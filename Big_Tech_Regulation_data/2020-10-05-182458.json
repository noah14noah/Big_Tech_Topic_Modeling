Here's some of the things we may be talking about today. Out of nowhere yesterday the State Department's inspector general called up House and Senate[1] committees and said senior staffers need to sit down for an \"urgent\" briefing today.[2] Nobody knows what caused the State Department's internal cop to suddenly freak out, but conventional press wisdom suggests it might have something to do with Ukrainium One and the impeachment inquiry. Later today former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker will tell the House Intel, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees[3] about what the hell he was doing in Ukraine after Trump tried to blackmail the Ukrainian president. </p><p>Since he no longer works for Uncle Sam,[4] Trumplandia can't erect all its usual stonewalls. [5]Early this morning Secretary of State Mike Pompeo admitted that he had been listening[6] when Trump tried to blackmail the president of Ukraine (as if he could hide it). The Daily Beast reports Pompeo freaked out when Rudy Giuliani went on TV[7] and lumped him into his Ukrainium One scheme, and tried to pin everything on Volker. Anonymous sources say that instead of Volker, Congress should be looking at Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a major Trump inaugural donor who's been scheming with Rudy about Ukrainium One for some time. Rudy Giuliani went back on Laura Ingraham's white power[8] hour to push back on a detailed WSJ report that confirmed Attorney General Bill Barr was \"surprised and angry\" to learn Trump thinks Giuliani and Barr do the same job.[9]. A very sane and sober Rudy spat that he might sue congressional Democrats and whistle-blowers for being mean to him,[10] but even Ingraham called Rudy a senile idiot. Rudy then stopped short of incriminating himself (again), telling Ingraham the LEAKERS are just White House staffers who want to talk to reporters, adding, \"I say to them is 'will you just calm down, take a little valium, calm down, little babies, calm down.'\" The Daily Show breaks down the some of the crazy bullshit Rudy Giuliani has been saying[11] lately to help Trump cheat in the 2020 election. [embedded content] The Impeachment Trial of Rudy Giuliani | The Daily Show <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com\">www.youtube.com</url>[12] The new White House policy to \"let Trump be Trump\" resulted in staffers investigating the cost of a black, electrified border wall made of concrete topped with large, flesh-piercing spikes, and/or a moat filled with snakes or alligators[13]. Trump also suggested US soldiers shoot migrants in the leg to slow them down. When Trump was told he couldn't have any of those things, he threw a tantrum and threatened to close the entire border, potentially stranding legal US residents in Mexico. Jared Kushner and former Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen tried to walk Trump back, leading Trump to tell Nielsen, \"Lou Dobbs hates you, Ann Coulter hates you, you're making me look bad.\" The resulting clusterfuck led to Stephen Miller purging what the New York Times calls \"bleeding hearts\" who were not loyal to Trump World. House investigators are looking into new allegations that political groups and/or foreign governments were trying to kiss the pinky ring of our new God-Emperor by booking rooms at his hotels and never staying there.[14]A new Quinnipiac poll shows Sen. Elizabeth Warren gaining crucial ground among black voters,[15] suggesting that Warren's surge may be far more substantial than previously thought. [Poll[16]]UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has submitted his final offer to the EU for Brexit.[17] BoJo says the only other alternative is a hard-Brexit, even if Parliament has said that ain't gonna happen. Over in Ukraine, nobody is paying too much attention to Trump's attempt to blackmail them for weapons because they're (still) in the middle of a shooting war with Russia's little green men.[18] Now that they don't have to defend themselves with rocks and harsh language,[19] and the State Department signed off on another congressionally approved $39 million[20] in anti-tank weapon sales, yesterday the Ukrainian president announced a summit to negotiate elections in Russian-backed separatist regions.[21]North Korea sent a carrier pigeon to let the world know they would resume talks with the US to \"denuke.\"[22] The State Department says that the stalled talks will start again later this week. However, North Korea must've been upset that it wasn't getting enough attention for coming back to the negotiating table because it also just launched a ballistic missile[23] from an underwater platform into the Japanese waters. Casey Newton got his hands on some audio of Mark Zuckerberg bitching about Elizabeth Warren[24] coming for his piggy bank. Zuckerberg griped about a potential Warren presidency[25] breaking up big tech, saying, \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\" Warren responded on Twitter[26] by calling out Facebook's \"anticompetitive practices,\" and Zuckerberg's tendency to gleefully wipe his ass with the tear-soaked tissues of privacy advocates. In a social media post, Zuck confirmed the authenticity[27] of the audio, calling it \"an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking.\"  Facebook's magical internet funny money, Libra, is losing support[28] amid a backlash from regulators in the US and EU. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Visa and Mastercard are getting cold feet[29] and there's talk of them bailing out. Shame. Former White House liar Sean Spicer continued to embarrass himself[30] on one of those shows for D-List celebrities desperately clinging to their last few seconds of fame. Spicey's homage to the rotting corpse of disco was a bad dance fusion of \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the cha-cha, proving again that everything is terrible. [Video[31]]Rachel Maddow sat down with Stephen Colbert to talk about her new book, Blowout,[32] how Russia uses oil and gas as an economic weapon[33], that second DEEP STATE whistle-blower, and how it's anyone's guess[34] how the impeachment process will play out.

The company's revenue is on the rise and it has committed to sharing these gains with partners, lowering barriers to entrepreneurship and turning e-commerce into a force for good. As a socially responsible, high-growth global technology company, Shopify is out front.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the goalposts are moving. Tech companies are being scrutinized for everything from anti-competitive practices and data use to content policies, taxation and employment practices - most notably in July's \"Big Tech\" congressional hearing in the U.S. The role of the corporation and the fundamentals of how our economy functions are being challenged. And governments are reaching across sectors to chart an inclusive, equitable and sustainable economic recovery. Canada and the world need bolder models for responsible innovation. Shopify is well positioned to lead the way - but to do so will require the same level of ambition that the company has brought to its growth trajectory.</p><p>Shopify has engaged in a range of initiatives that are worthy of admiration and replication by other large technology firms in Canada. Recently, it offered free trials to help thousands of businesses \"go digital,\" contributing to the survival of Canada's mainstreet businesses during COVID-19 closures, while (not accidentally) growing its client base. It has partnered with Indigenous organizations, provided work-integrated learning opportunities to aspiring developers as part of an accredited computer science degree, and committed to investing at least $5 million (U.S.) annually in carbon sequestration.</p><p>It has also suggested a commitment to decent work, through a requirement for fulfilment partners to offer fair pay to workers, recognized the value of diversity and an inclusive culture for better product design and talent attraction, and demonstrated an appetite for self-regulation, banning Breitbart and the Proud Boys (after some initial controversy) and closing more than 5,000 stores earlier this year that violated its code of conduct.</p><p>Shopify has positioned itself as a company that provides value to its workers, consumers, the environment and the communities it operates in, as well as its shareholders.</p><p>In this moment of renewal and recalibration, public expectations are shifting, pushing the bar for responsible innovation higher.As Shopify rapidly expands its business model - including through new lending and payment products, enhanced warehousing and distribution services, a new film and TV production company, and integrations with other large tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Walmart - will its commitments to socially responsible practices keep pace?</p><p>We suggest three opportunities for Shopify to model what it means to be a socially responsible tech company as we head into 2021.</p><p>First, Shopify could break new ground by embedding social responsibility into its governance structure. The company could, for example, proactively establish a meaningful, independent oversight board (learning from fraught experiments at Google and Facebook), and make room for worker and merchant representation on its corporate board. It could even go so far as to add a social impact mandate into its articles of incorporation.</p><p>Recognizing that Canada's tech sector is characterized by significant participation and pay gaps for BIPOC and women, Shopify could ground its aspirations for greater diversity and inclusion in robust public reporting on recruitment, hiring, pay and promotions. It could also enhance accountability by reporting on the demographics of its business clients, as well as on the groups that are not accessing the company's products, services or digital storefront initiatives. This could inform Shopify's strategies for extending into new markets and designing products that are more inclusive and widely accessible.</p><p>Finally, the company could consider the power of proactive disclosure related to merchants that have been banned. As social media platforms struggle to combat misinformation, Shopify could further differentiate itself by introducing detailed annual reporting on which merchants have been banned or deactivated, and why. Allowing researchers and journalists to access this information could be transformative in tracking the economics of misinformation and hate.</p><p>Of course, Shopify can't be expected to redefine big tech on its own, or to self-regulate. Governments have a critical role to play, as regulators, partners and funders, in raising the standards for all tech companies. As Canada's government plans for a recovery that will bring about a more sustainable, inclusive and equitable economy, it should be looking closely at the role of Canada's leading tech companies in helping us get there. Policy-makers, Shopify and the tech companies aspiring to follow in its footsteps should seize the opportunity to set a higher standard for responsible innovation - a made-in-Canada standard that both challenges the harmful norms and learns from them.</p><p>Sarah Doyle is director of policy and research and Vass Bednar is a public policy analyst at Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Ryerson University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020100359028831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6104-HPY1-JBTY-W027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"874\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The company believes \"the world is b...</p><p>\"We unequivocally believe that for the future of commerce to survive and thrive it has to be in the hands of the many, not the few,\" Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein, speaking out against a new California bill, told CNBC. The company believes \"the world is better with many entrepreneurs and many independent entrepreneurs, and anything that makes it more difficult we don't is a great thing,\" he said in a \"Mad Money\" interview. Amazon is backing a California measure that would subject online marketplaces to the same liability expectations as physical store counterparts.  A Shopify executive is the latest e-commerce operation to come out against a consumer protection bill that has received the backing of Amazon , telling CNBC it would stifle small businesses that operate online.   \"We unequivocally believe that for the future of commerce to survive and thrive it has to be in the hands of the many, not the few,\" Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein said in a \" Mad Money \" interview with Jim Cramer Wednesday.   Consumer protection is very important \"but it cannot come at the expense of independent businesses who are frankly the backbone of our economy,\" he said, joining Etsy , eBay 's public policy team and other industry groups in opposition to the proposal.   The measure, Assembly Bill 3262, being considered by state lawmakers would subject \"electronic retail marketplaces\" to product liability requirements as brick-and-mortar retailers. If passed into law, California would be the first state to make online marketplaces be responsible for defective goods listed on their websites.   While Shopify is not itself a marketplace, but provides tools for businesses to open an internet storefront, \"we still believe that the world is better with many entrepreneurs and many independent entrepreneurs, and anything that makes it more difficult we don't is a great thing,\" Finkelstein said.   AB 3262 was amended on Monday to add internet markets that make money on what merchants bring in from advertising. The changes were made after Amazon's public policy arm said it would back the measure under such conditions.   \"Injured consumers should be able to seek compensation regardless of how a particular online marketplace makes money,\" Brian Huseman, the company's policy chief, wrote in a blog post on Friday. The position follows a court ruling earlier this month that said Amazon could be liable for damages from a defective product that was sold on the platform by a merchant and burned a customer.   On Tuesday, Etsy, a handmade goods marketplace, came out against the move by Amazon , accusing the tech giant of \"abuse of power market play.\"   \"Amazon is taking bold steps to wipe out its competitors by promoting complex, hard-to-comply-with legislation that only they can afford to absorb,\" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said. \"Amazon's goal is to be the only place to buy stuff online, hobbling mom-and-pops that sell unique items in their own shops, or more frequently since COVID, through marketplaces like Etsy. Small businesses, struggling now more than ever, will ultimately bear the brunt of the overbearing burdens of AB 3262.\"   The news comes as Big Tech, including Amazon, faces scrutiny over anti-competitive practices. Last month in a congressionial hearing , Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon, was questioned on the company's use of third-party merchant data for its own product development projects.   California is also embroiled in a legal fight  with the travel segment of the tech sector  over labor regulations. Uber and Lyft threatened to pull the plug on business in the state before the ride-hailing apps would have ben forced to reclassify drivers as employees.

The company's revenue is on the rise and it has committed to sharing these gains with partners, lowering barriers to entrepreneurship and turning e-commerce into a force for good. As a socially responsible, high-growth global technology company, Shopify is out front.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the goalposts are moving. Tech companies are being scrutinized for everything from anti-competitive practices and data use to content policies, taxation and employment practices - most notably in July's \"Big Tech\" congressional hearing in the U.S. The role of the corporation and the fundamentals of how our economy functions are being challenged. And governments are reaching across sectors to chart an inclusive, equitable and sustainable economic recovery. Canada and the world need bolder models for responsible innovation. Shopify is well positioned to lead the way - but to do so will require the same level of ambition that the company has brought to its growth trajectory.</p><p>Shopify has engaged in a range of initiatives that are worthy of admiration and replication by other large technology firms in Canada. Recently, it offered free trials to help thousands of businesses \" go digital,\" contributing to the survival of Canada's mainstreet businesses during COVID-19 closures, while (not accidentally) growing its client base. It has partnered with Indigenous organizations, provided work-integrated learning opportunities to aspiring developers as part of an accredited computer science degree, and committed to investing at least $5 million (U.S.) annually in carbon sequestration.</p><p>It has also suggested a commitment to decent work, through a requirement for fulfilment partners to offer fair pay to workers, recognized the value of diversity and an inclusive culture for better product design and talent attraction, and demonstrated an appetite for self-regulation, banning Breitbart and the Proud Boys (after some initial controversy) and closing more than 5,000 stores earlier this year that violated its code of conduct.</p><p>Shopify has positioned itself as a company that provides value to its workers, consumers, the environment and the communities it operates in, as well as its shareholders.</p><p>In this moment of renewal and recalibration, public expectations are shifting, pushing the bar for responsible innovation higher. As Shopify rapidly expands its business model - including through new lending and payment products, enhanced warehousing and distribution services, a new film and TV production company, and integrations with other large tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Walmart - will its commitments to socially responsible practices keep pace?</p><p>We suggest three opportunities for Shopify to model what it means to be a socially responsible tech company as we head into 2021.</p><p>First, Shopify could break new ground by embedding social responsibility into its governance structure. The company could, for example, proactively establish a meaningful, independent oversight board (learning from fraught experiments at Google and Facebook), and make room for worker and merchant representation on its corporate board. It could even go so far as to add a social impact mandate into its articles of incorporation.</p><p>Recognizing that Canada's tech sector is characterized by significant participation and pay gaps for BIPOC and women, Shopify could ground its aspirations for greater diversity and inclusion in robust public reporting on recruitment, hiring, pay and promotions. It could also enhance accountability by reporting on the demographics of its business clients, as well as on the groups that are not accessing the company's products, services or digital storefront initiatives. This could inform Shopify's strategies for extending into new markets and designing products that are more inclusive and widely accessible.</p><p>Finally, the company could consider the power of proactive disclosure related to merchants that have been banned. As social media platforms struggle to combat misinformation, Shopify could further differentiate itself by introducing detailed annual reporting on which merchants have been banned or deactivated, and why. Allowing researchers and journalists to access this information could be transformative in tracking the economics of misinformation and hate.</p><p>Of course, Shopify can't be expected to redefine big tech on its own, or to self-regulate. Governments have a critical role to play, as regulators, partners and funders, in raising the standards for all tech companies. As Canada's federal government plans for a recovery that will bring about a more sustainable, inclusive and equitable economy, it should be looking closely at the role of Canada's leading tech companies in helping us get there. Policy-makers, Shopify and the tech companies aspiring to follow in its footsteps should seize the opportunity to set a higher standard for responsible innovation - a made-in-Canada standard that both challenges the harmful norms of big tech and learns from them.</p><p>Sarah Doyle is director of policy and research and Vass Bednar is public policy analyst at Brookfield Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Ryerson University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020100459039662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610D-8771-F103-31N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Enough to boost sales at Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This spring, Amazon announced plans to make one-day shipping standard for Amazon Prime customers, a major logistics investment it said would cost $800 million in the second quarter alone. The growth of Amazon's core retail sales had been slowing, so investors had been hoping that offering millions more items available faster would get customers to spend more on its site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Thursday, the company said it had $63.4 billion in sales in its latest quarter, up 20% in the past year. Profit for the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 4%. Amazon beat Wall Street's expectations for sales, but fell short on earnings. Shares fell about 2% in after-hours trading.</p><p> If the shipping initiative results in sales picking back up, investors will overlook the cost, said Michael Levine, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group.</p><p> \"Folks will be like, 'I literally can't care less,'\" he said.</p><p> People with a Prime membership, which costs $119 a year, are the company's biggest customers. They spend more than twice as much as non-Prime shoppers.</p><p> But with more than 100 million estimated Prime members in the United States, the growth is \"reaching its limit,\" according to a June report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And as the rise in Prime memberships has slowed, so has Amazon's sales growth.</p><p> There are signs that delivery times could help juice sales. About a third of Prime members say they have abandoned purchases in their online shopping carts because an item would not arrive fast enough, according to research from John Blackledge, who covers Amazon for the investment bank Cowen.</p><p> In the quarter that ended in March, the number of units sold on Amazon was up just 10%, compared with 22% growth during the same period a year earlier. This quarter, unit sales picked back up, growing 18%, far more than Wall Street expected.</p><p> \"Changing Prime to one-day delivery is an epic move,\" Blackledge said.</p><p>Amazon has several businesses that have begun to provide consistently large profits. The biggest component is Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud provider. It has continued to grow even as sales reached almost $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter, and is more profitable than the much larger retail business. But the annual growth did dip below 40% for the first time.</p><p> Sales on the website are increasingly from third-party merchants, who pay Amazon fees for listing and shipping their items. That business as a fee collector is also more profitable for Amazon than when it sells items directly from its inventory.</p><p> Finally, Amazon's high-margin ad business reaches more than an estimated $10 billion a year in sales, as it has become almost a necessity for people selling on the website. Amazon has also been building out tools to use consumers' shopping behavior to target them for ads across the web. Amazon's \"Other\" business segment, which it says is largely ads, had $3 billion in sales in the last quarter.</p><p> Those profit machines let Amazon spend heavily on the infrastructure for fast delivery or other major pushes that don't yet produce major revenue, like the Alexa voice assistant.</p><p> \"They have cover with this ad business scaling and AWS as the incredible business it is,\" Blackledge said.</p><p> The pressure in Washington has been ramping up, as lawmakers and regulators focus on antitrust concerns. Amazon had to testify before Congress last week, where an executive was peppered with questions about whether it misuses customer and seller data for its own benefit, and the Justice Department announced this week that it was opening a sweeping antitrust review into big tech companies.</p><p> On Wednesday, Facebook disclosed that the Federal Trade Commission had begun a formal antitrust investigation into the social network.

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., are trying to make that happen. </p><p>Last week, they unveiled a comprehensive online privacy bill called the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act of 2019 (COPRA) and a hearing on the measure was held Dec. 4 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.</p><p>It is a sweeping plan that gives people control over their personal data. It allows them to see what is being collected and how it is being used, and it also prevents personal information from being shared with third parties.</p><p>\"We want to protect consumers' privacy rights,\" Cantwell said. \"We believe to do that, you need strong enforcement and mechanisms to make sure that those rights are protected... If your privacy rights are violated, you need to be first able to find out about it, and then you need to have the power to do something about it as well.\"</p><p>The proposal gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general tools so they can hold big tech companies accountable if they collect information without permission, if they fail to protect that information or if they misuse it.</p><p>While the federal measure lacks bipartisan support -- so far the COPRA is backed only by Democrats -- the plan creates an important starting point in creating an online privacy plan nationwide.</p><p>We hope it gains traction.</p><p>The U.S. already is behind the European Union, which adopted its consumer privacy protection rules in 2016. The General Data Protection Regulation requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of citizens in all 28 EU member states, and also covers that data if it goes outside the EU.</p><p>Companies profit from the personal data they collect, but most people have no idea how their personal information is being used. </p><p>It's time federal lawmakers fixed this disturbing situation and give people a way to control their personal information online. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRICTY-98845d4beae54b18a249a9a7d0f4a188</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRICTY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNJ-MDM1-DYJM-M427-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">308624</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tri-City Herald (Washington) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tri-City Herald (Washington)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But for short-sellers, it has been nothing short of a boon. Short-sellers who placed bets that the shares of four big tech leaders, known as the FANG group, as spelled out by their first initials, were due for a fall have made more than US$4 billion in profits over the last two weeks and more than US$1 billion during the first two trading days in April, financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC said on Tuesday. The FANG group is comprised of four closely watched internet stocks: Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc , Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google . Doug Kass, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, said he has been shorting Amazon shares because of \"the existential threat of regulation has surfaced and has deflated the FANG bubble. </p><p>Importantly, it is a bipartisan regulatory and antitrust threat.\" Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference. \"Social media's technological achievements and progress have outsped regulatory supervision and oversight,\" Kass said. He highlighted the recent discovery that information of about 50 million Facebook users had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica as he noted the potential jeopardy of the trust of users, which is \"a fundamental and necessary ingredient to future corporate success and measured in engagement.\" A strict new European Union law on data privacy takes effect on May 25. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters on Tuesday that the social network had no immediate plans to apply the law in its entirety to the rest of the world. Governments are also taking action on other fronts. The European Commission last month proposed new rules to ensure that digital business activities are taxed in a fair and growth-friendly way in the EU. Kass also noted the European Union's record US$2.7 billion antitrust fine against Google. The overhang of increased government oversight has taken a bite out of the fortunes of large technology companies in the past. Microsoft Corp reached a settlement in an antitrust case with the Department of Justice in 2002 that lasted until 2011, contributing to a long period of underperformance that kept the stock below the high it reached in 1999 until 2016. Since then, the stock is up nearly 60 percent on the strength of its cloud-based services. And not all short bets on tech stocks have been money makers. Some short-sellers have held their bets against the FANGs since the middle of 2017 and have yet to turn a profit. Billionaire investor David Einhorn includes bets against Amazon and Netflix as part of his \"bubble basket.\" While conventional wisdom suggests that recent turbulence in these stocks could have benefited short-sellers, Einhorn said the shorts did not perform as he hoped this year. \"We believe our investment theses remain intact. Despite recent results, our portfolio should perform well over time,\" Einhorn said in his quarterly letter to investors on Tuesday. So far this year, Amazon shares are up over 19 percent and Netflix shares have soared nearly 48 percent. Alphabet and Facebook, however, are down year-to-date.

Instead of righting the sinking ship, they jumped ship,\" tweeted Google Walkout for Real Change, a worker's organisation protesting, various unfair practices and policies within the tech company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google Walkout for Real Change is not an obscure fringe group. It began last year as a huge organised protest that saw 20,000 employees in 50 cities across the globe stage a walkout in protest of how the company had handled sexual harassment claims, followed by more walkouts protesting Google's AI contracts with the US defence department, its plans to build a censored search engine, and their AI ethics policies.</p><p>As one of the original organisers, Meredith Whittaker, has something to say about the vast amount of power global technology companies like Google have been allowed to amass, largely unchecked and undeterred, over the past 20 years.</p><h>Social implications Google's code of conduct states unequivocally: \"don't be evil, and if you see something that you think isn't right - speak up!\" Whittaker, who worked as a research scientist in AI at Google for </h><p>more than a decade, did speak up, but Google didn't like it.</p><p>Ultimately working for Google was incompatible with her role at the AI Now Institute, which she co-founded to examine the social implications of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Having left Google in July, Whittaker has a clear message about how artificial intelligence is developed, applied, and controlled: \"What's frightening about AI isn't terminators and super intelligent machines: it's the way AI works to centralise knowledge and power in the hands of those who already have it and further disempower those who don't.\"</p><p>Speaking at the Falling Walls conference during Berlin Science Week recently, Whittaker told the audience that she was going to \"make a case for collective action in artificial intelligence\". She turned to AI's beginnings, explaining that while neural nets (algorithms, modelled loosely on the human brain, that are designed to recognise patterns) have existed since the mid-1960s, and convolutional neural nets were already being developed in the 1980s, what was missing for growth was access to computing power and datasets.</p><p>This all changed around 2012 when the image classification system AlexNet was released. We expect instant image recognition these days - it's on all our photo apps - but less than a decade ago it was only made possible with the availability of ImageNet, a huge dataset amassed by Princeton and Harvard.</p><p>But, as Whittaker points out, ImageNet was created on the back of questionable data collection practices and cheap human labour. \"It consists of over 15 million images scraped from Flickr and the web without consent, then labelled by low-paid Amazon Mechanical Turk workers,\" she says.</p><p>It's difficult to grapple with certain technological developments because, as is the case with medical innovations, we are more than happy as end users to enjoy the fruits of this labour. However, we don't like to think about the lab animals that may have sacrificed in the process. And in the case of technological progress, it's hard to spot the lab rats, especially if they are the end user or even society at large.</p><p>How did the power suddenly tip in favour of the Big Three? \"Not long before 2012 the resources that made AlexNet possible weren't available, they weren't even conceivable. And these just happened to be resources that major tech companies have in abundance and that few others do,\" explains Whittaker.</p><p>\"Ask any AI start-up and they will tell you they rent their computational infrastructure from one of the Big Three tech companies - Amazon, Microsoft or Google, in that order. They're often at a loss for where to get their own data, so from this perspective, we can understand the popular commodification of internet technologies that began in the 1990s as creating the conditions for the AI of today.\"</p><p>She explains that large technology companies happen to have all the necessary ingredients to push the envelope on AI: they have masses of social data thanks to their vast consumer market reach, as well as powerful infrastructure designed to collect, process and store such data.</p><p>\"In short, the current crop of AI, the AI that is touching our lives and institutions, is a corporate technology,\" stated Whittaker.</p><p>\"Only five or so companies in the West have the resources to develop this technology at scale, which means that we cannot talk about AI without confronting issues of power. And frankly, we cannot talk about AI without talking about neoliberal capitalism: these systems are already being quietly integrated throughout our social institutions and we're seeing the costs.\"</p><p>Whittaker gave some examples of these costs: Amazon Ring is a surveillance AI video camera and doorbell system designed so people can have 24/7 footage of their homes and neighbourhoods. This sounds all above board, but Amazon has begun partnering with over 400 police departments in the US that has, explained Whittaker, resulted in police recommending residents to buy an Amazon Ring for their house.</p><p>\"They've basically turned cops into door-to-door Amazon salesmen,\" she says.</p><p>\"It sounds funny, but it's horrible, right? Amazon gets ongoing access to videos like those from Ring so they can continue to train their AI systems - this is really valuable for them. </p><p>\"Police get access to a portal of Ring videos that they can use whenever they want, no subpoena required. So, they're effectively creating a privatised surveillance system of homes across the US.\"</p><p>And Amazon is currently filing a patent for facial recognition in this space. </p><h>'Discredited race science' </h><p> Meanwhile, in Japan a start-up named Vaak sells surveillance AI that claims to be able to detect shoplifting before it happens, a la the Precogs from Minority Report. This is already being used by department stores to profile shoppers and as Whittaker points out, there is no transparency about how this AI model works, which makes it almost impossible for an individual to contest unfair profiling.</p><p>\"It's really important to know that that is a system in a long line of AI systems that are replicating the logics of discredited race science and physiognomy - claiming to be able to tell interior characteristics and personality traits based on people's physical appearance, their speech and mannerisms.\"</p><p>And here's how these systems can get it horribly wrong with fatal consequences: in 2018 the US state of Michigan began using an automated decision system named MiDAS to detect employment fraud. After dumping its entire fraud detection system, it turned out that MiDAS was deeply flawed and got it wrong 93 per cent of the time. But it was too late - the system had falsely accused at least 42,000 Michigan residents leading to cases of bankruptcy filings and even suicides.</p><p>\"As you can see, the stakes are extremely high. We're already seeing these systems used to justify inequality and set the boundaries between the haves and the have nots,\" noted Whittaker.</p><p>Surely people can refuse to use the products of big tech and thereby not provide free data to further bolster these systems? </p><p>\"We all live our lives and make choices, but we're talking about huge structural issues,\" she explains to The Irish Times. \"Whether or not you use Gmail, you walk down the street of a smart city and you are being tagged, you are being profiled, you are being recorded by infrastructures of surveillance.</p><p>\"If I am a Gmail user [and you're not], if I email you, your information is now on Google servers. Facebook has a shadow account for a huge number of users who never signed up for the service because they buy data from data brokers and they do network analysis connecting you with your friends, et cetera.\"</p><h>'Structural change' </h><p> This cannot be solved by individually choosing to be a more righteous person and opt out of these systems, says Whittaker, who explains that these systems are being built into our economic, societal and political infrastructures, profiling us without our consent.</p><p>\"This is why we need this sort of larger scale structural change and regulation driven by social movements that are demanding outcomes and service of justice,\" she tells me.</p><p>To remedy the harms of AI, Whittaker says we need to confront power: \"As you probably know, power doesn't move based on the force of argument. Throughout history, it's clear that social movements and organised workers in particular play a central role in shaping structural change in service of justice. And this is why after a decade at Google spent researching and writing and speaking about technology's social consequences, I joined with my colleagues and I began labour organising.</p><p>\"Where little else had, collective action worked. Contracts were cancelled, workplace policies changed, and oversight practices put in place.\"</p><p>Whittaker says this is only the start. There is much more to be done to take back control of AI and stop the amassing of power within large private entities with more clout and technological know-how than most governments. And it is time to stop and think before we let AI devalue and degrade human labour by firing at will on the basis of algorithmically determined productivity benchmarks like those used in Amazon.</p><p>Whittaker warns: \"It's time to take advantage of the short window we have before technical infrastructure and AI are so far embedded in our social institutions as to be impossible to pull loose.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4105080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNG-GT01-JC8Y-84BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable after decades of underinvestment that has left many countries with seemingly little option but to accept the terms laid down by the tech giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Tech companies like to project a modern, progressive image to the world. But under the surface, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Uber are pursuing an agenda that could hand them dangerous levels of control over our lives and profoundly harm economic development in the global south,\" the report says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industry bodies deny that there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">moves to establish global rules</url> that would force-feed western technology to developing-world countries. They say that e-commerce liberates small and medium-sized businesses to export goods they could never previously afford to sell. They also say that states' attempts to keep data in local servers prevents tech firms benefiting from economies of scale by housing data in vast hubs across the globe.</p><p>Christian Borggreen, a researcher at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">Computer and Communications Industry Association</url> (CCIA), the Geneva-based lobby group for Facebook, Netflix, BT, Amazon, eBay and others, says: \"Forced data localisation is on the rise globally. Since the year 2000 the number of national requirements grew from 15 to 84.\"</p><p>That is significant, he says, because there is a risk that countries that demand data localisation \"do this for protectionist or censorship reasons\". He is thinking of Russia and China.</p><p>There is also a potential risk of damage to productivity from throwing sand in the wheels of global tech. The International Monetary Fund said last month that half of the productivity gains in the developing world came from globalisation, and much of that comes from the adoption of western technology.</p><p>However, Nick Dearden, head of Global Justice Now, says it is essential that developing countries retain their citizens' data within their borders to avoid the core of their economies being directed from abroad.</p><p>The idea that they should be passive receivers of western technology, and borrow heavily on international financial markets to pay for it, means they become prey to the whims of foreign businesses, he says.</p><p>'Without [keeping data local] it's so much more difficult for countries to regulate and tax industries'</p><p>  Nick Dearden, Global Justice Now    </p><p>\"Without [keeping data local] it's so much more difficult for countries to regulate and tax industries, for them to get really any benefits out of investment with no skills, jobs or technology transfer, or to nurture infant industries. It's the central problem with the way trade deals operate.\"</p><p>Susan Aaronson, a digital trade expert at George Washington University in Washington DC, says fighting the adoption of international rules to protect local data privacy is the wrong approach. She argues that developing world countries \"could say to tech firms 'you need to pay for our data and you need to be transparent about how you use it'. They haven't so far. They've accepted the Facebook model.\" Separately, they could negotiate common rules for e-commerce.</p><p>Nick Ashton-Hart, a trade expert who used to work at the CCIA, says the report should consider the issue of data separately from e-commerce. Whereas Dearden considers Amazon, eBay, Alibaba and other trading platforms as rent-seeking operators that suck money out of the economy, Ashton-Hart says they should be seen as giving small businesses in developing-world countries access to global markets. Allowing them, along with Facebook, Google and other global operators, to store data where they want to would create huge efficiency savings that could be passed on to local businesses and consumers.</p><p>If there is a problem taxing or regulating technology transfers, intellectual property or the sale of goods and services across borders, that is an issue of local governance, says Ashton-Hart, who now works for the International Chamber of Commerce, a group that promotes UK exports.</p><p>Likewise, governments can set the rules for their citizens' online privacy and do not need to do it by demanding that global firms maintain relatively small local databases. \"The bigger issue is that more than 100 countries have no privacy laws at all, according to Unctad, but this isn't addressed at all,\" says Ashton-Hart. \"If developing countries want to protect their nationals, that's where to start, and NGOs should be calling them out for not doing it.\"</p><p>The issue has come into sharp focus with the EU's plan to impose new data protection rules in Europe that force companies to win the consent of users before storing personal data online, known as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</url>.</p><p>It becomes law at the end of this week, and is causing huge anxiety in the tech sector and a backlash from small business that rely on customer databases to generate new business.</p><p>Facebook repatriated 70% of its international customer records to the US once it became clear that the servers hosting the data in Ireland would be subject to the rules.</p><p>Dearden says the issue has become pressing since e-commerce leapt to the top of the World Trade Organisation's agenda last year in Argentina. African countries were particularly alarmed at proposals to establish a level playing field that would force them to allow trade with major foreign businesses.</p><p>In a statement following the meeting, African countries signed up to a declaration by the Rwandan delegation, which said the planned rules meant small businesses would be \"least likely to be able to effectively compete with multinational corporations, who have become global digital leaders, and have decimated smaller companies\".</p><p>It said these multinationals had \"benefited from digital industrial policies such as subsidies, R&amp;D subsidies, development of, and access to, and ownership of technologies, economies of scale, government-sponsored infrastructure, tax benefits, etc\".</p><p>Dearden admits developing countries are split, with some wanting to take whatever the tech firms have to offer to spur growth.</p><p>\"Some on the pro side have been talked to by the developed countries. Others think it sounds nice but don't know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn't agreed - and that's because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.\"</p><p>Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China</url> after it decided the deal was too one-sided.</p><p>Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away - and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon.</p><p>                   An Apple a day ... the race for hi-tech healthcare                   </p><p>The tech industry's appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">and healthcare is a priority</url>. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments.</p><p>Apple wanted to save lives, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">he said.</url> A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information.</p><p>But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don't just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it - information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country's healthiest people - or to cancer patients.</p><p>In the UK, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London</url> were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google's parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust.</p><p>DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company's business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-wto-digital/some-wto-members-to-push-for-e-commerce-rules-as-broader-deal-fails-idUSKBN1E72YV\">The main target is the $3tn (\u00a32.2tn) US market</url>, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights.</p><p>Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: \"Big tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private 'solutions' are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.\"</p><p>Education is an area of interest to Google that brings with it similar issues. Dearden says, especially when the technology literacy rate is under 30% in rural Kenya (according to an IBM Digital Villages study), and the Kenyan government is one of the most advanced users of technology in Africa.</p><p>Dearden adds: \"Patented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What's more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades ... This should worry all of us - because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.\"</p><p>Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley's aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-44055887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC3-11N1-F021-6053-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1786\"/><timeReceived>3:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 19, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

Notably absent from the Google inquiry is antitrust chief Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who recused himself because he had represented the company while he was in private practice.Almost all state attorneys general are also conducting a parallel investigation into Google. Led by Ken Paxton of Texas, the attorneys general are looking at 'Google's overarching control of online advertising markets and search traffic that may have led into anticompetitive behavior that harms consumers.'[3][3] Reaching beyond antitrust concerns, the state AGs have also raised other issues, most notably whether the FTC should be investigating Big Tech's possession of consumer data and whether that raises privacy concerns.[4][4]Earlier this month, officials from the DOJ met with various state AGs to discuss their respective findings from their investigations. </p><p>At this time it is unclear whether the dual inquiries will ever merge into one cohesive effort; however, it is clear that the probes are very much active. Recently, the state AGs reached an agreement with Google regarding consultants retained to assist with their probe as the investigation proceeds.[5][5] The focus of the inquiry is to determine whether Google 'undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy, and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.'[6][6]While noncompetition issues, such as privacy, in antitrust are hardly a novel concept,[7][7] the differences now are the magnitude and reach of the information tech companies now possess. As online platforms increasingly evolve into behemoth entities, with their pervasiveness evoking Frank Norris' 1901 novel, The Octopus, federal and state agencies are stepping up to enhance antitrust enforcement and to examine Big Tech's practices when it comes to using citizens' private information. But does penalizing these companies actually benefit consumers? Online platforms claim that their ability to provide the best services to their users at the lowest cost is based on how they track data. In exchange, privacy rights are implicated, forcing authorities to take action. It makes sense, then, for federal and state officials to respond with a massive investigation into one of the biggest tech companies. This, of course, is not the end of the story.Antitrust laws were not intended to protect privacy rights. As FTC Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips noted, 'competition and privacy laws are different. They serve different ends, and employ different tools. Often, they are in direct tension.'[8][8] While it is true that companies like Google stand to profit from consumer data, antitrust laws, which are intended to prohibit noncompetitive activities, do not directly regulate one's right to privacy. Understandably, the collection of data is part of that inquiry and undoubtedly raises privacy concerns. But that should be dealt with through the various U.S. consumer privacy laws, and not by trying to impermissibly stretch the antitrust doctrines beyond their mandate.[1][9] Press Release, Dep't of Justice, 'Justice Department Reviewing the Practices of Market-Leading Online Platforms,' (July 23, 2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reviewing-practices-market-leading-online-platforms\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reviewing-practices-market-leading-online-platforms</url>[10].

The effect of these technologies, made possible by the colossal volumes of data we are able to collect and process, has been described as the \"fourth industrial revolution\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are hundreds of ways businesses can apply AI to improve their customer service, identify new products, reduce risk, and increase efficiency. The World Economic Forum has described it as a \"seismic shift\", and predicts that the big four tech companies of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon could overturn existing industries, starting with banking.</p><p>This is not as unreasonable as it might appear.</p><p>Finance is an industry built on data analytics. Under Chatham House rules, experts at our recent COGX conference noted AI can directly replace actuaries and in-house data analysts.</p><p>How many banks are becoming reliant on outsourcing advanced data science to elite tech companies? How many would have the firepower to compete if these companies decided to deal directly with customers? Not only are these tech giants realising that they have the data science capabilities to perform advanced financial analysis, but they know what they can do with their wealth of additional customer insight.</p><p>The businesses built on understanding every aspect of their users' lives can create a new universe of perfectly personalised products, while finally stitching in a missing part of their model: financial decisions.</p><p>Banks need to realise that their traditional protection of high customer switching costs will no longer apply when their competitors are not other banks. To survive, banks will shift seriously now into data science.</p><p>The time for experimenting within existing functions through fintech partnerships has passed. Today's mission is to overhaul legacy infrastructure and practices to bring the entire sector up to speed.</p><p>Fintechs' investment in machine learning and data analytics is increasing, but only a small part of this is being driven by established banks, and it still pales in comparison to the investment among tech giants.</p><p>These same fintechs are now able to go after profitable niche industry sectors, such as lending to specific groups, democratising trading, or currency exchange, without building the legacy infrastructure of big banks.</p><p>This could leave banks squeezed by the narrow focus and low cost base of challenger fintechs on one side, and the deep data reserves and advanced machine learning capabilities of big tech on the other.</p><p>However, banks still remain uniquely well-placed to handle large-scale transactions, and maintain a reputation for data protection and discretion.</p><p>Regulation remains significant, the public is mindful of the potential for monopolies, and tech chief executives will think twice about the impact on their culture and reputation before they move into banking.</p><p>Instead, we are likely to see an evolution in the banking sectors, with banks increasing their investment in fintech startups, and investing in artificial intelligence capabilities to supplement their partnerships with big tech companies.</p><p>The banking industry is not insulated from technological disruption. But this threat is more of a call to action than a funeral bell.</p><p>Banks need to look beyond the business model and competitor set they have grown accustomed to over the last century. In the new world, data is available from sources far beyond traditional financial metrics, and can be analysed with advanced algorithms to unlock a new world of insights.</p><p>This means embedding machine learning into the core of the business, rather than seeing it as an efficiency that can be added to existing practices.</p><p>AI will revolutionise all banking functions, from chatbots in customer support and predictive personal budgeting, to robo-advisory and markettracking services. Incumbent banks remain best-placed to benefit from these changes, provided they can overcome the substantial hurdles of tradition and culture. If the City can learn from Tech City by moving fast and breaking things, then Silicon Valley's giants will be kept at the Bay.</p><p>\u00a3 Charlie Muirhead is co-founder of CognitionX, the marketplace for all things AI.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-129592804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGB-CB11-JBVM-Y1KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 City A.M.

Should Facebook , Google (Alphabet), Apple , Microsoft and Amazon be broken up?    After US Senator Elizabeth Warren put forward her proposal, the idea has gathered traction on both sides of the US political divide.    Antitrust hearings are taking place against the big five companies.    In India, the hearings have generated only passing interest.    After all, the companies are US-headquartered and it is easy to overlook the implications of the various potential outcomes of the hearings in the US for the Indian technology ecosystem and policymakers.    First, here is the background to the hearings.    The US has a long history of antitrust action to ensure that no private company becomes too powerful.    The first US Antitrust Act was the Sherman Act, enacted in 1890 and later bolstered with the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC) and the Clayton Act.    Antitrust hearings in the past broke up Standard Oil and AT&amp;T and put restrictions on others such as IBM and Microsoft from extending their dominance.    The US Antitrust cases initially focused on how market dominance would lead to higher price for consumers.    Later, a more nuanced view emerged.    Focusing just on the price paid by consumers is a useless measure in the technology industry where basic services are often free (Google, Facebook) or the cheapest (Amazon).    In the case of Microsoft and Apple, platform dominance leads to issues of preferential treatment to own products.    The current case against Big Tech is unique equally for the issues that are important as well as those that are irrelevant.    The question of oligopoly or price fixing or overcharging the consumer does not arise.    As mentioned, Google and Facebook give away basic services free, Amazon ensures consumers pay low prices.    Equally, there is fierce competition between the five tech companies in different areas (Microsoft vs Google in search engines, OS and cloud, Microsoft vs Amazon in cloud and Artificial Intelligence, Facebook vs Google vs Amazon for a share of the advertising pie, Apple vs Microsoft vs Google in a gamut of mobile applications).    The key issues are as follows.    First, whether the big five are using their dominance to shut out rivals.    Amazon has driven smaller sellers to bankruptcy by copying their stuff and introducing them at cheaper prices under home labels.    Facebook bought up Instagram and WhatsApp when they were still small.    Apple, Microsoft and Google all use dominance to squeeze users of their ecosystems dry.    Also, while their services to consumers are often free or low priced, they collect loads of data that are then monetised leading to worries about privacy and data misuse.    There are three potential outcomes of the hearings: An order to maintain status quo, an order to break up the companies or the third option -- to place curbs on them and force them to share innovations with rivals.    Either way, the implications for India and other countries will be significant.    If the status quo is maintained, it would mean the two tech camps -- one based in Silicon Valley and the other in China (Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, among others) would maintain their balance of power and every other country would be part of one or the other.    If Big Tech is broken up, while the Chinese would gain, it would also open up opportunities for the Indian tech companies -- and those from other countries -- to play at the highest end of the tech market on a far more equal footing, whether in the area of Artificial Intelligence platforms or social media ecosystems or mobile applications.    The third option -- forcing the big tech companies to share their patents for free and putting restrictions on their operations, though unlikely, would also help innovation and the rise of newer tech companies.     The Bell Labs ruling allowed patents for inventions such as the transistor and lasers to be available freely to engineers in US companies, which allowed the rise of start-ups such as Fairchild Semiconductors and Intel.    The restrictions placed on IBM gave a chance for Bill Gates and Paul Allen to build Microsoft.    Two decades later, antitrust hearings against Microsoft kept it from being too dominant on the Internet front and allowed the rise of Google and others.    For the Indian policymakers, the hearings are also important because it throws up issues on data collection and privacy.    More importantly, it could lead to a better understanding of dominance, something that Indian regulators have not had to deal with seriously, despite the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP Act) of 1969 and the current Competition Commission of India Act.    Till the mid-1980s, monopolies and oligopolies in any industry in India happened because of government policy -- by virtue of the licences issued.    At best, the cases dealt with price fixing and unfair market actions.    The only real case of market dominance came up when telecom players complained that Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) used its dominance in other sectors (petrochemicals, refining) to offer free services in telecom to enter the market.    However, the Competition Commission of India (and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) had ruled in favour of RIL because it was a new entrant in telecom.    The hearings in the US could help Indian regulators understand the nuances of the issue better -- if they so desire.

Do we want Big Tech companies tracking us? Even worse, do we want to risk having these private monopolies grani information abbut its to the government in exchange for protection of their monopoly power?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AT THE BEGINNING o: the 20th century, the invention of the automobile liberaced individuals from the yoke o: distance. While people could travel before the invention and widespread use of the automobile, they were bound in their daily lives by the limited distance horses could cover. Railroads alleviatec, but did not eliminate, these restrictions- movement was confined by the location of railroad tracks and b&gt; train schedules. It was only the automobile that gave individuals the freedom to move at their ow n leisure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A century after the invention of the automobile, the invention of toe smartphone triggered a similar revolution-and, while hisiory never repeats itself, sometimes it rhymes, and these rhymes can help us understand the present.</p><p>Before the smartphone, people were tethered to their landlines. In the 1990s, the proliferation of mobile pnones and increased access to the Internet greatly expanded our freedom to communicate and our access to information, but it was the introduction of the smartphone in 2007-coupled with monile communication and the Internet-that brought unprecedented access to information to the Western world and to a significant portion of the developing world.</p><p>We have at our fingertips today more advanced hardware and computing power than was used to send man to the mo-on, more information than is contained in the best librar/, and more power to communicate than any propaganda machine ever dreamed of possessing. The average individual, however, would not be able to tafie advantage of these hardware advances and computational powers without the proper applications. Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon-what the press now calls \"Big Tech\"-enable average people to use :hese powers to improve their lives.</p><p>Yet, however much the automobile revolution improved lives, it also presented challenges that required regulatory responses- e.g., speed limits and traffic lights in response to lethal accidents and emission standards in response to air pollution. The Big Tech revolution poses challenges as well-including to free markets-and it is foolish to ignore them. While we no more want to go back to a world without smartphones than we do a world without cars, the question is whether we should manage this new technology so that it helps all of us and does not become just an end in itself.</p><p>From the outset, the car industry was fragmented. Roughly 3,000 companies were started in the U.S. with the intent to produce cars. Despite the fact that Henry Ford's introduction of mass production with the Model T in 1908 significantly increased economies of scale, there still were 44 independent car companies in the U.S. a: the outset cf the Great Depression. Only after that did the number of U.S. car manufacturers drop to eight, and it was not un:il :he early 1980s that the 3ig Three (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) emerged. By that time, however, foreign cars were on the nse. Even today, the market share ef the top-\u00e6 lling car manufacturer in the U.S. is a mere 18%; of the largest two, only 32%; and cf the largest four, just 54%.</p><p>What procuced this fragmentation? One factor v/as geographical segmentation: high transportation costs favored local producers. Another was product differentiation: Ford famously said that you can choose a Model T of any color as long as it is black; in reality, consumers preferred not only different colors but different models, reducing the economies of scale advantage.</p><p>The history of Big Tech is very different. Only 10 years after the introduction of the iPhone, Apple's market share as the largest smanphone seller in the U.S. is 38%; that of the largest two smartphone sellers, 64%; and of the largest four, 90%. When we look at toe application markets, the picture is even starker. The market share nf Google, toe largest search engine in the U.S., is 86%; that of tine largest two, 93% and of toe largest four, 99%. The market share of the largest social media platform in the U.S. is 60%; of the largest two, 86%; and of the largest four, 98%. To be fair, it is difficult to measure the market snare of products that are free but, even if we lcok at a more-substantive market, such as online advertising, Google and Facebook form a duopoly that commands more th an 80% of market share.</p><p>With the :ech sector, we no longer are dealing with a mainly tangible economy- an economy with tangible assets such as computers, machinery, and buildings. In the tech sector-as Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake explain in Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy-intangible assets like research and de- velopment, marketing, and software dominate.</p><p>This is not an insignificant fact. As Haskel and Westlake point out, there are four main characteristics of an intangible economy that lead to higher market concentration and less competition: intangible assets are highly scalable, meaning that they can be used repeatedly with little additional investment; investments in intangible assets tend to be sunk, making their value difficult to recuperate; intangible assets are susceptible to spillover, meaning that other companies can benefit from using or mimicking them; and intangible assets, when combined, often produce valuable synergies.</p><p>Economists since Adam Smith have taught us that, in a competitive economy, the pursuit of private interests leads to the best possible outcome for everybody, but notice the qualifier: for this arrangement to work, there must be competition. It should disturb us, then, that the founders of Google themselves admit that the history of searches they have amassed creates a gigantic barrier to new entrants.</p><p>Another aspect of the Big Tech revolution that sets it apart is the quantity and precision of amassed data it makes possible. Businesses always have accumulated data on their clients, but the amount and detail of data concentrated in the hands of Big Tech companies are beyond anything previously imagined. Moreover, its value increases rather than decreases with quantity: consumption patterns of individuals are more valuable if linked to their location, more valuable still if linked to their health information, and so on. Not only does this data concentration represent an insurmountable barrier for new entrants into the market, it represents a threat to individual privacy and even can be a threat-as recent data mining and censorship scandals suggest-to the functioning of our democracy.</p><p>Google and Facebook know more about us than our spouses or closest friends-and sometimes even more than we know about ourselves. They can predict what we are going to do, how we are going to vote, and what products we are going to buy-and they use the best minds in the world to manipulate our decisions in a way reminiscent of the movie \"The Truman Show.\"</p><p>However, that is only one way of using (or misusing) the massive information gathered. Thirty years ago, during the debate over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, The Washington Post reported the titles of the videos he rented. During the recent confirmation hearings for Justice Kavanaugh, it only was because the alleged crimes took place before the diffusion of smartphones that phone companies were not able to disclose the geolocation of the nominee and his accusers during the early 1980s. We surely do not want the government tracking our every movement. Do we want Big Tech companies tracking us? Even worse, do we want to risk having these private monopolies grant information about us to the government in exchange for protection of their monopoly power?</p><p>Some say that market competition will solve these problems naturally, but there is plenty of evidence of distortion of competition in the tech sector, not only on the market side-consider the recent European Union case against Google, charging Google with preferring its own shopping comparison tool to others-but on the social side as well.</p><p>To take one example, Google unilaterally decided to de-rank payday lenders in their search results. De-ranking is a subtle form of censorship-a company de-ranked by Google effectively is condemned to irrelevancy. Regardless of what we think of payday loans, who is Google to decide that for us. and why would Google have done it? Could it have been because the Obama Administration was initiating a campaign against payday lenders at the same time? It is not hard to imagine that Google cultivates the gratitude of politicians who have the power to regulate and legislate in ways that impact Google's interest.</p><p>The inductivist turkey</p><p>The Panglossian view that technology will solve the Big Tech problem because that is what has occurred in the past suffers from the fallacy of what British philosopher Bertrand Russell called \"the inductivist turkey.\" When a turkey observes that his owner comes each morning to feed him, the turkey inductively infers that he will continue to be fed each morning-an inference that breaks down each year at Thanksgiving. Just because something happened in the past does not mean it will happen in the future.</p><p>It also simply is not true that technology alone has been sufficient in the past. IBM's dominance lasted \"only\" 30 years and Microsoft's less than two decades, but neither company was dethroned without government intervention. IBM lost its primacy because the Department of Justice went after it on antitrust grounds for decades. Because of this pressure, it decided to outsource part of its computer manufacturing, which is what led to the PC revolution. Similarly, Google and Facebook are not part of Microsoft today because Microsoft was under antitrust scrutiny. As one of the lawyers in that case said, \"The trial is the remedy.\" So, historical precedent actually supports the idea of subjecting Big Tech to antitrust scrutiny. While it is absolutely true that growth comes from technological innovation, it is wrong to think that letting Big Tech companies continue unhindered necessarily will lead to that innovation.</p><p>So, what do I propose? As a skeptical economist-especially with regards to government intervention-I advocate what 1 call a lean approach. There should be no massive overhauls, which create uncertainty and pose a danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. I also am not in favor of breaking up all of Big Tech, and especially not Google, because there are significant economies of scale in search algorithms. I would be much more in favor of splitting Instagram from Facebook, because there are no strong synergies between them and because it was a mistake for antitrust enforcers to allow Facebook to gain so much market power in the first place.</p><p>Yet, my initial approach would be even more benign. We should try to promote competition. The reason we do not see a conservative Facebook being developed is because people want to be where other people are, and it is very costly in terms of time and effort for people to \"multi-home\"-to be on multiple social networks. Compare this, for example, with using both Lyft and Uber, which is convenient and efficient.</p><p>The same could be true with social media if users could post their content to an intermediary that disseminates it to all of their preferred social media sites. The intermediary also could collect and organize content from their friends and present it in one place. The reason this is not already happening is that Federal law prevents it. Indeed, a company called Power Ventures made an application to do all this, but it was shut down by court order when Facebook sued it. As a result of that lawsuit it is a crime for a company-even with an individual's permission-to obtain that individual's data from Facebook. Here is a clear example of Facebook creating barriers to entry, and the elimination of those barriers would be pro-competition and -free market-not interventionist.</p><p>In the jargon, this is called \"portability of the social graph,\" and it is no different than the portability of our cell phone numbers. Those of us who are a little older remember a time when we did not own our phone numbers-the telephone company did, and if we switched companies we lost our number. Why do we now think it is normal to own our phone number?-because the Federal Communications Commission forced phone companies to allow portability, another instance where regulation created more competition, not less, and reduced consumer prices.</p><p>We should begin with this kind of lean regulation in the tech sector to create more competition, which in turn will lead to more innovation and a better result for all of us. \u2605</p><p>Luigi Zingales is the Robert C.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice, which both have jurisdiction to enforce antitrust laws, have divided oversight over the four companies, with Amazon and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple and Google under the Justice Department, sources told Reuters. The potential investigations have been welcomed by some consumer advocates, who say big technology companies stifle competition and hold too much sway over speech and commerce. But some legal experts said the investigations may not lead to major reforms, noting that U.S. law makes it difficult to prove an antitrust violation. </p><p>The following answers some questions about the basics of U.S. antitrust law and what regulators will focus on: What are antitrust laws for? Antitrust laws seek to promote fair competition. A law from 1914, the Clayton Act, lets the government block mergers that would harm consumers. The Sherman Act, passed in 1890, prohibits price-fixing conspiracies and other agreements that restrain competition. The Sherman Act also lays out rules regarding monopoly power. It is these laws that the Justice Department and the FTC would likely focus on if they initiate investigations of the technology companies, legal experts said. Why would Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple face scrutiny? The Justice Department's focus is expected to be on allegations that Google favors its own products in search results and abuses its clout in the online advertising market, although it is expected to look at all of the company's businesses, sources told Reuters. It is not known what aspects of Amazon, Facebook, and Apple could be investigated. Google has said that changes to its search algorithms are made with consumers in mind, and that it is transparent in how it promotes its own services. Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, who said in a New York Times op-ed that it should be forced to sell off subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram. Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg, in his own op-ed, said, \"In this competitive environment, it is hard to sustain the claim that Facebook is a monopoly.\" Clegg wrote that Facebook is responsible for the sort of rapid, consumer-friendly innovation antitrust law is meant to encourage. In the United States, half of all online shopping transactions happen on Amazon, giving the ecommerce company sway over merchants that use its platforms. But in a 2018 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said \"Amazon remains a small player in global retail\" because most commerce still happens offline. Finally, some software developers argue Apple has a monopoly on its app marketplace, and uses this power to demand hefty commissions and engage in other anticompetitive practices. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told CBS News in an interview that aired on Tuesday that Apple does not have a dominant position in any market. What would the U.S. government need to prove to bring a case against the tech companies? It is difficult to show a violation of U.S. antitrust law, legal experts said. It is not enough for regulators to establish that a company has monopoly power. They must also show anticompetitive conduct - an abuse of that dominant position aimed at bypassing fair competition. \"You can get a monopoly just by being a good competitor and that's fine,\" said Chris Sagers, a professor of antitrust law at Cleveland State University. Under current precedent, the Department of Justice and the FTC also need to show that consumers are being harmed, something that in recent decades has typically been measured by whether prices are going up and innovation is slowing. Using these metrics, it could be difficult to prove that technology companies, which do not charge money for many of their services, are hurting consumers, some legal experts said. But Charlotte Slaiman, an antitrust lawyer with consumer rights group Public Knowledge, said there is a growing consensus among economists and the public that it is misleading to call services such as Google and Facebook free. \"What is really going on is that consumers are bartering with their data in exchange for a service,\" Slaiman said. In 2013, the FTC closed an investigation into Google's search practices. The agency said that, while Google's changes to how it displayed search results likely harmed some rivals, there was \"ample evidence\" that Google was trying to improve user experience. What can the U.S. government do if investigators find an antitrust violation? The FTC and Justice Department can both file civil lawsuits in federal court and ask judges to order changes to a company's business model. The Justice Department can also bring criminal antitrust cases, but those prosecutions usually relate to cartels and price-fixing, making charges against big technology firms unlikely.

On March 8, Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator and Democrat presidential contender for 2020, shared her plan to break up the big technology companies, which dominate the world from their base in the U.S. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" she wrote in a post on online publishing platform Medium. While the idea of forced breakups in corporate America might sound radical, given that there have been only a few such instances in its history, she has given political weight to a proposal which until then resonated largely in the academic world. By doing so, Ms. Warren has also brought the issue of antitrust action, or action that promotes competition, into the mainstream at a time when the 2020 presidential race is set to pick up pace. </p><p>Within days, Verge reported that \"a majority of the other presidential candidates have agreed with at least the premise of her proposal.\" The plan has put the Big Tech, as the big technology companies are referred to, on the back foot. In a television interview a few days ago, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he disagreed with Ms. Warren's plan and mentioned that he is \"frustrated that tech is painted as monolithic\" What is at stake? What lies ahead? What is the criticism against Big Tech?<br/> Ms. Warren, while specifically referring to Google, Amazon, and Facebook in her post, wrote that American tech companies have built dominance because of two strategies. One involves purchase of potential competitors. As examples, she pointed at Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Google's purchase of mapping service Waze and ad company DoubleClick.<br/> The second strategy is the use of \"proprietary marketplaces to limit competition\". In the post, she wrote, \"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version.\"<br/> Her point is that Big Tech has \"bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"<br/> Ms. Warren later clarified that Apple, which doesn't find a mention in her written proposal, also needs to be broken up. This triggered Mr. Cook's response, mentioned above. How big is Big Tech, really?<br/> If you go by market capitalisation (or the value of a company's outstanding shares), as per data in May, Amazon and Apple were worth well over $900 billion each (see graphic). Google's owner Alphabet was worth over $800 billion while Facebook had a value of well over $500 billion.<br/> The tech company that's more valuable than all the above four is Microsoft, which has seen a resurgence in recent years. (Microsoft, interestingly, was sued about two decades ago for antitrust violations and barely escaped being broken into two.) These tech giants are among the world's top companies by market capitalisation.<br/> Market research company eMarketer estimates Google and Facebook control about 60% of the digital ad spending in the U.S. Ms. Warren wrote that \"nearly half of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. More than 70% of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook\".<br/> Many of Google's properties - including the video platform YouTube, the Android platform, Play Store, Maps, the Chrome browser, the search site, as also Gmail - each have a billion plus users. Facebook has over 2 billion users and its arms Messenger and WhatsApp have more than a billion users each. What is the reason for this dominance? What is Ms. Warren's plan?<br/> Ms. Warren puts weak antitrust enforcement as the reason for the \"dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector\".<br/> She wants to take two major steps: one involves legislating to ensure companies don't end up being both a platform and a player. This pertains to companies with annual global revenues of at least $25 billion.<br/> The second step involves \"reversing illegal and anti-competitive mergers\". According to her, acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos by Amazon, of WhatsApp and Instagram by Facebook, and of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick by Google come under that category and need to be unwound. Who is in agreement with this, who is against?<br/> Fellow presidential contenders Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, John Hickenlooper, and Tulsi Gabbard have spoken about stronger antitrust enforcement, much in line with Ms. Warren's reasoning. Republican Senator Ted Cruz, retweeting Ms. Warren - for the first time ever - who criticised Facebook for taking down posts calling for its breakup, said, \"Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech.\" Others like Senator Josh Hawley have also spoken about how the dominance of a few in the tech world is threatening competition.<br/> Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg and was his roommate once upon a time, wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times recently calling for the social media company to be broken up into three. Mr. Hughes had exited the company many years earlier.<br/>Facebook lost no time in responding to this. Its spokesman Nick Clegg said, \"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the break-up of a successful American company.\"<br/> Antitrust experts have opined that it won't be easy to implement Ms. Warren's proposal not just because it would involve years of litigation. There is also the background of how antitrust violations have been viewed more from the prism of how monopolies can affect pricing. In the tech world, many successful giants have come about on a zero-pricing model. Haven't the tech companies been under pressure from policymakers in recent years?<br/> In a way, yes. In the last few years, discontentment with tech companies has increased following incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This has led to many voices calling for regulation of tech companies.<br/> The U.S. historically has taken a much lenient approach, compared to say the European Union, to penalising abuse of a dominant market position. The last big charge on monopolisation was on Microsoft about two decades ago. - some believe the scrutiny itself worked to check excessive market power.<br/> The EU in recent years has imposed antitrust fines to the tune of over $9 billion on Google. The latest one was a result of, as the E.U. antitrust agency put it, Google's abuse of its dominance \"to stop website using brokers other than the AdSense platform\". The fines amounted, as one report put it, to a small slice of its cash reserves. Spotify has now complained to E.U.'s investigators alleging misuse of Apple's App Store in favour of the latter's own streaming service.<br/> Regulations on data privacy and copyright standards have also been tightened in the EU. The world seems to be walking up to the possibility of more regulation. Bloomberg has reported that Japan's Fair Trade Commission is looking to examine Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon for possible abuse of market dominance. What will be the effect of Ms. Warren's proposal?<br/> It's tough to say what this will end up as. But what it has surely done is triggered a debate on the regulation of technology companies which seemed to be having an easy ride to burgeoning growth all along. Privacy concerns were there but tech companies convinced lawmakers that they could fix it on their own. Ms. Warren has been seen as a \"pace-setter\" by many in this regard, given that the U.S. will shortly go into campaign mode in the coming months.

What it doesn't do is resolve the question of whether consumers should be able to \"opt out\" of having their data shared by tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) unveiled the Digital Accountability and Transparency to Advance (DATA) Privacy Act last week, highlighting values like the right to deletion and clear, concise privacy policies that consumers can understand.</p><p>Most notably, the bill does not preempt state laws, but includes civil penalty authority for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a right to privacy regardless of race, gender, political or religious affiliation, and prohibits political ad targeting and price discrimination based on one of those \"protected characteristics.\"</p><p>The bill also does not exempt any government organizations (federal, state, or local) from the privacy requirements listed, and requires tech companies to provide a clear \"opt out\" option to consumers that allows them to tell tech companies not to share their data with third parties or use it for anything other than the service the tech company provides to the consumer.</p><p>Cortez Masto's bill also includes a \"safe harbor\" provision for tech startups who make less than $25 million a year and collect data on less than 3,000 people, which would encourage innovation while still requiring the big companies to meet certain privacy requirements.</p><p>Companies that make more than $25 million a year and collect data on 3,000 or more people must appoint a \"privacy protection officer,\" who must \"educate employees about compliance requirements; train employees involved in data processing; conduct regular, comprehensive audits to ensure compliance and make records of the audits available to enforcement authorities upon request; maintain updated, clear, and understandable records of all data security practices undertaken by the covered entity; serve as the point of contact between the covered entity and enforcement authorities; and advocate for policies and practices within the covered entity that promote individual privacy.\"</p><p>But the key sticking point appears to be the \"opt out\" issue. Neither industry players, lawmakers, or tech experts seem to agree on the need for an \"opt out\" approach in a federal privacy law.</p><p>The Center for Democracy and Technology released its own privacy bill a few months ago, which does preempt state laws but does not include an \"opt out\" provision for consumers or a \"safe harbor\" provision for tech startups. The CDT bill allows sharing or \"licensing\" of consumer data under certain conditions.</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) also released a privacy bill draft a few months ago, the Data Care Act, and instead of an \"opt out\" provision, it strictly prohibits companies from sharing or selling consumer data to third parties.</p><p>CDT President Nuala O'Connor, who testified before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce last week, said in her testimony that \"notice and consent\" practices do not serve consumers well.</p><p>In her view, a federal privacy law should move beyond \"opt out\" provisions by simply forbidding companies from certain data-sharing practices.</p><p>\"Existing privacy regimes rely too heavily on the concept of notice and consent, placing an untenable burden on consumers and failing to rein in harmful data practices,\" she said. \"This status quo burdens individuals with navigating every notice, data policy, and setting, trying to make informed choices that align with their personal privacy interests. The sheer number of privacy policies, notices, and settings or opt-outs one would have to navigate is far beyond individuals' cognitive and temporal limitations. It is one thing to ask an individual to manage the privacy settings on their mobile phone; it is another to tell them they must do the same management for each application, social network, and connected device they use.\"</p><p>At a Senate privacy hearing last fall, industry leaders like AT&amp;T said consumers \"should be able to choose how their data is used,\" but didn't offer specifics as to what that might look like. Last week, tech industry lobbyists told the Senate they want a \"stronger\" privacy law than California's, but again, weren't specific.</p><p>Michelle Richardson, director of CDT's Data and Privacy Project, told InsideSources she thinks the opt out provision is \"fine to include, in that there should be some aspect of personal control here, the problem is that there are hundreds if not thousands of companies that touch your data, and it's not reasonable to expect that people will be able to exercise that right. It's going to be incredibly difficult. That's why we try to move the conversation away from opt-out.\"</p><p>She also wishes the bill offered more \"concrete details.\"</p><p>\"A lot of the details are left to the FTC to decide, as to what's appropriate, what's reasonable [for tech companies],\" she said. \"It's a little bit of a gamble to have the FTC make all of the decisions. We want to make sure Congress sets some baselines that are clear.\"</p><p>Advocacy group Public Knowledge, on the other hand, praised the discrimination provisions but said the bill wasn't adequately comprehensive.</p><p>\"For example, it preserves an outdated distinction between sensitive and non-sensitive data, lacks requirements for companies to conduct privacy risk assessments for high-risk data processing, and, crucially, does not provide consumers with a private right of action to have their day in court individually and as a class to seek damages and injunctive relief for violations of their privacy,\" Dylan Gilbert, policy fellow at Public Knowledge, said. \"We look forward to working with Sen. Cortez Masto to protect consumer privacy through a more comprehensive bill.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., within the margin of error, and polls last week in Nevada and California showed her leapfrogging Sanders into second place, Warren's campaign appears on the move and interest in her ideas is growing.Still, Warren faces an uphill battle, primarily because she has eschewed big corporate donors and has focused on a grassroots campaign that hasn't been nearly as successful as Sanders'. Campaign reports show she has raised about $6 million in the first quarter[5] of the year, while Biden, Sanders and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke eclipsed that amount within 24 hours of announcing candidacy.However, Warren stands apart from the field in one key way: she has a detailed plan for just about everything, from free college tuition and student loan forgiveness to Big Tech regulation and Pentagon contracting.Since entering the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren has issued about 20 detailed plans. Most of her competitors have issued less than a half-dozen, and frontrunner Biden has only issued two \u2014one of which came under fire for its similarity to others without attribution.With so many plans on the table, Warren also has drawn criticism from centrists and conservatives alike, who say her ideas would hurt business and the economy due to increased regulation and taxation. However, like Sanders in the 2016 campaign, by making so many bold proposals[6], Warren is framing much of the debate in the Democratic primary and, again like Sanders in 2016, those positions appear to be advancing her inpolls.Wall Street is not happy about Elizabeth Warren's rise in the polls. Could she become president?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/vx90dSOkuP\">https://t.co/vx90dSOkuP</url>[7]- The New Yorker (@NewYorker) June 16, 2019[8] Robert Reich, former labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, told the New York Times last week, 'It's rare, at this stage of a presidential campaign, somebody distinguishes themselves by the boldness and detail of their policies.'Reich added, 'She is asking the biggest questions that exist, and this is: How do you make a free market work? How do you make capitalism actually work for the many rather than the few?'

This was less because of what the Facebook co-founder and chairman did say--for the most part, bromides about privacy, security and censorship--than because of what the lawmakers arrayed before him didn't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This was a missed opportunity,\" Khanna lamented later that evening in a text message. \"The hearing revealed a knowledge gap in Congress about technology.\" Many of the men and women questioning Zuckerberg were about twice his age, and some were quite a bit older than that. They knew that adversaries like Russia had weaponized social media networks like Facebook and Twitter, but the particulars of the problem clearly eluded them. The 44 legislators who took turns quizzing Zuckerberg showed only a cursory understanding of data collection and encryption, and the lengthy hearing quickly devolved into the kind of exasperating technology tutorial one dreads having to give aging relatives.</p><p>It was an amusing day for the purveyors of humorous internet memes. But anyone anxious about the obviously uneasy marriage between democracy and digital technology would not have been reassured. Zuckerberg left Capitol Hill without having to explain in any appreciable detail the failure that brought him there in the first place: the improper use of data belonging to 87 million Facebook users by data research firm Cambridge Analytica, which was conducting microtargeting work for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. He did offer apologies and reassurances, but these were vague enough to not be especially reassuring.</p><p>Only eight years older than Zuckerberg, Khanna has been called \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/23/ro-khanna-wants-to-be-silicon-valleys-ambassador-to-middle-america/\">https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/23/ro-khanna-wants-to-be-silicon-valleys-ambassador-to-middle-america/</url> Silicon Valley's ambassador to Middle America.\" California's 17th congressional district, which he has represented since 2017, is home to some of the most successful corporations in the world: Apple (market value: $892 billion, as of April 16), Intel ($245 billion), Yahoo (now part of Verizon, whose market capitalization stands at $197 billion) and Tesla ($50 billion). Alphabet ($726 billion), with its Googleplex, is one district over, as is Facebook ($480 billion), with its thumbs-up icon announcing its Menlo Park Headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way.</p><p>That address captures the mood of Silicon Valley a decade ago: whimsical, cheeky, maybe even hubristic. This was before anyone had ever heard of the Internet Research Agency, where Vladimir Putin's minions were waging a new kind of war. Psychographic data, of the kind Cambridge Analytica supposedly collected, was not yet for sale to politicians looking for an edge. Trolls were the stuff of medieval legend. And coding savants could not have expected to be lectured by the likes of Senators Chuck Grassley and Dean Heller, as Zuckerberg was earlier this month. The thumb is still there, at 1 Hacker Way, but the joke is no longer funny.</p><p>\"I believe representing Silicon Valley is one of the most important jobs in American politics,\" Khanna says. To represent Silicon Valley is to speak and account for a techno elite given far more to self-celebration than introspection. Aware of the region's surpassingly good fortunes, and of its closely related tendency to hubris, Khanna has tried to export the former while arguing that it is necessary to tame the latter. He believes that the success of the tech sector is replicable and could serve as economic balm for other parts of the nation, particularly those where mining or manufacturing can no longer vault blue-collar workers into the middle class. Despite troubling disclosures about Facebook and its peers, he believes that most any community would welcome Zuckerberg, along with his Cambridge Analytica problem.</p><p>The same week that Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi selected Khanna to draft an Internet Bill of Rights. It was a significant show of confidence in the House freshman by Pelosi, a veteran of the chamber renowned for her political acumen. Although it is impossible to say what an Internet Bill of Rights will look like, Khanna has long proposed such a measure to give Internet users clarity over the data they share as they click through Facebook photos or shop on Amazon.</p><p>The Internet Bill of Rights would, in turn, prove a major test of just how much regulation Silicon Valley is willing to countenance. Big Tech has been a remarkably cagey industry, in part because it knows it gives us what nobody else can. It knows that even as we complain about hegemony, we order diapers on Amazon, instead of walking to the corner store. World leaders spar on Twitter, while chefs who once wanted to impress critics now think about what will look good on Instagram. At the same time, Reddit trolls disseminate fake news, which Google algorithms uncritically promote, while terrorists talk freely on WhatsApp, protected by the messaging service's encryption. Silicon Valley is becoming a victim of its own explosive growth, like the too-big-to-fail Wall Street banks that failed in 2008, plunging the nation into a recession.</p><p>Khanna is aware of souring public opinion and has tried to both acknowledge it and reshape it. \"You can't be an island of success,\" he says of the district he represents. \"We have to answer the nation's call.\" If Silicon Valley can answer that call with \"humility,\" Khanna says, the tech behemoths can avoid the kind of onerous regulation other liberal legislators are calling for, such as the General Data Protection Regulation that will go into effect in Europe in 2018.</p><p>Khanna's indefatigable optimism has positioned him as a potential leader in a Democratic Party unable to reconcile its progressive and centrist elements and desperate for new faces. As a member of the Progressive Caucus, Khanna has advocated for liberal policies such as expansion of the earned-income tax credit. But his corporate past--and corporate constituency--keep him from veering too far into the sort of political fantasy for which Northern California is sometimes known. He may be just what the party needs, a moderate by temperament but by no means a centrist.</p><p>\"You can have a bold progressive vision coming from Silicon Valley, rooted in patriotism,\" Khanna says. \"And I guess the case study is they elected me.\"</p><p>Yet amid continuing calls to #DeleteFacebook--as well as for Twitter to suspend problematic accounts and Google to live up to its famous \"Don't be evil\" motto--that sunny vision is increasingly hard to sell, in Washington and elsewhere. And that has forced Silicon Valley's ambassador to play crisis manager, urging patience and promising reform from an industry that has never felt the need to listen to politicians.</p><p>'A Legend in Our Family'</p><p>[[nid:887978]]</p><p>If there is an obverse to Trump's America, it is CA-17, a hilly, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd113/cd_based/ST06/CD113_CA17.pdf\">https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd113/cd_based/ST06/CD113_CA17.pdf</url> 185-square-mile refuge south of San Francisco. To the northwest is San Francisco, aglitter with the towering new symbols of techno wealth. On the opposite side of the shimmering bay rise the hills of Oakland and Berkeley, where the graying warriors of the 1960s shuffle down the aisles of organic groceries. The district has only ever sent two Republicans to Congress, the last of them nearly 30 years ago. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the greater Silicon Valley area with more than 70 percent of the vote; Trump was even less popular here than he was in Manhattan.</p><p>Khanna represents both the hippies and the techies, but it's not hard to divine where the sympathies of the former Stanford economics instructor lie.</p><p>His parents immigrated to the United States from India in 1968. Because of his name and his dark brown skin, Khanna is one of those Americans fated to field questions about where he is really from. The answer is Philadelphia, where he was born in 1976. But it is also India, where his maternal grandfather, Amarnath Vidyalankar, was an activist and politician who spent time in prison. \"He was a legend in our family,\" Khanna says, calling him \"the deep inspiration for entering public service.\"</p><p>Shortly after Khanna was born, his family moved to the prosperous Bucks County suburbs north of Philadelphia. The neighbors, uniformly white, were suspicious. There had been an Indian family on the block before who had not decorated their house with Christmas lights--a statement of cultural defiance, in the local view. The Khannas adorned their house for the holidays, defusing fears. He happily spent his childhood in the town and his parents live there still.</p><p>Khanna's patriotism is rooted in this suburban experience. \"We're constantly embracing history and culture by reshaping. But we can't reject such a thing as American culture,\" Khanna says. \"We should have respect for certain traditions. I don't think we can be a rootless communal culture.\"</p><p>The mere notion of national culture is anathema to many liberals, who now consider it almost a byword for xenophobia. Khanna acknowledges as much, while also realizing that Democrats have largely ceded patriotism to Republicans. \"We need to define American culture in a way that's inspiring,\" he says, one that embraces and includes.</p><p>It's a kind of patriotism tailored to CA-17, the only majority-Asian district in the United States, a miniature of the happily multicultural America that Obama promised was about to come into being. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/17/h-1b-foreign-citizens-make-up-nearly-three-quarters-of-silicon-valley-tech-workforce-report-says/\">https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/17/h-1b-foreign-citizens-make-up-nearly-three-quarters-of-silicon-valley-tech-workforce-report-says/</url> A full 71 percent of workers in the valley's technology sector are immigrants.</p><p>This inspirational message would, of course, need a messenger. \"You need someone who, intrinsically, in their gut, conveys that the 21st century will be a shining moment for American exceptionalism,\" Khanna says, without quite saying that he would very much like to be that person.</p><p>'A Huge Opportunity'</p><p>[[nid:887969]]</p><p>In the spring of 2004, The Nation wrote about a spate of liberal challengers to sitting Democratic members of Congress who supported the war in Iraq. \"The most serious\" of these candidates, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/antiwar-primary-challenge/\">https://www.thenation.com/article/antiwar-primary-challenge/</url> The Nation declared, was Khanna, then 27 years old.</p><p>At the time, Khanna was new to politics, at least as far as his own electoral prospects were concerned. Years before, as a student at the University of Chicago, he'd knocked on doors for a young politician from nearby Hyde Park: Barack Obama. After law school at Yale, followed by a brief stay in Washington, Khanna moved to the Bay Area, where he worked as a lawyer in private practice, as Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com burst of 1999-2000. He lost the 2004 primary but, five years later went to Washington anyway, appointed as a deputy assistant secretary in the Commerce Department by President Obama.</p><p>Khanna remembers being confounded by the fact that the department was headquartered in a building named for Herbert Hoover. Khanna knew of him only as one of the nation's worst presidents; he soon learned, however, that Hoover was an \"extraordinary commerce secretary,\" as he puts it today, one who helped spur the rise of the commercial aviation industry and reformed the Bureau of Standards, which helped streamline and clarify business practices.</p><p>In 1922, Hoover wrote a book, American Individualism, in which he espoused what he called \"progressive individualism,\" with capitalism curbed by a muscular federal apparatus. There was a utopian quality to the book, and Hoover would have been a perfect ambassador for Silicon Valley with his vision of a beneficent capitalism. And in a way, that is his role today. Hoover Tower looms over the campus of Stanford University, where tech giants like Yahoo and Google were born, and the Hoover Institution, a prominent conservative think tank, is housed on campus.</p><p>Khanna's approach to Silicon Valley has some touches of Hooverism. He does not believe that onerous regulations are necessary, but he understands that if companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter resist transparency on a variety of issues--data privacy, Russian-controlled accounts that influence our electoral process, a near-monopoly on advertising enjoyed by the first two of those companies--transparency will be forced upon them.</p><p>\"This is a huge opportunity for tech leaders to work with Congress,\" Khanna says. Otherwise, he warns, the regulatory power will fall to \"a bunch of bureaucrats who, frankly, don't know much about tech,\" intellectual siblings of the senators who haplessly interrogated Zuckerberg. If regulation is inevitable, better that regulation be informed by the industry in question.</p><p>The Rust Belt Safari</p><p>[[nid:887982]]</p><p>\"You can blend technology optimism with a progressive vision,\" Khanna likes to say. But he's a somewhat awkward fit with his party's left wing. It doesn't help that he's worth at least $27 million, making him the fourth-richest member of the exceptionally wealthy delegation from California (total worth: more than $439 million, with Darrell Issa of the San Diego area <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-richest-california-lawmakers-20180305-story.html\">http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-richest-california-lawmakers-20180305-story.html</url> topping the list). Khanna's wife, Ritu, is the daughter of Ohio automobile parts magnate Monte Ahuja.</p><p>A Republican might well celebrate these as particularly American success stories, but</p><p>\"we were a little nervous,\" offers Mark Pocan, the Democratic congressman from Wisconsin who co-chairs the 77-member Progressive Caucus. He says, however, that his fears have since been allayed, as Khanna has come out as an anti-trust crusader and an advocate for expanded Medicare. \"I could see him being the person on any committee or any issue,\" Pocan says.</p><p>So can others, who have noted Khanna's persistent ambition, his obvious desire to spend no time as a House backbencher (he is one of very few first-termers to have moved his family to Washington). Khanna disconcerted many Democrats by endorsing California State Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who is seeking to unseat U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, whom some regard as insufficiently liberal. A columnist for The Mercury News <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/15/the-background-of-khannas-call-for-feinstein-to-depart/\">https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/15/the-background-of-khannas-call-for-feinstein-to-depart/</url> questioned Khanna's \"credentials as a kingmaker,\" given that Feinstein had been in politics for longer than he'd been alive.</p><p>At the same time, Khanna has declined to take a far easier means of self-promotion. Unlike many of his House colleagues, he is not especially interested in impeachment. His Twitter feed is not rife with theories about collusion, what Trump was doing in Russia in 2013, how Jared Kushner wooed real estate investors from the Mideast. Instead, as he put it, there is a more basic question: \"Where do we want to take America?\" For all his faults, Trump had an answer. Democrats have yet to find one. Khanna is among several young Democrats in the House who see economic progressivism as a better path than endless parsing of the Mueller investigation.</p><p>It helps, of course, that his district generates more wealth than many small nations. For all the Silicon \"districts\" out there, nobody has yet replicated the valley's success. But Silicon Valley is a paradise only for those who can afford it. Glimpse the homeless clustered under freeway overpasses, and the market success of Big Tech can seem like a market failure. Khanna has tried to celebrate the valley while condemning the inequalities it has fostered. \"I don't want to live in the Silicon Valley that only has Facebook or Google engineers able to live here,\" he said at a recent forum on affordable housing.</p><p>To survive, he believes, the culture of Silicon Valley must be exported beyond the Bay Area. When that happens, he imagines the entitlement will dissipate, like the fog over San Francisco in late afternoon. \"We can't have all of the jobs, all the capital, all of the resources just in Silicon Valley,\" he says. \"It's not good for these companies. It's not good for America.\" He has worked with Representative Hal Rogers, Republican of Kentucky, on Silicon Holler, a project to bring tech jobs to Appalachia. And he recently toured venture capital firms in the Midwest with Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/3/30/17177834/midwest-heartland-bus-tour-comeback-cities-rust-belt-safari-vc-venture-capital-founders-washington\">https://www.recode.net/2018/3/30/17177834/midwest-heartland-bus-tour-comeback-cities-rust-belt-safari-vc-venture-capital-founders-washington</url> in a trip dubbed the \"Rust Belt Safari.\"</p><p>And he regularly returns to the Bay Area, holding a monthly town hall in his district. At the one in February, Khanna tried to allay constituents' concerns about North Korea, the loss of civility, Russian meddling. Khanna mentioned his trip to Kentucky, joking that his Indian background had been far less alarming to the people there than the fact that he represented California.</p><p>\"We are a community that believes in America's future,\" he said. \"If we can make this district a model for the kind of America that we want to see--I think that is the best antidote to the policies of Donald Trump.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWEEK-NW891908_2018-04-27.SIG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEEK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBG-2R41-JC85-S0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newsweek Inc.

It's now become a kitchen-table question. In what ways, if any, does their business need to be regulated?   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">==</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The combination of personal information and advertising is an inherent conflict for Facebook. Many people are leaving Facebook, or in the case of the youngest generations, have never used it. Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok are providing social media services without the overwhelming amount of advertisements one finds on Facebook. Security concerns have also led parents to restrict their children's access to Facebook. Technology and the network effect allow rapid growth but also rapid decline for social media companies. This is a new frontier and legislation is not keeping pace with the changing environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Andy Ansin, vice president, Sunbeam Properties</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">== </p><p>Facebook is an incredible connector tool be it old friends reuniting or new connections growing closer. It has unfortunately become polarized as a societal vehicle used to mislead, to spread hate, drive conspiracy and peddle fake news. While freedom and open source of information is important, I would like to see standards for sourcing of information, proper labeling of opinion pieces and authenticating members from false accounts and phishing attacks.</p><p>Michael Balaban, president, CEO, Jewish Federation of Broward County</p><p> ==</p><p>Facebook can only be deemed too powerful if the people \"running the show\" are not asking the tough questions and demanding rigorous answers of themselves. Lime has given me the chance to reinvent myself once again. From banker to payments technology exec and now to micromobility as general manager for Lime in Florida. I am at the point in my life where leadership possibilities are endless. This question also encourages me to reflect about our role in the world to ensure we live our values and that it translates down through our employees and ultimately our users. Tech can and should have a positive impact in improving people's lives and the greater world around us, but it is always incumbent upon the industry to self-assess if ever it seems we're straying from that outcome. Ultimately, there is always a role for regulators and thoughtful elected and public officials, which also encourages me to wonder if I should someday run for office, as we all have a voice making both legislators as well as corporations accountable.</p><p>Uhriel Bedoya, Florida general manager, Lime</p><p>==</p><p>Facebook is likely too powerful and I don't see the political will yet to effectively regulate it.</p><p>Claudia Busch, founding principal, Berenblum Busch Architects</p><p>==</p><p>Mark (Zuckerberg), forgive me, but, yes, Facebook, if not too powerful, is at minimum too influential. Our newest and youngest learners lean on these social medial platforms for their news and assessment of matters. Unfortunately (and fortunately), the First Amendment allows the freedom of expression, and Facebook represents the best and worst of free speech. I have felt, for a while, that Facebook can be an invaluable source for information, but only if FB voluntarily builds a 'gold seal' that can be assigned to credible and unbiased news sources. Allowing news outlets to voluntarily register for the 'seal' and financing the costs of monitoring these providers with a membership fee can ensure the integrity of important information. The 'seal' should be awarded and monitored by an ethnically, racially and politically diverse editorial board.</p><p>Anita Byer, CEO, Setnor Byer Insurance &amp; Risk</p><p>==</p><p>Facebook has been losing popularity, and consequently power, for a while now. In general, I don't believe in over-regulation of businesses in a free market..</p><p>Ricardo Dunin, founding partner, Lionheart Capital</p><p>==</p><p>It should be regulated based on the behavior of Facebook. If it behaves like a newspaper or media outlet, regulate it as such. If it chooses to be a pure social interaction platform, then apply those rules to the game. If it decided to be a political and policy influencing platform, treat it a lobbying group and regulate accordingly.</p><p>Carlos R. Fernandez-Guzman, president, CEO, Pacific National Bank (PNB)</p><p>==</p><p>Facebook started off with good intentions, but as the saying goes \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" What started off as an innocuous way to share pictures, find friends and build a global community, has morphed into accusations of improper data collection and dissemination of disinformation, to name a few negative consequences. I don't know that regulation is the answer, but the serious discussion should continue, especially about data collection.</p><p>Christine Franklin, president, Cherokee Enterprises </p><p>==</p><p>I don't think Facebook is too powerful. I think people are simply too addicted to their phones and forget that life is better lived in person rather than on your phone. It's one thing to share pictures of great life events with friends, but it's another to live your entire life in front of a small screen instead of within a large and beautiful world.</p><p>Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal, 13th Floor Investments</p><p>==</p><p>I think all social media, not just Facebook, requires some monitoring and likely more checks and balances. However, we need to be careful with the introduction of any regulations that may inadvertently affect freedom of speech and American free enterprise. In my arena, it's been evident, for example, that FB understood that they were not going to be in the good graces of the government when they introduced their bitcoin, LIBRA. But the real question is, who will own one's data? In Europe, great strides have been made to protect consumer data. But this has stifled creativity a bit. In my industry, financial services, the challenge will be who will deliver the best results for the customer without impeding on their privacy. Will it be the Fintechs, banks, social media or big data companies? The jury is still out. The truth is that social media has influenced every aspect of financial services. It has moved far beyond a venue to post about life, family or levity and grown into a business platform with real-time industry updates, changing relationships between clients and business. Not only are social media channels a way for customers to interact with banks and Fintechs, but also where innovations and, of course, bad reports or complaints are posted. Every company in my industry has taken a deep dive into social media. A central part of customer service is today being offered through social media because it's where customers and also prospects reside. Creative proactive and effective reactive social media approaches increase visibility and the reach of messages and content. For these reasons, as mentioned, the impacts of regulation or other controls must be very carefully considered before being instituted.</p><p>Bernie Navarro, founder and president, Benworth Capital Partners</p><p> ==</p><p>Social media platforms should follow regulations when it pertains to the exchange and delegation of data. Currently, social media giants have complete control of our data (data monopolies), when in actuality, the information that is provided belongs to the user and not the platforms. If these social media companies were to become compatible with other platforms and make our data openly available, it would foster competition by allowing consumers to choose and switch between platforms with little to no friction. For instance, the way in which the European Union has dealt with financial data through Open Banking regulations may be an example to follow.</p><p>Sanket Parekh, founder and managing partner, Secocha Ventures</p><p>==</p><p>A broad based team of smart people form a variety of walks of life should address the issue of not only regulating Facebook but all major forms of social media, and the sooner the better, as the tools are becoming increasingly powerful. The Arab Spring across many countries in Northern Africa several years was impacted by social media, creating tremendous social change and upheaval in the region.</p><p>Julio Ramirez, president, CEO, JEM Global Consulting</p><p>==</p><p>The short answer is, yes, Facebook is too powerful. Like many trends in our history that are driven by advances in technology, their rate of adoption is faster than our ability to understand all the implications. We need to continue the effort of understanding what Facebook has become, and how we might mitigate the negative impacts.</p><p>Kelley Shanley, president, CEO, Broward Center for the Performing Arts</p><p>==</p><p>It's not just Facebook, it is also the other big tech companies that wield too much power for most people's comfort. Government definitely has an important regulatory role, but that role has to be balanced with the right to free speech and the right to operate lawfully and profitably. I think that for most people the biggest concern is that these corporations may already have too much influence to be able to effectively reign them in, as well as their potential influence on our elections.</p><p>Evelio C.

I'm your host, Beverly Hallberg, and on today's episode we delve into the issue of big tech and privacy. With a bipartisan group of attorneys general across the nation announcing an antitrust investigation against Google, what does this mean for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and others if the federal government steps in to regulate? Will that stifle competition or are these companies so large that they've already pushed out competitors?

Using empirical methods she assesses regulations and policies for digitally connected domains such as mobile wireless, telecom, cable, internet among others. Dr. Layton is also a visiting researcher at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, Denmark and is a vice president at Strand Consult. Roslyn, thanks so much for joining us today.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>I'm thrilled to join you, Beverly. Thank you so much.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>And I think technology is a wonderful thing. You are a tech guru. You are actually joining us today from Copenhagen. I know it's later there, so thank you so much for joining us on this episode. But isn't technology wonderful where we can even have this conversation while we're in different countries?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>It's true. It is. I mean I've been able to work all over the world and work with people because broadband is so excellent and it's getting better all the time. It's really a wonderful success story, and you don't know how great you have it until you go abroad actually. But any case, you and I today, we're using our mobile technologies probably, and I listened to your podcast when I'm on the go, so I love it.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>And I didn't tell you, I was going to ask you this question, but something that I was reading, your introduction I thought of is that while you and I have worked together in the past and you're a friend of mine, I have to admit that even though I've worked with people in the tech industry focusing on researching the policies of big tech, I don't meet many women in this industry. So you're one of the few women that I know that works in this industry. How did that come about? Why was this an interest for you and what is it been like being a woman working in this field?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>It's such a great question, and I would just say to those listener women who want to get into tech, go for it. Because you know what? Honestly, being a woman is an advantage. And the other part is who uses technology is women. But in my personal story, I have reinvented myself many times. I've had a long career doing different things, but I knew that at maybe in my thirties I got an MBA. I knew I had to change careers. I had worked with nonprofit organizations and I worked in the financial industry and I got an MBA. I worked for Titan India. I went back to California. I actually was working in Silicon Valley, so I had a great experience. And then I was recruited to Denmark to bring my Silicon Valley skills to a new place.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>But as I went along, I was very much involved in kind of startup culture, and what I realized what was missing was the thinking is so much like make it happen. Things had to be very fast. And I thought, gee, if you could step back and think of strategy for a moment. So in Denmark there's a wonderful thing called the Industrial PhD Program, and that I went to a study business economics. I studied a very controversial issue called net neutrality. I looked at 50 countries around the world and what happened with their internet regulation before and after. And that was really ... opened my mind and my world to the policy area, and it's made me love the American constitution because I've learned so much about the US because I've lived abroad. But what I can boil all of that down for you is that regulation tends to reward the largest companies because they are generally asking for regulation and they can protect their market position.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>And when it comes to the internet, we have seen a lot of success with what's called multi-stakeholder or bottom up kind of solutions where you have different stakeholders working together. And I learned that in my research where I saw that the countries that had the most heavy handed regulation, you saw very little startup activity, very little disruptors. And of course where we've seen the entrenchment of the large companies were where ... sorry, the opposite. So where you had a multi-stakeholder model, you had a lot of local innovations. So for example, here in Denmark they manage the net neutrality issue through self-regulation. In most of the Nordic countries, they've been very innovative, making local innovation.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>But in the cases where they had a heavy handed approach, you don't find ... what's interesting is we were told we need to regulate the internet, but no one else has been able to come up with the other Google or something on Facebook, except in China where there are no rules at all for net neutrality. So in any case, my PhD was really ... it pushed back against a lot of conventional wisdom and so I take that approach very much because we have everyone in Washington, they all want to regulate their competitors. And when the largest companies come in and say, \"Oh please regulate us,\" then you really have to have some concerns.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>Well obviously because they have a vested interest in that. And I do want to get into that more, but I want to take a step back. I think often this world of big tech can ... it's a lot to sift through if you don't deal with it day in and day out. We know that there is something significant going on because 50 state attorney's general are making an investigation into Google across this issue, the issue of privacy, but can you take us a step back and say when it comes to privacy, what is it that people are referring to? What are the concerns?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Well, that's a great question, Beverly. I'm really glad you asked that because if you listen to the debates or what you read on the news, they are jumbling a lot of terms together. They'll say data privacy, data protection, data security, every single one of those terms has a very different meaning and extremely different legal implications and they all get thrown around and they're not the same thing. And so just to put this in perspective, in Europe, this giant new regulation called the General Data Protection Regulation, the word privacy is not in that text. With all the words in it, there's nothing about privacy. It is about regulating the conduct of business. It's about regulating information. It has nothing to do with privacy. Now, privacy in the United States actually has a very long history over 200 years going back to before the founding and the first laws that were adopted in the United States had to do with protecting people from the government.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So how the census was conducted, protecting the posts, making sure that your mail wasn't read, laws about people eavesdropping on you. So actually the privacy tradition in the United States is very strong largely about the administrative state. In our laws in the US we have over two dozen laws regulating privacy with regard to business, different industries. That goes back to the '70s, and where people had a lot of financial information, we have a lot of active ... people had credit, the early days of credit. And when it was time to move that away from punch cards and so on onto computers, it was necessary to make a kind of framework. So the interesting thing is in terms about the protection of data and how it's treated, the United States has a long tradition of doing that. But what we did was evolve what you would call a trust based or risk based approach, where we didn't do what the Europeans do, which says every single thing needs to be regulated by the state.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>We said, \"Let's evolve this based upon where the need is necessary. Financial information, health information, children and information.\" So that's been important for the permission less innovation we have in our country because we didn't assume that just because you collect personal information that it's a problematic. So we have allowed firms to emerge, that's been vital for the internet. And so now we're at a point, in fact, we've been there for 20 years, it's just Congress keeps ... it becomes difficult to make the deal or what have you, but we know that now we have to do something about the digital space and that's where- [crosstalk 00:09:19]</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>And can I jump in here in a question on that? So when we want to think about privacy, should we say, \"Okay, privacy first of all is about people and how people are treated in relation to the companies that they opt in to use.\" So let's use Facebook. That's an easy example. And Facebook should adhere to their policies on how people's data is being used. That's when they get into trouble is when they sell it to a third party without your consent, therefore breaking the privacy policy that they have with you. So that is very separate than what's going on with the competition and the regulation. Correct?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Right. So yes, I appreciate that you highlight that because that's already covered. So we have the Federal Trade Commission, which just fined Facebook $5 billion, a huge fine, but that was for what's called a violation ... we have rules about unfair and deceptive practices. So take privacy off the table. If you make a contract with a person or a terms of agreement and you do not represent what you're going to do or you do the opposite or you don't disclose, that is an unfair or deceptive practice. So you don't have to make new laws to address that. And so that has been there.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Now there were other issues with Facebook because they had a previous consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, so the question was did they violate it? And that of course enables the FTC to make the kinds of investigation and fines that they did. So that is one issue, unfair and deceptive practices. We have a hundred year tradition on that. It's very important in American law and jurisprudence and so forth. But the other issue is now, can you say the second part? I'm sorry, what's [crosstalk 00:11:00]</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>Well, just let's now get into what ... yeah, what are we now getting into when it comes to regulate the companies any further? Like you were saying earlier, a lot of these terms get used in different ways and they have very specific meanings and people I think are careless in how they use it. What's being talked about right now when it comes to the attorneys general is not about the privacy of people, it's how do we regulate these companies. Correct?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Right. So I'll be honest with you, when I have ... I'm still trying to get a copy of the materials, but I've watched the 50 attorney general stood on the steps of the Supreme Court and each one of them had kind of different reasons. So there's not a specific reason and they're not even describing it. But what is significant is not since really the tobacco kind of litigation have we had attorneys general on both sides and 50 of them, all but California and Alabama, so also Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico's AG have joined, but they all kind of have a different beef against Google. Now I would say this. On their own, a lot of attorney general have tried to go after Google for things like Affirm was on the Google search engine and then they fell to page three and all their business dried up.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So that again could be a deceptive practice with Google not disclosing how their algorithm works. So the challenge here is that you have a lot of antitrust action. You've got the Department of Justice, they have launched an investigation, you have Congress looking into it. So I would guess I would say there's a laundry list of people upset with Google. And to be honest with you, I mean a lot of us in the policy community have been trying to highlight these issues for years and no one would really listen. And so now it's a bit after the fact and everyone ... there's a lot of things we're concerned about, what's going on in China and so forth. But the world has changed even in the last decade. So for example, do you really want to break up Google and Facebook and Amazon and then just give a gift to the large Chinese companies?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So maybe we are not happy about some of these American companies, but who do we want people in Thailand? Do we want them to use American companies or Chinese companies when they go online? So I think the issue is now there's even more at stake. It's very complex. There's also challenges because for example Apple is putting cloud data in China where the Chinese government and military can look at it. So that's a concern, that Google has worked with ... has done some projects with the Chinese government. That's a concern. So it's a very difficult, extremely difficult question. And in many respects, sometimes it doesn't line up to traditional antitrust analysis. So for example, consumers don't necessarily pay more out of their pocket. Right? You don't pay to use a search engine. But we are considering now, well, do we give too much of our information?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>We don't know how it works. It's very opaque. The other issue is the companies are extremely innovative. So in a anti-competitive situation, innovation would be reduced, but that's not the situation now. We have a lot of innovation today. So I'll just wrap up on this one point just to show you how complex it is, because I used to be ... I was working in the field where we worked in digital advertising and analytics. A lot of the attorney generals think that because your advertisement appears high, did you pay more for the advertisement? That's not necessarily the case. Some of the best advertisers, they pay very little for their keywords because they have made a quality advertisement. It's very relevant for the user's query.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So in fact the bad advertisements get penalized by paying a higher price. So it actually rewards advertisers who make quality advertising that users click through, that they resolve, that they get what they're looking for. So the other part of this is that users get a lot of utility out of Google. Now there's definitely concerns with the operating system, there's concerns about business practices with vertical integration and so on. But it doesn't always match up to what the traditional antitrust analysis would look for.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>And that's why I think it's good that even as we're thinking about, okay, what leads to innovation, what increases competition, we can actually look to Europe and some of the rules, you called them, I think they are known as GDPR is what they're known as there, is some of the privacy rules that they institute. And of course they deal with privacy differently outside of America, but what have you found when it comes to the small or medium sized firms that are trying to grow in comparison to these larger companies? Because like you were saying, these large companies tend to want these types of regulations because it benefits them somehow. Correct?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Right, exactly. Well, as I told you in my PhD when I studied this net neutrality policy, all the countries that adopted the hard rules, Google, Apple, Facebook, all the big American companies increased their traffic and revenue in those countries. And it's not surprising of course, they've always been asking for, \"Well please regulate the internet in our favor.\" But what we've seen in Europe, and it's not just this latest policy of GDPR, it's been the history of the EU, is that they've always felt that they could manage innovation from the desk of the bureaucrat. Right? So they thought, well, we didn't like Google so the government will fund our own search engine and it will ... And France and Germany tried to create a competitor to Google, it didn't fly because there's something about ... every single day you have to have the test of the users and do they like your service or not and you have to respond to the marketplace.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So the European attempts to make innovation to compete with Silicon Valley have not really been successful. There's other barriers within the European Union. Americans forget that our whole nation was founded on being a single market. We have a common language and currency. We have interstate commerce and the European Union is still trying to resolve that. They have 17 currencies and 24 languages and so even with all the regulations they make to try to make it a single place, it still doesn't work. And that has a lot to do with restrictive regulations that say you have to treat every single piece of information as if it is a piece of property, that it has to be ... if you don't care whether it's sensitive or not, whether it's valuable or not.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So you don't get a lot of risk taking. The sad thing about the EU would be in the last ... you haven't seen small and medium sized companies grow. But the amazing thing with this GDPR is they promise that policymakers said, \"Oh, we're going to go after the American companies and we'll see a level playing field and new European innovation will come.\" That hasn't happened. A year later, American companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, they have more market share today than they did a year ago because the cost of the GDPR, it's several million dollars to upgrade the systems, to hire all the people to do all the reporting and so on. So small competitors, small advertising competitors have exited the market. They have closed down. They've stopped serving the EU. To put in perspective, 1000 media from the United States, they no longer serve European Union. From my desk in Copenhagen, I cannot get the Chicago Tribune.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>They decided they're not going to make their site available in Europe because the regulations are so onerous. Now if you tried to do that in America would it violate our first amendment, free speech where the government is essentially regulating speech. So this is really what the lesson is is that you have to be careful with the regulations you adopt because you end up rewarding the largest players. So for example, Microsoft, they're around the world saying, \"Oh we have to make GDPR everywhere.\" Well of course because they're already compliant and they don't want a new software company to challenge them on that because they have the market position.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>And I want to talk a little bit just about our elected officials that have to make decisions on this. I find that whether somebody is Republican or Democrat, they're looking at big tech and trying to figure out what is the solution and what do we do about some of these issues that we're coming across. And I'm curious from you as somebody who's testified on the hill, both in the House and the Senate, what has it been like educating members of Congress on the issues of big tech? Like you were saying, it's such a complex issue, and they're being approached with different ideas on how to deal with it. Are they really taking the time to research this as much as possible? And of course they have different expertise, different members of Congress, but I just find in some ways it's kind of ironic that members of government are making these decisions when it's very much outside of most of their wheel of expertise. It's very different than traditional policies that they're used to.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Yeah. Well that's a great point, Beverly. Well first of all I'd say is the media will definitely like to highlight the conflicts in Congress between the parties and of course that's part of their shtick to do that. But personally I find it very gratifying to work on this issue because there's a lot of bipartisanship. And just given that privacy is something everybody cares about, they understand what's at stake. And I'm very heartened because I think honestly all of the testimony that I've prepared, the representatives and senators, they have asked extremely insightful questions and their staff people, they're very knowledgeable. They asked very good questions. And personally I'm okay that they have been deliberant about it. And in fact, I find it's the most encouraging thing of everything. And I'm much more encouraged by Congress than the AGs, for example, because they are more measured in what they look at and they know what's at stake.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>I think that it's surprised a lot of people that the GDPR has not been this Nirvana that they expected and they're very concerned if they adopt regulation, it's going to hurt small business. We have literally millions of small startups in the United States. Last year, 40,000 new internet startups going and then just add that over the two decades that we've had, so they're very concerned about what they adopt. Now, that being said, and you would know this, Beverly, is there's a lot of cowboy ... I don't know what you'd call them, renegades in California who somehow they want to do their own kind of GDPR and they've passed a law, it would be coming in place in January and that is very destructive. It is. It's essentially a grab bag. It came together in a week and now we really have to do something because California being a large state and so many American companies are selling into California, that it can in many ways set the tone for the whole country.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>So it's really important that Congress does kind of bring the country back to its senses and look at and make the proper framework for internet what you would call information privacy. Because if we don't want to go with what California is doing, it is disastrous. Already the minimum cost to comply with the whole laundry list of what the California legislature wants, it's a minimum of $100,000. And that's more than companies will spend on the entire IT budget. So many of us are very concerned about California, especially because of what we've seen in Europe and so we don't want that to happen to the rest of the internet economy. So it is a big deal.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>And so when you talk about internet privacy, so this angle, is there something that we need to change legislatively to ensure that that remains or would it just be keeping status quo? So just kind of finally in wrapping up, what should we be looking towards Congress? What should they be doing or not doing as a whole?</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>Right. Well, the most important thing is Congress can preempt California. So it can create a national law, which it should because it's interstate commerce, that the California ... it will preempt what California is trying to do. And as you know, we have certain areas of our constitution where we have a federal policy that will supersede the state policy. So that's very important so that we don't destroy the internet economy for the rest of America. That is one area. But the other thing is we have an excellent organization called the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, and the actual technology of privacy is codified in certified standards.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>There are actually standards that are written down that are ... what would you say, official or certified by different standards organizations, American Institute of Standards and so on, Global One, American One, and we can be able to say to the various companies that you can choose your standards and then we'll give you a safe harbor to transition to them and that you can disclose which standards that you use so that people will know. And then we can be able to have an internet economy that works with a set of standards that have been agreed to that are disclosed.</p><p>Roslyn Layton:</p><p>If you violate the standard, it's very clear, the standard is written. And that is a much better way for the companies to, where any organization can figure out which amount of risk that they want to take for the users to decide and that would be a great direction to go.</p><p>Beverly H.:</p><p>Well Roslyn, I always appreciate chatting with you because I personally learned so much. So thank you. I'm sure if it's helpful to all of those who are listening and for joining us when it's really late in Copenhagen. So I appreciate you taking the call.

Should investors be worried? Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones certainly thinks so, recently warning that the S&amp;P 500 would sink 25 per cent if Warren wins the 2020 election. Veteran money manager Mark Mobius agrees, saying a 20 or 25 per cent market fall is \"probably possible\" if Warren defeats Donald Trump next year. Billionaire investor Ron Baron, a lifelong Democrat, isn't a fan, describing Warren's proposed wealth tax as \"pretty nuts\". </p><h>Cooperman complains </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strongest words, however, have come from billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman. \"This is the f**king American dream she is s***ting on\", complained Cooperman, who has warned that the US market would drop 25 per cent if Warren is elected president and who recently outlined his many reservations in a five-page letter to the Massachusetts senator.</p><h>Wall Street is increasingly preparing for the prospect of a Warren presidency. A recent Evercore ISI survey of investors found 70 per cent believe she will win the Democrat party's nomination for president. Bookmakers agree, making Warren the favourite to win the nomination. </h><p>Right now, the Democrats are also odds-on with the bookies to win next November's presidential election. With the Iowa caucuses less than three months away, Warren's progress has the potential to move markets sooner rather than later. Indeed, some say echoes are already being felt, with Oppenheimer last month describing the underperformance in bank stocks as the \"Warren correction\".</p><p>Markets will start to price in a Warren presidency long before next year's election, reckons high-profile hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, who predicts stocks will suffer falls of 10 to 15 per cent if she becomes the Democrat nominee. Antipathy from the tiny billionaire class is hardly unexpected, of course, given that Warren has proposed a wealth tax of 3 to 6 per cent on households with a net worth of over $1 billion. That said, Warren hasn't sought to downplay suggestions that the broader financial class ought to fear her presidency. </p><p>In September, CNBC TV personality Jim Cramer said he was hearing the phrase \"she's got to be stopped\" from fearful bank executives, which prompted Warrren to retweet the CNBC story, adding: \"I'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message.\" Her policies offer Democrat primary voters \"a menu as ambitious as anything seen since FDR's New Deal\", the Economist observed recently, describing them as a \"fundamental reworking of American capitalism\".</p><p>The financial sector has long been targeted by Warren, who has proposed tougher regulation and breaking up America's biggest banks; a financial transaction tax; changing the taxation treatment of investment gains for the top 1 per cent of households; and stopping \"legalised looting\" in the private equity sector and putting them \"on the hook for the debts of companies they buy\". Big tech, too, is nervous. Warren has promised \"big, structural changes\" to promote more competition, including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google. </p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbeg has described her antitrust proposal as an \"existential\" threat and said it would \"suck for us\". Analysts warn that healthcare companies are under threat from her $20 trillion Medicare-for-all plan, while it's also clear that she's \"not going to be friendly to the energy industry\", notes Jefferies strategist David Zervos.</p><p>There is, says Zervos, \"a general perception that it would be a significant equity market correction if she were to win\". That's borne out by an RBC Capital Markets survey showing that 89 per cent believe electing a Democrat other than the centrist Joe Biden would be bearish or very bearish for US stocks. </p><p>It's \"very reasonable\" to assume that the enactment of Warren's policies would be \"negative for the stock market in the extreme\", according to Sevens Report Research. While her policies would \"likely improve quality of life for many demographics\", they would do so at the expense of corporate profits and hurt earnings \"universally\". Other strategists focus more on individual sectors, Bank of America cautioning that healthcare, technology, financials and energy are \"most exposed to expected regulatory pressure under her presidency\". However, some strategists see the concern as overblown. RBC says markets may be more volatile next year due to Warren-related angst, but any pain is likely to be \"temporary\". That's echoed by David Zervos, who sees her agendas as similar to Barack Obama's in 2007. Stocks went on to enjoy excellent returns during the Obama presidency and, while Zervos cautions that some sectors may be affected by Warren's policies, he says her presidency is unlikely to be a significant negative for the overall market. </p><p>Some strategists expect Warren to pivot to the centre in the event that she becomes the nominee, whilst others say that, in any event, she faces a battle in enacting her more radical proposals, particularly if the Republicans retain control of the US Senate.</p><p>Of course, forecasting such matters is an inherently tricky business. Stocks have rallied under Donald Trump and many investors are now keen on his re-election, but Trump was widely seen as a major negative for markets prior to his 2016 election victory. </p><p>Barclays, RBC Capital Markets and Bridgewater, the world's biggest hedge fund, all warned of double-digit percentage losses in the event of a Trump victory, while billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer said Trump's trade policies would be \"close to a guarantee\" of a global depression. </p><p>Initially, markets appeared equally wary of Trump. One study, \"What do financial markets think of the 2016 election?\", examined market movements in the run-up to the election and concluded stocks were likely to fall 10 to 15 per cent if Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Markets abruptly changed their mind on Trump within hours of his victory and the narrative suddenly shifted, with commentators prognosticating as to which stocks and sectors were most likely to benefit under the new administration.</p><p>However, the forecasters were wrong-footed again; in both 2017 and 2018, an index of companies attacked by Trump \"blew away\" those he favoured, noted money manager and Bloomberg columnist Barry Ritholtz. </p><h>Correlation is not causation </h><p>As a general rule, strategists tend to see Republican policies as more market-friendly but stocks have actually fared much better under Democrat administrations over the last century. That said, correlation is not causation, and much research suggests a president's long-term impact upon stock returns tends to be minimal. </p><p>This also appears to be the case outside the US, with one major study of 24 stock markets under 173 different governments concluding that \"investment strategies based on the political orientation of countries' leadership are likely to be futile\". Markets don't like uncertainty so stocks may well be about to become more volatile, but forecasting market responses to political developments isn't easy. That point was made by Vanguard the day after Trump's election victory in November 2016, when it advised investors to \"not subject themselves to the political whims of the moment\" - good advice that may be worth remembering as election fever mounts in 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4087450</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ2-YXT1-DYS1-03Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1247\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

In the 1990s he was the wunderkind sidekick to the imperial Sandy Weill, then boss of Citigroup, the world's pre-eminent bank. Still, while some peers described Mr Dimon as brilliant, charismatic, caring and dedicated, others complained he was abrasive, foul-mouthed and unpredictable. Plenty doubted he was well suited to such a large stage. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we explain this week (see Briefing), Mr Dimon has put paid to these doubters. JPMorgan weathered the financial crisis well and has since become the bank that all the others want to emulate. It is big, globally active, dominant in retail and investment banking, transparent, well capitalised and admirably profitable. Last year its return on equity was a handsome 15%. Its annual profits are now double the entire current market value of Deutsche Bank, once Europe's pretender to the global investment-banking throne.</p><p>However, another big question has remained unanswered: when Mr Dimon should leave and who will run the bank after he is gone. It has been cast in sharp relief by the recent news that Mr Dimon has undergone emergency surgery for an \"aortic dissection\", a rare heart condition. The bank says he is recovering well. But investors, the board, staff and regulators have had a reminder that one day JPMorgan will have to have a different leader.</p><p>Wall Street's biggest succession decision is tricky for several reasons. JPMorgan could benchmark itself against other banks: in 2018 the head of Goldman Sachs retired and a flurry of European banks have waved goodbye to their leaders in the past few months. But in all these cases the firms were performing below their potential. Aged 63, Mr Dimon is no geriatric\u201477 CEOs who are older than him are serving at firms in the S&amp;P 500 index of America's biggest companies. The most seasoned, Warren Buffett, is still, inadvisedly, clinging on at the age of 89.</p><p>Mr Dimon has served for longer than the typical American CEO, who lasts about a decade. Bob Iger, the boss of Disney, has just stood down after 15 years at the top. But tenure is not, in and of itself, a disqualification. There are 66 S&amp;P 500 CEOs who have been in place longer than Mr Dimon. Reed Hastings has run Netflix for over two decades and few reckon he should press stop. </p><p>So how to make a decision? Two tests matter. The first is that Mr Dimon is not blocking the path of an entire generation of successors who might end up leaving or becoming disillusioned. Inevitably, one cohort has already departed. A JPMorgan diaspora now run financial firms all over the world, including Wells Fargo, Barclays and Standard Chartered. It would be a mistake to let another generation go, too. Mr Dimon has two co-presidents directly beneath him who are both aged about 60. Beneath them is a broader group of half-a-dozen potential successors, most of whom are in their 50s and still being battle-hardened.</p><p>The second test is the likely time horizon of the strategic threats and opportunities that the bank faces. These mainly arise from technology\u2014the prospect that big tech firms might challenge the big banks, or that new payments firms win huge customer bases independently of the banks, as they already have in China, or that new digital currencies take the world by storm. These trends will play out over a decade or more\u2014and no one, not even Mr Dimon, thinks that he will stay that long. </p><p>Both tests suggest that Mr Dimon should leave the stage sooner rather than later. A good option would be for him to do so at the end of next year. By then the next generation of executives will have acquired the experience necessary to run the Western world's biggest bank at a time of technological tumult, while not being so frustrated that they quit. Even if JPMorgan and Mr Dimon follow this advice, they and the shareholders should reflect on another succession. March 2nd saw the death of Jack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric (GE), and perhaps the most celebrated American boss of recent decades. He retired from GE in 2001 on a high, but the firm soon slipped into brutal decline, reflecting in part long-standing problems that became clear only once he had left. The best bosses face up to the reality that at some point someone else has to be in charge. But even then their legacy can only be assessed years after they have thanked their team, shed a tear and walked out the door with their head held high. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-V38FBLR</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDG-BM71-DY2R-201D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) discussed breaking up big tech companies, accusing them of stealing revenue from content creators like book authors, comedians, musicians and newspapers.</p><p>\"We must help America's content creators -- from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians -- keep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook,\" Warren wrote.</p><p>The idea that tech companies like Facebook and Google are primarily responsible for putting newspapers, musicians and other artists out of business (or at least not compensating them fairly) is not new: it's the basis for the European Union's controversial updated Copyright Directive (specifically Articles 11 and 13), and Amazon is infamous for ripping off burgeoning writers who sell their books on the Amazon platform.</p><p>On Monday, more than 200 European organizations representing artists, authors and other creators sent a letter to the EU demanding the ratification of the updated Copyright Directive, which would force tech companies to pay newspapers, producers and publishers for linking to their work as well as regularly scan for content that infringes copyright.</p><p>\"This Directive has been long sought to create a much-needed level playing field for all actors of the creative sector in the European Digital Single Market, whilst giving citizens better access to a wider array of content,\" they wrote.</p><p>But is the lack of compensation for content creators all Big Tech's fault?</p><p>Aram Sinnreich, chair of communication studies at American University, said the entire entertainment supply chain is stacked against the artists, so the idea that Facebook and Google are solely responsible for their compensation is misguided.</p><p>Streaming services like Spotify can rip off music artists just like Facebook and Google can rip off newspapers and Amazon can rip off book authors, but the bigger culprits are the publishers, record labels and film production companies, all of which Sinnreich said are \"too consolidated.\"</p><p>\"The industries that are promoting that rhetoric are themselves routinely exploiting and defrauding creative labor,\" he told InsideSources.</p><p>Monday's letter to the EU, for example, is signed by mainly publishers and producers. In other words, the EU Copyright Directive is a fight over two different industries for a bigger cut of a pie that likely won't go to the content creators.</p><p>At the same time, if Big Tech pays the publishers and producers for linking to and providing samples and clips of creative content, publishers and producers may give more to the artists they represent. If newspapers make more money, they can pay journalists more, as can record labels and publishing houses.</p><p>\"[Tech] platforms have become an integral link the supply chain that wasn't there 20 years ago,\" Sinnreich said.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Regulators and programme makers are at odds over whether small children should be banned from watching television or using tablets and smartphones.France urges parents not to allow children under three to watch TV, and American paediatricians also favour a total ban on screen time until at least 18 months.Carole Bienaime-Besse, who sits on France's TV regulator, the CSA, claimed Sunday that overexposing babies and small children to digital devices has become a \"public health issue\". \"People are realising that screens can cause addiction even among very small children, and in extreme cases autistic problems, what is called virtual autism,\" she said. \"Silicon Valley also knows this. </p><p>There are lots of educational apps for babies, but in the end the results are counterproductive,\" Bienaime-Besse told AFP.Studies show that \"children over-exposed to them are the ones who find it hardest at school,\" she said.France banned its broadcasters from targetting under-threes in 2008, and blocked Fox-owned BabyTV from launching there.But some programme makers insist that bans do not work, especially with so many parents using television and devices to \"babysit\" their children.- 'Digital wild, Wild West' -\"It is admirable, but probably unrealistic\" to try to keep small children away from screens, said Alice Webb, who heads the BBC's children's arm, CBBC, and the CBeebies network for pre-school children. \"Those times are long gone. Digital is everywhere. This is a tide you cannot get ahead of,\" she told top TV executives Sunday at the MIPJunior gathering at Cannes on the French Riviera. That said, the British public broadcaster is so worried about the digital \"wild, Wild West\" children are growing up in that it is holding a global summit in December to try to put heads together on how they might be better served and protected.\"We need to have this conversation now because we don't want to be saying to ourselves in 10 years time, 'What did we do to our children?'\" Webb told AFP.She said the BBC aimed CBeebies at children from two upwards, \"but we know children younger than that are watching. So we have to be realistic about this, and bear those children in mind\" knowing that the TV or a tablet may be their \"babysitter\".\"We have games and apps that are about helping children develop the cognitive skills that a two-year-old needs. This is about learning on screen and in the real world at the same time, it is not an either or and it's all about moderation,\" Webb argued.- Social media giants in denial -For older children, Webb said it was \"impossible to think we can control what goes online\". She said the only answer was to \"teach children what is and is not for them... how to develop critical thinking and how to cope when they see things they don't want.\"She said the BBC is setting up a new online resource called \"Own It\" to help children deal with the dangers and challenges of social media.While Instagram, Twitter and Facebook claim that only teenagers over 13 are allowed onto their networks, Webb said that in the UK 75 percent of 10-year-olds and above are on social media.Despite what the social media giants say, \"statistics suggest otherwise and they are finding it harder to stand behind that line,\" Webb said.Bienaime-Besse said regulators need stronger powers so they can act against inappropriate online content in the same way as they do with traditional broadcasters.\"I think it is absurd that the likes of Facebook and Twitter are not regulated like other content suppliers.\"And she was sceptical that the industry would regulate itself when it came to younger children.However, \"if you go to Silicon Valley, all the big tech executives send their children to Montessori schools without screens and just blackboards.\"And Steve Jobs of Apple did not allow his children to use an iPad.\"Bienaime-Bess said parents had to wake up to \"what we are holding in our hands. A child who cannot defend themselves should be protected from the harm that these very useful tools can bring.\"Kids should become masters of technology by learning coding\" rather than being slaves to it, she said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIJO1009031508124444254251762100119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIJO-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PR5-VNM1-JCMN-Y36G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>3:27 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digital Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 16, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

(Reuters)<br/><br/>CANNES: Regulators and program makers are at odds over whether small children should be banned from watching television or using tablets and smartphones.  </p><p><br/>France urges parents not to allow children under three to watch TV, and American paediatricians also favor a total ban on screen time until at least 18 months.  <br/><br/>Carole Bienaime-Besse, who sits on France's TV regulator, the CSA, claimed Sunday that overexposing babies and small children to digital devices has become a \"public health issue.\"  <br/><br/>\"People are realizing that screens can cause addiction even among very small children, and in extreme cases autistic problems, what is called virtual autism,\" she said.  <br/><br/>\"Silicon Valley also knows this. There are lots of educational apps for babies, but in the end the results are counterproductive,\" Bienaime-Besse told AFP.  <br/>Studies show that \"children over-exposed to them are the ones who find it hardest at school,\" she said.  <br/><br/>France banned its broadcasters from targetting under-threes in 2008, and blocked Fox-owned BabyTV from launching there.  <br/><br/>But some program makers insist that bans do not work, especially with so many parents using television and devices to \"babysit\" their children.  <br/><br/>\"It is admirable, but probably unrealistic\" to try to keep small children away from screens, said Alice Webb, who heads the BBC's children's arm, CBBC, and the CBeebies network for pre-school children.  <br/><br/>\"Those times are long gone. Digital is everywhere. This is a tide you cannot get ahead of,\" she told top TV executives Sunday at the MIPJunior gathering at Cannes on the French Riviera.  <br/><br/>That said, the British public broadcaster is so worried about the digital \"wild, Wild West\" children are growing up in that it is holding a global summit in December to try to put heads together on how they might be better served and protected.  <br/><br/>\"We need to have this conversation now because we don't want to be saying to ourselves in 10 years time, 'What did we do to our children?'\" Webb told AFP.  <br/><br/>She said the BBC aimed CBeebies at children from two upwards, \"but we know children younger than that are watching. So we have to be realistic about this, and bear those children in mind\" knowing that the TV or a tablet may be their \"babysitter.\"<br/><br/><br/>\"We have games and apps that are about helping children develop the cognitive skills that a two-year-old needs. This is about learning on screen and in the real world at the same time, it is not an either or and it's all about moderation,\" Webb argued.  <br/><br/>For older children, Webb said it was \"impossible to think we can control what goes online.\"  <br/><br/>She said the only answer was to \"teach children what is and is not for them... how to develop critical thinking and how to cope when they see things they don't want.\"  <br/><br/>She said the BBC is setting up a new online resource called \"Own It\" to help children deal with the dangers and challenges of social media.  <br/><br/>While Instagram, Twitter and Facebook claim that only teenagers over 13 are allowed onto their networks, Webb said that in the UK 75 percent of 10-year-olds and above are on social media.  <br/><br/>Despite what the social media giants say, \"statistics suggest otherwise and they are finding it harder to stand behind that line,\" Webb said.  <br/><br/>Bienaime-Besse said regulators need stronger powers so they can act against inappropriate online content in the same way as they do with traditional broadcasters.  <br/><br/>\"I think it is absurd that the likes of Facebook and Twitter are not regulated like other content suppliers.\"  <br/><br/>And she was skeptical that the industry would regulate itself when it came to younger children.  <br/><br/>However, \"if you go to Silicon Valley, all the big tech executives send their children to Montessori schools without screens and just blackboards.  <br/><br/>\"And Steve Jobs of Apple did not allow his children to use an iPad.\"  <br/><br/>Bienaime-Bess said parents had to wake up to \"what we are holding in our hands. A child who cannot defend themselves should be protected from the harm that these very useful tools can bring.  <br/><br/>\"Kids should become masters of technology by learning coding\" rather than being slaves to it, she said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/91/150819311174.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/7/9/91/150819311174.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARBUNW-101676001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARBUNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PRB-RC81-F11P-X532-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343613</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Arab News - Saudi Research &amp; Publishing Co.

So we have to be realistic about this, and bear those children in mind\" knowing that the TV or a tablet may be their \"babysitter\".</p><p>\"We have games and apps that are about helping children develop the cognitive skills that a two-year-old needs.

Digital is everywhere. This is a tide you cannot get ahead of,\" she told top TV executives Sunday at the MIPJunior gathering at Cannes on the French Riviera. </p><p>That said, the British public broadcaster is so worried about the digital \"wild, Wild West\" children are growing up in that it is holding a global summit in December to try to put heads together on how they might be better served and protected.</p><p>\"We need to have this conversation now because we don't want to be saying to ourselves in 10 years time, 'What did we do to our children?'\" Webb told AFP.</p><p>She said the BBC aimed CBeebies at children from two upwards, \"but we know children younger than that are watching. So we have to be realistic about this, and bear those children in mind\" knowing that the TV or a tablet may be their \"babysitter\".</p><p>\"We have games and apps that are about helping children develop the cognitive skills that a two-year-old needs.

When you think about it, all of them are involved in so many things. They're not just one social network, or just an online retailer, a search engine, or a computer manufacturer.But do they have their hands into too many different factions?</p><p> Many people are pushing to have them broken up, and it's even begun a topic in the next United States presidential race. Should the big tech companies be broken up? Our Opinion Phil believes it depends on 'how they wield their power, for good or evil'. It becomes more philosophical than technical to him. While many of the companies are considered too big, they put all that back into their products and services, or in some cases they put the companies into politics to protect profits and growth.He believes if someone uses their wealth and power for the good of mankind, space exploration, electric cars, clean air, and water for all, giving away most of their wealth to good causes, then they can carry on. 'But if someone has an army of robot penguins ready to go at a moment's notice from their underground lair, they are probably up to no good.'Sayak thinks the big-tech breakup lobby in the U.S. is banking on historical antitrust precedents. He uses the example of the 1984 AT...reakup that benefited Apple and Microsoft as an example. Yet, in 2019, 'the Gang of Four is way too big and powerful to be broken up.' They are multinational companies in every sense of the word and don't depend on the U.S. consumer market alone, though it's still important. The moment someone brings antitrust legislation to the U.S., 'these big-tech companies will happily move their stock to some convenient banana republic. They know their loyal customers would never ditch them no matter what. He doesn't have a good solution but knows it needs to be relevant to this day and age.Andrew bases it on a consumer welfare argument, feeling it's hard to say since A) it depends on a counterfactual that the consumer would be better off if the companies were broken up and B) that the companies seem to be pretty good for consumers, providing awesome products at little to no upfront cost.But based on anti-competitiveness, there's a case. He believes 'Amazon especially has displayed its willingness to use its power to crush any possible competition, and Facebook and Google also don't seem keen on letting competitors invade their space.'The bottom line is he wouldn't say he's in favor of breaking up big tech, but he'd be in favor of trying to encourage a more competitive environment.Miguel is not in favor of breaking up big tech. 'In the long term, we should focus more on companies leveraging their ties to government to make it more difficult for competition to enter the market.' He sees that as a much larger issue.David isn't sure if breaking them up solves the bigger issue. He, too, looks at the AT...reakup that everyone thought would be the end of their reign, yet look at them now. He knows it might not be an apples-to-apples comparison, but he doesn't feel there's much reason to believe breaking up those companies truly serves the consumer. 'I'd rather see a focus on encouraging competition so one or two companies are not dominant.'Ryan believes the big tech companies should be broken up. 'Monopolies stagnate innovation and encourage predatory pricing.' He points to the people who only have one cable/Internet provider where they live. Customers don't have the option to shop around and are at the mercy of the giant corporations. He feels there needs to be more regulation involving the tech industry.I'm not sure if I'm a good person to answer this question, but I'll give it a go. For one, everyone keeps pointing at AT...but my husband is fourth-generation Ma Bell. Even though they are no longer the monopoly they once were, they continue to grow and dominate anyway and buy up all that competition. They launched the U-verse service in the U.S. introducing cable TV to their products, then bought out its biggest satellite competitor in DirectTV. They also acquired one of the biggest media companies in Time/Warner. Did it really serve a purpose to break them up? Your Opinion Where do you stand on this issue? Do you agree with some above that it doesn't really solve the issue anyway? Or do you just frown overall on monopolies? Should the big tech companies be broken up?

These days most consumers get most of their bulletins online. Since online publishing is cheap, a profusion of new sources have sprung up. Websites run by established newspapers compete with newer, online-only outlets and professional (or amateur) blogs, not to mention the mix of articles, digital chain-letters and comments curated by the algorithms of social-media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. </p><p>Established media have struggled. Much of the advertising that used to pay journalists' salaries has gone to Facebook and Google, the two big technology firms that dominate the market for online advertising. Print circulation has collapsed. Local papers have been particularly hard hit, with many going bust. Social-media algorithms prioritise attention-grabbing clickbait over boring truth, which helps propel nonsense around the world. Collins, a dictionary-publisher, declared \"fake news\" its 2017 neologism of the year. </p><p>In 2018 the government asked Dame Frances Cairncross, an economist (and former journalist on this newspaper) to ponder what, if anything, it should do about all this. On February 12th her report was published. It mostly rejects the idea that journalism deserves a bail-out. </p><p>Mostly, but not entirely. Dame Frances argues that public-interest journalism is undersupplied by the market, and that the government should support it via tax breaks or direct funding. Two types of journalism in particular deserve support. One is that which investigates corruption and the abuse of power. Despite its cachet, such work is expensive, difficult and\u2014from a commercial point of view\u2014generally not worth it. The other is the sort of thing local newspapers used to provide: writing up planning meetings, trials in local courts and the like. It is hard to imagine any news less likely to go viral. Yet the report cites research suggesting that a lack of it undermines voter turnout and civic engagement. </p><p>The most eye-catching recommendation, though, is that online platforms such as Google and Facebook be given a \"news quality obligation\", backed by a regulator, requiring them to promote only news from reliable outlets. \"This is really unprecedented,\" reckons Rasmus Nielsen of the Reuters Institute at the University of Oxford (which is funded partly by the press and big tech firms). \"I can't think of another democracy in which there is a call for regulatory oversight of what constitutes 'quality' in the news.\"</p><p>But it fits with growing worries that the ability of a small number of technology firms to amplify and disseminate news may be unhealthy. Politicians have called for the likes of Google to censor everything from fake news stories to articles about suicide and self-harm.</p><p>Resistant at first, firms are trying to comply. But they are walking into a minefield. The smartphone version of Edge, Microsoft's web browser, for instance, now warns users about sites it deems untrustworthy. In January it flagged MailOnline, the widely read website of the pearl-clutching Daily Mail, for \"generally [failing] to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability\". After the Mail complained, the warning was removed.</p><p>Having governments rate the media would be an awkward policy for a liberal democracy. But the report argues that the alternative\u2014leaving it to the judgment of private companies\u2014is even worse. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-4A7PVKQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDW-Y341-JBKN-B00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Maybe 'no carrot, all stick'? Actually, he instead uses the much nicer phrase 'leverage to persuade platforms to accept a range of new responsibilities.'

Maybe if you cut a big enough check every month, we could make sure it stays nice and secure.For those unfamiliar, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996[2] is the bedrock law that allowed for the evolution of the digital world we know today, for better and for worse \u2014 the 'twenty-six words that created the internet[3].' It says that, when it comes to legal liability, websites should be treated more like newsstands than like publishers. In the print world, if the Daily Gazette prints something libelous about someone, that person can sue the newspaper. But they generally can't sue the Barnes &amp;#38; Noble where copies of the Gazette were being sold. The thinking is that if you made a newsstand legally liable for the content of every single newspaper and magazine and book it sellsthat'd be a pretty strong incentive to get out of the newsstand business. And even if a newsstand stayed open, it would likely become more boring, culling the publications it carries to a few middle-of-the-road options in order to limit its liability. Section 230 says[4] that an 'interactive computer service' would not be 'treated as the publisher or speaker of any information' that is provided by a third party \u2014 like one of its users posting a comment or sharing a link. So if you post defamatory material about your neighbor on Facebook, you are legally liable for it \u2014 but Facebook isn't. And indeed, it would be hard for Facebook, Twitter, Google, or any other sort of digital service provider to exist in their current forms without Section 230. If they were all legally responsible for everything on their platforms, it'd be hard to imagine they'd let random users publish on them. Section 230 also allows sites to moderate legal content without (generally) being open to litigation. In America, it's perfectly legal to be a Nazi and to say pro-Nazi things \u2014 but if YouTube removes a pro-Nazi video, the Nazi can't sue claiming his First Amendment rights have been violated.  There has been a lot of political hubbub about Section 230 of late; both Donald Trump and Joe Biden say[5] they want to revoke it. Trump sees it as protecting dastardly social media companies that target conservatives and try to fact-check his tweets. Biden see it as protecting dastardly social media companies that amplify Trump's falsehoods and extremist content.Into this debate comes this new paper[6], by former Businessweek journalist Paul Barrett[7], now deputy director of NYU Stern's Center for Business and Human Rights[8]. It's titled 'Regulating Social Media: The Fight Over Section 230 \u2014 and Beyond.' It's a good and valuable contribution, with excellent background summaries of various points of view and filled with good ideasand one not-as-good one I'm going to complain about for a bit. Barrett argues for a three-step approach:1. Keep Section 230The law has helped online platforms thrive by protecting them from most liability related to third-party posts and by encouraging active content moderation. It has been especially valuable to smaller platforms with modest legal budgets. But the benefit Section 230 confers ought to come with a price tag: the assumption of greater responsibility for curbing harmful content. 2. Improve Section 230 The measure should be amended so that its liability shield provides leverage to persuade platforms to accept a range of new responsibilities related to policing content. Internet companies may reject these responsibilities, but in doing so they would forfeit Section 230's protection, open themselves to costly litigation, and risk widespread opprobrium. 3. Create a Digital Regulatory Agency There's a crisis of trust in the major platforms' ability and willingness to superintend their sites. Creation of a new independent digital oversight authority should be part of the response. While avoiding direct involvement in decisions about content, the agency would enforce the responsibilities required by a revised Section 230. So the threat of opening up massive legal liability should be used as 'leverage to persuade platforms to accept a range of new responsibilities related to policing content' \u2014 to turn it into 'a quid pro quo benefit.' What could those responsibilities be? The paper offers a few ideas (emphases mine).One, which has been considered in the U.K. as part of that country's debate over proposed online-harm legislation, would 'require platform companies to ensure that their algorithms do not skew toward extreme and unreliable material to boost user engagement.'Under a second, platforms would disclose data on what content is being promoted and to whom, on the process and policies of content moderation, and on advertising practices. Platforms also could be obliged to devote a small percentage of their annual revenue to a fund supporting the struggling field of accountability journalism. This last notion would constitute a partial pay-back for the fortune in advertising dollars the social media industry has diverted from traditional news media.I like the idea of the tech giants giving money to journalism as much as anyone. And I have no particular objection to items 1 and 3 on the paper's to-do list. But I have to say No. 2 \u2014 making liability protection contingent on accepting other, sometimes only tangentially related policy proposals \u2014 bugs me. A few reasons:Any of these ideas could become law without getting Section 230 involved. If Congress wants to tax Facebook and Google and use the proceeds to fund journalism, it canjust do that. If it believes requiring disclosure of algorithms and transparency in moderation policies are good ideas, it can pass laws to do so. If a company refuses, fine them or sue them to make them change. There's no need to tie even the most sensible or well-intended regulations to the legal protection that has basically allowed the Internet to exist.Speaking of which Section 230 protects every website, not just Facebook and other giants. Every blog, every personal website, every online forum, every chat app, every app where people review restaurants or books or gadgets \u2014 they're all able to function the way they do because of 230, which regulates 'interactive computer services,' not just giant social media companies.Why can news sites publish reader comments? Because of Section 230. Imagine if your favorite news outlet was suddenly liable for potentially massive damages because some rando posted 'John Q. Doe is a child molester!' under one of its stories. What would an outlet in that situation likely do? Kill off the comments or any other kind of public input that increases liability. Which is why Incentivizing regulation-via-lawsuit is a bad way to encourage good behavior. We've already seen, with cases like Peter Thiel killing Gawker[9] and an Idaho billionaire targeting Mother Jones[10], that litigation is a powerful tool for the uber-rich to go after news sources they don't like. Even if the suits don't have merit, they can easily soak millions of dollars out of news companies with thin margins. Removing Section 230 protections would mean, for example, that a politician could sue a local gadfly blogger over a comment getting moderated or not.In other words A policy like this favors incumbents and the powerful. Facebook and Google have the profits to be able to deal with lawsuits. But if you're a small upstart hoping to become the next big thing? Good luck paying lawyers the first time someone uploads a libelous twizzle or a faceplurp or a snapdat or whatever you call it. And frankly, different parts of the Internet should have different ideas about what content is allowable. What counts as 'extreme' content on Facebook might not be what counts as 'extreme' content on a niche forum.And finally Do you trust the government to get content moderation right \u2014 when the potential penalties for getting it wrong are so huge? Let's say Congress passes a law saying that, in order to retain their legal protections, websites must 'ensure that their algorithms do not skew toward extreme and unreliable material.' Okay \u2014 that would require a definition of 'extreme and unreliable materials.' Whatever that definition is, it will mark a universe of acceptable speech that is smaller than what the First Amendment allows. And whatever that definition is, it will be up to the executive branch \u2014 whether via a new regulatory agency, the Department of Justice, or some other entity \u2014 to do rule-making around it and to enforce it.To be blunt: Would you trust the Trump administration to use that power well? This is a president who, just a few months ago, signed an executive order[11] declaring it unacceptable that a Democratic congressman's tweet 'peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax' was allowed. The order didn't do much, practically speaking, because an executive order can't cancel Section 230. But if whether or not Twitter had legal protections was based on an administration determination that it was not promoting 'extreme and unreliable materials,' the scenario is very different. Literally just yesterday, Trump said Twitter should not be allowed to keep up an obviously photoshopped meme of Mitch McConnell and that 'Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!'Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you! @HawleyMO[12] @MarshaBlackburn[13] <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co\">https://t.co</url> /ah0nMeQdM0[14] \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 8, 2020[15]  Are you really confident that a Trump appointee wouldn't read a POTUS tweet one day and then decide that allowing a #blacklivesmatter hashtag to trend is 'promoting extreme content'? The experience of the past four years has not made me eager to get the government involved in defining and regulating political speech. Barrett's paper acknowledges many of these problems. Here's how it described a hypothetical world where Section 230 has been repealed: If Section 230 were swept away tomorrow, the internet would change, and on the whole, not for the better. It would slow down drastically, as platforms, websites, and blogs looked more skeptically at content posted by users, blocking more of it. Pointed political debate might get removed. Threats of litigation against internet companies would become more common, as would take-down demands, more of which would be successful, as nervous platforms and sites tried to avoid lawsuits. The internet could become a 'closed, one-way street that looks more like a broadcaster or newspaper and less like the internet we know today,' writes Jeff Kosseff in his book, The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet. To be fair, in a hypothetical post-Section 230 world, some people making take-down requests targeting such harmful content as bullying or defamation would be justified, as some are today. But others would try to silence corporate whistleblowers or activists seeking to build the next #MeToo or #BlackLivesMatter movement\u2014and these efforts at squelching valuable speech would be more likely to succeed. Silicon Valley analyst Anna Wiener depicts an internet that, above all, would be thoroughly bland: 'Social-media startups might fade away, along with niche political sites, birding message boards, classifieds, restaurant reviews, support-group forums, and comments sections. In their place would be a desiccated, sanitized, corporate Internet \u2014 less like an electronic frontier than a well-patrolled office park.' I think that's a bad world. Barrett's paper uses this vision to support Section 230's continued existence. But then it advocates making Section 230 exist only for some companies and not for others, for some websites and not for others \u2014 all contingent on things like whether the government thinks you're limiting 'extreme' content in the way it would like or whether you've paid enough into a journalism fund. If you like those ideas, make them into laws. Don't turn them into an obstacle course that everyone who puts content online must navigate in order to save us from that office-park Internet. Because while Trump and Biden view Section 230 as a special gift to a few trillion-dollar companies, it's actually a gift to all of us who want a free and open and vibrant Internet. Facebook can still make plenty of money on a 'desiccated, sanitized, corporate Internet' \u2014 but we'd be worse off with one. The tech giants need greater regulation on a host of issues. But Section 230 has become a political football for all the wrong reasons. Don't hold the legal heart of the open web hostage in the process.Photo  by Cole Wyland[16].

Maybe \u201cno carrot, all stick\u201d? Actually, he instead uses the much nicer phrase \u201cleverage to persuade platforms to accept a range of new responsibilities.\u201d But either way, the pitch is pretty similar:    Hey, tech companies \u2014 that\u2019s a nice bit of protection from legal liability you\u2019ve got there. It would be a real shame if anything were to happen to it. Maybe if you cut a big enough check every month, we could make sure it stays nice and secure.       For those unfamiliar, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 is the bedrock law that allowed for the evolution of the digital world we know today, for better and for worse \u2014 the \u201c twenty-six words that created the internet .\u201d It says that, when it comes to legal liability, websites should be treated more like newsstands than like publishers .    In the print world, if the Daily Gazette prints something libelous about someone, that person can sue the newspaper. But they generally can\u2019t sue the Barnes &amp; Noble where copies of the Gazette were being sold. The thinking is that if you made a newsstand legally liable for the content of every single newspaper and magazine and book it sells\u2026that\u2019d be a pretty strong incentive to get out of the newsstand business. And even if a newsstand stayed open, it would likely become more boring, culling the publications it carries to a few middle-of-the-road options in order to limit its liability.    Section 230 says that an \u201cinteractive computer service\u201d would not be \u201ctreated as the publisher or speaker of any information\u201d that is provided by a third party \u2014 like one of its users posting a comment or sharing a link. So if you post defamatory material about your neighbor on Facebook, you are legally liable for it \u2014 but Facebook isn\u2019t. And indeed, it would be hard for Facebook, Twitter, Google, or any other sort of digital service provider to exist in their current forms without Section 230. If they were all legally responsible for everything on their platforms, it\u2019d be hard to imagine they\u2019d let random users publish on them.    Section 230 also allows sites to moderate legal content without (generally) being open to litigation. In America, it\u2019s perfectly legal to be a Nazi and to say pro-Nazi things \u2014 but if YouTube removes a pro-Nazi video, the Nazi can\u2019t sue claiming his First Amendment rights have been violated.    There has been a lot of political hubbub about Section 230 of late; both Donald Trump and Joe Biden say they want to revoke it. Trump sees it as protecting dastardly social media companies that target conservatives and try to fact-check his tweets. Biden see it as protecting dastardly social media companies that amplify Trump\u2019s falsehoods and extremist content.       Into this debate comes this new paper , by former Businessweek journalist Paul Barrett , now deputy director of NYU Stern\u2019s Center for Business and Human Rights . It\u2019s titled \u201cRegulating Social Media: The Fight Over Section 230 \u2014 and Beyond.\u201d It\u2019s a good and valuable contribution, with excellent background summaries of various points of view and filled with good ideas\u2026and one not-as-good one I\u2019m going to complain about for a bit.    Barrett argues for a three-step approach:    1. Keep Section 230    The law has helped online platforms thrive by protecting them from most liability related to third-party posts and by encouraging active content moderation. It has been especially valuable to smaller platforms with modest legal budgets. But the benefit Section 230 confers ought to come with a price tag: the assumption of greater responsibility for curbing harmful content.    2. Improve Section 230    The measure should be amended so that its liability shield provides leverage to persuade platforms to accept a range of new responsibilities related to policing content. Internet companies may reject these responsibilities, but in doing so they would forfeit Section 230\u2019s protection, open themselves to costly litigation, and risk widespread opprobrium.    3. Create a Digital Regulatory Agency    There\u2019s a crisis of trust in the major platforms\u2019 ability and willingness to superintend their sites. Creation of a new independent digital oversight authority should be part of the response. While avoiding direct involvement in decisions about content, the agency would enforce the responsibilities required by a revised Section 230.    So the threat of opening up massive legal liability should be used as \u201cleverage to persuade platforms to accept a range of new responsibilities related to policing content\u201d \u2014 to turn it into \u201ca quid pro quo benefit.\u201d What could those responsibilities be? The paper offers a few ideas (emphases mine).    One, which has been considered in the U.K. as part of that country\u2019s debate over proposed online-harm legislation, would \u201crequire platform companies to ensure that their algorithms do not skew toward extreme and unreliable material to boost user engagement.\u201d    Under a second, platforms would disclose data on what content is being promoted and to whom, on the process and policies of content moderation, and on advertising practices .    Platforms also could be obliged to devote a small percentage of their annual revenue to a fund supporting the struggling field of accountability journalism . This last notion would constitute a partial pay-back for the fortune in advertising dollars the social media industry has diverted from traditional news media.       I like the idea of the tech giants giving money to journalism as much as anyone. And I have no particular objection to items 1 and 3 on the paper\u2019s to-do list. But I have to say No. 2 \u2014 making liability protection contingent on accepting other, sometimes only tangentially related policy proposals \u2014 bugs me. A few reasons:     Any of these ideas could become law without getting Section 230 involved. If Congress wants to tax Facebook and Google and use the proceeds to fund journalism, it can\u2026just do that. If it believes requiring disclosure of algorithms and transparency in moderation policies are good ideas, it can pass laws to do so. If a company refuses, fine them or sue them to make them change. There\u2019s no need to tie even the most sensible or well-intended regulations to the legal protection that has basically allowed the Internet to exist .    Speaking of which\u2026   Section 230 protects every website, not just Facebook and other giants. Every blog, every personal website, every online forum, every chat app, every app where people review restaurants or books or gadgets \u2014 they\u2019re all able to function the way they do because of 230, which regulates \u201cinteractive computer services,\u201d not just giant social media companies.    Why can news sites publish reader comments? Because of Section 230. Imagine if your favorite news outlet was suddenly liable for potentially massive damages because some rando posted \u201cJohn Q. Doe is a child molester!\u201d under one of its stories. What would an outlet in that situation likely do? Kill off the comments or any other kind of public input that increases liability.    Which is why\u2026   Incentivizing regulation-via-lawsuit is a bad way to encourage good behavior. We\u2019ve already seen, with cases like Peter Thiel killing Gawker and an Idaho billionaire targeting Mother Jones , that litigation is a powerful tool for the uber-rich to go after news sources they don\u2019t like. Even if the suits don\u2019t have merit, they can easily soak millions of dollars out of news companies with thin margins. Removing Section 230 protections would mean, for example, that a politician could sue a local gadfly blogger over a comment getting moderated or not.    In other words\u2026   A policy like this favors incumbents and the powerful. Facebook and Google have the profits to be able to deal with lawsuits. But if you\u2019re a small upstart hoping to become the next big thing? Good luck paying lawyers the first time someone uploads a libelous twizzle or a faceplurp or a snapdat or whatever you call it. And frankly, different parts of the Internet should have different ideas about what content is allowable. What counts as \u201cextreme\u201d content on Facebook might not be what counts as \u201cextreme\u201d content on a niche forum.    And finally\u2026   Do you trust the government to get content moderation right \u2014 when the potential penalties for getting it wrong are so huge? Let\u2019s say Congress passes a law saying that, in order to retain their legal protections, websites must \u201censure that their algorithms do not skew toward extreme and unreliable material.\u201d Okay \u2014 that would require a definition of \u201cextreme and unreliable materials.\u201d Whatever that definition is, it will mark a universe of acceptable speech that is smaller than what the First Amendment allows. And whatever that definition is, it will be up to the executive branch \u2014 whether via a new regulatory agency, the Department of Justice, or some other entity \u2014 to do rule-making around it and to enforce it.    To be blunt: Would you trust the Trump administration to use that power well? This is a president who, just a few months ago, signed an executive order declaring it unacceptable that a Democratic congressman\u2019s tweet \u201cpeddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax\u201d was allowed. The order didn\u2019t do much, practically speaking, because an executive order can\u2019t cancel Section 230. But if whether or not Twitter had legal protections was based on an administration determination that it was not promoting \u201cextreme and unreliable materials,\u201d the scenario is very different.    Literally just yesterday , Trump said Twitter should not be allowed to keep up an obviously photoshopped meme of Mitch McConnell and that \u201cMitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you!\u201d     Why does Twitter leave phony pictures like this up, but take down Republican/Conservative pictures and statements that are true? Mitch must fight back and repeal Section 230, immediately. Stop biased Big Tech before they stop you! @HawleyMO  @MarshaBlackburn  <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/ah0nMeQdM0\">https://t.co/ah0nMeQdM0</url>    \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 8, 2020        Are you really confident that a Trump appointee wouldn\u2019t read a POTUS tweet one day and then decide that allowing a #blacklivesmatter hashtag to trend is \u201cpromoting extreme content\u201d? The experience of the past four years has not made me eager to get the government involved in defining and regulating political speech.       Barrett\u2019s paper acknowledges many of these problems. Here\u2019s how it described a hypothetical world where Section 230 has been repealed:    If Section 230 were swept away tomorrow, the internet would change, and on the whole, not for the better. It would slow down drastically, as platforms, websites, and blogs looked more skeptically at content posted by users, blocking more of it. Pointed political debate might get removed. Threats of litigation against internet companies would become more common, as would take-down demands, more of which would be successful, as nervous platforms and sites tried to avoid lawsuits. The internet could become a \u201cclosed, one-way street that looks more like a broadcaster or newspaper and less like the internet we know today,\u201d writes Jeff Kosseff in his book, The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet .    To be fair, in a hypothetical post-Section 230 world, some people making take-down requests targeting such harmful content as bullying or defamation would be justified, as some are today. But others would try to silence corporate whistleblowers or activists seeking to build the next #MeToo or #BlackLivesMatter movement\u2014and these efforts at squelching valuable speech would be more likely to succeed. Silicon Valley analyst Anna Wiener depicts an internet that, above all, would be thoroughly bland: \u201cSocial-media startups might fade away, along with niche political sites, birding message boards, classifieds, restaurant reviews, support-group forums, and comments sections. In their place would be a desiccated, sanitized, corporate Internet \u2014 less like an electronic frontier than a well-patrolled office park.\u201d    I think that\u2019s a bad world. Barrett\u2019s paper uses this vision to support Section 230\u2019s continued existence. But then it advocates making Section 230 exist only for some companies and not for others, for some websites and not for others \u2014 all contingent on things like whether the government thinks you\u2019re limiting \u201cextreme\u201d content in the way it would like or whether you\u2019ve paid enough into a journalism fund.    If you like those ideas, make them into laws. Don\u2019t turn them into an obstacle course that everyone who puts content online must navigate in order to save us from that office-park Internet. Because while Trump and Biden view Section 230 as a special gift to a few trillion-dollar companies, it\u2019s actually a gift to all of us who want a free and open and vibrant Internet. Facebook can still make plenty of money on a \u201cdesiccated, sanitized, corporate Internet\u201d \u2014 but we\u2019d be worse off with one.    The tech giants need greater regulation on a host of issues. But Section 230 has become a political football for all the wrong reasons. Don\u2019t hold the legal heart of the open web hostage in the process.

Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper, but also squarely within his constitutional powers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president, but there's no serious argument for this. The conduct of foreign policy \u2014 and horse-trading with foreign leaders \u2014 is a core presidential duty.</p><p> The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump's presidency, namely his inability or unwillingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn't think institutionally or constitutionally.</p><p> In contrast to his carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It's not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn't know that they exist; it's that she doesn't care.</p><p> Her broad approach is if she doesn't like something about America, she'll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn't a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.</p><p> One of Warren's signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, her plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.</p><p> Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \"constitutionally or legally suspect\" is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.</p><p> As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.</p><p> And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it's not clear under what authority.</p><p> Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \"I appreciate what you're getting at Liz, but you can't do that.\"</p><p> To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren't thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.</p><p> This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump's Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal didn't raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn't have the power to do it.</p><p> To be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small. It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump's emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions.</p><p> All you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it's freaking out about Trump, it's boosting the prospects of Elizabeth Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.</p><p>     Rich Lowry is a syndicated columnist. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-5081901</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28DB3DC15BCE2F NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8D-5TM1-DXVP-V3Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Evening Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

People have asked this question because we see more and more that they have come to control the dialogue and discussion of ideas on the public stage. And the answer is not nearly as simple as one would think. </p><p><br/>Is Facebook a near monopoly as a social network entity? Based on actual active user counts, Facebook only has 36% of the market share. However, that doesn't tell the real tale. I suspect that the vast majority of users of other social media platforms also have a Facebook account, so the real question to ask is \"What percentage of time do people spend on the various forms of Social Media?\" and here Facebook owns 83% of user's time. <br/>Is Google a near monopoly as a search engine? Most certainly. Though there are competitors, combined they have a very minor share of searches when compared to Google (July of 2018 saw Google with 86.2% of searches).<br/>There is really no metric by which Twitter could be considered a Monopoly. They have fewer members than Facebook and fewer daily post totals. People spend less time on their Twitter accounts than Facebook as well. There might be an outsized influence of ideas expressed on Twitter, due to a confluence of factors; their Tweet limit of 280 characters forces people to be concise, and because it is easier to send messages out from a Twitter account to your followers than via Facebook. So, though there are fewer posts, more of them are important to the political and social discussions.<br/>There is no formal legal definition, enshrined in law, of what market share constitutes a monopoly. Therefore, we are forced to look to the courts, who enforce decisions regarding this topic. The definition of monopoly power, as defined by various US Courts, can be best summarized by the Third Circuit Court \"a market share between seventy-five percent and eighty percent of sales is more than adequate to establish a prima facie case of power.\" Courts have found corporations guilty of holding monopoly power with less than seventy-five percent, though other circumstances must be present, such as evidence that the corporation has been able to use their position to block other entities from entering the market or to control prices of either their sales or their costs. If the company, such as Twitter, doesn't meet that threshold of market share, there are other factors that could be used to define them as a monopoly.<br/>So, I hear you cry, you have proven that both Google and Facebook are clearly monopolies in their respective industries, and perhaps we could make the argument that Twitter holds an unhealthy majority as a venue to project ideas to the masses. Why did you say this isn't so simple at the start? Because Facebook doesn't SELL their social media activities, Google doesn't SELL their Internet Searches, and Twitter doesn't SELL their messaging activities. They all sell advertising and use their respective activities to draw users into their platform. In 2017 Google owned 38.6%, Facebook 19.9%, and Twitter a paltry 1.3% of the digital advertising market. So, regardless of what market share of their free services that they provide, it is their revenue sources that are actually of any importance when considering if they are monopolies. They aren't social media companies, they are digital advertising companies. <br/>The Eleventh Circuit Court stated, in another case, \"market share at or less than 50% is inadequate as a matter of law to constitute monopoly power\" and the Seventh Circuit Court wrote \"fifty percent is below any accepted benchmark for inferring monopoly power from market share\". And this is where things get sticky, Google, Facebook, and Twitter (along with several other, newer platforms) are able, due to their dominant and controlling share of the market, to exert influence on people's lives by prioritising advertising and search results. There is overwhelming evidence that the Russian Intelligence agency, FSB, took advantage of the knowledge of Facebook's and Twitter's algorithms and weak security to attempt to influence the US Federal Election in 2016. <br/>As to whether they had any discernible impact is not known for sure, and likely would be difficult to assess the results. The political parties, along with other domestic US-based organizations used both platforms extensively to try and reach more and more voters while also attempting to energize their respective bases, demonstrating that these platforms have become intrinsic to the functioning of our social discourse.<br/>So, what we can see here is that from a business standpoint, these corporations are not monopolies. Regardless of what their non-income related activities might be, strictly-speaking they are digital advertising media companies, and as such own nowhere near the market share required to be tackled as a monopoly. So, how do we approach their seemingly indomitable control of the public forums of our social discourse and political discussions? Check back for Part 2 where we discuss Free Speech and regulating the marketplace of ideas.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-47954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRS1-JCMP-51XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Frontier Center, Canada All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Frontier Centre For Public Policy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The former chancellor will continue his work as an MP while joining a panel of outside experts on J.P. Morgan's Europe, Middle East and Africa advisory council.</p><p>The bank has refused to reveal his salary, which \"is not expected to be on the same scale as [Tony] Blair, who was reportedly paid more than \u00a32m a year\" as a \"global advisor\" to the New York City-based multinational, according to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/18/former-chancellor-sajid-javid-role-jp-morgan-adviser-us-bank-mp-conservative\">The Guardian</url>.</p><h>What are the current rules?</h><p>For former ministers and senior civil servants, the rules on work outside the political arena are fairly simple. All second jobs, or roles taken immediately after stepping down from government, must be cleared by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments at the Cabinet Office.\u00a0</p><p>  This body decides whether it is appropriate for senior government figures to take up roles after leaving politics, or in the case of sitting MPs such as Javid, whether they must be \"ring fenced\" against revealing government policy and privileged information.</p><p>All ex-ministers must inform the committee of any employment they wish to take up within two years of standing down from their government role.\u00a0</p><p>For example, when former Tory MP David Gauke rejoined law firm Macfarlanes as head of policy in May, he would have had to clear the role since he served as justice secretary under Theresa May until last summer.</p><p>However, when it comes to the type of officials Facebook is targeting, the rules get a bit more complicated. As The Times notes, the job moves \"are not published in official transparency releases, either because the officials were not senior enough or because they worked for independent regulators such as Ofcom\".</p><p>\"The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which vets appointments of former crown servants, only checks at director-general level and above,\" the paper continues. \"And its advice is non-binding.\"</p><h>So should the regulations be beefed up?</h><p>Steve Goodrich, a senior researcher at anti-corruption organisation Transparency International UK, told The Times that \"in theory, there are restrictions on former civil servants using privileged information to benefit their new employers\".\u00a0</p><p>But \"how much this is enforced in practice is up for debate\", he adds.</p><p>The latest influx of officials moving into the private sector is\u00a0part of an ongoing trend, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/632627/170720_ACOBA_2016-17_Annual_Report_ACOBA.pdf\">official figures published in 2017</url> revealing that 52 former ministers had taken up jobs outside of Parliament in the previous 12 months. The politicians who crossed over included Frances Maude, an ex-Cabinet Office minister and industry minister, who took up nine external roles.</p><p>The disclosure fuelled \"complaints that lawmakers are routinely making use of a 'revolving door' to pursue lucrative contracts in the private sector\", as The Guardian's Whitehall editor Rajeev Syal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/20/more-ex-ministers-take-private-sector-jobs-amid-revolving-door-claims\">wrote</url> at the time.</p><p>The following year, the Committee on Standards in Public Life said that \"MPs should be more transparent with voters if they have second jobs outside Westminster\", the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44675842\">BBC</url>\u00a0reported.</p><p>Labour also called for a \"radical overhaul\" of the \"revolving door\", which the party claimed was \"at the heart of how the British establishment survives and thrives across Whitehall\", according to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-politician-jobs-uk-business-ministers-conservative-employment-a8420276.html\">The Independent</url>.\u00a0</p><p>But Labour made no specific recomendations and no reforms have been enacted since then.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPEVVO-107902athttpswwwtheweekcouk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPEVVO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NW-84G1-JB34-302C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464399</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

Morgan  Credits Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images  Facebook targeting government insiders as another ex-minister joins banking giant J.P. Morgan In Depth[1] Joe Evans[2] Tuesday, August 25, 2020 - 2:29pm Facebook has hired ten former UK government policy officials with insider knowledge of regulatory processes since the beginning of 2020, an investigation has found. The Times[3]reports that the social media giant is 'systematically hiring government insiders' in a recruitment campaign that will fuel concerns over the 'close relationship between the government and technology companies'. The new claims about the so-called 'revolving door' between politics and the private sector come just a week after J.P. Morgan announced that former chancellor Sajid Javid has been appointed as a senior advisor to the banking giant.Why the concerns?The officials hired by Facebook[4] 'left roles in government and with regulators' to work on policy and communications for the social media giant, 'indicating that mandarins are being offered significant incentives to do so', says The Times. Facebook's possible motives are key to critics' concerns, with some senior Conservative MPs claiming that 'Facebook was seeking to limit regulations before they were introduced', the newspaper reports. </p><p>Julian Knight, the Tory chair of the Commons Committee on Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, argues that the public 'have a right to question the cosy relationship between government and big tech at all levels'. 'The truth is big techhas taken over from the likes of banking, oil and pharmaceuticals in terms of their lobbying power,' he added. The committee'sformer chair, Tory MP Damian Collins, claims that Facebook is 'clearly hiring people who have both direct personal knowledge'[5] of the latest thinking in government and 'extensive networks' among officials advising ministers. 'They are doing this to try and change the direction of policy before it is even launched,' Collins said. Similar concerns were raised after Javid's new banking role was announced last week. The former chancellor will continue his work as an MP while joining a panel of outside experts on J.P. Morgan's Europe, Middle East and Africa advisory council. The bank has refused to reveal his salary, which 'is not expected to be on the same scale as [Tony] Blair, who was reportedly paid more than 2m a year' as a 'global advisor' to the New York City-based multinational, according toThe Guardian[6].What are the current rules?For former ministers and senior civil servants, the rules on work outside the political arena are fairly simple. All second jobs, or roles taken immediately after stepping down from government, must be cleared by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments at the Cabinet Office. See related Key moments from first night of Republicans' 'dark convention'[7] This body decides whether it is appropriate for senior government figures to take up roles after leaving politics, or in the case of sitting MPs such as Javid, whether they must be 'ring fenced' against revealing government policy and privileged information. All ex-ministers must inform the committee of any employment they wish to take up within two years of standing down from their government role. For example, when former Tory MP David Gauke rejoined law firm Macfarlanes as head of policy in May, he would have had to clear the role since he served as justice secretary under Theresa May until last summer. However, when it comes to the type of officials Facebook is targeting, the rules get a bit more complicated. As The Times notes, the job moves 'are not published in official transparency releases, either because the officials were not senior enough or because they worked for independent regulators such as Ofcom'. 'The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, which vets appointments of former crown servants, only checks at director-general level and above,' the paper continues. 'And its advice is non-binding.'So should the regulations be beefed up?Steve Goodrich, a senior researcher at anti-corruption organisation Transparency International UK, told The Times that 'in theory, there are restrictions on former civil servants using privileged information to benefit their new employers'. But 'how much this is enforced in practice is up for debate', he adds. The latest influx of officials moving into the private sector ispart of an ongoing trend, with official figures published in 2017[8] revealing that 52 former ministers had taken up jobs outside of Parliament in the previous 12 months. The politicians who crossed over included Frances Maude, an ex-Cabinet Office minister and industry minister, who took up nine external roles. The disclosure fuelled 'complaints that lawmakers are routinely making use of a 'revolving door' to pursue lucrative contracts in the private sector', as The Guardian's Whitehall editor Rajeev Syal wrote[9] at the time. The following year, the Committee on Standards in Public Life said that 'MPs should be more transparent with voters if they have second jobs outside Westminster', the BBC[10]reported. Labour also called for a 'radical overhaul' of the 'revolving door', which the party claimed was 'at the heart of how the British establishment survives and thrives across Whitehall', according toThe Independent[11]. But Labour made no specific recomendations and no reforms have been enacted since then.

Its valuation has already doubled in the last 14 months to about $800 billion, and Jeff Bezos, its founder and CEO, is officially the richest man on the planet.</p><p><br/>There are ways in which Amazon seems to be the greatest company in American history. It's revolutionized the global shopping experience and expanded into media and hardware, while operating on razor-thin margins that have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-riddle-of-amazon/309523/?utm_source=feed\">astonished critics</url>. But some now consider it the modern incarnation of a railroad monopoly, a logistics behemoth using its scale to destroy competition.<br/>So what is Amazon: brilliant, dangerous, or both? That's the subject of the latest episode of Crazy/Genius, our new podcast on technology and culture.<br/><br/><br/>To build the case for breaking up the Everything Store, I talk to Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at NYU and an outspoken critic of big tech, and Lina Khan, a researcher at the Open Markets Institute and a leading expert on antitrust policy. Both of them encourage me to see how a company famous for low prices can still behave in an anticompetitive manner. Making the case against heavy regulation for Amazon are Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech think tank, and Michael Mandel, an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute who researches technology and e-commerce. Both encourage me to focus not only on the hidden costs of Amazon's largeness, but also on the hidden benefits.<br/>You can subscribe to Crazy/Genius at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/crazy-genius/id1378618386?mt=2\">iTunes</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Iswseg72nczz5ddixgxnqncrxgq\">Google Play</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-atlantic-2/crazygenius\">Stitcher</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/46iJKYSBSvS0pCjp0wLHIG\">Spotify</url>.

Right now, U.S. data privacy laws are scattershot among individual states, covering different things and, like the state-based data breach notification laws, only add more confusion. Having a national law would provide the same protections to everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the other hand, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GDPR has only been live for a few months, so we don\u2019t know what the long-term implications will be</emphasis>. Or maybe we should wait to see how well the state privacy acts function before we take on a federal mandate.</p><p>I asked security and privacy professionals for their opinions: First, do we need a data privacy law at the federal level and second, if we do, what do you think should be in that law?</p><p>Almost everyone agreed that yes, a law passed by Congress is necessary.</p><p>\u201cAfter numerous large-scale breaches and the well-publicized misuse of consumer data, we are well past the time for comprehensive data privacy protections for all U.S. citizens,\u201d Michael Magrath, director, Global Regulations &amp; Standards, OneSpan, said, adding that the data privacy law should apply to online and offline data.</p><p>Callum Corr, data analytics specialist from ZL Technologies, agreed that we need to do this, but he\u2019s concerned about who would take the lead in writing that bill. \u201cBig tech giants have been pushing politicians and commissioners alike to allow them to come together and write a policy that is going to be favorable to the largest companies in the industry,\u201d he said. In fact, a number of big tech firms <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">plan to introduce a data privacy framework</emphasis> to the Senate.</p><p>\u201cIf we allow the tech leaders to write the law that is supposed to regulate them, then it defeats the purpose,\u201d Corr added. \u201cThe regulation needs to be consistent and therefore, it has to be federal.\u201d State laws are set up to fail because they all have boundaries attached, and the flow of data today has no boundaries. A federal law would address that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There Is Something Started</emphasis></p><p>There is one pending bill, S.2289, which was introduced to the Senate in January, Pravin Kothari, CEO of CipherCloud, pointed out. This bill calls for the creation of an Office of Cybersecurity within the Federal Trade Commission (OCS-FTC, which would create, issue, and distribute regulations that require covered business entities (predominantly credit bureaus) to provide a complete overview of the technical and organizational security measures they have in place.</p><p>But, while this is a start, we need to proceed with caution. \u201cThe legislative environment is uncoordinated and generally ineffective. Look at HIPAA and PCI, which have been in place for long periods of time, but have not stopped health care organizations or financial institutions from becoming victims - regardless of the requirements and penalties,\u201d said Kothari.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Empower Individuals and Their Right to Data Privacy</emphasis></p><p>So we need the federal law, but what should it cover? The federal law should ideally empower individuals, said Rishi Bhargava, co-founder at Demisto. That includes following rights:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The right to know what data is being collected by a data controller/processor</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The right to deny the collection of that data</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The right to ask for removal of that data at any time</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The right to be informed about any major breach that compromises their data</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We Need Accountability</emphasis></p><p>Despite the industry-based federal privacy laws enacted now, Ali Golshan, CTO and co-founder at StackRox, explained, we lack overall accountability for times when consumer data is lost or mishandled. However, he added, before we can have accountability, we need to figure out how to make the current compliances work with a broader privacy act. And any privacy law will need to include transparency of data management across organizations of all sizes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy Needs Protection</emphasis></p><p>You can\u2019t think about data privacy without considering data protection. Any U.S. federal data privacy legislation should include a requirement, not a recommendation, that multifactor authentication must be used to access systems containing personal information, Magrath suggested, and should leverage the NIST\u2019s Digital Identity Guidelines v1.1 and future revisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Learn from GDPR</emphasis></p><p>A lot of organizations have already taken steps to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">be in compliance with GDPR</emphasis>. Also, as states begin to enact their own laws, businesses will need to add more data privacy layers. We don\u2019t need to build a U.S. law from scratch, said Nathan Wenzler, chief security strategist at AsTech.</p><p>\u201cWe could start with GDPR as a framework, since it's already affecting U.S. companies who collect and use personal data for EU residents, and work to modify and improve upon it for our own purposes,\u201d Wenzler explained. \u201cThe intent of GDPR satisfies many pieces of a user-centric data privacy and protection effort.\u201d</p><p>GDPR is hardly perfect, of course, but a federal data privacy law similar to GDPR would provide users some amount of recourse to control how, where and it what manner their personal data is used, which in and of itself would be a huge step forward in our data privacy efforts.</p><p>Overall, what we want from a federal data privacy law is something that will help businesses keep consumer data secure and private as they work across state and international borders, TrustArc Chief Data Governance Officer Hilary Wandall said, adding, \u201cA U.S. national standard that applies across industry sectors will provide a stronger position and voice for U.S. business and policy interests in the international privacy regulatory dialogue.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sue Marquette Poremba has been writing about network security since 2008.

The panel, moderated by AEI\u2019s James Pethokoukis, discussed issues including the suitability of antitrust as a tool to use against these large tech firms, how these firms are affecting innovation, how much history\u2019s lessons apply to the current moment, and whether Big Tech threatens democracy.  </p><p><br/>The Chicago Booth School\u2019s Luigi Zingales voiced the most skepticism toward these tech firms and argued that previous cases of government action or threats to act against AT&amp;T, Microsoft, and IBM suggest that regulating the current dominant firms is warranted. He added that these firms\u2019 size and control of information render them potential threats to American democracy. Andrew McAfee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology countered that Microsoft\u2019s inability to prevent the rise of Google and Apple stemmed not from government decisions, but from Microsoft\u2019s failure to foresee the importance of search and mobile. The Niskanen Center\u2019s Ryan Hagemann added that the problems confronting American democracy are less about the platforms themselves than they are cultural. AEI\u2019s Michael R.

Technology is blunting the harshness of government-mandated lockdowns everywhere, allowing some measure of normalcy in our lives to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As social media keeps us connected to our communities and loved ones, thorny issues remain for Big Tech, in particular accusations of unprecedented censorship. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\u2019s style of censorship is widely perceived as highly arbitrary and a process that lacks transparency. If a large enough public believes there is bias, then there\u2019s a higher likelihood lawmakers will provide regulations that curb the power and privilege (see Section 230) of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIER itself has faced throttling by Google, YouTube, and perhaps Twitter, and videos we\u2019ve needed for science-based postings have been deleted. We steadily worked to build our own outlets, preparing for the possibility of full censorship.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our heavy reliance on Big Tech has prompted some commentators in recent months to question if the techlash was coming to a standstill. </p><p>Fat hope. As the adage goes, there is no rest for the wicked. Worrywarts everywhere have not cut tech giants any slack, even doubling down on their pessimism. In a May New York Times column titled \u201cThe Immunity of the Tech Giants,\u201d author Kara Swisher stoked standard anti-Big-Tech fears, warning that the pandemic further enables their dangerous growth, describing these corporations as possessing \u201cunlimited power, Midas-like financial might\u201d and enjoying \u201cminimal oversight.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common refrain in the techlash narrative is straightforward. Big is bad, and bad needs to be curbed by government. Regulate them, break them up and fine them if they exploit their power. Lacking this regulatory oversight, the Big Tech \u201cmonopolies\u201d (pretend monopoly was defined by a handful of players rather than one, would you?) would be entrenched and unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These apocalyptic doomsday narratives are particularly effective at capturing the public imagination and selling clicks. The problem is that they are not consistent with the history of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet\u2019s history is chock full of so-called \u201cmonopolies\u201d from MySpace and AOL to Yahoo and Microsoft, all of which at one point enjoyed a dominant market share and the frenzied attention of the press, only to find themselves unexpectedly displaced by emerging competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hard for us to imagine how Facebook would ever be unseated from its market position today. But remember that politicians, journalists and activists were all making the exact same kinds of predictions just over a decade ago against the leading web giants of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Facebook, there was MySpace. MySpace had all the makings of a winner. It launched in 2002, had a million users by 2004, and was bought by the media conglomerate News Corp at $580 million in 2005. MySpace\u2019s web traffic surpassed Google\u2019s in 2006 and at its peak in 2008, MySpace attracted 76 million unique visitors a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like present day Facebook, MySpace had no shortage of its own naysayers. A Guardian headline in 2007 read, \u201cWill MySpace ever lose its monopoly?\u201d Others confidently declared that \u201cMySpace Is a Natural Monopoly,\u201d echoing a common verdict made by many tech academics and analysts today of Google and Facebook. Fast forward one year into 2008, and Facebook had already doubled the web traffic of MySpace, which was shrinking away quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How was MySpace toppled? Some argue that Facebook\u2019s explosive growth leveraged at the right time on emerging broadband technology. Others point to the fact that MySpace refused to integrate with third-party apps. Or perhaps as a late-mover, Facebook learned from MySpace\u2019s mistakes, as its platform was plagued with technical problems, fake accounts and cluttered advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as Facebook had unseated MySpace, MySpace had beat Friendster and both these first-generation social networking platforms were victors over the Internet\u2019s previous incumbents: the web portal players of AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe, and GeoCities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 90s internet powerhouse AOL, its merger with Time-Warner in 2001 at the time was the largest, valued at $165 billion. At its peak in 2000, AOL had 23 million subscribers with the next biggest competitor Earthlink trailing far behind at 3 million users. The merger between the largest cable company and Internet service provider prompted media pundits to waste no time in diagnosing the merger as Judgement Day for the media industry as we know it. AOL\u2019s competitors complained to the Federal Communications Commission that the web giant had \u201cthe potential to become an even greater, bottleneck to prevent the emergence of a robust, competitive instant-messaging market,\u201d and that the AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) \u201cneeds to be protected from the control of a single entity.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as we all know now, the AOL-Time Warner marriage was to be the most disastrous merger in recent business history. The earliest cracks showed as soon as two years after the merger with a reported $54 billion loss. By the end of 2003, AOL was dropped from the Time Warner name and is still recovering from its losses today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with a gargantuan first-mover advantage, AOL failed its transition into the opening of the commercial internet and lost its reign to Yahoo. Yahoo\u2019s media portal empire spanned across email, news, travel, gaming, search and more. Yet Yahoo\u2019s seat at the throne was similarly short-lived. Once worth $125 billion, Yahoo sold to Verizon for 4% of that amount in 2016. Yahoo, like AOL, struggled with its transition to mobile during the smartphone revolution, losing significant market share to Google and Facebook who innovated superior monetization business models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tales of MySpace, AOL and Yahoo\u2019s fall from glory shows how spectacularly wrong tech analysts can be, and how complex the machinations of a market economy are. The popular caricature paints big corporations as making well-calculated and methodical movements across the chess board of the economy in their quest for economic dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, the larger the enterprise, the more dizzying array of factors CEOs face in steering their ship through the economy. As F. A. Hayek often said, the complexity of modern market economies rests way beyond the comprehension of any one given person, in particular the well-meaning politician who fancies himself capable of overhauling whole economic systems with the stroke of a legislative pen. This \u201cextended order\u201d was built on billions of transactions coordinated by market prices and other social institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complexity is further magnified in a fast-changing and low entry barrier environment like that of the digital world, where the costs of writing new code are minuscule compared to the pre-Internet era which required high fixed investment costs in physical infrastructure and hardware. The low barriers of entry into the tech market necessarily means that Big Tech has to be in constant surveillance of Silicon Valley startups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further to keeping an eye on the rapid flux of new tech entrants, Big Tech incumbents are also especially vulnerable to consumer\u2019s low barriers of exit. Social media users are not two-dimensional robots \u2013 most of us multi-home on different social media platforms depending on our hobbies, occupations and social networks. I\u2019m deeply immersed in Facebook and Twitter, but also on YouTube for social commentary, browse Reddit when I\u2019m bored and TikTok when I\u2019m truly bored. How many of us hop back and forth between e-commerce, food delivery and ride-hailing services at a moment\u2019s notice of a price promotion? The fact that we use whole folders to categorize these apps on our smartphones is testament to the diversity of competition in the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, incumbents enjoy network effect advantages. But the low costs of consumer switching/exit are hardly trivial, as they act as a perpetual check on Big Tech incumbents. The mere threats of displacement prevent market leaders from taking their customers for granted. As soon as they do, new entrants are poised to challenge their market power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only Big Tech opponents would appreciate it, this competition is taking place on the margin constantly. Instagram once eroded Facebook\u2019s user base on photo content, while WhatsApp and Telegram invaded on the chat messaging front. Spotify\u2019s streaming service single-handedly took on Apple\u2019s iTunes music download service. Google\u2019s search engine is not as monopolistic as one might think when we realize that industry-specific verticals exist within the larger umbrella of search; Amazon for books, Walmart for consumer goods, Airbnb and Tripadvisor for travel, Yelp for local businesses and food reviews. The short-form video market now belongs to TikTok while Facebook and Instagram\u2019s attempts to counter are still far off from being a serious threat. Zoom\u2019s leapfrogging of Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Google\u2019s Meets and Cisco\u2019s Webex during COVID-19 is another example of how Big Tech incumbents are not insulated from market competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians and tech activists will continue spinning their yarn about dangerous tech monopolies that are immune to competition. But contrary to their tales, Big Tech\u2019s market power is very much overhyped. The dynamism of market competition in the tech sector is alive and well and as history shows, no corporation stays at the top for long. As long as Big Tech continues to serve consumers well with innovative low-cost solutions, there is no reason why that should be a cause for concern either.&lt;/p&gt;         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-103122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603C-WMF1-JBJN-M3T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 8, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

From the foundation myths surrounding Athens and Rome, to the clearance of virgin forests in western New York state to create the \"garden city\" of Buffalo, to scores of purpose-built capitals - Bras\u00edlia, Canberra, Astana, Washington DC - building new cities is just something that humans do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When countries rise up, when markets emerge, people build new cities. Today, though, we are taking it to unheard-of levels. We have never before built so many new cities in so many places at such great expense as we are right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than already exist on Earth</p><p>  Paul Romer    </p><p>New dots have been popping up on the maps of countries such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and India with unprecedented frequency since the late 1990s, and more than 120 new cities are currently being built in 40 nations around the world. </p><p>Avant-garde developments like Shenzhen and Pudong blazed new economic trails until they eventually widened into the boulevards of a new status quo for the emerging markets of the world.</p><p>We are standing on the precipice of a new city building boom unlike anything we've seen before. These shiny new metropolises hold the dreams and aspirations of people and nations from east Asia to the Middle East to Africa. Will they deliver a bright new urban future or a debt-fuelled bubble of historic proportions?</p><p>                                        A one-stop cure-all?                                      </p><p>The new city has been sold as a one-stop cure-all for an array of urban and economic issues facing emerging markets around the world: overcrowding, pollution, traffic congestion, housing shortages, lack of green space and economic stagnation, to name a few. By starting from scratch, governments hope to move on from their current clogged and dysfunctional urban centres and develop new economic sectors to help them leapfrog other nations. City building itself can also be a highly profitable endeavour for some.</p><p>At first glance, many new cities appear to openly defy economic fundamentals. What are emerging markets - \"poor countries\" - doing building some of the most technologically advanced, expensive cities on earth? Why is the dusty, remote Kazakh border town of Khorgos <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">turning into</url> what is claimed will become a \"new Dubai\"?

This means 2.5 billion more city dwellers, with 90% of the uptake happening in Asia and Africa. Half of the urban area that will be needed hasn't been built yet. We would need scores more Delhis, Shanghais and Lagoses.</p><p>\"The sad thing is that we're going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth,\" says the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer of New York University. \"If we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have.\"</p><p>If you build a new city you don't have to relocate or work around existing roads, rivers, factories or houses</p><p>  John Macomber    </p><p>It doesn't take a Nobel winner to see that many of the existing cities of Asia and Africa are simply not able to handle this onslaught of urbanisation. Cairo was built to house 1 million people, not the 20 million who live there today. Cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Lagos, Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro are crowded by rings of informal developments. Retrofitting these cities with modern infrastructure and utilities is more complicated and expensive than clearing out a swathe of land and starting all over again.</p><p>As Macomber says: \"If you build a new city you don't have to relocate or work around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. You also don't have to work around existing political processes, community groups, civic organisations ... or even existing regulations and rules.\"</p><p>                                        'A wild west atmosphere'                                      </p><p>As well as being less complicated and cheaper than retrofitting old cities, building new cities is seen by many leaders as more profitable - and sexier. At the height of China's new city building boom in 2011, land sales accounted for roughly 74% of the revenue stream for the country's municipal governments and plots of urban construction land were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">selling at a 40-fold profit</url>. Emerging markets that are actively reconstructing themselves - both physically and in terms of their global image - tend to have economies that are driven by the real estate and construction sectors. For them, building an entirely new city is the pinnacle of projects.</p><p>\"Neoliberalism and deregulation have created a wild west atmosphere that facilitates the circulation of footloose capital globally,\" says Sarah Moser, a geography professor at McGill University and the author of the upcoming Atlas of New Cities. \"It is easier now than in previous decades to acquire vast tracts of land and to then use that land for any purpose, including urban and commercial.</p><p>\"Technology companies, construction companies, and the real estate industry are leveraging the many challenges facing cities in the global south to convince people that new cities are an important solution rather than fixing existing cities, which is not as profitable.\"</p><p>Development firms such as New York's Gale International and South Korea's Posco are peddling copies of Songdo LINK around the world. Architects such as KPF and Arup are drawing up attention-grabbing masterplans lined with skyscrapers, parks and shopping malls reminiscent of New York, London and Dubai. And big tech firms such as Cisco, Alibaba and Tencent are keen to provision these new cities with cutting edge IT networks and public surveillance gizmos.</p><p>The developer's goal is to maximise profits ... There is not much money to be made in affordable family housing</p><p>  Sarah Moser    </p><p>The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of $100bn (\u00a378bn), while the country's Neom megalopolis is slated to cost <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">five times that</url>. Malaysia's Forest City had its price initially pegged at $100bn, while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking $161bn. Adding up the costs of more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment that can be measured in the trillions of dollars - but the returns are far from given.</p><p>\"Too often a best-case scenario of potential economic rewards is presented and the project is rushed through when decision makers are on a utopian high,\" says Moser. \"The reality is that new city projects can only move forward with massive loans, often from foreign banks, with no guarantee that the city will be profitable enough to repay the loans.\"</p><p>                                        New cities that work                                      </p><p>\"Cities have to have a purpose,\" Macomber says. \"It's a common mistake that has been made for centuries where a ruler will say 'Let's build some buildings and palaces and some things will happen' or 'Let's put up a couple big office buildings and now we're going to have a Dubai on the Indian Ocean'. Not necessarily. The new cities that struggle are the ones that are pushing against what market forces want to do.\"</p><p>New cities that work have built-in economic drivers that give them their impetus and reason for being. Khorgos on the China-Kazakhstan border <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">was sparked to life by</url> a transportation hub along the New Silk Road; Cyberjaya in Malaysia was built as a concentrated hub of hi-tech firms, startups and educational facilities; South Korea's Songdo is one of the best examples of an \"aerotropolis\" - a city built around an airport.</p><p>Other new cities could be described as superfluous - custom-built cities for the rich. \"Some of these developments are imagined as the gated communities of privilege,\" says Romer. \"Like Bras\u00edlia: 'The place where we will be able to drive really fast in our cars. We'll just not let any poor people come here.' Those things are doomed to fail.</p><p>\"They're also an inappropriate response to the real need, which is not for the rich to have a place to retreat to but for people who want to get a first position on the kind of urban, modern escalator that can help lift them and their kids to a better life.\"</p><p>Many new cities that are currently being built in Asia and Africa are clearly being designed for emerging middle classes. If provided with the right opportunities, this well-educated, big spending and highly mobile sector of society can be a boon for just about any country. If those opportunities are not provided they are especially prone to flight - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">emigrating to better jobs and lifestyles</url> in the US, Canada and western Europe.</p><p>The new city building boom is nearly as much about maintaining and attracting high-value talent as it is about creating space for the droves of rural migrants searching for their first handholds in an urban environment.</p><p>\"Many new cities are scrambling to attract these global elites through creating luxury properties that they can buy, luxury retail and restaurants, and infrastructure for their lavish hobbies: particularly docking facilities for yachts,\" says Moser.</p><p>\"The developer's goal is to maximise profits and this is done in large part by creating luxury condos and villas. There is not much money to be made in affordable family housing, so developers are not interested.\"</p><p>                     Wade Shepard is the author of Ghost Cities of China, and On the New Silk Road                   </p><p>                     Follow Guardian Cities on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">Twitter</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">Instagram</url> to join the discussion, catch up on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">our best stories</url> or sign up for our       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/follow-new-silk-road-china-belt\">weekly newsletter</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54357513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-0691-JCJY-G4FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1686\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

And ever since its initial public offering in 2004, GOOG stock has performed accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But 16 years after its <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-ipo-this-year\">IPO</url>, the world's leading search engine isn't the growth dynamo it once was, its rivals are getting stronger, and for the first time, it's an open question in Silicon Valley whether Google might eventually lose its search mojo as popular consumer tech products evolve. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a brief overview of the Mountain View, California-based technology giant, its core areas of business, and -- most importantly for prospective investors -- pros and cons that can help answer the question: \"Should I buy Alphabet stock?\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/advice/articles/invested\">Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.</url>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet Stock at a Glance</emphasis></p><p>In 2015, Google restructured its business and reincorporated itself as Alphabet, a holding company whose major subsidiary would be Google, the world's dominant search company. Under the restructuring, investors were able to differentiate the results between the cash-cow Google and its money-losing \"moonshot\" investments in the \"Other Bets\" category. </p><p>Despite the separation, there's a reason the company kept its ticker as GOOG: Alphabet is still essentially just a big proxy for its crown jewel, Google. </p><p>GOOG stock's lifeblood is digital advertising, a massive industry that, along with Facebook ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>), it dominates -- the two companies control a combined 70% of the digital advertising market in the U .S. Google sells ads against its search results for specific terms, and also operates a sprawling ad network, placing ads on third-party sites for a cut of the resulting revenue. </p><p>With mobile overtaking desktop as the world's preferred search device, Google's Android operating system becomes ever more valuable; Android enjoys between 70% and 80% of global market share, and Google is the default search engine for Android. </p><p>YouTube, Gmail, Google Play, Pixel phones, Google Home smart speakers, Google Cloud and the company's expanding hardware business are a few of the big-name products supplementing Alphabet's bottom line alongside the search engine; in fact, given macroeconomic headwinds, these side businesses may soon become more important than ever. </p><p>As for Other Bets, it accounted for an immaterial 0.4% of Alphabet's overall revenue last quarter and lost a disproportionate amount of money doing so. In the second quarter of 2020, Other Bets posted $148 million in revenue and an operating loss of $1.11 billion. This is where some of the wacky yet potentially huge long-term projects live, such as Google Fiber, the Waymo self-driving car unit, anti-aging research outfit Verily, a network of internet-beaming balloons and a drone delivery unit. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pros to Buying GOOG Stock</emphasis></p><p>The first and most obvious advantage to owning Alphabet stock is simply owning a piece of the biggest, baddest search engine in the world. </p><p>No matter what happens to advertising revenue, Google has firmly entrenched itself as the world's go-to search site. The search giant controls more than 87% of the U.S. market and more than 90% of the global market share. </p><p>And for the time being, Android serves as a pretty good insurance policy against other search companies meaningfully cannibalizing mobile share. </p><p>The second pro to owning GOOG stock, aside from its big-time search engine cash cow and exceptional brand, is the company's investment in diversification. Its portfolio of products ranges from self-driving cars to YouTube, and from artificial intelligence to cloud and voice search. </p><p>YouTube is arguably at the epicenter of the consumer transition from traditional mass-market media to dispersed, on-demand and increasingly mobile media consumption. These factors have made their way into Alphabet's earnings report, with YouTube ad revenue increasing 6% year over year in the second quarter. While advertising revenue is Alphabet's bread and butter, it doesn't hurt that YouTube Premium paid subscribers have increased 60% year over year. </p><p>At this point, advertisers who aren't shifting more of their budget to online video platforms are simply missing out. </p><p>Longer term, Google's willingness to invest in bold new projects outside its core competency as a search engine could be precisely what allows it to continue as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-growth-stocks-to-buy\">growth stock</url> despite hundreds of billions in annual revenue. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/semiconductor-stocks-with-strong-dividends\">7 Semiconductor Stocks With Strong Dividends.</url>]</p><p>Several promising areas hold the type of game-changing potential that could launch a new era of growth for GOOG shareholders: in particular, AI and autonomous vehicles, or AVs. Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary is already a leader in AVs, and Alphabet's research and development investments in artificial intelligence have made it one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/artificial-intelligence-stocks-the-10-best-ai-companies\">best AI companies,</url> too. </p><p>A line item dubbed \"Google other,\" which includes its Pixel mobile phones and Google Play, enjoyed revenue growth of more than 25% in the second quarter to $5.12 billion. Speaking of which, Google Play app and game downloads were up more than 35% year over year as people stuck at home hopped on their phones to blow off steam. </p><p>Finally, Google Cloud revenue grew an impressive 43% year over year. Like Google Play, Cloud was helped by the worldwide lockdowns this quarter as people were forced to work remotely. Millions of companies used Alphabet's G Suite of services -- such as Gmail, Drive, Chat and Meet -- and millions more will continue to use those services as remote work becomes more normalized. </p><p>The final pro for buying Google stock is an open secret: Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat. Widely respected on Wall Street and poached from Morgan Stanley ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ms-morgan-stanley\">MS</url>) in 2015, she oversaw the reorganization of Google into the holding company Alphabet, allowing the company to show just how profitable the core search business was -- and how investing in potential \"moonshots\" affects overall earnings. Porat's presence gives investors the sense that there's an adult in the room making sure spending doesn't get too out of hand. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cons to Buying GOOG Stock</emphasis></p><p>The first thing companies do when a recession is looming is cut their advertising budgets, and that's bad news for the biggest advertising platform in the world. Alphabet is familiar with this trend; in the last recession, the company saw its first sequential decline in revenue between the end of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. </p><p>Alphabet hit a similar milestone this quarter with its first year-over-year decline in revenue. Alphabet reported $38.3 billion in revenue, down from $38.9 billion in the same quarter last year -- not an enormous decline, but the fact that revenue dropped is a red flag for investors. </p><p>There's nothing Alphabet can do about macroeconomic headwinds, and unfortunately there's nothing the company can do about the fact that Amazon.com ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>) exists -- and is attacking the search giant on all fronts. </p><p>Perhaps the greatest long-term risk Amazon poses to GOOG is its encroachment into voice search -- which might be the very future of search itself -- where Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant has a huge first-mover advantage that it's ruthlessly capitalized on. </p><p>Amazon is also seizing digital advertising dollars, as marketers shift spending to Amazon.com's growing platform and more lucrative product searches begin on Amazon than Google. In cloud, <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">Amazon Web Services</url> is the clear market leader, with Google Cloud playing catch-up and occupying a distant third place behind Amazon and Microsoft ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>) Azure. Jeff Bezos' ruthlessly opportunistic company is also devoting time, energy and resources to AI. </p><p>Taken in concert, these trends don't look particularly good for Alphabet or inspire much confidence in its ability to churn out company-changing profits anytime soon. Amazon beat Google to market by years in smart speakers and cloud computing, GOOG's Pixel phone has thus far proven unable to dislodge Apple's ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>) iPhone from its perch, and the company even tried to copy Facebook with its ill-fated and largely ignored Google+ social network, which was finally discontinued after seven ho-hum years. </p><p>Another thing to worry about is the specter of regulation, which is suddenly less of a specter and more an inevitability. </p><p>The European Commission fined Google a record $5 billion in 2018 for using Android's dominance to stifle competition. While the U.S. may be slow to the draw with regulation, in mid-2019 news broke that the Department of Justice had opened an antitrust inquiry into the company. And it seems that regulation in the U.S. might truly be on the horizon, given Sundar Pichai's recent (virtual) summons to Capitol Hill for a grilling session with lawmakers. </p><p>Lastly, while GOOG stock certainly doesn't appear grossly overvalued, shares do trade for more than 30 times earnings with no obvious catalyst on the horizon. With slowing global growth and a flat yield curve indicating trouble ahead, the timing doesn't seem ideal for potential Alphabet shareholders, either. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/dividends/slideshows/the-biggest-us-dividend-stocks-to-buy\">9 of the Biggest U.S. Dividend Stocks to Buy.</url>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Bottom Line for GOOG Stock</emphasis></p><p>No stock is perfect, and Alphabet is no different.

Here are a few points to help you decide: </p><p>-- Amazon at a glance.</p><p>-- Pros to buying.</p><p>-- Cons to buying.</p><p>-- Bottom line: Should you buy Amazon stock?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon at a Glance</emphasis></p><p>After the market closed on Thursday, Amazon reported quarterly revenue and earnings that beat analyst expectations -- causing an after-hours-trading surge that continued into the regular session on Friday. </p><p>This is despite the fact that Amazon spent more than $4 billion in <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/companies-that-announced-big-executive-payouts-during-the-pandemic\">pandemic-related costs</url>. That spending represented only a small fraction of the nearly $89 billion in net sales during the second quarter -- a 40% rise, year over year -- as a surge in online shopping due to the health crisis helped boost the company's performance. Amazon earned $10.30 per share, far exceeding Wall Street estimates. </p><p>The results mark another quarter in a long series of earnings beats in Amazon's history. The company has made the transition from an intermittently profitable business to one of the most impressive large-cap earnings growth stocks out there. </p><p>Its journey has been helped by growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division, Prime subscribers and sales of smart speaker Alexa-enabled devices -- all on top of its most well-known business of selling almost anything you could imagine and delivering goods to customers' doorsteps increasingly quicker. </p><p>Although the pandemic has helped Amazon boost its sales, the current environment has created such high demand that the company has experienced an increase in shipping delays and out-of-stock items, giving competitors room to edge in. That said, too much demand could be one of those good problems to have, and many investors have continued to buy the stock, sending shares to record highs this year. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pros to Buying Amazon Stock</emphasis></p><p>Over the long term, Matthew Fox, founder of &gt;Ithaca Wealth Management, sees more pros to owning Amazon than cons. One of the advantages in owning the stock is Amazon's <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/top-stocks-to-watch-with-diverse-leadership\">management team</url>, who Fox says are some of the smartest people in business and are long-term oriented -- focusing beyond quarterly performance. </p><p>Amazon continues to see opportunities with the move to online shopping from people who don't want to go to the traditional stores because of the pandemic, says JoAnne Feeney, portfolio manager with Advisors Capital Management. </p><p>Although Amazon's <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/retail-stocks-with-booming-online-businesses\">e-commerce</url> business is heavily dependent on the health of the consumer, Fox sees the company as diversified, with its exposure to the growth business of cloud computing and its foray into advertising. </p><p>\"You're getting exposure to one of the highest-quality growth companies in the entire world,\" Fox says. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/advice/articles/invested\">Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.</url>]</p><p>Mike Bailey, director of research with FBB Capital Partners, says Amazon's long-term prospects include durable growth trends for global e-commerce, cloud computing and online advertising. </p><p>\"Despite the run in Amazon shares, our sense is investors have yet to fully price in the potential upside from Amazon's entry into the advertising business, which is growing quickly but currently is only a fraction of the size of Facebook and Google,\" he says. </p><p>In the second quarter, Amazon's \"other\" business category -- predominately made up of advertising -- reported $4.22 billion in revenue, a year-over-year increase of 41%. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cons to Buying Amazon Stock</emphasis></p><p>Amazon, which has a share price that is much higher above earnings expectations than the S&amp;P 500 average, faces risks of overvaluation in addition to regulatory risks, Feeney says. </p><p>For her, risks for Amazon's stock include slower-than-expected growth, which could be exacerbated by increasing e-commerce competition. </p><p>\"The challenge is to maintain the pace of growth that is currently built into expectations,\" she says. </p><p>Earnings growth expectations will eventually have to fall, Feeney adds. That doesn't detract from current growth, but it does lessen the appeal of the stock overall. </p><p>From Bailey's perspective, additional risks could include declining sentiment for \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/investing-in-faang-stocks-do-they-deserve-the-hype\">FAANG</url>\" stocks -- Facebook ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">FB</url>), Apple ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>), Amazon, Netflix ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nflx-netflix-inc\">NFLX</url>) and Alphabet ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/goog-alphabet-inc-ordinary-shares-class-c\">GOOG</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/googl-alphabet-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">GOOGL</url>) -- along with rising regulatory concerns under a new president and a potentially L-shaped recession that drags on and lowers demand for e-commerce and cloud computing. </p><p>While Amazon has a dominant position in e-commerce, it is facing increasing direct-to-consumer online sales competition from a host of businesses both big and small. But because online sales still represent a relatively small -- albeit growing -- portion of total retail sales, it seems that there could be room for other players without posing a huge competitive risk for Amazon in the short term. </p><p>\"The pie is so big, and Amazon can't even eat a whole slice,\" Fox says. </p><p>Plus, other players currently can't match the vast array of items that Amazon sells, he adds. </p><p>Bailey views Walmart ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/wmt-walmart-inc\">WMT</url>) as the only real e-commerce competitor for Amazon in the U.S., with Microsoft ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corporation\">MSFT</url>) and Alphabet its main rivals in cloud computing. </p><p>\"For both market segments, we view the current dynamics as a winners-take-all type of setting where scale matters,\" Bailey says. \"We view both Amazon and Walmart as gaining share over smaller competitors in e-commerce, while the top three cloud computing giants will likely extend their leads over smaller ankle biters.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bottom Line: Should You Buy Amazon Stock?</emphasis></p><p>As a quality name with growth prospects, it seems like Amazon could be a buy for long-term investors. </p><p>Fox says that investors need to have Amazon in their portfolios over the long term. \"You have to hold on to it or you have to buy,\" he says. </p><p>For investors that don't have any Amazon exposure, Bailey favors easing into a position gradually but stopping short of taking a full market weighting of the stock. For those investors holding a lot more than the company's market weight, he suggests considering trimming positions to lock in some gains, especially if other FAANG stocks are a big part of your portfolio. People who don't own any other FAANGs could take Amazon holdings closer to its market weight. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/pros-and-cons-of-buying-netflix-inc-nflx-stock\">Should You Buy Netflix (NFLX) Stock?</url>]</p><p>Feeney likes Amazon as a company, but she thinks there are less expensive ways to gain exposure to e-commerce and cloud trends, naming Zebra Technologies Corp.

But because growth expectations are so high and there is a risk of overpaying for shares, those investors may want to consider buying during price dips. </p><p>In the meantime, stocking up on shares of other companies exposed to the same growth trends as Amazon might not be a bad idea either. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matt Whittaker</emphasis> began writing for U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2015, covering investing topics.

Their long-term growth prospects come mainly from their ability to dominate their markets.\"\u00a0</p><p>But the Faangs face significant risks, and the weight of expectation means that when those risks rear their head the reaction is dramatic.</p><p>Facebook shares, for example, have fallen by 40pc since their July peak. Shares in all the Faang stocks have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/big-faang-short-alternative-tech-stocks-portfolio/\">fallen by over 20pc</url> since their summer highs, losing $1 trillion in collective value during a rocky October for global markets.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/big-faang-short-alternative-tech-stocks-portfolio/\">Tech wreck Big Tech shares have lost $1tn in value this year</url></p><p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at trading service IG, said: \"These stocks face the tyranny of high expectations. People have piled in and expect them to do well quarter after quarter. They have all cornered their markets and have solid margins, but inevitably take it hard when they don't meet expectations.\"\u00a0</p><p>Many investors will be asking themselves whether they should take a punt and\u00a0bag themselves a bargain by buying into the tech giants while their prices are lower.\u00a0</p><p>To help make up your mind, before you invest, here are the key risks facing each of the Faangs.\u00a0</p><p>                       Reader Service: Gain trusted, friendly, face-to-face advice on your <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/big-faang-short-alternative-tech-stocks-portfolio/\">investments</url> from a local expert adviser                   </p><p>Facebook</p><p>Facebook set out some of the problems it faced in its recent earnings report: slowing revenue growth, rising costs following recent scandals, a failure to add users in America and a loss of users in Europe - markets where it makes much of its profit.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Beauchamp said: \"Young people are turning away from Facebook in favour of other platforms. Most of Facebook's profits come from selling adverts in the wealthiest markets - if those are weaker, can new markets compensate for that?\"</p><p>He added that despite weathering the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook users' data was misused, there was still a potential threat from regulation. The remedies taken, and the need for increased spending on security, are potentially\u00a0costly.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/big-faang-short-alternative-tech-stocks-portfolio/\">At a glance | FAANG stocks</url>Amazon</p><p>Amazon has disrupted or is attempting to disrupt a number of industries: high street retail, food delivery, consumer technology, music streaming, cloud computing and more.</p><p>\"The driver of Amazon over the past few years has been its move into cloud computing - it's because of that cash engine that it has been able to invest in everything else,\" said Mr Beauchamp. He added that Google and Microsoft were major rivals to that part of its\u00a0business.</p><p>There is also a risk from regulators. \"The American government could say this is ridiculous - it's crowding out every market and taking on one industry at a time. It's an apocalyptic scenario, but it is a possibility,\" Beauchamp said.</p><p>Apple</p><p>Apple is undeniably reliant on the iPhone, which accounts for two thirds of its revenues. \"Apple is an iPhone machine, but it doesn't have the same ability to produce blockbuster numbers just by revealing a new model,\" said Mr Beauchamp.</p><p>\"For companies built on the foundation of excellent further growth, revising expectations down is a problem.\"</p><p>The firm is moving towards being a service company via iCloud and Apple Music, he said, but it is not the high growth stock it once was.</p><p>\"Apple is becoming a much cheaper stock in valuation terms than it used to be, so it's possible you're seeing the transition to it being a more boring, cash-generating business,\" said Mr Beauchamp.</p><p>The company has a large cash pile, while a smartphone is now considered more of a staple than a luxury. Apple would also be an obvious casualty if the trade war between America and China worsened. It has Chinese suppliers and its own factories in China, and sells millions of products there annually.</p><p>Neil Goddin, manager of the Kames Global Equity fund, said: \"If the Chinese government tells people not to buy American goods, they will listen. Apple also faces many of the same risks it always has: competition is high, the smartphone takeover may be nearing the end, and it has struggled to find growth in China and India.\"</p><p>Netflix</p><p>Streaming service Netflix, which has a market value of $150bn, has been investing huge amounts in creating original programming - spending in 2018 is expected to be $13bn. But it has significant competition in Amazon's Prime Video service and could face rivalry from Google and Apple too.</p><p>Mr Goddin said: \"The fact customers pay $10 a month makes the product brilliant, but I struggle to believe it will ever be able to charge $20 or $30, as that enters the realm of traditional content providers.\"</p><p>He added that, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 153, the valuation of the company was \"crazy\".\u00a0</p><p>There is also a question over how effective its spending on content is. \"It can outspend anybody, and is happy to, but producing so much leads to duffs and dilutes quality,\" Mr Goddin said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/big-faang-short-alternative-tech-stocks-portfolio/\">Fund tips | Five funds with tech exposure</url>Google</p><p>Like Amazon, Google relies on the money generated by one portion of its business - advertising - to invest in all of its other ventures.

Stories of $640 toilet seats and $37 screws come to mind. Budgeting and buying may not be Uncle Sam's strong suit, but investing is a different story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-hated-earnings-stocks-you-should-love.html-16\">&gt;&gt;5 Hated Earnings Stocks You Should Love</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Government investments have been conspicuous losers in recent years, like the $10.5 billion lost on the bailout of General Motors or the now-you-see-it-now-you-don't profit made on American International Group . But while those deals have grabbed headlines, they weren't actually investments; they were bailouts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, governments' investment funds are some of the most ignored big-dollar professionally managed portfolios out there. And they're not relegated to the U.S. Federal government -- individual state trusts and foreign governments' sovereign wealth funds add up to some huge assets under management.</p><p>While we can't peek into all government investment accounts, the SEC's own rules can help us get the details on eight of the biggest with U.S.-domiciled accounts.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/case-correction-stocks.html\">&gt;&gt;The Case for a Correction in Stocks</url></p><p>With $47.2 billion in stocks as of the most recent quarter, it makes sense to pay attention to these government funds' favorite stocks in 2014. To do that, we'll use 13F filings.</p><p>Institutional investors with more than $100 million in assets are required to file a 13F -- a form that breaks down their stock positions for public consumption. From hedge funds to mutual funds to insurance companies to governments, any professional investors who manage more than that $100 million watermark are required to file a 13F.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/invest-venture-capitalist-these-5-stocks.html\">&gt;&gt;Invest Like a Venture Capitalist With These 5 Stocks</url></p><p>Today, well focus on<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/government-funds-favorite-stocks/\">five stocks government-managed funds bought most during the last quarter</url>.</p><p>Level 3 Communications</p><p>Government-run funds really like integrated telecom firm Level 3Communications -- not that it should come as any surprise. Level 3 has been a stellar performer in the last 12 months, tacking nearly 44% onto its share price over that time period. So government investors have been piling on another 450,000 shares in the most recent quarter, boosting their stake by more than $15 million at current share prices.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-big-tech-stocks-sell-right-now.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Big Tech Stocks to Sell Right Now</url></p><p>Level 3 is a wholesale communications provider. The firm helps enterprise and carrier customers deliver voice, IP and video and content worldwide over its tier 1 network (it's one of only six in the world). LVLT also operates the largest competitive local exchange carrier in the country. Level 3's deep Internet infrastructure should continue to generate strong demand as data consumption continues to rise globally. Likewise, the firm's scale makes it an obvious partner for major communications carriers, and it's got an impressive client list to show for it. Those clients are also incredibly sticky, since few rivals can step in and replace LVLT's infrastructure.</p><p>That said, owning valuable infrastructure is expensive. Historically, Level 3 has paid its way by carrying a very leveraged balance sheet; at last count, the firm had more than $8 billion in net debt on the books. While Level 3 has gotten close to getting itself in trouble with debt in the past, it's been making some impressive strides towards profitability in 2013. That could greatly change this stock's fortunes as we get deeper into 2014. Earnings on Feb. 5 should be telling.</p><p>While Level 3's debt load continues to be a concern, this stock is showing some promise. And government funds (Singapore's in particular) are betting big on shares right now with nearly half of the firm's outstanding shares in tow.</p><p>Apple</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/why-wall-street-got-apple-wrong-week.html\">Take it from me</url>-- the past five months have been strong for shareholders of tech behemoth Apple . Shares of AAPL are up more than 21% since September. And despite the recent upside, the $491 billion device maker still looks cheap from a valuation standpoint.</p><p>Government funds agree. They picked up 678,000 shares of AAPL in the last quarter, hiking their holdings by 50%.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-48\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url></p><p>That brings the value of government funds' ownership in Apple to nearly $1 billion at current prices.</p><p>Apple is one of the most profitable technology manufacturers in the world. At the same time that PC makers and mobile device rivals are fighting a race to the bottom on margins to stay competitive, Apple still converts more than 20 cents on every sales dollar into profit. It's done that by establishing a deep economic moat over its ecosystem, incentivizing users to \"keep it in the family\" with innovative products that work well. That's borne out by usage metrics; while Apple's iOS isn't the dominant mobile operating system, for instance, it is the most used by far.</p><p>The firm's dominance has done a good job of scaring investors away. After all, how much longer can Apple's breakneck growth rates continue? But with $130 billion in net cash and investments, the firm has enough cash to retire more than 26% of its outstanding shares at current prices. Ex-cash, Apple currently trades for a paltry P/E ratio of 10.</p><p>Even if the company never experiences growth again, Apple sports a dirt-cheap price tag in 2014.</p><p>Exxon Mobil</p><p>High oil prices have fueled some substantial growth in Exxon Mobil in recent years, turning more projects economically viable and funding critical acquisitions. And as crude prices continue to sit on the high end of their historic range, Exxon should continue to throw off serious cash to investors, including government funds.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-insiders-love-right-now.html-44\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Insiders Love Right Now</url>In the most recent quarter, government investors added 2.85 million Exxon shares to their portfolios -- a $282 million increase at current prices.</p><p>Exxon is the world's biggest oil and gas supermajor, with proven reserves of 18.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. More than half of Exxon's reserves are oil, which means that the firm enjoys a rich sales mix that's skewed heavily towards the commodity that'll give it the most bang for its buck. The acquisition of XTO Energy in 2010 dramatically increased Exxon's natural gas exposure, and diluted net margins in exchange for overall growth. While that decision was somewhat controversial, I think it'll prove to be one of the best ways to achieve meaningful growth for investors given Exxon's previous size.</p><p>Because Exxon is an integrated oil and gas firm, it has a hand in every step of the energy business, from pulling oil out of the ground to refining it to retailing it at its gas stations. The firm's downstream operations have historically been excellent, driving much better returns than peers that have been busy spinning off their own downstream assets.</p><p>For investors looking for energy sector exposure, it's hard to go wrong with Exxon and its 2.5% dividend yield.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson</p><p>Government funds kept up with the uber-blue-chip theme last quarter, picking up 2.47 million shares of $267 billion health care name Johnson &amp; Johnson . That buy operation doubled the funds' exposure to JNJ, making it a significant bet on the firm.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-rocket-stocks-stomp-sp-2014.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Rocket Stocks to Stomp the S&amp;P in 2014</url></p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is the biggest health care company, best known for consumer brands such as Band-Aid, Tylenol, Neutrogena and Acuvue. But the consumer divisions are just the tip of the iceberg; Johnson &amp; Johnson's pharmaceutical and medical device businesses make up the most important part of the income statement. That huge level of diversification is a major benefit for shareholders -- it spares investors from overblown exposure to drug patent losses, health care regulations and economic hiccups.</p><p>While the acquisition of orthopedic device firm Synthes ate up a big chunk of Johnson &amp; Johnson's net cash, the firm's balance sheet is still pristine with around $15.5 billion in net cash on the books. Johnson &amp; Johnson's combined health care business enjoys some massive net profit margins -- nearly 17% in the most recent quarter. Those huge profits should continue to contribute to shareholder yield: Currently, the firm pays out a 2.8% dividend yield on top of the 30% gains shares saw last year.</p><p>Wells Fargo</p><p>Last up on government funds' \"buy list\" is big bank Wells Fargo . The funds picked up 4.93 million shares of WFC in the last quarter, once again doubling their exposure to the stock. So should you buy it too?</p><p>Wells Fargo earned a reputation for being the best-in-breed of the big banking names during the Great Recession. The firm's businesses range from all of the conventional retail and commercial banking to wealth management, investment brokerage, and investment banking. And while Wells certainly didn't skate through the financial crisis of 2008, it managed to exit the environment bigger and stronger by buying floundering Wachovia at fire sale prices.</p><p>But while there isn't a lot to hate about Wells Fargo, there isn't a lot to be exited about either. Yard for yard, Wells Fargo isn't much different from any of the other big-four banks in the U.S. Most of the kinks have been worked out of WFC's labyrinthine balance sheet at this point, but there are some smaller banking names with bigger fee-based sales streams that look more interesting right now. BNY Mellon (BK) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) are more unique alternatives worth a closer look.</p><p>To see these stocks in action, check out the<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/government-funds-favorite-stocks/\">Government Investment Fund Buys portfolio</url>on Stockpickr.  </p><p>-- Written by Jonas Elmerraji in Baltimore.</p><p>RELATED LINKS:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-set-soar-bullish-earnings.html-76?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Set to Soar on Bullish Earnings</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/3-stocks-spiking-big-volume.html-13?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;3 Stocks Spiking on Big Volume</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-set-soar.html-59?cm_ven=splinks\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Set to Soar</url></p><p>Follow Stockpickr on<url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/stockpickr\">Twitter</url>and become a fan on      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stockpickr/129281803913?ref=ts\">Facebook</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-12239772</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B97-9P11-F03D-6333-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1586\"/><timeReceived>07:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 TheStreet.com, Inc.
