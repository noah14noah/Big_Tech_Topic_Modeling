The centers can offer a more convenient alternative to long wait times in a hospital's emergency department, or waiting for a visit with your regular doctor. The centers can also be hard to distinguish from urgent care centers or emergency rooms connected to a hospital. Visiting them can lead to surprisingly high bills[1]. Insurers like UnitedHealth Group are sounding the alarm on freestanding emergency departments, saying that moving visits away from the departments and into doctor's offices or urgent care facilities could reduce annual healthcare spending by $800 million in Texas alone. </p><p>A new kind of doctor's office that acts like the emergency room you might find in a major hospital is gaining ground \u2014 and it's worrying insurers. The centers, known as free-standing emergency departments, offer a more convenient alternative to long wait times in a hospital's emergency department or waiting for a visit with your regular doctor. Some are affiliated with hospitals, while others operate independently, sometimes with private-equity backing. Because of the centers' emergency-room status, they're able to bill insurers and individuals more than a standard primary-care or urgent-care visit, even if they're treating a condition like a fever or infection. Free-standing emergency departments have more than doubled over the past decade, growing from 222 centers in 2008 to 566 in 2016 according to a recent report from UnitedHealth Group.[2] In states like Colorado and Texas, the model has been popular in wealthier[3] areas. Elsewhere in the US, hospitals have been experimenting with building stand-alone emergency centers closer to where people live as a more convenient alternative. Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, the president of Gist Healthcare, which consults with health systems, told Business Insider that there are parts of suburban Texas where emergency departments \u2014 as well as urgent care centers[4] \u2014 are conforming to the Starbucks model. That is, popping up across the street from one another or along the same road until the businesses start to see demand drop. In some cases, some of the operators of free-standing emergency departments in Texas have filed for bankruptcy[5].Never miss out on healthcare news.

But they can leave people on the hook[7] for thousand-dollar[8] bills for simple procedures. For instance, a patient who came into a Houston-area center after experiencing dizziness racked up $15,000 in charges for what turned out to be fluid in her ears, of which her insurer expected her to cover more than $13,000, the Houston Chronicle reported in February.[9] In Colorado, the family of a two-year-old found themselves on the hook for a $6,420 bill[10] after taking her to a freestanding emergency center for a bump to her head, Colorado Public Radio reported in April 2018[11]. UnitedHealth Group and other insurers have been investigating the impact the centers have on patient care and spending. In UnitedHealth's recent report, the healthcare giant found that centers in Texas were predominantly treating common conditions such as fevers and infections at emergency room prices, which are much higher than a typical doctor's visit. Should common visits shift out of the free-standing emergency department to a doctor's office or urgent care center, the costs associated with that care would drop by 95%,the company said in its report.[12] That amounts to roughly $800 million in Texas alone.

In 2018,nearly half of Americans under 65[15]with private health insurance had high-deductible plans[16], up from about 25% in 2010. Those plans require a person to spend thousands out of his or her own pocket before their health insurance starts covering their care.How free-standing emergency departments workFree-standing emergency departments got a boost in 2009 when Texas passed a law that allowed for them to spring up in the state.[17] They're staffed by doctors and can do a lot of the diagnostics that a hospital-connected ER can, but they're not equipped to do all of it. Car crashes, strokes and other more serious illnesses and injuries still get transferred to the hospital. \"We put locations in convenient neighborhood communities and provide a high level of care to our patients with a short wait time,\" Jennifer Martin, the digital marketing manager for Signature Care, which owns 16 emergency-room locations in Texas, particularly in Houston, told Business Insider. The model takes a lot of education, too. Martin said that Signature Care make it clear when patients call that the center is for emergency care and acts just as an emergency room with emergency room-level prices. According to an analysis conducted by UnitedHealth, the most common visits to free-standing emergency centers in Texas were for fevers, acute bronchitis, acute pharyngitis (otherwise known as sore throat), acute upper respiratory infections, and coughs. The company found that visits to the centers cost 22 times what a doctor's visit would, and 19 times what an urgent care appointment would. Under Texas law[18], insurers are required to pay for emergency care for their members, even if the place they get their care is out of network, keeping many of the free-standing emergency rooms in service.The case of urgent cares transforming into emergency roomsDr. Sabrina Poon, an emergency-medicine doctor at Vanderbilt University, has been looking into the different ways patients decide to get care, such as at urgent care centers and free-standing emergency departments. \"I'm stepping into it from a lens of trying to figure out why patients are going to these different venues,\" Poon said. As part of her research[19], Poon and her colleagues took a look at three instances of urgent care centers that had converted to free-standing emergency centers in Texas to get a sense of what changes those centers had to make. To be sure, there haven't been many instances of urgent care centers transitioning into free-standing emergency centers, Poon said. For the most part, the scope of visitors didn't change at the three sites, and a lot of folks came in for the same conditions they would have if they were going to an urgent care center. But the centers were raking in a lot more money. The median reimbursement for a visit to one facility jumped from $148 to $2,153. At another facility, revenues jumped from $637,585 as an urgent care site to $8,429,828 looking one year before and after the conversion, respectively. \"I think they provide good care but the question is, in this era of skyrocketing health costs, what can we do to keep the care affordable and make it better,\" Poon said.

Some are affiliated with hospitals, while others operate independently, sometimes with private-equity backing. Because of the centers' emergency-room status, they're able to bill insurers and individuals more than a standard primary-care or urgent-care visit, even if they're treating a condition like a fever or infection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Free-standing emergency departments have more than doubled over the past decade, growing from 222 centers in 2008 to 566 in 2016 according to a recent report from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/2017/Freestanding-ER-Cost-Analysis.pdf\">UnitedHealth Group.</url> In states like Colorado and Texas, the model has been popular in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coloradohealthinstitute.org/sites/default/files/file_attachments/FSED%20mapping%20paper%20March%2018.pdf\">wealthier</url> areas. Elsewhere in the US, hospitals have been experimenting with building stand-alone emergency centers closer to where people live as a more convenient alternative.\u00a0</p><p>Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, the president of Gist Healthcare, which consults with health systems, told Business Insider that there are parts of suburban Texas where emergency departments - as well as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/urgent-care-is-changing-how-americans-access-healthcare-2018-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">urgent care centers</url> - are conforming to the Starbucks model. That is, popping up across the street from one another or along the same road until the businesses start to see demand drop.</p><p>In some cases, some of the operators of free-standing emergency departments <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/financial-problems-threaten-freestanding-emergency-rooms\">in Texas have filed for bankruptcy</url>.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Never miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, our weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.</emphasis></p><p>With \"emergency\" in the name, the centers don't look all that different from an emergency room attached to a hospital, and because they show up in many the same places as urgent care centers, it can often be hard for consumers to tell the difference. But they can leave <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpr.org/news/story/as-freestanding-ers-proliferate-colorado-lawmakers-finally-find-traction-on-regulation\">people on the hook</url> for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Cracking-the-Code-How-facility-procedure-codes-13635306.php#photo-16969078\">thousand-dollar</url> bills for simple procedures.\u00a0</p><p>For instance, a patient who came into a Houston-area center after experiencing dizziness racked up $15,000 in charges for what turned out to be fluid in her ears, of which her insurer expected her to cover more than $13,000, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Cracking-the-Code-How-facility-procedure-codes-13635306.php#photo-16969078\">the Houston Chronicle reported in February.</url> In Colorado, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpr.org/news/story/as-freestanding-ers-proliferate-colorado-lawmakers-finally-find-traction-on-regulation\">family of a two-year-old found themselves on the hook for a $6,420 bill</url> after taking her to a freestanding emergency center for a bump to her head,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpr.org/news/story/as-freestanding-ers-proliferate-colorado-lawmakers-finally-find-traction-on-regulation\">Colorado Public Radio reported in April 2018</url>.\u00a0</p><p>UnitedHealth Group and other insurers have been investigating the impact the centers have on patient care and spending. In UnitedHealth's recent report, the healthcare giant found that centers in Texas were predominantly treating common conditions such as fevers and infections at emergency room prices, which are much higher than a typical doctor's visit.</p><p>Should common visits shift out of the free-standing emergency department to a doctor's office or urgent care center, the costs associated with that care would drop by 95%,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/2017/Freestanding-ER-Cost-Analysis.pdf\">the company said in its report.</url> That amounts to roughly $800 million in Texas alone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more: The doctor who founded CityMD and sold it for $600 million explains how a new kind of medical clinic is changing how Americans get healthcare</emphasis></p><p>It's happening at a time when patients are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lillys-50-price-cut-to-insulin-humalog-is-still-unaffordable-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">more on the hook</url> than ever before for the cost of their medical care. In 2018,\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201811.pdf\">nearly half of Americans under 65</url>\u00a0with private health insurance had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-high-deductible-health-insurance-plans-dont-work-2018-11?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">high-deductible plans</url>, up from about 25% in 2010. Those plans require a person to spend thousands out of his or her own pocket before their health insurance starts covering their care.</p><h>How free-standing emergency departments work</h><p>Free-standing emergency departments got a boost in 2009 when Texas passed a law that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/facilities/freestanding-emergency-rooms/default.aspx\">allowed for them to spring up in the state.</url>\u00a0</p><p>They're staffed by doctors and can do a lot of the diagnostics that a hospital-connected ER can, but they're not equipped to do all of it. Car crashes, strokes and other more serious illnesses and injuries still get transferred to the hospital.</p><p>\"We put locations in convenient neighborhood communities and provide a high level of care to our patients with a short wait time,\" Jennifer Martin, the digital marketing manager for Signature Care, which owns 16 emergency-room locations in Texas, particularly in Houston, told Business Insider.\u00a0</p><p>The model takes a lot of education, too. Martin said that Signature Care make it clear when patients call that the center is for emergency care and acts just as an emergency room with emergency room-level prices.\u00a0</p><p>According to an analysis conducted by UnitedHealth, the most common visits to free-standing emergency centers in Texas were for fevers, acute bronchitis, acute pharyngitis (otherwise known as sore throat), acute upper respiratory infections, and coughs. The company found that visits to the centers cost 22 times what a doctor's visit would, and 19 times what an urgent care appointment would.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/IN/htm/IN.1301.htm#1301.155\">Under Texas law</url>, insurers are required to pay for emergency care for their members, even if the place they get their care is out of network, keeping many of the free-standing emergency rooms in service.\u00a0</p><h>The case of urgent cares transforming into emergency rooms</h><p>Dr. Sabrina Poon, an emergency-medicine doctor at Vanderbilt University, has been looking into the different ways patients decide to get care, such as at urgent care centers and free-standing emergency departments.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm stepping into it from a lens of trying to figure out why patients are going to these different venues,\" Poon said.\u00a0</p><p>As part of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jem-journal.com/article/S0736-4679(18)31202-2/fulltext\">her research</url>, Poon and her colleagues took a look at three instances of urgent care centers that had converted to free-standing emergency centers in Texas to get a sense of what changes those centers had to make. To be sure, there haven't been many instances of urgent care centers transitioning into free-standing emergency centers, Poon said.</p><p>For the most part, the scope of visitors didn't change at the three sites, and a lot of folks came in for the same conditions they would have if they were going to an urgent care center. But the centers were raking in a lot more money.</p><p>The median reimbursement for a visit to one facility jumped from $148 to $2,153. At another facility, revenues jumped from $637,585 as an urgent care site to $8,429,828 looking one year before and after the conversion, respectively.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think they provide good care but the question is, in this era of skyrocketing health costs, what can we do to keep the care affordable and make it better,\" Poon said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Want to tell us about your healthcare experience?

Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That set the tone for the hours of sharp questioning of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Mr Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mr Tim Cook of Apple, Mr Sundar Pichai of Google and Mr Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to the GDP of Japan.</p><p> Given the history of Silicon Valley's relationship with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommittee members' questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significant tech regulation may be closer than we think.</p><p> Despite its techno-libertarian image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants. In the late 1970s, venture capitalists and semiconductor chief executives got Capitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulations. In the 1980s, a group of young legislators became such boosters of the industry that they were known as \"Atari Democrats\". President Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competition.</p><p> The bipartisan love affair intensified in the 1990s as president Bill Clinton and vice-president Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early Internet-era policymaking. Mr Newt Gingrich, then the Republican Speaker of the House, talked up cyberspace and formed close alliances with libertarian-minded tech thinkers.</p><p> The lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy Internet companies could regulate themselves.</p><p> Washington's embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry's wealth and power. A 2013 Senate hearing to interrogate Mr Cook about Apple's tax avoidance quickly was sidetracked by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company's innovative products. Mr Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise.</p><p> \"Google is still the story of the American dream,\" declared Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee's chairman at the time.</p><p> Those days seemed a dim memory last Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyse significantly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressional inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousness starting with Senate hearings in the summer of 1965, where top auto executives faced sharp questions about their lax approach to safety.</p><p> The evening network news programmes showed Mr Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year, a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Mr Ralph Nader, published a blockbuster expose of the industry, Unsafe At Any Speed. This combination of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seat belts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvements like guardrails and traffic barriers.</p><p> Wednesday felt like Big Tech's Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questioning by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representatives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania; the crescendo of investigative journalism that, in part, led to last week's hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech's practices. And now, this House subcommittee is merely one of several legislative or regulatory bodies considering limits on Big Tech's power.</p><p> There are, of course, many reasons tech regulation may not come to pass. The issues at stake are wickedly complex, and quite different for each of these companies, something chief executives sought to underscore in the hearing.</p><p> \"It appears to me,\" Mr Bezos observed, \"that social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don't think that's helpful for a democracy.\" (Mr Zuckerberg's reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.) Large tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learnt a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space.</p><p> Although the trial didn't end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the years-long policy scrutiny now facing its peers.</p><p> Then there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments - carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s - the problems posed by unregulated bigness were clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe.</p><p> Tech's consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinformation, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm.</p><p> We may wish we used our smartphones less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communities and brains. But we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click \"buy\" on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representatives noted, we do so because we have little alternative.</p><p> What happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But last week marks the end of Washington's great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies' bigness possible in the first place.</p><p> NYTIMES</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mr David Cicilline, chairman of the US House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, speaking during a hearing on \"Online Platforms and Market Power\" at Capitol Hill, Washington, last Wednesday.

Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That set the tone for the hours of sharp questioning of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to the G.D.P. of Japan.</p><p>Given the history of Silicon Valley's relationship with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommittee members' questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significant tech regulation may be closer than we think.</p><p>Despite its techno-libertarian image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants.</p><p>In the late 1970s, venture capitalists and semiconductor chief executives got Capitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulations. In the 1980s, a group of young legislators became such boosters of the industry that they were known as \"Atari Democrats.\" Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competition.</p><p>The bipartisan love affair intensified in the 1990s as Bill Clinton and Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early internet-era policymaking. Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House, talked up cyberspace and formed close alliances with libertarian-minded tech thinkers. His party's leaders convened \"high-tech summits\" on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy internet companies could regulate themselves.</p><p>Washington's embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry's wealth and power. A 2013 Senate hearing to interrogate Mr. Cook about Apple's tax avoidance quickly was sidetracked by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company's innovative products. Mr. Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise.</p><p>\"Google is still the story of the American dream,\" declared Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee's chairman at the time.</p><p>Those days seemed a dim memory Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyze significantly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressional inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousness starting with Senate hearings in the summer of 1965, where top auto executives faced sharp questions about their lax approach to safety.</p><p>The evening network news programs showed Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Ralph Nader, published a blockbuster expos\u00e9 of the industry, \"Unsafe at Any Speed.\"</p><p>This combination of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seatbelts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvements like guardrails and traffic barriers.</p><p>Wednesday felt like Big Tech's Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questioning by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representatives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania; the crescendo of investigative journalism that, in part, led to this week's hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech's practices. And now, this House subcommittee is merely one of several legislative or regulatory bodies considering limits on Big Tech's power.</p><p>There are of course many reasons tech regulation may not come to pass. The issues at stake are wickedly complex, and quite different for each of these companies, something chief executives sought to underscore in the hearing.</p><p>\"It appears to me,\" Mr. Bezos observed, \"that social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don't think that's helpful for a democracy.\" (Mr. Zuckerberg's reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.)</p><p>Large tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learned a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space.</p><p>Although the trial didn't end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the yearslong policy scrutiny now facing its peers.</p><p>Then there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments - carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s - the problems posed by unregulated bigness were clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe.</p><p>Tech's consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinformation, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm. We may wish we used our smartphones less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communities and brains.</p><p>But we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click \"buy\" on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representatives noted, we do so because we have little alternative.</p><p>What happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But this week marks the end of Washington's great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies' bigness possible in the first place.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That set the tone for the hours of sharp questioning of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">G.D.P. of Japan</url>.</p><p>Given the history of Silicon Valley\u2019s relationship with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommittee members\u2019 questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significant tech regulation may be closer than we think.</p><p>Despite its techno-libertarian image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants.</p><p>In the late 1970s, venture capitalists and semiconductor chief executives<url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">got</url> Capitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulations. In the 1980s, a group of young legislators became such boosters of the industry that they were known as \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">Atari Democrats</url>.\u201d Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competition.</p><p>The bipartisan love affair intensified in the 1990s as Bill Clinton and Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early internet-era policymaking. Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House, <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">talked up cyberspace</url> and formed close alliances with libertarian-minded tech thinkers. His party\u2019s leaders convened \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">high-tech summits</url>\u201d on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy internet companies could regulate themselves.</p><p>Washington\u2019s embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry\u2019s wealth and power. A 2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">Senate hearing</url> to interrogate Mr. Cook about Apple\u2019s tax avoidance quickly was sidetracked by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company\u2019s innovative products. Mr. Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise.</p><p>\u201cGoogle is still the story of the American dream,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">declared</url> Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee\u2019s chairman at the time.</p><p>Those days seemed a dim memory Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyze significantly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressional inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousness starting with Senate hearings in <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">the summer of 1965</url>, where top auto executives faced sharp questions about their lax approach to safety.</p><p>The evening network news programs showed Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Ralph Nader, published a blockbuster expos\u00e9 of the industry, \u201cUnsafe at Any Speed.\u201d</p><p>This combination of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seatbelts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvements like guardrails and traffic barriers.</p><p>Wednesday felt like Big Tech\u2019s Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questioning by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representatives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania; the crescendo of investigative journalism that, in part, led to this week\u2019s hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech\u2019s practices. And now, this House subcommittee is merely one of several legislative or regulatory bodies considering limits on Big Tech\u2019s power.</p><p>There are of course many reasons tech regulation may not come to pass. The issues at stake are wickedly complex, and quite different for each of these companies, something chief executives sought to underscore in the hearing.</p><p>\u201cIt appears to me,\u201d Mr. Bezos observed, \u201cthat social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful for a democracy.\u201d (Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.)</p><p>Large tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learned a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space.</p><p>Although the trial didn\u2019t end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the yearslong policy scrutiny now facing its peers.</p><p>Then there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments \u2014 carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s \u2014 the problems posed by <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">unregulated bigness</url> were clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe.</p><p>Tech\u2019s consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinformation, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm. We may wish we used our smartphones less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communities and brains.</p><p>But we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click \u201cbuy\u201d on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representatives noted, we do so because we have little alternative.</p><p>What happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But this week marks the end of Washington\u2019s great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies\u2019 bigness possible in the first place.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=JP\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google are expected to answer some tough questions about business practices. Earlier this month, the four big tech companies were part of another hearing. On July 16, top-ranking executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google made their way down to the US Capitol for the House Judiciary Hearing, chaired by Congressman David N. Cicilline. The hearing stretched for nearly two hours, with questions from US Congress representatives including aspects such as company policies, predatory pricing, favouring own services, and more. Representating the companies were Amazon's associate general counsel Nate Sutton, Apple's vice president of corporate law and chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer, Facebook's head of global policy development Matt Perault, and Google's economic policy director Adam Cohen.   For those familiar with the format, the hearing brought back memories of the Congressional hearings of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, and his Google counterpart Sundar Pichai. The questions, however, remained more pointed towards the issues at hand, that of the power of the Big Tech quartet getting out of hand. The hearing, as it proceeded, reflected upon the blatant powerhouse that these corporate giants have become, leading to questions of anti-competitive practices, predatory pricing, deliberate favouring of own services and a murky failure of identifying misleading information in suspicious circumstances.   We have the key takeaways from the responses by the big tech companies from the July 16 hearing, just as a refresher ahead of today\u2019s expected hearing.   1. The main theme of the hearing remained in identifying whether these companies really had competition in the industry -- an aspect that is key to checking misuse of a dominant market position. One of the key points here came up when Representative Joe Neguse told Facebook's Perault, \"You can understand the skepticism, because when a company owns four of the six largest entities measured by active users in the world in that industry, it works as a monopoly, or at least as monopoly power.\" He further highlighted that under the Sherman Antitrust Act, whether or not a company engages in monopolistic practices depends on whether or not there is anti-competitive conduct at play. In response, Perault acknowledged that the documentary evidence that Neguse produced on Facebook's anti-competitive policy was indeed a part of the company once, which has since been altered \"to suit the constantly evolving nature of the industry\". However, in related questions through the hearing, when asked if he could produce a list of companies that Facebook considers is big enough to be counted as \"competition\", there was no conclusive answer drawn, much like how the affairs went down at Zuckerberg's hearing.   The others, meanwhile, did have competitors of note in their associated industries, and although their market dominance on paper is lesser than that of Facebook, the extent of the impact of competition remains to be answered. For instance, when Amazon's Sutton was asked by Representative Jamie Raskin about his company's market share, the figures he produced were of 1 percent market share in the global retail space, and 4 percent of the same industry in USA. When asked about who he identified as a competitor, he claimed to have data of Walmart being several times larger in volume of business. The extent and specific market filters in this case remained unanswered, and hence, inconclusive.   2. Apple faced the least intensity of the questioning, but aspects of its App Store practices and who it favours as its third party partners came up in the hearing. Apple executive Andeer stated on record that \"84 percent of all apps on the App Store are not subjected to the 30 percent tax that Apple imposes on developers marketing their services on the Apple ecosystem.\" He further claimed, \"Over 2 million apps available in the App Store pay nothing to Apple. It's only a very small percentage that pays a commission.\" When asked to elucidate specifically about Spotify, he said, \"They're one of our most successful developers, but they pay a commission on less than 1 percent of their subscribers to Apple.\" Taking a dig at the lawsuit that Spotify filed against Apple, Andeer concluded by saying that the music streaming service has built a \"very successful business, thanks to the App Store,\" before adding that Apple is \"very proud of their success.\" He denied claims of preferential treatment of Apple Music on the App Store, stating, \"we make it very easy for competitors to access each and every iOS user through the App Store, so Spotify, Google Play Music and dozens of others offer apps that compete with Apple Music.\"  Story continues  3. Amazon's Sutton faced a rough time explaining the process of using their own technology on a retail platform where they also sell their own hardware. He claimed that Amazon sells their own products because they do so at good quality and cheap pricing, in line with what consumers want. He further added that the \"The data on popularity of products -- like much retail data -- is actually public data. For each of our products, you can see where it's ranked, how popular it is. We do not use any of that specific seller data in creating our own private brand products.\" He further added, \"In fact, there are so many marketplaces that there's a billion-dollar industry that has grown up to provide services to sellers so that they can use them to list across all marketplaces at the same time.\" His responses were in answer to Amazon deliberately adopting policies that stifle retailers with smaller commercial power, thereby killing competition across multiple sectors of retail. However, the answers did not seem to satisfy the Representatives in their investigation of the fact that Amazon's hardware and platform integration is, in fact, designed to keep a user within their own ecosystem.   4. Google defended through its representative Cohen that \"you are free to use any other service, if you want to.\" The allegations against Google stated that their massively overpowering 'Search' platform has evolved in design to become one that keeps a user within their ecosystem. Cohen also answered in non-committal denial to Representative Lucy McBath's inquiry on non-removal of misinformation on the Google Maps platform, by stating that he was not aware of either the quoted WSJ article, or that there are 11 million fake locations registered within a particular region on Maps. Cohen also defended Google's monopolistic position in the search engine industry as \"incorrect\", stating that a lot of people use in-website search tools, thereby counting as competition to Google. There were also suggestions of some sort of a monopolistic collaboration between Apple and Google, and why Apple's Safari web browser used Google as the default search engine. In response, Apple's Andeer noted, \"We gathered data that most of our users prefer using Google to search for information, and hence the decision. However, we offer an easy way for any user to choose any alternative of their liking.\"   Above all other factors, what the hearing truly implicated is the sheer might and the common theme of murky policies that have a soundly reasoned backdoor for each of the Big Tech companies. These backdoors lie in properly defining a particular sector, and what \"competition\" really stands for. It is important to note what each company primarily deals in, and given that each of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google dabble with multiple industries at the same time, it raises, yet again, the unresolved question of whether these companies should be broken down into individual entities for competition's sake. As an umbrella, it is difficult to tie them down to one particular industry, thereby giving them the power to define their own rules by virtue of creating their own niche.   The hearing's conclusion also calls for significantly stronger regulations in the technology sphere, where governments need to impose far more stringent laws in terms of defining terms such as \"anti-competitive practices\", \"misuse of market dominance\" and so on. This, however, is tied to the foremost implication of how these companies are involved in multiple industries, which makes regulations more difficult to be imposed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42709316318</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-5BD1-JCSC-J068-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

As we head to another congressional hearing on antitrust later today, it is expected that representatives from four of the world\u2019s largest tech companies will have some defending to do. Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s Google are expected to answer some tough questions about business practices. Earlier this month, the four big tech companies were part of another hearing. On July 16, top-ranking executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google made their way down to the US Capitol for the House Judiciary Hearing, chaired by Congressman David N. Cicilline. The hearing stretched for nearly two hours, with questions from US Congress representatives including aspects such as company policies, predatory pricing, favouring own services, and more. Representating the companies were Amazon's associate general counsel Nate Sutton, Apple's vice president of corporate law and chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer, Facebook's head of global policy development Matt Perault, and Google's economic policy director Adam Cohen.   For those familiar with the format, the hearing brought back memories of the Congressional hearings of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, and his Google counterpart Sundar Pichai. The questions, however, remained more pointed towards the issues at hand, that of the power of the Big Tech quartet getting out of hand. The hearing, as it proceeded, reflected upon the blatant powerhouse that these corporate giants have become, leading to questions of anti-competitive practices, predatory pricing, deliberate favouring of own services and a murky failure of identifying misleading information in suspicious circumstances.    We have the key takeaways from the responses by the big tech companies from the July 16 hearing, just as a refresher ahead of today\u2019s expected hearing.   1. The main theme of the hearing remained in identifying whether these companies really had competition in the industry -- an aspect that is key to checking misuse of a dominant market position. One of the key points here came up when Representative Joe Neguse told Facebook's Perault, \"You can understand the skepticism, because when a company owns four of the six largest entities measured by active users in the world in that industry, it works as a monopoly, or at least as monopoly power.\" He further highlighted that under the Sherman Antitrust Act, whether or not a company engages in monopolistic practices depends on whether or not there is anti-competitive conduct at play. In response, Perault acknowledged that the documentary evidence that Neguse produced on Facebook's anti-competitive policy was indeed a part of the company once, which has since been altered \"to suit the constantly evolving nature of the industry\". However, in related questions through the hearing, when asked if he could produce a list of companies that Facebook considers is big enough to be counted as \"competition\", there was no conclusive answer drawn, much like how the affairs went down at Zuckerberg's hearing.   The others, meanwhile, did have competitors of note in their associated industries, and although their market dominance on paper is lesser than that of Facebook, the extent of the impact of competition remains to be answered. For instance, when Amazon's Sutton was asked by Representative Jamie Raskin about his company's market share, the figures he produced were of 1 percent market share in the global retail space, and 4 percent of the same industry in USA. When asked about who he identified as a competitor, he claimed to have data of Walmart being several times larger in volume of business. The extent and specific market filters in this case remained unanswered, and hence, inconclusive.   2. Apple faced the least intensity of the questioning, but aspects of its App Store practices and who it favours as its third party partners came up in the hearing. Apple executive Andeer stated on record that \"84 percent of all apps on the App Store are not subjected to the 30 percent tax that Apple imposes on developers marketing their services on the Apple ecosystem.\" He further claimed, \"Over 2 million apps available in the App Store pay nothing to Apple. It's only a very small percentage that pays a commission.\" When asked to elucidate specifically about Spotify, he said, \"They're one of our most successful developers, but they pay a commission on less than 1 percent of their subscribers to Apple.\" Taking a dig at the lawsuit that Spotify filed against Apple, Andeer concluded by saying that the music streaming service has built a \"very successful business, thanks to the App Store,\" before adding that Apple is \"very proud of their success.\" He denied claims of preferential treatment of Apple Music on the App Store, stating, \"we make it very easy for competitors to access each and every iOS user through the App Store, so Spotify, Google Play Music and dozens of others offer apps that compete with Apple Music.\"    3. Amazon's Sutton faced a rough time explaining the process of using their own technology on a retail platform where they also sell their own hardware. He claimed that Amazon sells their own products because they do so at good quality and cheap pricing, in line with what consumers want. He further added that the \"The data on popularity of products -- like much retail data -- is actually public data. For each of our products, you can see where it's ranked, how popular it is. We do not use any of that specific seller data in creating our own private brand products.\" He further added, \"In fact, there are so many marketplaces that there's a billion-dollar industry that has grown up to provide services to sellers so that they can use them to list across all marketplaces at the same time.\" His responses were in answer to Amazon deliberately adopting policies that stifle retailers with smaller commercial power, thereby killing competition across multiple sectors of retail. However, the answers did not seem to satisfy the Representatives in their investigation of the fact that Amazon's hardware and platform integration is, in fact, designed to keep a user within their own ecosystem.   4. Google defended through its representative Cohen that \"you are free to use any other service, if you want to.\" The allegations against Google stated that their massively overpowering 'Search' platform has evolved in design to become one that keeps a user within their ecosystem. Cohen also answered in non-committal denial to Representative Lucy McBath's inquiry on non-removal of misinformation on the Google Maps platform, by stating that he was not aware of either the quoted WSJ article, or that there are 11 million fake locations registered within a particular region on Maps. Cohen also defended Google's monopolistic position in the search engine industry as \"incorrect\", stating that a lot of people use in-website search tools, thereby counting as competition to Google. There were also suggestions of some sort of a monopolistic collaboration between Apple and Google, and why Apple's Safari web browser used Google as the default search engine. In response, Apple's Andeer noted, \"We gathered data that most of our users prefer using Google to search for information, and hence the decision. However, we offer an easy way for any user to choose any alternative of their liking.\"   Above all other factors, what the hearing truly implicated is the sheer might and the common theme of murky policies that have a soundly reasoned backdoor for each of the Big Tech companies. These backdoors lie in properly defining a particular sector, and what \"competition\" really stands for. It is important to note what each company primarily deals in, and given that each of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google dabble with multiple industries at the same time, it raises, yet again, the unresolved question of whether these companies should be broken down into individual entities for competition's sake. As an umbrella, it is difficult to tie them down to one particular industry, thereby giving them the power to define their own rules by virtue of creating their own niche.   The hearing's conclusion also calls for significantly stronger regulations in the technology sphere, where governments need to impose far more stringent laws in terms of defining terms such as \"anti-competitive practices\", \"misuse of market dominance\" and so on. This, however, is tied to the foremost implication of how these companies are involved in multiple industries, which makes regulations more difficult to be imposed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42709106238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-5BC1-JCSC-J4NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>News18.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Proposal America's last big fight over internet privacy began in the final years of the 2000s, when concerns over consumer privacy violations had started to trouble lawmakers and the public. In 2007, pro-privacy technologists firstproposed Do Not Track, developing a simple way to let online users send a signal from their browser ordering websites and trackers not to collect their data.The problem was getting stakeholders who make money off of tracking to agree to accept those signals.Like every privacy policy battle before or since, the effort pitted outgunned consumer advocates against a coalition of big tech platforms and advertising trade groups. The coalition, which included companies like Facebook and Google as well as groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the Direct Marketing Association and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), responded to proposed regulations by claiming any privacy rule would hamper innovation.The Federal Trade Commission, which has oversight authority for consumer protection and corporate competition, announced it would investigate online tracking in December 2009. The FTC enforces regulations on consumer privacy, but its authority to issue industrywide regulations is incredibly weak. Congress had gutted the agency's rule-making authority during the deregulation craze of the 1970s. An amendment to restore that power was included in the version of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that passed the House of Representatives in 2010. A lobbying campaign led by the advertising tech industry[4], however, stripped that amendment from the final bill. Without agency regulations, the industry was left to its own, preferred devices of self-regulation. The IAB, which counts Google and Facebook (and Oath, which owns HuffPost) as members, labeled the removal of the provision their 'number one legislative priority' and called it a 'a major victory for industry[5]' when it was dropped from the final bill text.In 2010, the FTC held a series of roundtables with stakeholders to hear from both industry and privacy advocates about what regulatory approach would work best to protect online consumer privacy. The agency threw its weight behind Do Not Track in a report[6] that included a detailed explanation of past privacy failures throughout the industry. The Venue In 2011, the FTC brought in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an internet standards-setting body largely composed of the representatives of big technology companies, to help outline Do Not Track rules.This was where the privacy push really got derailed, Jonathan Mayer, a technologist who was involved in the negotiations, told HuffPost.'This was a recurring problem during the Obama administration,' Mayer, who would later work at the Federal Communications Commission under Obama and is currently a professor at Princeton University, said in an email. 'The federal government had a habit of punting difficult technology policy issues to multi-stakeholder working groups. Unsurprisingly, these working groups didn't make much progress.'The consortium wasn't exactly a fair venue. The group is mostly made up of industry players like tech companies and advertising trade groups who pay its annual membership fee. The playing field was tilted toward the very corporations that did not want to endanger their profit source, which involved tracking users, collecting their data and packaging it to target ads\u2014 the same companies that are now under the microscope for privacy violations.A small band of consumer advocates from nonprofit groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Center for Digital Democracy and Consumer Watchdog were allowed by the W3C to participate, too, even though they were not consortium members when the negotiations started. The nonprofits were effectively 'charity cases,' said Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney at EFF who participated in the negotiations. 'We were heavily outnumbered in the room,' he said. The Default Settings In February 2012, the Obama administration released a consumer privacy bill of rights and announced that executives for the big tech firms and advertising trade groups had accepted the FTC's Do Not Track principles. In the administration's press release, companies operating web browsers agreed to provide a Do Not Track capability. The DAA,which was created by the big advertising trade groups, agreed to run a voluntary effort through its AdChoices platform[7] where online users could opt out of tracking. (This is that blue triangle you see next to online ads.)Browsers followed through on their promises soon after the presidential announcement, but not in the way advertisers wanted. Mozilla and Microsoft both launched new versions of their respective web browsers with the Do Not Track function automatically turned on for users. Antivirus company AVG similarly opted users in to Do Not Track through its default setting.But the ad industry would only accept Do Not Track if it believed the tool would not be widely adopted. That's why the industry cared deeply about the default settings for Do Not Track, and would only agree to honor it if users had to affirmatively select the option. When it became clear that browsers or other software would opt users in to Do Not Track automatically, the ad industry saw a direct threat. The DAA, which was the running the voluntary Do Not Track effort for the advertising industry, said it would not honor Do Not Track signals from browsers that set the default to opt-in. The Failure Meanwhile, the consortium negotiations between industry leaders and privacy advocates had reached an impasse. The actions by the browsers and other companies to default users into Do Not Track increased the acrimony.The ad industry became publicly hostile to the Do Not Track talks and doubled down on its own self-regulatory solution that promised not to automatically opt in users to privacy. Mark Zaneis, the general counsel for the ad industry lobbying group IAB, told The New York Times[8], 'We have self-regulation. It's working very well.'That's when Washington lawmakers jumped into the debate. In a 2012 letter to the FTC[9], then-Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the commerce committee and a supporter of digital privacy legislation, promised that a failure by the W3C would 'only highlight the need for Congress to act.' During an April 2013 oversight hearing[10] on Do Not Track, he pointed a finger at the advertising industry. The industry was 'dragging its feet'in the negotiations, 'and I believe they are doing it purposely,' he said.Rockefeller moved to reintroduce legislation to enact and enforce privacy controls, including Do Not Track. It was just one of many bills introduced during the Obama administration with the intent of addressing digital privacy. Not one passed out of committee.As lawmakers grew increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of the Do Not Track process, major players dropped out of the consortium negotiations. The advertising industry quit, blaming 'ideological' privacy advocates whom they likened to Bolsheviks. The industry declared it would stick to its self-regulatory approach. Outnumbered and overburdened, the consumer advocates, including Mayer, left. While the consortium released two Do Not Track standards in 2015, both opposed by privacy advocates, its negotiations still continue.Back in Washington, nothing happened. The FTC had no rules to enforce. Congress, which would soon be under unified Republican control, did not follow through on threats to enact privacy legislation if the regulators or the consortium negotiations failed. Users began to turn to ad-blocking plugins.Industry efforts to block regulation by claiming it would impede innovation had worked yet again. Will It All Happen Again? Today, the same industry players are back to play the same roles. Zuckerberg might have accepted responsibility for abusing user privacy, again, and endorsed vague privacy measures, but the trade associations for the tech and advertising industries strongly oppose any new regulation or legislation. The Internet Association, a major tech trade group, is running a campaign against a privacy ballot initiative in California. The ad trade groups, including the IAB,oppose any new legislative effort to enact privacy rules and current legislation to mandate transparency for online political advertising.Privacy advocates appear to be on the sidelines[11] at the moment. But those who spoke to HuffPost said they think the current moment holds more promise than previous failures like Do Not Track, even as the industry takes the same stance against government regulation. They point to the tough questions Zuckerberg received from members of both parties. They consider the bipartisan privacy bill[12] introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) as a sign of progress. They note that 41 state attorneys general[13] are pushing for answers from Facebook about its business practices and that the FTC is investigating Facebook[14] for violating a consent order on privacy from 2011. The passage of new privacy rules in states like California[15].And, most importantly, the implementation of the European General Data Protection Regulation has forced companies to adjust their business practices to stringent privacy rules in one of the world's largest markets.None of this should mean that privacy proponents should expect victory any time soon. One big lesson Tien, the privacy expert at EFF, said he learned from the Do Not Track effort is to not expect corporations to assent to rules that would make it harder for them to make money.'If someone says, 'We're willing to do something that cuts into the amount of money we make,' be very suspicious about whether they are actually going to do that,' he said.The other lesson Tien suggested Americans learn from the Do Not Track failure is that legislators and regulators often don't focus and follow through on promises. American politics, he said, tend 'towards episodic hyperbole.''If you're not grappling with enforcement and investigation as part of this and you're just sort of beating companies over the head saying, 'bad, bad, bad,' You know, they'll take it. And then once everybody forgets about them or goes on to the next scandal or the elections or children's health care or whatever, they are working away at monetizing data all that time,' he warned. 'You need constant vigilance.'

We`ve got some breaking news we`ve got to get to tonight.</p><p>MADDOW: Got you --</p><p>O`DONNELL: Great to get going, thanks, Rachel. So, the breaking news tonight of course is that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>has just said the United States will retaliate against Russia for interfering in the presidential election.</p><p>But first, we`re going to talk about the story that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>doesn`t want us to talk about tonight.</p><p>The story that he had previously promised would be the biggest story of the day today until he decided that he just couldn`t talk about it.</p><p>And that is why we need to talk about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC: <person><nameText>Senator Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>threw down the gauntlet today on the issue of the president-elect`s conflicts of interest.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because I don`t think there`s anything nefarious going on or sneaky or transparent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This right here is what an apparent conflict of interest looks like.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My goodness, what are his children doing?</p><p><person><nameText>KELLYANNE CONWAY, </nameText></person>SENIOR ADVISER TO <person><nameText>PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP</nameText></person>: I find all this hand-wringing over who was in that meeting yesterday to be really over the top.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s like the princelings of China and other corrupt regimes and not the United States of America.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: This is truly an exciting time to be alive.</p><p>SEN.

He`ll be up for re-election in four years, he might need them again. So --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: Today, the most important political news story of the day is what didn`t happen today. And that is what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>does not want us to be talking about tonight.</p><p>He wants us to be talking about \"Vanity Fair\", Graydon Carter and the worst restaurant in the world.</p><p>And we always know what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants us to be talking about, because he tells us that every day on Twitter, often at the beginning of the day.</p><p>And today, his first tweet of the day was, \"has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of \"Vanity Fair Magazine\"?</p><p>Way down, big trouble, dead, Graydon Carter, no talent will be out.\" <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has been tweeting that sort of thing about \"Vanity Fair\" and Graydon Carter for years.</p><p>He`s been wrong for years, and he was attacking Graydon Carter years before Graydon Carter took over \"Vanity Fair\" since Graydon Carter along with Kurt Andersen co-authored the term \"short-fingered vulgarian\" to describe <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>back when they were running \"SPY Magazine\" in the 1980s.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>tweeted that this morning about \"Vanity Fair\" because \"Vanity Fair\" ran a review about the Trump grill in Trump Tower.</p><p>That said the Trump grill could be the worst restaurant in America. Now, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>knows that his tweet was going to bring much more attention to the review of his terrible restaurant.</p><p>I wasn`t going to read that review if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>didn`t alert me to it. It`s a wonderful piece of writing that you will enjoy, just what you would expect from \"Vanity Fair\".</p><p>Even if it`s on something I don`t care about, Donald Trump`s terrible restaurant.</p><p>But it was worth it to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to try anything today to deflect attention for what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wasn`t talking about today.</p><p>Even though weeks ago he promised that today would be the biggest day yet in the Trump transition.</p><p>The day when he would reveal exactly how he was going to remove any appearance of conflict of interest in his business dealings.</p><p>He scheduled the press conference that didn`t happen today two weeks ago, and then he canceled it on Monday.</p><p>And then, after he canceled it, he treated the world to a demonstration of how he has no intention of separating himself from his family business. He had his family attend a presidential transition meeting with the heads of tech companies.</p><p>All of our top tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Google, but not Twitter. Twitter wasn`t allowed in the room.</p><p>\"Politico\" reports that \"Twitter was not invited to the event in retribution for refusing during the campaign to allow an emoji version of the hashtag crooked Hillary.</p><p>According to a source close to the situation. Elizabeth Warren has had it with Donald Trump`s refusal to release his tax returns as a presidential candidate. And she has had it with his refusal to do anything about his conflicts of interest.</p><p>And so, Elizabeth Warren announced today that she will introduce a bill co- sponsored by four other Democratic senators that would require the president and vice president to disclose and divest any potential financial conflicts of interest.</p><p>The bill would also require Donald Trump`s appointees to recuse themselves from any matters involving his financial conflicts of interest if they appear before their agencies.</p><p>Any possible Trump business that appears before a department of the government, that cabinet member would have to recuse himself or herself from dealing with that.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren said this today about the bill. \"Americans deserve to know that the president is doing what`s best for the country, not using his office to do what`s best for himself.</p><p>The only way for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to eliminate conflicts of interest is to divest his financial interests and place them in a blind trust. Placing assets in a true blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents.</p><p>Our bill makes clear, we expect Trump to do the same.\" Joining us now, Ron Klain, former Chief of Staff to Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore.</p><p>Also with us David Cay Johnston; Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and columnist with the \"Daily Beast\".</p><p>He is the author of \"The making of <person><nameText>Donald Trump</nameText></person>\". Ron, I think people out there, certainly all Trump voters out there, when they see the picture of the kids in the meeting, and if they imagine a picture of the kids in cabinet meetings, the Trump kids in cabinet meetings, they don`t see anything wrong with that.</p><p>It`s bring your kids to work day, bring your daughter to work day, bring your son to work day, that`s become an American institution.</p><p>I don`t think the -- certainly the Trump voter out there sees any problem with this.</p><p>RON KLAIN, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO JOE BIDEN &amp; AL GORE: Well, you know, Lawrence, I agree with that. But I think in part because we`ve never seen anything like this before.</p><p>We really have no way to judge or assess this. Because this isn`t a case of a presidential potential conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest. This is an unprecedented case of a president with some glaring conflict of interest.</p><p>The effort to build a Trump Tower in Istanbul at a time when our relations with Turkey are on a hair trigger.</p><p>The attempt to build Trump Towers and Trump properties in Moscow when our relations with Russia are at a flash point.</p><p>So, you know, I think people -- it`s going to take, sadly, time for people to really appreciate what`s going on here.</p><p>But we are going to face a crisis in the next few months, Lawrence, where Russia does something very aggressive.</p><p>That the president assembles his advisors in the situation room, they will recommend tough action against Russia, and the president will have to choose between a half-built Trump Tower in Moscow and protecting the freedom and security of the American people.</p><p>That`s a conflict we`ve never seen before in our country. And so it doesn`t surprise me that people aren`t really roused by it yet, because we just haven`t seen anything like this before.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Ron, you`ve been in positions in government where you`ve had to advise politicians about potential conflicts of interests, appearance of conflicts of interests.</p><p>KLAIN: Yes --</p><p>O`DONNELL: What would you say to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>about that imagery of his kids being in that meeting and the possibility of his kids being in meetings like that in the White House?</p><p>KLAIN: Well, as I said, it`s much worse than just imagery, it`s the actuality. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has no plan to manage his conflicts of interest.</p><p>So, except the -- said there`s a plan that said his children would manage the business and he would manage the government.</p><p>And now it`s clear he`s fusing those two things. He brings his children to meetings with rich potential investors, maybe they`re looking to get money from these big tech companies to back new Trump enterprises.</p><p>You know, this is just wrong. It`s not -- it`s not an optics issue. It`s not a politics issue, it`s a legal issue, and it`s an issue about the sanctity of our government.</p><p>And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>ran for president -- look, I worked hard for Hillary Clinton, I didn`t want to see him become president. But he won, and he`s going to be president. That`s the job he said he would do.</p><p>Not manage his interests, not pursue his economic interests. It`s time for him to choose, and if he`s going to be president, he has to put his own personal business work aside and be our president.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And David Cay Johnston, the \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting tonight just minutes ago that the Trump plan as they understand it now is, they will not divest.</p><p>There will be no divesting, they won`t be liquidating assets. Elizabeth Warren`s legislation says that`s the only way you can do this.</p><p>Liquidate the assets, take the proceeds, put all that in a blind trust, that`s the only way. And the cancellation of this press conference today, the cancellation made on Monday.</p><p>I think to long-time Trump watchers like you, people who have written books about them as you have, I -- tell me if that didn`t indicate to you, they`re canceling it because they actually have nothing to say.</p><p>They have no plan to offer, and they don`t want to live out the rest of the transition being criticized about having no plan every day.</p><p>DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, COLUMNIST, DAILY BEAST: Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>promised a press conference, just like he promised something you pointed out repeatedly, Lawrence, about Melania Trump`s work papers.</p><p>When she came to the United States and worked as a model, and he didn`t deliver there either. We`re not going to see <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>explaining himself. He doesn`t believe he needs to explain himself like Vladimir Putin.</p><p>He thinks whatever he does is just fine. He sent a powerful message by having his children in that room.</p><p>This opened up a world in which business people and government leaders now recognize that if you want to curry favor with the Trumps, you do it through the two Trump boys.</p><p>If you are having a problem with the U.S. government, they are in a position now to effectively blackmail you. Bribery and blackmail being the same crime from different points of view.</p><p>And because they`re not subject to disclosure laws and Trump is not disclosing anything, we will have no idea what kind of deals Donald Trump`s sons are making that are inimical to the national security interest of the United States, but favorable to the Trump family.</p><p>And the only way to resolve this is to appoint an independent broker who has never dealt with the Trump family to put the assets into a blind trust for the broker to sell.</p><p>And the broker to disclose what`s happened. And I don`t think we`re going to see that happen because <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>evidently is highly dependent on the cash flow from these enterprises in order to maintain his life and that of his children.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Ron Klain, the divestiture process too, would be complicated.</p><p>And it may be that what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has decided is, the longer I wait to divest or sell any asset to start pleasing the critics, the higher price I can get for it.</p><p>I can get a higher price for it when I am president, and I am considering some issues of interest to Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Maybe I could get Russian oligarchs to pay an awful lot more for a certain property than it is either worth or than it is worth today.</p><p>KLAIN: Yes, I mean, maybe, and maybe more than that. I mean, I think David is absolutely right on this.</p><p>I actually think there`s no plan to sell these assets at all. And you know, as a Republican lawyer said today, try to imagine World War II with a Roosevelt Tower in Berlin and a Roosevelt Hotel, you know, in Frankfurt.</p><p>And Franklin Roosevelt sitting there --</p><p>O`DONNELL: Sure --</p><p>KLAIN: And trying to fight World War II. I mean, it`s just you can`t imagine it. And so, you know, there is no way, Trump`s first plan he said was to put these assets in a blind trust.</p><p>There`s no way to have a blind trust when your assets are buildings with your name on them in 20-foot gold letters.</p><p>There`s nothing blind about where the Trump money is. So, the only solution that protects the dedication of a potential president to the interest of our country, not his own pocket book is divestiture.</p><p>Senator Warren`s bill today, you know, I think is a -- is a great piece of legislation and is what should happen. But you know, I don`t think it has much of a chance sadly in a Republican-controlled Senate.</p><p>And I don`t think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to take this on, on his own. And so, I`m glad Senator Warren is fighting this fight.</p><p>She`s fighting the right fight, she`s a great leader to fight this fight. But I think we`re getting more and more Americans to get concerned about it and speak out about it.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And David, one of the things that makes the blind trust so useless in this particular case is that the Trump children, they`re sitting there at the table.</p><p>And the Trump children, if they were running this operation in a sort of blind way from <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>as he claims that they plan, it seems like that is going to be their plan whenever they get to it.</p><p>That they won`t divest anything, but the boys will run it and I won`t know what they`re doing.</p><p>But they will be sitting at meetings like that tech meeting filled with all these very high stakes players in the tech world.</p><p>And even if somehow <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>didn`t know what businesses his sons were in, they would know, and they would know which one of those tech people at the meeting said something that could benefit their businesses.</p><p>And they could walk that particular executive out of the building and make a little deal on the way out the door.</p><p>JOHNSTON: Well, and let`s keep in mind that the sons will be in a position to simply wink and nod to dad that they like somebody or they don`t like somebody.</p><p>And remember, Donald Trump`s long history here, thousands of cases where he didn`t pay his workers, he didn`t pay his vendors, they could decide not to pay people.</p><p>Is somebody going to take them to court for not paying their bills and risk the wrath of the president of the United States?</p><p>This, by the way, I think leaves Donald in a very vulnerable position. If at any point, the Republican leadership decides that they would rather have President Mike Pence. Trump`s refusal to act on this could hand them a cudgel to go after him.</p><p>O`DONNELL: The \"Cbs\" poll on Trump giving the businesses over to the kids to run, if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>hands control of business to kids, will that prevent conflicts?</p><p>Yes, 26, no, 70, don`t know, 4. So, Ron Klain, America passed that test, 70 percent got that right.</p><p>KLAIN: Yes, look, and as I said, I think over time, people`s appreciation for the kinds of conflicts, for the kinds of information David has brought to the public`s attention will really get more and more acute.</p><p>And we`ll see more and more (AUDIO GAP: 00:00:25) I admit, it`s a bit abstract, conflicts is an abstract concept.</p><p>You know, all this is a little hard for people to process, but I do think that the nature of this will become more clear as we go on.</p><p>And, you know, as David alluded to, if he`s going to have his sons in these meetings, and they`re running these businesses, there`s nothing blind about that at all, and there`s nothing trustworthy about that at all.</p><p>It is the most apparent and egregious kind of conflict you can imagine. And it`s particularly if they`re going to continue to pursue really big, major overseas developments.</p><p>Where the U.S. has foreign policy interests, where the potential for conflict is very high, now, that`s the scariest thing.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Ron Klain, David Cay Johnston, thank you for sharing your expertise on this stuff, really appreciate it.</p><p>KLAIN: Thanks David --</p><p>JOHNSTON: Thank you.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Coming up, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>has just spoken about the election hacking, and he says that the United States will retaliate against Russia at a time of its place and in a method of its choosing.</p><p>Russian political activist Garry Kasparov will join us. And New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman helped secure that $25 million settlement from <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>A settlement <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said he would never do for the students at the defunct Trump University, the fraudulent university.</p><p>Attorney General Schneiderman is now preparing to take on President Trump`s policies whenever necessary.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Lenin coined the phrase \"useful idiot\". Of course, he said it in Russian. And who is the useful idiot now? Garry Kasparov will join us next.</p><p>O`DONNELL: We have breaking news tonight. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is promising retaliation for Russia`s interference with the presidential campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action.</p><p>And we will, at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized, some of it may not be.</p><p>But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this because I spoke to him directly about it.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: This morning <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>tweeted this: \"if Russia or some other entity was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?</p><p>Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?\" The \"New York Times\" today wrote in an editorial, \"there could be no more useful idiot, to use Lenin`s term of art, than an American president who doesn`t know he`s being played by a wily foreign power.\"</p><p>Joining us now, Garry Kasparov; a former world chess champion and chairman of the Human Rights Foundation and a Russian pro democracy leader.</p><p>He`s the author of \"Winter is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped\".</p><p>Garry, it doesn`t seem like <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to be part of the movement to stop Vladimir Putin.</p><p>GARRY KASPAROV, FORMER CHESS CHAMPION &amp; CHAIRMAN, HUMAN RIGHTS FOUNDATION: Absolutely not. I think it`s quite ridiculous, you know, to -- even to assume that such a massive cooperation could be carried without direct approval and blessing of Russian dictator.</p><p>I`ve written enough books on dictators and dictatorships. I grew up in the Soviet Union in a communist country, and I don`t need any Intel to know that, you know, you can have Putin`s fingerprints all over the place.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Yes, there`s a mode that the Putin regime has gotten into with recognizable practices and characteristics.</p><p>KASPAROV: Oh, absolutely. I mean, Putin knows that there`s one main rule of survival for a dictator.</p><p>You cannot afford to look weak. And you know, when Obama said Russia was a regional power.</p><p>That was a challenge for Putin. And Obama`s biggest mistake of course, after -- you know, he failed to enforce his red line in Syria, is to underestimate that Putin would go somewhere. So, for me, the question was not if Putin strikes -- would strike. It`s when and where?</p><p>And I have to say that he took a calculated risk to aim at the core of American democracy. And, you know, unfortunately, he succeeded.</p><p>O`DONNELL: The reports indicate that the -- that one of the reasons why <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>didn`t get more explicit about this, although they got pretty explicit.</p><p>And in October, the intelligence community said approved at the highest levels of the Russian government. They did everything except type the word Putin in the -- in the reports about it then.</p><p>KASPAROV: Like, you know, it`s the -- from the perspective of the outside world and of course, in Russia, Putin looks victorious, because he did what he did, you know, he succeeded.</p><p>Now Trump is about to enter the White House, and Trump picked up Rex Tillerson, you know, Putin`s friend and business partner of his confidante (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>And you know, everybody expects American foreign policy to change dramatically, sanctions to be lifted and Trump to prepare a kind of a grand bargain with Putin.</p><p>You know, allow Yalta 1945, so, it is dividing the world again between two super powers.</p><p>O`DONNELL: A grand bargain in which you would imagine Trump asking for what?</p><p>KASPAROV: I don`t know, but it`s just -- it`s --</p><p>O`DONNELL: You can see what he is willing to give away.</p><p>KASPAROV: Oh --</p><p>O`DONNELL: You can`t see --</p><p>KASPAROV: And there`s plenty you can give away, and it`s not only the Crimea, you know, Ukraine`s raid of Crimea or other parts of Ukraine.</p><p>But you know, he could, you know, offer Putin, you know, just to sort of start from scratch, you know, let`s forget NATO.</p><p>You know, the entire global security infrastructure that has been built after World War II, now you know, could be at stake.</p><p>And we don`t know whether it will be, you know, some kind of stupid American interests or, you know, interests of ExxonMobil or Trump`s business in part or anything else.</p><p>Because you know, America is still the leader of the free world. And I know the reaction of eastern Europeans, Europeans in general who know that Putin has been going after them.</p><p>We have reports one after another pointing at Putin, at Putin`s Russia. Not at China, not at Iran, not this -- you know, a guy in T-shirt in New Jersey seller squarely to Putin. You know, blaming him for hacking secret documents and meddling with European politics.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And what you see in Donald Trump`s approach to Putin, imagine the two of them in the room finally. Imagine how that goes.</p><p>KASPAROV: Look, it could be anything. I think to begin with, Trump could hope for a grand bargain.</p><p>But it could end up, you know, in just a very bad relations which could be another potential disaster.</p><p>Or because Trump could get mad and just, you know, start doing something, you know, unimaginable.</p><p>So, I think it`s great danger that the foreign policy will be in the hands of a person who would also be accompanied by Michael Flynn and Rex Tillerson.</p><p>That, looking at foreign policy as you know, as you know, out of business, out of a deal, it`s not about deals. It`s about protecting the free world, and we have now existential threat coming from Putin.</p><p>And unless America, you know, reassures its leadership, I think we are entering, you know, uncharted waters and very dangerous territory.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Garry Kasparov, thank you very much for joining us tonight, I appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will join us to discuss what powers state Attorneys General have to do battle with the Trump administration.</p><p>Attorney General of New York will join us next.</p><p>O`DONNELL: According to the \"New York Times\" today, state Attorneys General are planning to fight back against <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>by using one of Donald Trump`s favorite tactics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I guess we`ll sue them, let`s sue them, right?</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>Let`s sue them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: Attorney general Maura Healey of Massachusetts recently wrote, \"I won`t hesitate to take <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to court if he carries out his unconstitutional campaign promises. . Xavier Becerra of California, the new attorney general there challenged <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to quote, \"come at us\" on a recent conference call with reporters.

We`re dealing with an attorney general who everyone in New York knows is a total lightweight, he`s very unpopular --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you going to testify?</p><p>TRUMP: We`re going to settle this case very easily, he (INAUDIBLE) I would settle it because he said I wouldn`t take the bad publicity. I get plenty of bad publicity. I`m used to it. And frankly, I, you know, I didn`t want to settle the lawsuit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And Attorney General Schneiderman in fact forced <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to settle that lawsuit, settle it for $25 million. Joining us now for an exclusive interview, Eric Schneiderman, New York State Attorney General, thank you very much for joining us tonight.</p><p>ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN, NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good to be here Lawrence.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Tell me what you think is in the arsenal of state attorneys general in terms of dealing with this administration, and what are the arenas you see so far in the Trump policy arena that would come into conflict with some state attorneys general?</p><p>SCHNEIDERMAN: Well the states under the federalist system are the essential units of government. States retain all powers not specifically given to the federal government under the constitution. And the founders in their wisdom did create this two-tiered system of protection. So we have state civil rights laws, and if they come after any vulnerable minority group, Muslims, Jews, immigrants, we have the ability to protect them.</p><p>If -- we have state environmental laws and if they`re not going to protect the environment we have laws that can do this. We also have the ability to sue the EPA. In fact this is not just a matter of one administration or another my office filed a notice of intent to sue under a democratic president because the EPA wasn`t issuing greenhouse gas regulations fast enough. So, the states have tremendous power, and that`s by constitutional design.</p><p>The founders thought a lot about the problem of a president becoming to much like a monarch because they were worried about King George. And they left a lot of power in the hands of the states. We`re prepared to use that to protect the rights of our people should those rights be threatened by any part of a new administration.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And the <person><nameText>Obama administration, </nameText></person>it was the Texas state attorney general that sued the Obama administration`s administrative changes in immigration that the federal courts there ruled in favor of the state attorney general. So, there`s a rich history of this kind of litigation going on in both directions. When you mention the EPA, you know we`re headed for a leader of the EPA who is basically opposed to everything the EPA does.</p><p>That seems like it`s going to leave an even more ripe target for the state attorneys general.</p><p>SCHNEIDERMAN: Sure and look the EPA is not something they can just do whatever it wants. I mean the U.S. Supreme Court directed the EPA that it should issue regulations on greenhouse gases. This is not something that operates free of a constitutional system of the laws. The Oklahoma A.G. who has been nominated to be the head of the EPA is a climate change denier.</p><p>He doesn`t respect the agency, there`s no respect to science. And we stand prepared to defend the environment and to force that agency to fulfill its duties. I have my own obligations to defend the constitution of the United States and the state of New York and to defend the people of state of New York. That includes defending us against the devastating consequences of climate change.</p><p>And we have legal tools to enforce that. We don`t want to prejudge and get into fights before they start, but we`re prepared to defend our people with every constitutional tool in the toolbox.</p><p>SCHNEIDERMAN: Going back to the Trump university case for a moment. There was <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>constantly saying, you know, and he was lying whenever he said it that I never settle, I never settle. Because as we know he has settled many, many, many times and there he was fighting this right up until -- It looked publicly as if he was fighting it right up to the last minute on the verge of when he was going to go testify under oath, all of which would have become public.</p><p>And then suddenly there is this settlement for $25 million. Was that a last-minute settlement? Or did you see that coming? I have not been able to settle a case on terms that favorable for a very long time. I mean, we got restitution for the students. We got a million dollar fine for the state of New York, so that was a pretty rapid turn around from a couple weeks before when he said it`s an easy case to win.</p><p>I never would settle it. So it`s, I`ve been in litigation with this guy for a while. I know him. He is unpredictable. Just because he says he`s going to do something doesn`t mean he is. But those of us who do care about -- civil rights, about protecting the environment, about the rights of workers and protections of our labor laws, we have state laws and we have the ability to sue federal agencies to make sure our people are protected. And it`s our duty, it`s something we have to do.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And quickly before you go, you`ve also been investigating the Trump foundation, what`s the status of that?</p><p>SCHNEIDERMAN: Again it`s an ongoing investigation. We`re not commenting, they`re attorneys have actually been handling it professionally and turning over documents it`s just we did order that they had to stop raising money in New York because they weren`t registered properly to do that. But we are proceeding with an ongoing investigation.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Eric Schneiderman, New York State Attorney General. Thank you very much for joining us tonight. Really appreciate it.</p><p>SCHNEIDERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Coming up, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>almost, he came close, almost told his supporters tonight that his ideas are going to cost a lot of money and that his supporters are going to have to pay for those ideas through taxation, but instead, he pretended the federal government already has enough money to build the wall and do all of the infrastructure projects, because we are a rich country, and he wants to reduce taxes on the rich to keep the rich country. That`s next.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Here`s <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in Hershey, Pennsylvania tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have to be a rich nation if we`re going to rebuild our military. If we`re going to build the wall, we have to be a rich nation. If we`re going to, if we`re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, we have to know what we`re doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: What he seems to be saying is that the United States Treasury has to be rich. It has to collect a lot of money. It needs a lot of money, because all of his promises are going to take a lot of money, a lot of tax money. That`s what you would say before announcing a tax increase to pay for what you want to do or to try to explain why this is no time to do a massive tax cut for rich people, because we need the tax money from these rich people of this rich country to pay for all that stuff that this rich country should have. But this was <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>talking, so of course what he`s saying has absolutely no rational meaning.</p><p>Joining us now, Eugene Robertson, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the Washington Post and an MSNBC political analyst, also with us, Krystal Ball, democratic strategist, a senior fellow at New Leaders Council, thank you both for joining us tonight. Eugene, he was warming up there to what sounded like, that`s why I`m abandoning the tax cut, because we need the money of all those rich people to make this country feel like a rich country.</p><p>EUGENE ROBERTSON, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, there you go again, Lawrence, being all linear and logical and that kind of stuff.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Sorry.</p><p>ROBERTSON: It`s no longer, you know, we`re way beyond that at this point. And, because, you know, it`s random phrases and random sentences that certainly do not add up. And none of, you know, this is a man who, from all we know, runs his, his business empire basically with smoke and mirrors. He`s got that money moving so fast from here and there, and he`s depending on the cash flow.</p><p>And it`s just -- everything has to be in motion. I don`t know if he thinks that`s the way he`s going to run the federal government or if he just doesn`t have a clue of how he`s going to run the federal government, but that certainly, what he was saying tonight, certainly doesn`t add up to policy of any sort.</p><p>O`DONNELL: The, let`s listen to something else he said that he wants to -- how much money he wants to spend on this infrastructure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Another critical element of our jobs plan is a historic $1 trillion investment in our crumbling infrastructure. Our infrastructure is going to hell. We`re going to fix our infrastructure. Our bridges are deficient. Our roads are in disrepair, and our airports are like third world countries. I am asking congress to support the construction of new roads, bridges, airports, tunnels and railways, all across our nation.</p><p>We`re going to do it. And we`re going to build it on time, on budget.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: A trillion dollars spending, and of course a giant tax cut, so here`s a Fox news poll indicating the way Americans listen to <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Do you believe <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will build a wall along the U.S./Mexican border? 34 percent say yes. 59 percent say no. So Krystal Ball,</p><p>KRYSTAL BALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yes.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Americans don`t -- are not listening to this guy, thinking he means what he`s saying. But I guess the question then becomes, what do they think he actually does mean, if he doesn`t mean what he`s saying.</p><p>BALL: That`s a great question. I think you`re absolutely right, though, I mean if we`re thinking that when he doesn`t live up to all of his promises people are just going to abandon him in droves, I think we`re living in a fantasy world, because frankly, people have known that he`s full of it from the beginning. I mean, first of all, a majority of Americans didn`t even vote for him.</p><p>Second of all, you had two historically, unpopular candidates. So it`s not that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was so great and everyone was so in love with him that they just lined up in droves. It`s that they thought that maybe he would bring some change, and so they were willing to take a risk, and things weren`t going well for them, and so that`s what they did. Then you throw in Russia and Comey and all the rest and you end up with the result that you have. But look, it`s easy how he`s going to pay for it Lawrence. I think it`s obvious.</p><p>He`s just going to ask his friend Vladmir Putin, isn`t that what he`s going to do?</p><p>O`DONNELL: That`s where the money is. And so here`s another Fox News poll question of registered voters. Do you believe <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will deport millions of illegal immigrants? Only 39 percent say yes. By the way, only 40 percent of Republicans say yes. 51 percent of Republicans say no. 52 percent overall say no. And so, Gene, Republicans don`t even believe the mass deportation.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Yes. It`s because it`s not going to happen. I mean, you know, he probably won`t try it. He back-pedaled during the campaign, and it was, it touched a nerve when he said that, and it clearly was the issue that drew a lot of people to him, but I guess people just didn`t take him seriously. About the trillion dollar infrastructure program, at one point during the campaign he said something that actually did make sense.</p><p>He said, you know, interest rates are at historic lows. This is a great time for us to borrow money and improve our infrastructure from coast-to- coast. Now that`s not republican policy. But it did kind of make sense. it would be interesting if he went to the Republican Congress and said, look, this is -- this is what, you know, maybe (INAUDIBLE) but it makes sense, But I kind of doubt he`s going to do that. And I doubt they would be very receptive to it.</p><p>O`DONELL: Well but Krystal, not one Republican has said to <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>how are you going to pay for this? I don`t hear any republican saying how are you going to pay for it.</p><p>BALL: They don`t care.</p><p>O`DONELL: So it sounds like they don`t care.</p><p>BALL: I don`t think they care.</p><p>O`DONELL: Yes.</p><p>BALL: No, I don`t think they care. Republicans only care about deficits when Democrats are in charge.</p><p>O`DONELL: right. right.</p><p>BALL: they blow up the budget when they run the show on the things that they want to spend money on, and then suddenly, when Democrats are in charge, and we just faced a financial crash for example, suddenly, we`ve got to tighten the purse strings then, at the least opportune time. And they use that as an excuse to cut programs they don`t like, to cut the social safety net, cut and privatize Social Security and Medicare. Republicans don`t actually care about the debt and the deficit. It`s all a rues to get their way. And if Trump`s wants to do a trillion dollar infrastructure plan I have no doubt that they will give him the money to do it.</p><p>O`DONELL: Krystal Ball, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Gene, we`re going to need you on a later segment.</p><p>BALL: Thanks Lawrence.</p><p>O`DONELL: Please stick around. Thanks. Coming up Donald Trump`s original political sin for which he should never be forgiven.</p><p>O`DONELL: And now for the good news. in the last week, you have contributed $7,753,527 to the KIND Fund, the Kids In Need of Desks. MSNBCs unique partnership with UNICEF which provides desks for African school and scholarships for girls to attend high school. And just last night when I told you about how hard people work in Malawi and how far the kids have to walk to school and their mothers have to walk to market.</p><p>You contributed a $125,888.00. That brings the total you have contributed to the KIND fund since we began it on this program six years ago to $11,819,396. You can help by going to lastworddesks.msnbc.com. You can designate your gifts for desks or girls scholarships. And you can contribute in the same any one on your holiday gift list. And UNICEF will send them an e-mail announcing your gift. Thank you very much for your continued support and kindness.</p><p>O`DONELL: Never forget that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>began his political career with a life that he finally admitted was lie but never apologized for. And he should never be forgiven for. That`s next.</p><p>O`DONELL: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>began his political career lying about President Obama`s birth. When he stopped lying about it in September of last year and admitted that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>was born in the United States. He never answered the question of why he changed his mind. The last person to ask him that question was Lester Holt in the first Presidential Debate on September 26th.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESTER HOLT, NEWS ANCHOR: I`m sorry we should of apologize. But I`ll let you respond to that. because there`s a lot there. But we`re talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONELL: Lester Holt asked <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>three times why he changed his mind about President Obama`s birth certificate and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said nothing. And now the news media did exactly what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>expected them to do. News Media has just stopped asking the question. And so the original sin of Donald Trump`s political career is one for which has done no penance. And for which no one should forgive him because he has said nothing to earn that forgiveness.</p><p>Today his favorite Sheriff who was recently defeated in his reelection campaign Sheriff Joe Arpaio had his own news conference to prove <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was right and <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>was not born in Hawaii. One of the sheriff`s volunteer investigators said this about the President`s birth certificate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE ZULLO, BIRTHER INVESTIGATORS: I`ve got two different forensic examiners concurring that it`s fake. It`s a fabrication. This charge is Federal penalties.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONELL: And Sheriff`s Arpaio said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE ARPAIO, MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF`S OFFICE: So I plan on turning over this investigation this month to the Federal Government and Congress and hope that Congress number one will pass a law that President should be vent maybe so Members of Congress will have wholesome hearings open to the public regarding this matter. If you`re going hold hearings under flatted footballs why can`t you hold one on this. I can`t believe it. I hope we enlighten you with what the real story and evidence is all about regarding this fake, fake birth certificate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONELL: Back with us Eugene Robinson. Gene, I don`t want to belabor the evidence that they presented. But essentially the evidence was this is a fake birth certificate because it looks so much like a Hawaiian birth certificate. I mean that`s actually what it came down to.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes. Yes.</p><p>O`DONELL: But this is the Trump original political sin extended out now, kept alive -- the flame being kept alive by Joe Arpaio.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes, right. Number let`s establish. This is all about racism.</p><p>O`DONELL: Yes, yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: This is all about, you know, making them and establishing <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>as an alien, as some other -- someone whose not like us, as, you know, it`s purely racist. Numbers two Joe Arpaio is a nasty piece of work who lost his bid for reelection. And he can now kind of slink off into the obscurity he deserves. But that leaves us with President Trump who as you said has never done penance for this and never will.</p><p>I do not believe he ever will. And so those of us who believe he should, who believe he must, you know, that will always be with us in what we think and feel about President Trump. And their <person><nameText>President-Elect Trump </nameText></person>and other who don`t care won`t care. But I think we are where were going to be on this issue with him. And you know it`s hard for me to get passed it. And I think that`s true of a lot of people.</p><p>O`DONELL: Well his strategy was clearly to exhaust people and then specifically on the debate for example just run out the clock with Lester Holt. He was standing there betting, how many times can Lester ask me this. It turned out three which is a lot in the Presidential Debate. I think Lester clearly made the point, the guy will not answer, cannot answer. And then kept going on to other items. But, but that was his strategy, people will give up.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes. And people do give up. I mean you can imagine an interview in which somebody really sticks with it and goes with it 10, 15, 20 times but I, you know, I think he`s, I don`t think he`s going to answer question. I don`t think he`s going to answer the question, and we will have to deal with that, and he`ll have to deal with it.</p><p>O`DONELL: And Sheriff Arpaio will keep the question alive -- or at least for one day. Eugene Robinson, thank you very much for joining us tonight, really appreciate it.</p><p>ROBINSON: Great to be here Lawrence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSNBC-2016121501cb474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSNBC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MDD-77R1-DXH2-60B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7263\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 MSNBC</copyright><publicationName>MSNBC</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 15, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vladimir Putin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Conflicts of Interest</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eric Schneiderman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuit</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: Testing of antibodies, testing on a scale that we have not done before.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: And the latest on the crucial efforts to find a vaccine.</p><p>This is a special edition of THE LAST WORD, \"Life in the Time of Coronavirus.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Life in the time of coronavirus involves challenges we have never seen before. It has now delivered the largest number of people in American history who are worried about where they`re going to get their next meal or next meals. Millions of people who have lost their incomes and worry about how they did afford food are now lining up at food pantries for the first time in their lives, and the food supply from farm to supermarket is being challenged as never before.</p><p>Imagine the weight of worrying when you look at your children and wonder how you`re going to feed them next week or next month. And added to that is the worry of being infected with the deadly coronavirus, which will be with us until we have a vaccine. We`ll be joined tonight by someone who is leading research and development for that vaccine and we will get a report from inside a New York emergency room on a day when the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, was able to announce the number of new admissions to New York hospitals is declining for the first time.</p><p>Hospital admissions have dropped 17 percent in New York since Saturday. The death toll in New York state seems to be declining with 671 deaths in the last 24 hours. As of tonight, the United States has 23,476 reported deaths by coronavirus. And the total number of reported cases is 579,909.</p><p>Governor Cuomo has formed an alliance of governors who border New York and are close to New York to confront the coronavirus as a country should confront the coronavirus with a unified strategy. The governors have stepped into the leadership vacuum that was well-documented by \"The New York Times\" this weekend in reporting on how president Trump delayed taking decisive action against the coronavirus nationally and then publicly refused to take responsibility for our national defense against the coronavirus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don`t take responsibility at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: One of the governors will join us tonight, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. We`ll get his reaction to the president telling the lie today and there is nothing else you can call it but a lie. The lie the president has total authority to reopen the economy. The president`s lies were so extreme about this today that it provoked one reporter to finally shout out that`s not true.</p><p>As viewers of this program have known for weeks now, the president shut down nothing. The president can reopen nothing. Every word the president says about reopening the country is pure posturing. It is pure propaganda. I`ll have a last word to say about that at the end of this hour.</p><p>But for most of this hour, we are going to be concentrating on what you need to know about what is happening in our hospitals and the fight against the coronavirus, where we are and the development of a vaccine and what you need to know about our current and future food supply during this pandemic.</p><p>With me again for the hour`s discussion of science and medicine is Dr. Zeke Emanuel. Zeke Emanuel is a physician. And he holds a PhD in political philosophy. Dr. Emanuel served in the Clinton administration and Obama administration. He`s now the vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Emanuel now is an NBC News and MSNBC medical contributor.</p><p>Zeke, we saw Dr. Anthony Fauci yesterday say that more lives could have been saved if the United States had started mitigation sooner. He said that on the day on that \"The Ne York Times\" published that investigative piece showing how Donald Trump personally delayed the federal government`s active support of mitigation, and then today, with Donald Trump looking on. Dr. Fauci said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY &amp; INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I was asked a hypothetical question and hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it`s what would have or could have. The nature of the hypothetical question was if, in fact, we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved and the answer to my question was as I always do, and I`m doing right now, perfectly honestly say yes. I mean, obviously, if mitigation helps, I`ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: Zeke, your reaction to what Dr. Fauci said yesterday and the way he repeated it today?</p><p>ZEKE EMANUEL, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: He`s just right. We obviously knew early on in January, there were indications from the intelligence services and many others that coronavirus was around in China and was a serious threat to the country that it was going to come to the United States and that it could wreck havoc, the havoc it has had in the country before.</p><p>This was obvious to people. We know about the Peter Navarro memo to the president. So the question is could we have done something differently, and the clear answer to that, as Dr. Fauci said is yes. We could have done things differently. We could have tried to contain it when it first aroused. We could have tried to create a very robust testing mechanism that we could have had in place before the, say, March and we could have tried mitigation efforts where it took hold in Seattle.</p><p>Those things were not led by the president and administration despite a clear warnings by government officials, people inside the White House, and when Dr. Fauci just says yes, if we had done mitigation earlier, we could have kept the curves even flatter than they are today, he simply is speaking a fact. I mean, that is -- I don`t think there`s a political twist to this. It`s just a fact about the way biology works, viruses work, viruses spread. That if you start earlier, you`re going to reduce the number of people who are infected and therefore reduce the spread.</p><p>So I don`t think this is a controversial comment. And the fact that there`s an even a question about attacking Dr. Fauci for saying it seems to me just a -- fly in the face of basic biology that we know about viruses.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Zeke, just a quick follow-up based on your experience working in the White House, we have an exhaustive report in \"The New York Times\" yesterday describing how long it took for the experts like Dr. Fauci to get actually in front of Donald Trump to actually tell him and brief him because the president was going through moods and he didn`t want to hear about things. And so, today, Dr. Fauci said that when we did recommend that the president make a statement encouraging social distancing, the president did what we recommended, but it was very clear track in the \"New York Times\" about how long it took to get Dr. Fauci in the room with the president.</p><p>You know how the White House works. You know how long that can take. What was your reading of that kind of delay of getting the medical experts in front of the president as we saw in the \"New York Times\" report?</p><p>EMANUEL: Well, I worked for President Obama and he read a briefing book every night and he read it very thoroughly and if a memo like this, what we need to have done was in that briefing book, President Obama would have read it and would have called a meeting together to ask. That`s what he did when H1N1 broke out. He got a memo about it. He read it and called the meeting together and began asking people to get all the options in front of him and to understand what the situation was.</p><p>This is part of the chaos of the Trump White House for not that doesn`t allow clear reading of memos and clear instructions and getting the expert together in the Roosevelt Room, frankly.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Joining our discussion now is one of the heroes of the frontline, Dr. Eric Bressman. He`s the chief resident in medicine at Mount Sinai and Elmhurst Hospitals in New York City.</p><p>Dr. Bressman, thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>Is there reason to be hopeful for what we`re seeing in New York hospitals tonight?</p><p>DR. ERIC BRESSMAN, CHIEF RESIDENT IN MEDICINE, MT. SINAI HOSPITAL: Absolutely. We`ve seen real signs I think the social distancing measure are having an impact and admissions are declining, the flow of patients is declining.</p><p>It definitely cause for optimism and I have to say, the work of the front lines, the residents, all the front line workers have been unbelievable. This is spectacular. They show up to work every single day not just out of a sense of duty but purpose and it`s been an honor and privilege to work alongside them.</p><p>EMANUEL: What`s the most challenging thing about dealing with these patients from a medical standpoint?</p><p>BRESSMAN: Well, I think we`re fighting two battles here. The first is this public health battle, the effort to flatten the curve, which as I said seems to be going well. But the second one is a clinical and scientific battle to better understand the course of the disease and understand what is happening to these patients. We still can`t really predict with reasonable certainty who will do well and who`s going to do poorly, and as a medical community, we`re still very much in the dark.</p><p>And that weighs heavily on us as clinicians. There is a tremendous amount of research going on. Mount Sinai lead the way with convalescent plasma therapy and other therapies and working on vaccines, as well. But that uncertainty really weighs a lot on clinicians to have to look patients in the eye --</p><p>(CROSSSTALK)</p><p>EMANUEL: Dr. Bressman, as I understand it, we get a lot of cases where patients are on the vent, they seem to be doing well and then, suddenly, they have clots in different places, they have heart attacks, they have unexpected medical complications.</p><p>Is that what you`re experiencing?</p><p>BRESSMAN: We`re definitely seeing that and there are a lot of theories circulating around, clots is a big part of this disease. The jury is still out. There is theories this is an overwhelming immune response.</p><p>I think, again, when the dust settles and we look back, we`ll probably see different types of patients who take different courses, but it certainly is a fascinating time to be in the medical field and see this happen and play out in real time but in the moment, it`s unsettling and it`s difficult.</p><p>EMANUEL: So why do you think as a front line doctor. The most difficult social or patient interactions you have going forward are?</p><p>BRESSMAN: You know, I mean, to start with, it is uncertainty. As a young generation of physicians, we have been raised on a lot of certainty. We didn`t live through the AIDS epidemic.</p><p>We know -- we were taught everything. We knew how every virus acted down to the smallest to not know right now for us is incredibly, incredibly humbling.</p><p>It`s also very difficult to watch these patients suffer alone. They don`t have visitors. Their family members aren`t with them and we`re really their only family in the time of need and while that`s a tremendous opportunity for us, it really difficult to watch.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Dr. Eric Bressman, thank you once again for joining our discussion. We really appreciate it.</p><p>BRESSMAN: No problem.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Thank you, Doc.</p><p>Well, Connecticut is one of the seven northeastern states that today announced an alliance of governors who are fighting the coronavirus and who will eventually consider the extremely complex questions that have to be answered before those governors can relax or remove their orders for all non-essential workers to stay home.</p><p>And joining us now is the governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont.</p><p>Governor, thank you very much for joining us. We really appreciate it.</p><p>GOV. NED LAMONT (D), CONNECTICUT: Good evening, Lawrence.</p><p>O`DONNELL: I`m sure by now you have heard that Donald Trump has declared you have absolutely no power to, quote, reopen Connecticut. It`s totally up to him. The president said his authority is total.</p><p>Luckily, at least, one White House reporter got it right and shouted out that`s not true. But what was your reaction to the president telling this?</p><p>And I won`t drag you into the debate over it, I`m just going to let the audience know it`s a complete lie, the president has no authority. He didn`t shut anything down in Connecticut.</p><p>But what is your reaction to the way the president spoke about it today?</p><p>LAMONT: These comments come and go. He loves us to run down these rabbit holes.</p><p>We had a good meeting with the COVID task force, including Vice President Pence. He knows that all of the regional governors here in the Northeast are going to work together in a collaborative way for a phased reopening based upon testing. We`re going to open up our state. We`re going to do it in the safest way possible.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Governor, you said you`re teamed up with all your neighboring states -- Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York. And New York added to that team New Jersey, Pennsylvania on the New York border, Delaware also agreeing to approach this, pardon the expression but as a country would approach it, as we kind of expected the president to lead this kind of approach to it, because obviously, what happens in New York, what happens in Rhode Island, Massachusetts has a huge effect on Connecticut.</p><p>So you can`t make these decisions independently.</p><p>LAMONT: No, you can`t. I mean, if I look how the COVID pandemic hit Connecticut, came up along Metro North and I-95 from New York, going all the way through Fairfield County up to New Haven, that`s the COVID corridor for Connecticut right now.</p><p>I cannot solve that unless Andrew Cuomo helps solve it in his side of the border, as well. That`s why we`re thinking together in terms of where we want to do the molecular testing, where we do the antibody testing, how we share that data and then we do. We`ll share that with the federal government so they can make the right decisions, as well.</p><p>O`DONNELL: I just want to clarify for viewers, although you as a governor and Governor Cuomo and others had the authority to simply close down businesses and say no non-essential businesses are allowed to operate, when you relax that order, that doesn`t actually mean that any private business has to reopen.</p><p>So although you have the power to close them, you don`t really have the power to open businesses.</p><p>LAMONT: No, but what we do do is allow them to open, allow them to have more than two or five people in there, and I think they`re clamoring for that opportunity. But nobody obligates them to open. You`re absolutely right, if they feel unsafe and want to stay closed longer, they can.</p><p>What I care about is the public health. I just cannot have, you know, 100 people clambering into a store next Thursday because that`s the second wave of a pandemic.</p><p>O`DONNELL: (AUDIO GAP) to have, in order to evaluate the risk for people going back to work or going back to school?</p><p>LAMONT: Well, first thing I want to do is test the first responders, make sure they`re safe going into the hospital, going into the nursing home.</p><p>Secondly, I want to test the folks that work at Electric Boat and Pratt &amp; Whitney, they`re going into the factory floor. By law, I got to keep them open. They`ve got a number of infections there at E.B. right now. They need the gowns. They need the fever meters. They got to be tested.</p><p>And then more broadly, I`ll test the person at the nail salon and barbershop to make sure they`re not infecting 12 people a day, even the patients come in on appointment basis only.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And just for the audience, Electric Boat is a major defense contractor in Connecticut, and obviously an essential operation. That`s why that`s open. But it`s right in that New London, Connecticut area, where people working there on a daily basis.</p><p>The question becomes what happens in their commute, what happens when they go home, what kind of exposure do people have from workers who are out there already and coming home every day? We don`t really know the answers to those questions, do we?</p><p>LAMONT: No, but we`ve certainly set some guidance there. Once you tested on the way in, fever test, tested on the way out, you got to stay at home and not see anybody.</p><p>These are the conditions of working in a critical defense industry, because all you need is five or six people infected and pretty soon, the whole factory floor could be infected.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Governor, what would -- what would you say to the president about how he should deal with this question about who has the authority in Connecticut to close down businesses and who has the authority to release that order of closing down businesses?</p><p>LAMONT: I`d say, Mr. President, I remember a couple of weeks, you`re on your way to the helicopter and you said, hey, maybe we should have a mandatory quarantine of the New York metropolitan area. And I got together with Cuomo. I got together with Governor Murphy and we had no idea what that meant.</p><p>Did you want to shut down highways leading in and out? Shut down rail?</p><p>And we did have a good conversation, a firm conversation, said this is unenforceable law and we pulled back some of the extremes, and we reached an agreement that was workable for all of us. I`d like to think that`s where we`re going to end up opening our states, as well.</p><p>O`DONNELL: So, just so Connecticut -- people working in Connecticut can understand, should they be listening to you or should they be listening to Donald Trump about when they might be able to go back to work?</p><p>LAMONT: Look, I think everybody knows it`s the governors that enforce the rules. It`s the governors that, you know, have -- where the rubber meets the road. So, I would certainly lead with the governors, because that`s the way the White House has done as well. They`re saying, governors, you have to take the lead on stopping this pandemic, now, we want you to take the lead on opening the business on an appropriate way.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Governor Ned Lamont, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We really appreciate it.</p><p>LAMONT: Thanks, Lawrence. Nice to see you.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And Dr. Zeke Emanuel is back with us.</p><p>Zeke, the governor said that the plan is eventually for a phased reopening based on testing. Those were his words. When will these governors have the kind of testing they need to suggest businesses are able to reopen?</p><p>EMANUEL: The honest answer is we don`t know. I think doctor or Governor Lamont had some really good points. First, the importance of travel between states as a conduit for re-infecting areas. And so, even when we open up, that is a serious worry, and being able to test people who might come into a community is very, very important, just to be sure whether we`re getting new infections in a community.</p><p>Second, you heard him. He needs to test first responders. He needs to tell healthcare workers. He needs to test workers and essential industries. That`s tens of thousands of tests in the state of Connecticut probably every day, every other day, and that`s -- we haven`t even spoken about patients or the asymptomatic spreaders that will also need to be tested or family relatives of someone who turns out to be positive.</p><p>And we don`t seem to have the testing infrastructure. Nothing about testing has gone right in this country. Abbott with that 15-minute test, a lot of those are not being used because we don`t have the reagents, we don`t have trained personnel.</p><p>So, I`m a little skeptical we`re going to have testing infrastructure to release, have non-essential businesses really begin to start sort of in May or in June. There doesn`t seem to be any work that was really done to put that in place now. We`ll have to work furiously for the month of May.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Yes. I mean, as we sit here tonight, there is no testing infrastructure out there on the horizon. We`d have to at least be able to see it on the horizon to say that it`s ready to be used at some point in the future.</p><p>Zeke Emanuel, stand by and stay with us.</p><p>And when we come back, the race to find a vaccine. First the vaccine has to be created, then tested, then validated and then manufactured and then distributed worldwide. Not just in the United States.</p><p>We will be joined next by a scientist who will be involved in every step of that process. That`s next.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Whenever you hear a serious scientists or serious governor talk about returning to normal in the time of coronavirus, somewhere very close to the word normal, you will hear the word vaccine.</p><p>In the past, developing vaccines has sometimes taken decades but scientists around the world are now working at ultrahigh speed in the hope of getting a vaccine into distribution next year.</p><p>Dr. Zeke Emanuel is back with us.</p><p>Zeke, is there actual hope of a virus as early as next year?</p><p>EMANUEL: Lawrence, there is a hope of a vaccine being ready in 2021. That`s conceivable because scientists began working on a vaccine practically the day that the viral genome was made public.</p><p>And we`ve decided to break it down for you, break down how we make a vaccine with some animated help from our friends at Bio Digital.</p><p>The virus is a tiny package of genetic information covered by a fat layer in which there are protein spikes. The virus then hitches a ride into the body, goes down into the lung and lung sacs where it attaches to special receptors on the lung cells. It invades the cells of the air airways and then replicates exponentially.</p><p>The immune system either succeeds in flushing the virus out but sometimes it can cause substantial and even fatal harm to the body. Vaccines generally target the middle of this process after the virus gets into the body, and they try to interrupt the virus from binding to the cells and hijacking the cells and replicating.</p><p>Generally speaking, vaccines train your immune system to respond and prepare you to fight off the virus before it becomes and infects the cells of your body.</p><p>Here is what scientists hope to achieve with a successful vaccine. If you`ve ever been vaccinated, you possess billions of antibodies and immune cells ready to fight off the virus if you become exposed to it. These are represented in green.</p><p>Antibodies serve many purposes in the immune system but for simplicity sake, they play two key roles. The first is blocking the binding of the virus to your lung cells, occupying the spike proteins on the outside of the virus. The second function is as a signal, antibodies tell the rest of your immune system to send in reinforcing cells to target and kill the viral intruder.</p><p>The thing to remember is vaccines train your immune system to produce those antibodies and those antibodies prevent the virus from doing harm to you. So, let`s say we developed a candidate vaccine.</p><p>What are the barriers from keeping me from getting that vaccine?</p><p>Well, vaccines work because scientists take the time necessary to ensure that they`re safe and that they are effective to prevent you from becoming infected. To get to that point, there are usually three phases of clinical trials.</p><p>Phase one is a safety trial. Can I give this healthy person a vaccine and not make them sick and, god forbid, kill them?</p><p>Phase two is efficacy. Does the vaccine actually produce an increased in antibodies directed at the virus.</p><p>And importantly, phase three is an effectiveness trial. Does the vaccine actually prevent you from getting coronavirus?</p><p>Once you clear those three hurdles, then the FDA gives the green light to mass produce and distribute the doses to the hundreds of millions of people who need it. Every one of these step involves patients, volunteers and scientists, and there is no one long step but rather many small steps that cause the process to take many months into a year and a half before you can get a shot. And if you get it in a year and a half, that would be record time.</p><p>Right know, countless scientists are racing to get a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. One of the efforts you might have heard about comes from the pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson. They`re part of a billion-dollar effort along with the Department of Health and Human Services. That was really good news for the Johnson &amp; Johnson stock price especially the headline that they might be able to start testing a vaccine on human beings as early as September.</p><p>Now, we get to ask how the work is going.</p><p>Joining us is Hanneke Schuitemaker. She`s the global head of viral vaccines at Johnson &amp; Johnson. She`s also a professor of virology at the Amsterdam University Medical Center.</p><p>Welcome, Hanneke.</p><p>HANNEKE SCHUITEMAKER, GLOBAL HEAD OF VIRAL VACCINE DISCOVERY, JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p>EMANUEL: So I want to ask you about the nature of the vaccine that you at Johnson &amp; Johnson are trying. How is it special?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Yes, so we are using what we call a (INAUDIBLE) system. So it`s really the method by which we present the corona piece to the human body. And we applied this system also in our Ebola vaccine and also for our HIV vaccine candidate and our Zika vaccine candidate.</p><p>So it`s a replication in competence to common cold virus, of which we have deleted the piece of genetic material and replaced that, in this case, with a piece of genetic material of the coronavirus. That`s coding for the S protein.</p><p>EMANUEL: So you`re taking a common cold virus, putting some of the coronavirus protein in it, and that is going to present to the body to rev up the immune system to fight the coronavirus?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Absolutely, yes. So it - by that, it`s really mimicking the protein of the coronavirus as it is on the virus. And so the immune system sees really the native protein and makes the correct immune response. At least that`s what we are hoping for and also see now in our first experiments.</p><p>EMANUEL: And when will the whole thing be ready? Do you think September is a realistic timeline to start the phase one safety testing?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Well, yes, I think it is. Of course, we have a lot of first- time, right, assumptions in that timeline, but currently, we are meeting all the deadlines that we have set ourselves. And of course, it`s also always with permission of the authorities, right? So we will have discussions with the regulatory authorities if they agree with our package, but so far, we are in a good dialogue.</p><p>EMANUEL: In the phase one safety testing, how many humans do you expect to get your vaccine?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Yes. So we want to initiate with a group of 250 people to do some dose finding and also see if we need one or two doses to get the good immune response. And then, of course, we need to go and extend the safety cohort before we would go into larger groups for efficacy testing.</p><p>EMANUEL: And in your type of system, what are the major side effects you see, say, the side effects you see with the Ebola attempt? What are you really looking for in terms of adverse events?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Yes. So what we know from our different vaccines that are based on the same platform, so all on that common cold virus system, we know that people can have some fever in the beginning, but we market as a very well tolerated vaccine and also with a very favorable safety profile. So I think - well, of course, we should not do any presumptions on what it will look like, but we have good expectations.</p><p>EMANUEL: And then you`re going to move to a phase two efficacy study where you`re expecting the body to produce antibodies to the protein. Is that correct?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Yes. So, first, also this phase one study assures to find out whether it`s immunogenic. So whether we can get these antibodies and also good cellular immune responses. And if we have the package ready and then again, of course, with permission of the authorities, we will hopefully start with an efficacy study early next year.</p><p>And in that study, we will test whether the immune response (inaudible) will give protective immunity. So whether it will prevent people from developing COVID-19, did this really caused by--</p><p>EMANUEL: So that`s actually more - that`s actually more an effectiveness study. That`s actually assessing whether people are protected from getting COVID-19. Is that correct?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Yes. Yes, that is correct. So first, to test whether it`s immunogenic - first, whether it`s safe and immunogenic, and then in the next phase, we can test whether it`s effective.</p><p>EMANUEL: And that I take it would be record time to get a vaccine into people?</p><p>SCHUITEMAKER: Yes. So what we have seen, of course, is that other companies with even faster platforms are already in people. I think we are sort of on the intermediate timeline, but our forte is really that we know how to produce our vaccine and that we can ramp up production really with good speed so that we have that stockpile ready, and by the end of next year, we foresee that we have produced 1 billion doses. So that`s I think really the strength of our platform.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thank you, Hanneke Schuitemaker, Global Head of Viral Vaccines at Johnson &amp; Johnson. Thank you very much for helping us understand how you produce vaccines against coronavirus.</p><p>LAWRENCE O`DONNELL, ANCHOR MSNBC: And when we come back, food insecurity across the country. Long lines at the food banks now include many people who used to serve food for a living since the restaurant industry has basically closed down. And at the same time, some farmers have had to destroy their products. How insecure is our food supply becoming in this country? Andrew Zimmern joins us next.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Life in the time of coronavirus means crisis on top of crisis for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and incomes, which leaves them worrying about how they can afford food if they can find food on the shelves of our markets while they worry about the possibility of actually catching this deadly virus.</p><p>The economic shutdown has dramatically increased the lines of food pantries around the country. 10,000 people lined up in San Antonio. Southern California, to thousands of - long lines in Southern California to thousands of cars lined up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p><p>We all know that the unemployment application filings have dramatically increased and also dramatically understate how many people have lost their income and their jobs so far since the states have been overwhelmed with those unemployment applications.</p><p>A more realistic picture is drawn in a new Monmouth survey that finds that four in 10 Americans have lost income as a result of the pandemic. In that same survey, more than half of Americans say they are having trouble finding certain items in stores. Toilet paper and hand sanitizer are at the top of that scarcity list, but the scarcity list contains certain food items now.</p><p>And so, tonight, more people are worried about where their next meal or future meals are coming from than ever before. And the delivery of all of our meals now depends on a food supply chain from farmer to supermarket that has never been under more stress.</p><p>Andrew Zimmern is an award-winning chef, writer and teacher, and the host of the MSNBC limited series \"What`s Eating America\".</p><p>Andrew, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Let`s start with the food supply chain and what`s happening. We`re reading about farmers dumping crops, dumping products. What is happening in the supply chain?</p><p>ANDREW ZIMMERN, AWARD-WINNING CHEF &amp; MSNBC HOST, \"WHAT`S EATING AMERICA\": Yes. We`ve gone in a short matter of weeks, Lawrence, from the shame of seeing those that could afford to buy food and eat depleting the shelves in our supermarkets to talking about if there was enough food.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I was on air saying there was enough food in the supply chain, but the first cracks would be distribution-based. And we started to see that last week. You shut down restaurants, you shut down schools, and the traditional pathway for a lot of those trucks from the wholesaler and warehouses now has to be rerouted to the places where people are actually picking up food - the grocery store, the community resource kitchen, where some other public or private space, which is doing community resource work, allowing people to pick up goods.</p><p>But remember, this is a health care crisis we`re in. And I talked a couple of weeks ago on the shows about the health care cracks that would soon appear. We saw that last week with reports from the farmers themselves that conditions on the farms, in the factories, on the fishing boats, in the crab houses, in the abattoirs, people were not practicing proper physical distancing. They weren`t cleaning properly.</p><p>A lot of workers are living in those places, four to six to a room, taking transportation to and from work as a group. And a lot of us were talking about the fact that if we didn`t protect workers in the supply chain, we`re in trouble.</p><p>Well, the reality is that`s where we are now based on the Smithfield processing plant shutting down in South Dakota. That`s a hotspot in that state from a coronavirus case total standpoint. Right? It`s about 40 percent of the cases in South Dakota are in that plant itself. It`s also responsible for 4 percent of the pork that`s sold in the United States. So we do - we do now have a supply chain problem.</p><p>You were talking with the doctor before about the necessity for testing. We need to be testing and re-testing these essential skilled workers. And we needed to have been doing it weeks ago. We need to get those frontline workers and food people, farmers, anyone touching our food in grocery stores, et cetera. People trucking it are essential workers now, and they need to be protected, tested because their working and living conditions are prone to transmit, not mitigate the virus.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Andrew, I`ve been urged to include people working at our supermarkets as part of the frontline troops who are actually keeping us going through this.</p><p>ZIMMERN: Yes.</p><p>O`DONNELL: I haven`t been thinking all the way back in the supply chain to what you just identified. Those are the forgotten heroes of this story.</p><p>ZIMMERN: Yes. Well, we`ve - we`ve kept them in the shadows. We talked about this in our premiere episode of \"What`s Eating America\". The immigrants and documented and undocumented workers, (inaudible) workers, the people who have been demonized by the administration for the last several years, we`ve actually disincentivized from going and participating in our health care system, even showing up at the emergency room.</p><p>These are people who don`t have health care. They don`t have paid sick leave. They are paying into our tax system. They are essential workers. They are skilled workers. But we`ve done everything possible to disincentivize them from helping out by taking care of themselves at a time where it is essential that we all be taking care of ourselves as a way to take care of the people in our country. I`m really, really worried about the workers in our supply chain.</p><p>The trucks - we`re a capitalist society. The trucks will find their way to the places where it needs to go. Cucumbers will grow again, but we need to have people who are planting the cucumbers. We need to have people who are cutting the chickens in the chicken factories. We need to have people who are taking fish out of the ocean. Without people - it`s a very, very simple idea. It goes back 10,000 years. If we don`t have people producing the food, we`re not going to be able to eat.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Zeke Emanuel has a question.</p><p>EMANUEL: Yes. So I want to understand how you think we are going to keep the food going. And in this moment, are farmers going to be able to plant and have a reliable crop and also have a reliable marketplace come the fall, or is this whole system going to break down?</p><p>ZIMMERN: Well, you`ve actually mentioned four different places. And I want to remember, the pieces of your question is actually really, really complex. Right? So we already have fewer visas being given this year in the administration for those seasonal workers that are coming up, and we know that we have a very large percentage of Americans who are sick and more that will be getting sick. And we`re practicing physical distancing in this country.</p><p>So, ergo we`re going to have fewer workers on farms doing planting. Right? We`re not talking about giant agro businesses where machines plant the corn. We`re talking about what are deemed specialty crops, which is food for human consumption. Right? So we`re going to have a problem this season getting everything into the ground.</p><p>The people of the United Farm Workers that I speak to are very, very concerned about how we`re taking care of our farm workers and, by extension, all our people in the food system. We need testing and re- testing, and we need to keep these people safe. Otherwise, who will replace them?</p><p>O`DONNELL: Andrew Zimmern, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Andrew, we`ve got to get you back. There`s so much more to talk about in this subject. Thank you, Andrew, very much.</p><p>ZIMMERN: So much. Thank you.</p><p>O`DONNELL: And we`ll be back with some final comments, but first, many of you have sent heartfelt thank-you`s to nurses and doctors and health care workers all over the country. Tonight, we have thank-you notes to first responders, read by the people who received those thank-you notes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAXWELL ADEY, FIREFIGHTER/PARAMEDIC, SAN DIEGO FIRE-RESCUE: Here we have some letters from the community showing their appreciation.</p><p>We love firefighters. Thank you for saving people. We are thankful for your helping hands. Thank you for all you do, Fire Station 35. We see you. We appreciate you. And you truly are heroes.</p><p>CHORUS: Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE)</p><p>DEPUTY WALLY BRACKS, LOS ANGELES SHERIFF`S DEPARTMENT: I received this note from one of my little friends while she was picking up her school lunch. It says, \"Thank you for protecting our city. Thank you. You are a rainbow.\"</p><p>SGT. PAUL SPINELLA, SUFFOLK COUNTY SHERIFF`S OFFICE, NEW YORK: Thank you for everything you have done for me and my family and my community. Thank you for risking your lives to help people who are sick. Really thank you for everything. Love, Emma (ph).</p><p>Well, thanks, Emma (ph).</p><p>OFFICER LUIS VASQUEZ, FAIR LAWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, NEW JERSEY: Officer Vasquez, thanks for your support. I`m glad this finally got to you. You rock! I hope you enjoyed it. Can`t wait to stand with you on the thin blue line. Thank you so much, Michaela (ph), The Cops Rock Girl. Thank you.</p><p>CAPT. SHANNON PAULSON, LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT: I was incredibly touched and wanted to thank you for creating the support group during this crisis. I was hesitant to reach out for assistance as I`m usually the person helping and not asking for help. You did everything you could to make sure I received what I needed. There are not enough words to thank you guys.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let`s know if you need anything else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I will. I will.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re here for you.</p><p>DEPUTY SHERIFF YVONNE DECARO, SUFFOLK COUNTY SHERIFF`S OFFICE, NEW YORK: Your actions will never be forgotten all of our lives. Love, Timothy Foreman (ph).</p><p>Together we will all get through this. Thanks again for putting your lives on the line. Forever grateful, Heather (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, everyone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, guys.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re welcome.</p><p>LT. LATASHA PIERRE-DAVIS, PARAMEDIC, FDNY: FDNY heroes, thank you for once again rushing in when New Yorkers need you the most. We thank you, and we love you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O`DONNELL: There is some encouragement tonight in the coronavirus statistics we are seeing in New York and the frontline report we got earlier in this hour from Dr. Eric Bressman from New York City. And that encouragement is that that indicates that social distancing is working.</p><p>That means that if we really are slowing the spread of the coronavirus, it is thanks to you. It is thanks to everyone who is staying home, everyone who is being ultra-careful when they have to go out for groceries, wearing a mask, gloves.</p><p>And so all of you, who have been observing all of the rules, deserve a congratulations tonight because what you`re doing seems - seems to be working.</p><p>Dr. Zeke Emanuel, your final thoughts tonight.</p><p>EMANUEL: I want to tell you a story. It begins with something that we think of as just a catch phrase.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, Houston. We`ve had a problem here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Say again, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Houston, we`ve had a problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: That alarm was sent by the Apollo 13 astronauts back to Mission Control 50 years ago tonight, almost at this precise hour. They were supposed to be going to the moon, but an oxygen tank exploded. 200,000 miles above the Earth, they had lost most of the power and water. They used a lunar module as a lifeboat. But it was designed to support just two people for 30 hours, not three people for four days. There simply wasn`t enough oxygen.</p><p>Together, the astronauts in the air and the engineers on the ground devised an ingenious solution, a jerry-rigged filtration system, so the three astronauts could breathe again. They used plastic bags, cue cards, hoses and, of course, duct tape. And it worked. We remember the Apollo crew and the engineers at Mission Control as heroes, not because they succeeded at a lunar landing but because the astronauts returned home safely.</p><p>Right now, none of us is going about daily life in the way we intended. Whether you`re aiming for the moon or a chance to raise your hand in third grade math class, your life has been interrupted by a viral explosion. In some sense, we`re all far from home. But we`re also beyond fortunate in another sense.</p><p>Apollo 13 was called a successful failure because the men and women at Mission Control never gave up. Today, we have the smartest doctors, nurses, and scientists, all working to get us back to normalcy. Their efforts already are herculean. By the end of this crisis, we`ll think that their efforts were miraculous.</p><p>As we heard again tonight, we`re in this for the long haul. A vaccine will be more than a year away. In that time, we can all be heroes, each in our own individual way. The working from home, hand washing, avoiding large crowds, wearing masks in public. What we are doing every day is working hard. We`re flattening the curve.</p><p>By staying strong now, we`re getting ready for the next steps, a path forward to getting social life and the economy going again. The work will be difficult and slow. At times it may be scary. But I know Americans are ready to do their part because we`ve already shown that. By all working together, we too can return home.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Thank you, Zeke.</p><p>And in tonight`s \"Last Word\", I want to reemphasize a couple of points that I made with Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut earlier tonight.</p><p>First of all - and this is something you`ve heard me say weeks ago at this hour. The President did not close a single place of business in America, and the President cannot reopen a single place of business in America, not one.</p><p>Several governors have used their legal authority to issue emergency orders for all non-essential workers to stay home in their states. And only those governors have the power to remove those orders or to gradually and very carefully adjust those orders to legally allow more people to leave their homes to go to work. But even if that happens, it will still be up to the company that you work for to decide whether to open that workplace again for you to return to. No one in government can order any of those businesses to open.</p><p>Governors do have that emergency power to close those businesses. But as you heard Governor Lamont agree with me tonight, governors do not have any power to order any business to open. Unfortunately, the President of the United States is going to continue to pretend that he has, what he calls, total authority about this. But he actually has no authority at all. None. No one in government can order a business to open. That`s why it`s called private enterprise.</p><p>Zeke, one of the things that the President doesn`t seem to understand is that the reason a lot of people are staying home is that their companies have told them to stay home and told them to stay home before any governors told them to do that.</p><p>EMANUEL: Yes. And many of us think that San Francisco has done remarkably well because many of the big tech companies sent their workers home before they were told to. Same thing in Seattle, with Amazon and Microsoft. And they have to decide that it`s safe enough to bring their workers back. And I`m not sure that`s going to happen just because the President decides it`s the right time or he`s going to do it.</p><p>O`DONNELL: Zeke Emanuel, thank you very much for joining us for the hour once again tonight. We really appreciate it.</p><p>\"THE 11TH HOUR WITH BRIAN WILLIAMS\" will be up next.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, ANCHOR MSNBC: Well, good evening once again.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Thank you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VELSHI: All right. I`m Ali Velshi in for Lawrence O`Donnell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming up tonight, Senator Elizabeth Warren. The presidential candidate talks breaking up tech giants, butting heads with leaders of big banks and how she thinks the Democratic Party needs to change to win in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, the phenom. We`ll talk with a reporter behind a new interview with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. How the freshman congresswoman got the nickname \"America`s Lightning Rod\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But tonight`s big story, the world or at least Washington is watching and waiting -- waiting for Robert Mueller. It`s like royal baby watch meets election night, meets waiting for the Vatican`s white smoke.</p><p>This morning, Robert Mueller was even photographed paparazzo style as he arrived at his office. If reports are true, and at this point, it is really hard to know for sure what`s true anymore, Robert Mueller`s wrapping up his investigation and will soon present the findings of his nearly two- year probe to Attorney General William Barr.</p><p>Let`s make it clear. Despite claims in the White House that this report will fully exonerate the president, Mueller`s investigation has already revealed a range of events related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Six people connected to the president have been charged. Five have been convicted or have pleaded guilty, 28 others including 26 Russians have also been charged, and dozens of others have been swept up in the investigation, including campaign and administration officials, family members, Trump Organization executives and members of Trump`s legal team.</p><p>In total, Trump and his associates had more than 100 contacts with Russians before the inauguration. That`s what we already know. And soon, possibly any day now, we`re likely to find out even more from the special counsel.</p><p>But while we may still be waiting for Robert Mueller`s final report, congressional investigators are not. Democrats on powerful investigative committees seem to see the Mueller report as the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings is targeting Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner over their use of personal e-mail and the messaging app WhatsApp to conduct official White House business.</p><p>In a new letter to the White House, Cummings describes a conversation he had with Jared Kushner`s lawyer Abbe Lowell in which he told -- he says Lowell told him that Kushner, quote, \"continues to use what`s app to conduct White House business and he`s not sure whether Kushner ever used the app to transmit classified information.\" Lowell also told Cummings that Ivanka Trump is not preserving all of her official e-mail communications. Abbe Lowell informed the oversight committee that Ivanka Trump doesn`t preserve official e-mails she receives in her personal account if she doesn`t respond to them.</p><p>Cummings says that appears to violate the Presidential Records Act and the chairman is now demanding documents by April 4th to figure out what`s going on. And he signaled he may issue subpoenas if the White House refuses to comply. Now, the House Judiciary Chairman, Jerry Nadler, says his request for information from 81 associates and entities connected to the president has yielded tens of thousands of documents so far and that`s before any subpoenas have gone out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY), CHAIR, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We`ve gotten substantial response from very large number of people. We`ve gotten -- who have told us either here are documents or we`re preparing the documents, you`ll have them shortly. We`ve also gotten from a fair number of people saying we`d be happy to provide you documents if you give us a subpoena first, which we will do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: Now, of course not everybody`s playing nice. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has rejected Nadler`s request for documents. Roger Stone invoking the Fifth in response to his document request. And today we learned that the White House is rejecting a request from the intelligence, judiciary, and foreign affairs committees for documents relating to Trump`s private conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, because that would be interesting to see.</p><p>But as tensions escalate between Trump and the administration and Congress over crucial pieces of Democrats` oversight, today is a good reminder that these congressional investigations will go on far longer and will likely cover far more ground than Robert Mueller`s investigation.</p><p>Joining me now, David Corn, Washington bureau chief for \"Mother Jones\" and an MSNBC political analyst. And Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal correspondent for slate.com and host of the podcast \"Amicus.\"</p><p>Welcome to both of you.</p><p>Dahlia, what do you make -- what do you think -- what are you expecting to happen? You`ve written about this a month ago but what do you expect now as we are all waiting for this Mueller investigation?</p><p>DAHLIA LITHWICK, SENIOR EDITOR AND LEGAL CORRESPONDENT: I think you`re right that we have a little bit of a false binary here where we think we`re going to get a whiz bang all or nothing. And I think there is a whole range of intermediate things that could come about, right? I mean, I think we`re expecting there`s going to be indictments and there`s going to be a road map and there`s going to be unicorns and a pony and we`re all going to know, smoking gun, Watergate tapes. It doesn`t have to go down that way, and everything we know about Robert Mueller is that he tends to be less the kind of dramatic B act guy and just bare minimum law, you know, follow the law, this is a lifer who`s always conducted himself this way.</p><p>So I think there`s such an enormous gray area in there. And I think that for folks who have been doing a lot of magical thinking about what this is going to offer them, the smoking gun at the other end, they may be disappointed.</p><p>VELSHI: And let me just read from what you wrote in \"Slate\" last month.</p><p>For those who have been collecting the Mueller memes and the t-shirts and the mugs and who are waiting breathlessly for his conclusions, there`s a very reasonable chance that major disappointment looms. The Mueller report is unlikely to provide a perfect binary call to arms. He`s amassing facts on a limited series of questions.</p><p>Some of those facts will make their way to the public, but many will not. Congress will make decisions on how best to proceed. There`s going to be a torrent of no collusion fake news out of the White House. What comes next may not be perfectly certain.</p><p>David, you have written about this. You in fact are one of the people who wrote about Russian interference in the election before anybody was onto this.</p><p>So what do you expect will happen?</p><p>DAVID CORN, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, MOTHER JONES: Well, I think people have to take a deep breath because there is no obligation that Mueller has to produce a weighty massive report telling us all he knows. Now, I believe Mueller knows a lot, but it`s not his job to tell us everything. It`s been his job to look for crimes and prosecute cases he thinks he can reasonably bring before a jury.</p><p>Report, the only requirement for a report under the justice department guidelines, regulations is that the end of his investigation he`s supposed to explain his prosecutorial decisions to the attorney general in a confidential report. So, you can imagine that report looking like six pages, here`s what I`ve done, here`s what I prosecuted, why, or 6,000 pages, here`s everything I looked at and here`s why I prosecuted these cases, I didn`t prosecute those cases.</p><p>And I`m so glad -- I should say we have no reason at this point to believe or guess that he`s going to go in one direction more than the other. So people are expecting or assuming there`s going to be a massive storytelling report from him that will answer all questions are making a really big assumption, which is why it`s really important, Ali, that you just laid out what`s happening on the congressional side because after Mueller it`s up to Congress to tell the public what really happened.</p><p>VELSHI: And in fact the Democratic heads of congressional committees responded to the White House`s refusal to release documents related to the Trump-Putin communications in which they said: President Trump`s decision to break with this precedent raises the question of what he has to hide. We will be consulting on appropriate next steps. Congress has a constitutional duty to conduct oversight and investigate these matters, and we will fulfill that responsibility.</p><p>Powerful, dahlia, because it is signed by Elijah Cummings, the chair of the Oversight Committee, Eliot Engel, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee. We know Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee is on this.</p><p>Congress is making it very clear. This isn`t one additional information. We are going to get the information that is coming to us.</p><p>LITHWICK: That`s right. And Adam Schiff had a very, very I think powerful piece today essentially saying, look, there`s a back door to what everything you and I just said and David has said about there`s a limited brief for Mueller, it`s Russian, quote/unquote, collusion and it`s crimes that flow from that and it`s obstruction.</p><p>There`s a back door to this, which is this starts as a counterintelligence investigation. If there are counterintelligence elements that Mueller unearths, then the committee needs to see this. Adam Schiff`s committee needs to see this. And I think what he`s saying is this isn`t just a question of did the president commit crimes. If the president is compromised, Schiff is saying, then I need to know.</p><p>VELSHI: He keeps making that point, David Corn, that what is happening now is as relevant if not more relevant than what happened prior to the election. Today, I spoke with Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, who`s on the Intel and the Oversight Committees, about this new letter from Cummings asking about Jared Kushner`s use of WhatsApp to potentially talk to foreign leaders. Here`s what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL), OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: The reason why we don`t want him to have access to top secret materials is because of his tremendous financial vulnerabilities. And those extend as well to some of the Trump family. But in Jared Kushner`s case now that we hear that he`s using WhatsApp potentially as a communications device with foreign leaders, you know, some of my constituents are saying, you know, what`s up with the WhatsApp?</p><p>VELSHI: Yes.</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: You know, what types of material are being communicated in such an encrypted messaging service to foreign leaders? And that`s why we were concerned about his top secret clearance in the first place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: David Corn, this is interesting because some of what you`ve written about is the idea that there is an overlap here that we`ve never gotten to the bottom of with Donald Trump`s financial vulnerabilities and Jared Kushner`s very separate financial vulnerabilities and why these guys could be vulnerable to foreign powers not just in the campaign and not just before but today.</p><p>CORN: Yes, Ali, you hit it on the head there. Because you know, just looking at the Russia piece of this, we`ve only learned recently that Donald Trump was doing this big deal in Russia through June in the summer of 2016 trying to get hundreds of millions of dollars and talking to Putin`s office about that while running for president. It`s a business overlap. We don`t understand exactly everything that happened there. And he was doing this while Russia was attacking the U.S. election. Very important.</p><p>And now we have Jared Kushner, and there are literally scores, dozens of indications that his business interests and his official duties have overlapped, intersected, been at odds one way or the other. And this goes back to before the inauguration when he`s talking to Russian bankers and trying to set up a back channel between the Trump transition or the Trump White House itself and Russia and the Kremlin. I mean, this is why it`s frustrating that people are getting so worked up and expectant about the Mueller report, because we could spend a whole hour here going down a long list of issues and items and controversies and scandals the American public should get answers to at some point and they won`t all come from Mueller.</p><p>VELSHI: So we`ve got a lot of people for different reasons who want different information and want different things from this report.</p><p>Dahlia, James Comey wrote an op-ed in the \"New York Times\" today in which he writes in part: I hope that Mr. Trump is not impeached and removed from office before the end of his term. I don`t mean that Congress shouldn`t move ahead with the process of impeachment governed by our constitution if Congress thinks the provable facts are there. I just hope it doesn`t because if Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country.</p><p>Your thoughts.</p><p>LITHWICK: Yes, that was crazy making. And stipulate the beginning of that op-ed I thought was very fair and right. He`s saying look, I don`t have a dog in this fight, I just want the facts. Good point. Stipulated.</p><p>But then he has this funny turn where he says whatever the outcome is don`t go for impeachment because there`s going to be a blowback. And I think the very notion that we are going to conform our responses to the Mueller report to sort of mollify angry people who are not going to accept it as true is first of all kind of how Comey got into trouble with Hillary Clinton in the first instance, but that can`t be the answer. We can`t be afraid of where truth takes us.</p><p>And if truth takes us to a place that causes a lot of people to be very angry and then to conform our actions because of that I think is exactly why, you know, this starts to look like asymmetrical warfare.</p><p>VELSHI: All right. Good point to end it on. Thank you.</p><p>Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor for \"Slate\" and the host of the podcast \"Amicus.\" And David Corn is a Washington, D.C. editor for \"Mother Jones\" and MSNBC political analyst. He`s also the author of a great book, \"Showdown: The Inside Story of How Obama Fought Back Against Boehner, Kantor and the Tea Party.\"</p><p>Coming up, my interview with presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. We talk about Jamie Dimon, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and pretty much everything in between. That`s next.</p><p>And a very rich guy and former labor secretary is going to join me to call out CEOs who could help fix inequality but they aren`t.</p><p>And, an in-depth look at how 29-year-old ex-bartender has upended America`s political conversation. That`s up next.</p><p>VELSHI: It is no secret that Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has had an adversarial relationship with the heads of America`s big bank. And none of them has been more outspoken and opponent of Warren`s policies than JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.</p><p>During the Obama administration, Dimon publicly criticized Warren over her plan to break up the big banks and Warren made Dimon a symbol of corporate greed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: Jamie Dimon got a race after he negotiated $17 billion to payoff for activities that were illegal that he presided over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: That`s why it grabbed a lot of attention on Monday when Jamie Dimon started talking about income inequality and sound a little bit, a very little bit, albeit, like Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JP MORGAN CHASE: I should say, I don`t want to be a tone-deaf CEO, but the company is doing fine. It is absolutely obvious that, you know, a big chunk has been left behind.</p><p>So, 40 percent of Americans make less than $15 an hour, 40 percent of Americans can`t afford a $400 bill whether it`s medical or fixing a car or something like that, 15 percent of Americans make minimum wages. You have 70,000 died from opioids.</p><p>So, we`ve kind of bifurcated the economy. I`ve got these terrible things out there.</p><p>VELSHI: Income inequality has become a major issue in the Democratic Party over the last decade and is a major topic in the 2020 presidential primary. And perhaps no candidate has a more ambitious plan to solve it than Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>Now, she`s got a different approach. She`s proposed a 2 percent wealth tax on the richest Americans. It`s not an income tax, but a tax on the net wealth of rich individuals, a category that includes everything from stock and investments to the value of homes, paintings and yachts.</p><p>And here`s why that`s important. New analysis out this week from the Tax Policy Center shows that the vast majority of Americans get most of their money from wages and salary and only a little bit of their money from wealth or capital gains, which includes things like investments or the value of your home and is taxed at a lower rate than wages and salary.</p><p>But if you look at the top 0.01 percent of America, it`s the opposite. The top tenth of the top 1 percent, most of their money comes from what they earn off of their capital, which is taxed at a much lower rate if at all. While a much smaller portion of their wealth, sometimes none at all, comes from the higher-taxed wages and salary.</p><p>In other words, taxing wealth is one way to curb income inequality. So, the question is whether this newly concerned citizen, Jamie Dimon, will get behind his former rival`s plan to solve the problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VELSHI: Senator Elizabeth Warren joins me now.</p><p>Senator, good to see you. Thank you for being with us.</p><p>WARREN: Good to see you. I`m delighted to be here.</p><p>VELSHI: I am always fascinated at the attention bankers get when they say things that most of us can see with our eyes, that we have income inequality and we have a bank -- you know, we have a bifurcated economy.</p><p>You have a proposal as to how to deal with that or at least how to take some of that wealth and do things that would make us feel less bifurcated. Tell us why you think that`s going to work.</p><p>WARREN: So, look, you`ve described the wealth tax. This is the tax on the top 1/10 of 1 percent. And here`s what we could actually do with that money. We could actually invest it in building more opportunity for everyone else.</p><p>In fact, I`ll give you an example of this that`s very personal to me. Years ago, I had a little one at home, not yet 2 years old, and I decided I wanted to go back to school. And, you know, that`s a good thing, right? I managed all of it, the tuition, the application, the tests, every part of it.</p><p>You know where I nearly stubbed my toe? I came down to the last weekend before classes started trying to find childcare that was good and affordable. So, finally, I find it, it all locks into place.</p><p>Roll forward just a little bit in time, and I get my first real tenure track teaching job. Now I`ve got two little ones under foot. I`m working my heart out. I`m doing everything I can.</p><p>I`m excited. I love this job. I work myself into the dirt at night. What`s the part that nearly knocks me over? It`s when the babysitter quits.</p><p>VELSH: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: And then we cycle through one after another after another on childcare until finally my Aunt Bea calls me and it`s late at night. She says, how are you doing, honey? And I start to cry and say, I`m going to quit because I just can`t do this anymore because I can`t keep the childcare held together.</p><p>Here`s the thing that I think about. Here I am now, I ended up as a college professor, I wrote 11 books, I started an agency, I became a United States senator, and twice I nearly got completely derailed --</p><p>VELSHI: Uh-huh, because of childcare.</p><p>WARREN: -- by childcare. How many women of my generation just got knocked off the tracks?</p><p>VELSHI: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: How many of my daughter`s generation have been knocked off their tracks? How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the tracks?</p><p>Understand this. The wealthy, they buy top-notch childcare and top-notch early education. Pre-K and pre-pre-K and play groups for 2-year-olds. Well, you know, if we did that ultra millionaire`s wealth tax, we could then afford to provide high-quality childcare for every single child in America zero to 5, and the pre-K and the pre-pre-K early childhood education, for all of them, and still have $2 trillion left over to invest in other opportunities.</p><p>VELSHI: And that childcare is something --</p><p>WARREN: That`s the real point. We could do better.</p><p>VELSHI: It`s something that every other developed nation does better than the United States.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>VELSHI: I want to talk to you about your plan. You and I spoke briefly about this the other day on technology.</p><p>The aforementioned Jamie Dimon also said today on CNBC that tech giants should gird themselves for the type of regulatory onslaught that the big banks experienced after the financial crisis.</p><p>Quote: they haven`t had the benefit of the full monty yet, Dimon said. If I were them, I`d be getting prepared for it.</p><p>There are a number of people who`ve said that your proposal for managing the way large tech companies behave is one worthy of description. You were talking about companies largely that have more than $25 billion in revenue not being both the pipe and the stuff that goes through the pipe. Not being both the platform and the competitor.</p><p>WARREN: Right. That`s exactly right.</p><p>So think of a company like Amazon. You know, everybody goes to buy and sell on Amazon. That`s the platform.</p><p>And then Amazon does something really special. They not only run the platform. They gather information from every one of those transactions, every buyer, every seller. And then they discover that, you know, Pete`s pet pillows is making a big profit and Amazon looks at that and says, hmm, we could do that.</p><p>So what do they do? They jump in front of Pete`s pet pillows, move Pete back to page 6 on your search, jump in and take the profits for themselves. Now, my view on this is, you can be the umpire. That is, you can run the platform, or you can have a team in the game. That is, you can be one of the competitors buying and selling on that platform.</p><p>But you don`t get to do both at the same time, because if you`re doing both at the same time, that`s not helping competition. It`s wiping out competition.</p><p>It`s why a lot of investors now in tech, the early investors, they refer to the zones around companies like Amazon and Google. They call it the dead zone because it means somebody starts to grow a business in there, then Amazon, Google, Facebook just reaches out and snatches up the business. And that`s not -- that doesn`t promote competition.</p><p>So I think they ought to be broken apart. Run that platform. You can still go online and search for 28 coffeemakers that can be delivered in 24 hours. But break that up from the part about running a business that competes on that platform.</p><p>VELSHI: I want to ask you about something that`s from your campaign announcement of the break-up bill. You said: Platform utilities -- let`s call them that -- would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.</p><p>This is the concern that a lot of individuals have, right? The commoditization and the monetization of your information. It`s probably a bigger concern --</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>VELSHI: -- than the privacy concerns we think with, which are very, very serious in and of themselves. You`re trying to figure out a way that he can better control of or they can have less control of our data.</p><p>WARREN: That`s exactly right. It`s about data and the uses, the unfair competitive advantage it gives them, and that we don`t want them calling the rest of the shots in the economy.</p><p>And, by the way, you know, we have a long history of this in the United States. Way back when, more than 100 years ago when we said in effect to the railroad companies -- hey, guys, you don`t get to run a railroad company and own the steel business that needs to transship their goods on the railroad. And also, you don`t get to charge discriminatory prices, that is, prefer one seller over another seller.</p><p>When you`re out there running a platform, whether it`s a railroad or it`s an online exchange, you have a duty of fair dealing to everybody who comes to buy and sell on that platform or to move goods along that platform. The idea is in America if we really want to have markets that work they`ve got to be markets with rules -- markets without rules are theft -- and they`ve got to be markets that help competition get a chance to grow and flourish.</p><p>I think of what I`m talking about is for all of the little businesses that want to grow into medium size and big businesses, for all the entrepreneurs that have a great idea and want a chance to get out there and compete. For all of the people who really believe that markets are places where those who have good ideas get to move forward. That`s what our antitrust laws are about. And that`s where we need to update them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VELSHI: OK. That`s just some of my conversation with Elizabeth Warren from earlier. What she had to say about socialism, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, and the state of the Democratic Party is next.</p><p>VELSHI: We`re back with more of my interview with Democratic Presidential Candidate Elizabeth Warren where I asked her about her stance on socialism and the Democratic Party`s rising star, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Time Magazine`s got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the front cover, something that a lot of conservative news channels and websites, they`re sort of targeting the idea that she represents a socialism that they think is embracing the Democratic Party or that the Democratic Party and some candidates are embracing.</p><p>One of the things, the criticisms that you get is that you`re anti- capitalist. Where do you position yourself and what do you explain to people? Because in your years of trying to get a fair treatment of consumers, with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, somehow that put you up against the banks and that caused you to be described as anti- capitalist.</p><p>WARREN: You know, it`s wrong. What I believe is I believe in markets and I believe in what markets can produce if they have rules and a cop on the beat to enforce those rules. So I`m glad to see people able to go out and get mortgages.</p><p>But we saw what happened before the crash when there were no rules and there was no cop on the beat to enforce any rules. And that meant that the giant banks could figure out that they could make a bazillion dollars in profits basically by cheating people. That`s not going to work. And that`s capitalism that will destroy itself.</p><p>What I believe in is I believe in markets. But you`ve got to have a cop on the beat to make sure everybody`s playing on a level playing field. That nobody is building a business model around cheating people, around ripping them off, around tricking them, and trapping them.</p><p>And look, there are some places, markets just don`t work. Public education. You know, I`m a former school teacher. I was a special needs teacher. We need public education. It`s not a place for markets.</p><p>Much of our health care system. You know, somebody`s having the first signs of a heart attack, they`re not going to make five phone calls to see who can deal most effectively with a heart attack and at what price. There are places where markets don`t work.</p><p>And that means we`ve got to step in and find other ways to make sure that people get what it is that they need, an education, health care. But there are a lot of places where markets can work if they have rules.</p><p>And here`s the problem. Big financial institutions, they didn`t like those rules. They spent more than a million dollars a day lobbying against the consumer agency and other financial regulations. Well, that`s a problem we`ve got right now.</p><p>Washington works great for giant companies. It works great for the rich and the powerful. It`s just not working for everyone else.</p><p>So we`ve got to get in there, we`ve got to have a government that helps us level the playing field, make sure everybody`s playing on the straight up. And when we do that, we create more opportunity for everyone else.</p><p>Look, the giants may not like it. They don`t want to turn loose of their power and their extraordinary profits that they keep sucking up. But this is how we make our government work. This is how we make our country work. That`s what I think it should be all about in the U.S.</p><p>VELSHI: So what do you say privately, pretend we`re not on T.V., about people who worry about the direction in which the Democratic Party may be going? Some of the party wants candidates to be more liberal and others want the candidates to be more moderate. What`s your take on that?</p><p>WARREN: Let me give you a different way to look at it. I want our party to be more grassroots. I want our party to be more connected to people all across this country.</p><p>And I`ll tell you how I look at that. I look at that in terms of money. So for example, I don`t take PAC money of any kind. I don`t take Washington lobbyist money of any kind. And I`ve made the decision that I`m going to spend my time with grassroots all around this country trying to build a movement.</p><p>Now, that`s a different way to try to power a political campaign, to try to power a presidential campaign. It means that I need help. I`ve got to reach out to a lot of people and say please join me, come to elizabethwarren.com and kick in five bucks if you think that`s how a campaign should work.</p><p>Because I think as a Democratic Party, we have this extraordinary opportunity during a primary to actually make our case to people at the grassroots to engage them and to revitalize our democracy. They shouldn`t just be about going to places where we can scoop up lots of money and then run lots of T.V. ads.</p><p>This should be about building the on-the-ground movement that`s going to help us win in 2020, that`s going to help us win not just the White House but Congress, the State Houses, the governor`s mansions, and that`s going to help us have the power to be able to start making real change in this country come January 2021.</p><p>VELSHI: Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you for your time tonight.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>VELSHI: And MSNBC has more Contenders coverage. My colleague Stephanie Ruhle will interview former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz tomorrow 9:00 a.m. Eastern on MSNBC.</p><p>And up next, rich guy Nick Hanauer and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich have a message for CEOs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN: We`ve got to have a government that helps us level the playing field, make sure everybody`s playing on the straight up. And when we do that, we create more opportunity for everyone else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VELSHI: Democratic presidential candidates are offering proposals to address income inequality. Elizabeth Warren, as you just heard, wants a wealth tax. Bernie Sanders wants a hike in the estate tax to name a few. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who`s not running for president, she`s too young to do that, has proposed a 70 percent tax rate on income above $10 million.</p><p>In contrast, President Trump has embraced trickle-down economics with a massive tax cut for the wealthy. One of my next guests is a wealthy entrepreneur but he`s issued a dire warning about inequality. In 2014, Nick Hanauer wrote, \"I have a message for my fellow filthy rich. If we don`t do something to fix the glaring inequalities in this economy, the pitchforks are going to come for us.\"</p><p>So are the pitchforks still coming? And what should the presidential candidates do about it? Joining me now Nick Hanauer, venture capitalist and host of the \"Pitchforks Economics\" podcast. And Robert Reich, former labor secretary under President Clinton and currently a professor of public policy University of California at Berkeley. His latest book \"The Common Good\" was recently released in paperback. Gentlemen, thank you for being with us.</p><p>Nick, let me start with you.</p><p>NICK HANAUER, HOST, PITCHFORK ECONOMICS PODCAST: Thank you.</p><p>VELSHI: Four hundred Americans, this is the latest findings from Berkeley, Gabriel Zucman, 400 Americans own more of the country`s riches than the 150 million adults in the bottom 60 percent of the wealth distribution.</p><p>And frankly those numbers, Nick, are not different regardless of where you go. If you look at it globally, it`s still small numbers of people control more wealth than the bottom half of humanity. What -- tell me how you identify what to do -- why that`s a problem and what to do about it.</p><p>HANAUER: Yes. Well, I mean it`s really clear that rising economic inequality, and it has gotten much, much worse over the last 30, 40 years, is both harming the economy by killing the feedback loop between what consumers can buy and what businesses can sell but equally it`s shredding the social cohesion and reciprocity norms upon which democracies depend.</p><p>And our political polarization, of course, is a consequence of rising inequality. And in particular, you know, you played this clip of Jamie Dimon earlier, who has apparently discovered that economic inequality is a thing and 40 percent of Americans earn less than $15 an hour.</p><p>What`s really striking to me is that Jamie has not apparently woken up to the fact that many of the people earning less than $15 an hour work for him. A bank teller at JP Morgan Chase earns $12 an hour. And that`s the problem, is $12 an hour is about 40 percent less than you need to live in a city like Seattle.</p><p>And here`s the really incredible thing, is that Chase earns about -- JP Morgan earns about $44 billion, that`s B, billion dollars a year in profits. If they -- they employ 250,000 workers. If they took the bottom 200,000 workers and paid them each $25,000 a year, that would be barely -- that would be about 10 percent of their annual profits.</p><p>And that`s what Corporate America needs to do. They need to stop talking and start paying people a wage that allows them to live with security and dignity.</p><p>VELSHI: Yes. Robert, you wrote about Jamie Dimon this week, \"I`m glad JP Morgan is starting a new jobs program but in my book, Dimon is still a tone-deaf CEO.\" I mean I`m just fascinated, right, when CEOs come around to this.</p><p>I don`t know how many years you and I have had something akin to this discussion continuously. And now you get guys who have platforms to say I think our society`s bifurcating, we`ve got to do something about it.</p><p>ROBERT REICH, FORMER CLINTON LABOR SECRETARY: Well, it`s easy to say something about it. And it`s very, very difficult to actually do something about it.</p><p>But if you are the CEO of the biggest bank on Wall Street and you`re the chairman of the business round table, which is a group of CEOs of the biggest companies in America, you can do something about it.</p><p>You`ve got political clout if you cared about raising the minimum wage, the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. If you cared about raising taxes on the wealthiest people. If you cared about getting rid of monopolies. If you cared about any -- strengthening labor unions.</p><p>Anything that is actually going to help rebalance this economy, you could much more easily than anybody else. You could actually use your clout. The fact of the matter is that Jamie Dimon and none of -- I mean the big disappointment, Ali, is that Corporate America, the CEOs of Corporate America who in the first 15 years after the Second World War really did exercise some clout for the good of average Americans.</p><p>Basically, greed has so taken over, they don`t care. And they will just basically do what is good for them.</p><p>VELSHI: Nick, let me just tell you. I mean these weirdly socialistic policies that we talk about, Elizabeth Warren`s wealth tax, which by the way has an approval rating of 61 percent in a recent \"New York Times\" poll, is a two percent on your wealth above $50 million.</p><p>Median income in America is about $55,000. The Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez`s plan for a 70 percent tax rate, again, what everybody`s calling socialist, 51 percent approval rating. It`s on income above $10 million per year. Median family income, about $55,000 in America. Anybody who thinks this is socialist has an ulterior motive here.</p><p>HANAUER: Yes. No, I mean these ideas are positioned as fringe, extremist, lefty socialist. Nothing could be further from the truth. These were basically the policies we had in place in the middle of the last century that propelled the greatest expansion of the middle class in our country`s history. And, by the way, are perfectly correlated with the lowest amounts of political polarization we`ve had in our country.</p><p>And these two things are inextricably intertwined. When rich people pay their fair share and middle-class families thrive, the nation grows faster and our politics works better. And so these ideas are not outlandish. It is in fact kind of what we used to do.</p><p>Not the wealth tax but certainly a marginal tax rate of 90 percent was what we had in place in the `60s. And again, this is not unreasonable. There is no earthly reason why somebody needs to make 100 or 200 million dollars a year and pay low tax rates. It`s not good for anybody.</p><p>VELSHI: Robert Reich, what`s the consequence of a small group of people, of wealth concentrated in a small group of people, greater wealth than the bottom half of humanity? If everybody else is making money more than they did last year and more than inflation, what`s your long-term worry about a world that`s going in this direction?</p><p>REICH: Well, there are two big, big problems. One problem is we lose democracy because with great wealth amassed at the top comes great political power and that political power -- basically, nobody else has heard and a lot of political scientists have actually already measured this already. And we can see we`re losing democracy because big money is taking over.</p><p>The second problem is that you don`t have enough what`s called aggregate demand in the economy. That is, we produce a lot of goods and services. But unless people have the ability to buy those goods and services, the economy over the long term can`t actually sustain itself.</p><p>So a very rich person, somebody who owns a business, it is in his or her interest over the long term to make sure that the rising tide is lifting all boats or there won`t be a business.</p><p>VELSHI: Guys, I could sit and have this conversation for an hour. We don`t have that kind of time but I would like to invite you back so that we can continue to deal with what may be one of the intractable economic problems of our time, rising --</p><p>REICH: It is tractable.</p><p>VELSHI: All right. Fair enough, tractable economic problems of our time.</p><p>HANAUER: It is.</p><p>VELSHI: And it may be tractable because we can talk about it. Thank you, guys.</p><p>REICH: Thanks, Ali.</p><p>VELSHI: Nick Hanauer and Robert Reich, thank you for joining us.</p><p>HANAUER: Thank you so much.</p><p>VELSHI: How Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez`s life has shaped her politics, that`s next.</p><p>VELSHI: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is America`s most famous freshman member of Congress. A progressive firebrand, the right`s new favorite villain. And now the subject of a Time Magazine cover.</p><p>Her policy proposals, like the green new deal, are being debated by Democratic presidential candidates. Ocasio-Cortez tells Time Magazine, \"I used to be much more cynical about how much was up against us. I think I`ve changed my mind because I think that change is a lot closer than we think.\" Why does she think that? That`s next.</p><p>VELSHI: This week`s Time Magazine cover is titled \"The Phenom, How Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became America`s Lightning Rod.\"</p><p>Joining me now is writer Charlotte Alter. It`s a great piece. It tells a lot of people if they missed the creation story of Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, this is it.</p><p>She tweeted on March 8 about being working class, being a waitress. She said, \"I find it revealing when people mock where I came from, and say they`re going to send me back to waitressing as if that is bad or shameful. It is as though they think that being a member of Congress makes you intrinsically better than a waitress. But our job is to serve, not rule.\"</p><p>She`s a freshman member of Congress but she has a guiding philosophy that has made her a lightning rod according to your article.</p><p>CHARLOTTE ALTER, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, TIME MAGAZINE: Absolutely. Yes, she`s basically an activist with a congressional pin. And a lot of people see her as the conscience of the Democratic Party.</p><p>I think that her working-class background is absolutely intrinsic to the story she`s telling and to her power in this moment right now because she can really authentically speak to the issues that are facing a lot of people.</p><p>And she`s faced a lot of issues that not only other working class people have faced but also millennials have largely faced like student debt, health care affordability, college affordability, climate change, those are all things that she`s really experienced firsthand. So I think she`s speaking to something that hasn`t really been spoken to before.</p><p>VELSHI: Her age is important here. She`s 29-years-old. She responded to a tweet that you had sent. So I want to read your tweet first and then hers is on the top of the screen. Yours is, \"In order to understand AOC, you have to look at what she experienced, and what she didn`t, Red Scare, Reaganomics and prosperous 90s were all before her time. Her adulthood was defined by financial crisis, debt, and climate change. No wonder she and her peers are moving left.\"</p><p>She responded by saying, \"Yes. And this is not just my story, this is true of wide swaths of our entire generation who are now poised to become a much more influential civic and electoral block as we mature into our 30s and beyond.\" She`s almost suggesting her ascent is inevitable.</p><p>ALTER: And honestly, it is in some ways. You`ve got to look at the math here, right. We have the oldest first-term president ever elected until 10 -- until a couple of months ago, Congress was 10 years older than it had been in the 1980s. Trump has surrounded himself with people who are rooted in 20th Century ways of thinking.</p><p>And the thing about AOC and the reason that she is I think tapping into something that is so exciting to some and threatening to others is that she is really bringing us into the politics of the 21st Century. She`s a 21st Century leader trying to tackle 21st Century problems, in a body that`s largely dominated by 20th Century thinking.</p><p>VELSHI: Do you get the sense that she understands why she`s so threatening?</p><p>ALTER: I think she does. I think there`s a lot of different reasons why she`s so threatening.</p><p>Some people are threatened because she`s a young Hispanic woman. Some people are threatened because they worry she`s too far-left. Some people are threatened because she`s kind of turning over the apple cart and disrupting the way things have typically worked in Washington.</p><p>She`s spent her first week of orientation picketing. You know, staging a protest in Nancy Pelosi`s office, that`s not something that people have typically done. So I think she`s -- I think a lot of people find her threatening but I also think a lot of people find her really exciting.</p><p>VELSHI: Thank you for a great article, Charlotte Alter.</p><p>ALTER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>VELSHI: Charlotte Alter, and her article, is in the current issue of Time Magazine. And that is tonight`s LAST WORD.</p><p>\"THE 11TH HOUR\" with Brian Williams starts right now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Later, he sat with Tusk, Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron and Italy's caretaker leader Guiseppe Conte.</p><p>Johnson has already met separately this week with Merkel and Macron, who have challenged him to come up with a better alternative to the main sticking point, the deadlock on the Irish border question.</p><p>___</p><p>3:10 p.m.</p><p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has touched down in the French seaside resort of Biarritz for his first Group of Seven summit, a gathering where he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time.</p><p>The meeting between the two men is expected to be crucial as Johnson prepares to pull Britain out of the European Union.</p><p>Johnson spoke earlier this week with French President Emmanuel Macron, the host of the summit of leaders of the world's rich democracies, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p><p>Responding to European Council President Donald Tusk's comment earlier that he didn't believe Johnson wanted to go down as \"Mr. No Deal,\" referring to Britain leaving the EU without an agreement, Johnson effectively said their fates were tied over the issue of Ireland.</p><p>Johnson said that \"if Donald Tusk doesn't want to go down as Mr. No Deal Brexit, then I hope that point should be born in mind by him too.\"</p><p>___</p><p>2:45 p.m.</p><p>A march against the Group of Seven summit has ended peacefully, after thousands of activists for various causes walked from southwest France into Spain under heavy security.</p><p>Regional police said no arrests or incidents were reported during Saturday's march from Hendaye in France to Irun in Spain, and estimated some 9,000 people took part.</p><p>Protesters came from multiple countries to demonstrate for more action against climate change, for indigenous peoples, free trade deals and other causes. Some wore masks representing G-7 leaders meeting in nearby Biarritz.</p><p>Protester Gael Gilles, 30, told The Associated Press, \"there is too much inequality in this world and I am here to demonstrate peacefully against this G7 ... to tell (the leaders) that they do not go into the good direction on the climate and other things.\"</p><p>___</p><p>1:35 p.m.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron says he's launching an appeal to all world powers to help Brazil and other South American countries fight the fires burning in the Amazon.</p><p>Before the Group of Seven summit, which begins Saturday, Macron thrust the rainforest fires to the top of the agenda. He touched on it again in a national address, which took place just as U.S. President Donald Trump touched down in the French seaside resort of Biarritz.</p><p>Macron also called for an end to the trade wars he said are \"taking hold everywhere.\" Just before Trump left the United States, he again threatened tariffs on French wines in retaliation for a French measure taxing technology companies.</p><p>___</p><p>12:40 p.m.</p><p>European Council President Donald Tusk has promised EU retaliation if the U.S. makes good on its threats to impose tariffs on French wine.</p><p>Just before leaving for the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, U.S. President Donald Trump again threatened new taxes on French wine in response to a French measure taxing internet companies.</p><p>Tusk said that \"the last thing we need and want is confrontation with our best ally, the United States.\" But he said France can count on EU loyalty for one of its most valuable exports.</p><p>___</p><p>12:35 p.m.</p><p>European Council President Donald Tusk says this year's Group of Seven summit will be an \"unusually difficult\" meeting of the leaders of some of the world's most powerful democracies.</p><p>The summit begins Saturday in the southern French resort town of Biarritz. Tusk warned in particular against trade wars, which he said could lead to a global recession. Other threats include climate change, and technology that is developing more quickly than the ability to regulate.</p><p>He warned that it could be the last moment to restore unity among the G-7 countries.</p><p>___</p><p>12:25 p.m.</p><p>France is pressing the White House to endorse a global pledge at the Group of Seven summit to better fight against the spread of hate speech on the internet.</p><p>Cedric O, a French official in charge of digital economy, told reporters that the other six nations in the G-7 have already backed the pledge, as have Google and Facebook.</p><p>The U.S. didn't endorse a similar pledge after the mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, earlier this year. O said the pledge includes a commitment to fight terrorist and hate speech on the internet, transparency on the process, and defense of freedom of expression.</p><p>___</p><p>11:50 a.m.</p><p>Hundreds of protesters are marching as Group of Seven leaders arrive in the French resort town of Biarritz.</p><p>Protesters planned to cross into Spain from the French border village town of Hendaye. As the march began, they held cardboard signs aloft with pictures of Earth, protesting against climate policies they blame on the world's G-7 countries.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, the host, put the Amazon fires at the top of the agenda for the weekend meeting.</p><p>___</p><p>11:30 a.m.</p><p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has arrived for the Group of Seven summit amid escalating tensions with South Korea.</p><p>South Korea canceled a deal to share military intelligence, mainly on North Korea, after a trade dispute between the two countries.</p><p>Relations between two countries, both allies of the U.S., are at their lowest point since they established diplomatic ties in 1965.</p><p>Abe's plane touched down in the French seaside resort on Biarritz on Saturday morning.</p><p>___</p><p>11:05 a.m.</p><p>Germany says that impeding a trade deal between the European Union and South American trade bloc Mercosur won't help reduce the destruction of rainforest in Brazil.</p><p>On Friday, Group of Seven summit host French President Emmanuel Macron threatened to block the recently agreed trade deal with Mercosur, which also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Ireland joined in the threat.</p><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made clear she shares Macron's concern about the fires. But her government said in an emailed response Saturday to a query about the threat to the Mercosur deal that its trade section \"includes an ambitious sustainability chapter with binding rules on climate protection,\" in which both sides committed to implementing the Paris climate accord.</p><p>It added: \"the non-conclusion (of the deal) is therefore from our point of view not the appropriate response to what is currently happening in Brazil.\"</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the Group of Seven leaders \"cannot be silent\" in the face of fires sweeping parts of Brazil's Amazon and will call for everything to be done to stop fires in the rainforest.</p><p>Germany is backing French President Emmanuel Macron's call to discuss the fires at the weekend's French-hosted G-7 summit. Merkel said in her weekly video message released Saturday: \"Emmanuel Macron is right - our house is burning, and we cannot be silent.\"</p><p>She said leaders are \"shaken\" by the fires and that they will discuss \"how we can support and help there, and send a clear call that everything must be done so that the rainforest stops burning.\"</p><p>Amid a series of policy and trade disagreements, which she didn't address explicitly, Merkel said that \"talking to each other is always better than about each other - and the G-7 is an excellent opportunity for that.\"</p><p>___</p><p>10:30 a.m.</p><p>World leaders and protesters are converging on the southern French resort town of Biarritz for the G-7 summit.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron is the host of the summit, which begins Saturday and has emptied out the town famed for its beach on the last week of the summer break. He has downplayed any expectations of a unified front from the leaders of the Group of Seven democracies.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump arrives later in the day. At last year's meeting, Trump left early and repudiated the joint statement from Air Force One.</p><p>At the top of the agenda are climate change - and especially the fires burning in the Amazon - and a global economy teetering on the edge of recession.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Justice Department says it will take into account the \"widespread concerns\" about social media, search engines and online retail services expressed by consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. Its antitrust division is seeking information from the public, including those in the tech industry.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, top antitrust official Makan Delrahim worries that without meaningful competition, \"digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.

The Justice Department says it will take into account the \"widespread concerns\" about social media, search engines and online retail services expressed by consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. Its antitrust division is seeking information from the public, including those in the tech industry.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, top antitrust official Makan Delrahim worries that without meaningful competition, \"digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.</p><p>___</p><p>6:15 p.m.</p><p>A longtime digital advertising executive and antitrust expert says American consumers and news publishers need competitive tech markets.</p><p>Dina Srinivasan spoke Tuesday after the Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust investigation into big tech companies. She says increased competition could help solve wide-ranging privacy concerns in tech.</p><p>But Blair Levin, a former leading Federal Communications Commission staffer, says it's not clear that antitrust regulations would solve all, or even any, of the other concerns.</p><p>Tech companies are facing scrutiny that ranges widely from privacy concerns to protection of children to political interference. Levin says regulators need to carefully line up which institutions can address which issues - and antitrust likely won't take care of all of them.</p><p>___</p><p>6:05 p.m.</p><p>One Wall Street analyst believes the Justice Department's announced review of technology companies will lead to business model tweaks and fines rather than broader structural changes such as breaking up the companies.</p><p>Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities says any resulting probe would likely take many years, and that the government would ultimately fail to break up the companies without changes to antitrust laws. He says that's unlikely.</p><p>The Justice Department says it is opening an investigation into whether big online companies have hurt competition or innovation.</p><p>The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.</p><p>Shares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple are down slightly in after-hours trading, while Google's stock is unchanged. All four had closed up for the day.</p><p>___</p><p>5:55 p.m.</p><p>A Harvard professor who worked in the Obama administration says one challenge with the Justice Department's announced probe of big tech companies is to avoid politicizing it.</p><p>Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, says the antitrust scrutiny on the companies is long overdue. He just hopes it's \"fast and effective enough that it can actually improve the functioning of the market.\"</p><p>As for whether any outcome could be expected before next year's presidential elections, Furman says these cases take a long time to investigate, let alone litigate.</p><p>The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.</p><p>___</p><p>5:45 p.m.</p><p>An antitrust expert believes a Justice Department investigation into whether major technology companies are abusing their market power may prompt regulators to interpret the law in new ways.</p><p>The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.</p><p>University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp says one possible way the companies have been doing that is by collectively buying hundreds of startups in recent years to devour their technology and prevent them from growing into formidable rivals.</p><p>Traditionally, antitrust regulators have only sought to block acquisitions involving two big companies. But Hovenkamp says U.S. antitrust law is broad enough for regulators to consider the potential damage wrought by relatively small deals too.</p><p>___</p><p>5:30 p.m.</p><p>Major tech companies facing congressional antitrust scrutiny have no comment on the Justice Department's just announced probe.</p><p>The department says it is opening sweeping antitrust investigation of Big Tech and whether the online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.

Levin says regulators need to carefully line up which institutions can address which issues - and antitrust likely won't take care of all of them.</p><p>___</p><p>6:05 p.m.</p><p>One Wall Street analyst believes the Justice Department's announced review of technology companies will lead to business model tweaks and fines rather than broader structural changes such as breaking up the companies.</p><p>Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities says any resulting probe would likely take many years, and that the government would ultimately fail to break up the companies without changes to antitrust laws. He says that's unlikely.</p><p>The Justice Department says it is opening an investigation into whether big online companies have hurt competition or innovation.</p><p>The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.</p><p>Shares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple are down slightly in after-hours trading, while Google's stock is unchanged. All four had closed up for the day.</p><p>___</p><p>5:55 p.m.</p><p>A Harvard professor who worked in the Obama administration says one challenge with the Justice Department's announced probe of big tech companies is to avoid politicizing it.</p><p>Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, says the antitrust scrutiny on the companies is long overdue. He just hopes it's \"fast and effective enough that it can actually improve the functioning of the market.\"</p><p>As for whether any outcome could be expected before next year's presidential elections, Furman says these cases take a long time to investigate, let alone litigate.</p><p>The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.</p><p>___</p><p>5:45 p.m.</p><p>An antitrust expert believes a Justice Department investigation into whether major technology companies are abusing their market power may prompt regulators to interpret the law in new ways.</p><p>The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.</p><p>University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp says one possible way the companies have been doing that is by collectively buying hundreds of startups in recent years to devour their technology and prevent them from growing into formidable rivals.</p><p>Traditionally, antitrust regulators have only sought to block acquisitions involving two big companies. But Hovenkamp says U.S. antitrust law is broad enough for regulators to consider the potential damage wrought by relatively small deals too.</p><p>___</p><p>5:30 p.m.</p><p>Major tech companies facing congressional antitrust scrutiny have no comment on the Justice Department's just announced probe.</p><p>The department says it is opening sweeping antitrust investigation of Big Tech and whether the online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. It did not name any specific companies in its announcement.</p><p>Amazon had no comment. Facebook also did not have an immediate comment.</p><p>Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company's benefits to consumers.</p><p>Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn't think \"anybody reasonable\" would call Apple a monopoly.</p><p>___</p><p>5:15 p.m.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department says it is opening a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p>It comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. President Donald Trump also has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months.</p><p>___</p><p>4:50 p.m.</p><p>The Washington Post is reporting that the Federal Trade Commission will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement.</p><p>The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.</p><p>Advertisers were reportedly able to target users who provided their phone number as part of a two-factor authentication security feature.</p><p>The FTC didn't respond immediately to a request for comment. Facebook had no comment.</p><p>The complaints will reportedly be detailed in a settlement on Wednesday. Facebook won't be required to admit guilt but will have to submit to federal oversight, the newspaper reported.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-e334256d27254a28a3b5d6db041ec5b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-D4S1-DYN6-W218-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><timeReceived>10:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Justice Department says it will take into account the \"widespread concerns\" about social media, search engines and online retail services expressed by consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. Its antitrust division is seeking information from the public, including those in the tech industry.</p><p>In a statement Tuesday, top antitrust official Makan Delrahim worries that without meaningful competition, \"digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.</p><p>___</p><p>6:15 p.m.</p><p>A longtime digital advertising executive and antitrust expert says American consumers and news publishers need competitive tech markets.</p><p>Dina Srinivasan spoke Tuesday after the Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust investigation into big tech companies. She says increased competition could help solve wide-ranging privacy concerns in tech.</p><p>But Blair Levin, a former leading Federal Communications Commission staffer, says it's not clear that antitrust regulations would solve all, or even any, of the other concerns.</p><p>Tech companies are facing scrutiny that ranges widely from privacy concerns to protection of children to political interference. Levin says regulators need to carefully line up which institutions can address which issues - and antitrust likely won't take care of all of them.</p><p>___</p><p>6:05 p.m.</p><p>One Wall Street analyst believes the Justice Department's announced review of technology companies will lead to business model tweaks and fines rather than broader structural changes such as breaking up the companies.</p><p>Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities says any resulting probe would likely take many years, and that the government would ultimately fail to break up the companies without changes to antitrust laws. He says that's unlikely.</p><p>The Justice Department says it is opening an investigation into whether big online companies have hurt competition or innovation.</p><p>The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.</p><p>Shares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple are down slightly in after-hours trading, while Google's stock is unchanged. All four had closed up for the day.</p><p>___</p><p>5:55 p.m.</p><p>A Harvard professor who worked in the Obama administration says one challenge with the Justice Department's announced probe of big tech companies is to avoid politicizing it.</p><p>Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, says the antitrust scrutiny on the companies is long overdue. He just hopes it's \"fast and effective enough that it can actually improve the functioning of the market.\"</p><p>As for whether any outcome could be expected before next year's presidential elections, Furman says these cases take a long time to investigate, let alone litigate.</p><p>The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.</p><p>___</p><p>5:45 p.m.</p><p>An antitrust expert believes a Justice Department investigation into whether major technology companies are abusing their market power may prompt regulators to interpret the law in new ways.</p><p>The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.</p><p>University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp says one possible way the companies have been doing that is by collectively buying hundreds of startups in recent years to devour their technology and prevent them from growing into formidable rivals.</p><p>Traditionally, antitrust regulators have only sought to block acquisitions involving two big companies. But Hovenkamp says U.S. antitrust law is broad enough for regulators to consider the potential damage wrought by relatively small deals too.</p><p>___</p><p>5:30 p.m.</p><p>Major tech companies facing congressional antitrust scrutiny have no comment on the Justice Department's just announced probe.</p><p>The department says it is opening sweeping antitrust investigation of Big Tech and whether the online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. It did not name any specific companies in its announcement.</p><p>Amazon had no comment. Facebook also did not have an immediate comment.</p><p>Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company's benefits to consumers.</p><p>Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn't think \"anybody reasonable\" would call Apple a monopoly.</p><p>___</p><p>5:15 p.m.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department says it is opening a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p>It comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. President Donald Trump also has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months.</p><p>___</p><p>4:50 p.m.</p><p>The Washington Post is reporting that the Federal Trade Commission will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement.</p><p>The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.</p><p>Advertisers were reportedly able to target users who provided their phone number as part of a two-factor authentication security feature.</p><p>The FTC didn't respond immediately to a request for comment.

No new deaths were registered Friday, leaving the toll at 4,634 among 83,542 total cases of COVID-19 reported since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Another 103 people were in isolation being monitored as suspected cases or for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms.  Strict quarantine, social distancing and case tracing measures have helped radically bring down infections. </p><p>Mask wearing is still universal in indoor spaces, while many venues also require proof on a mobile phone app that the person is healthy.

(Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! The officials also recommended \u2014 but did not move to require \u2014 that travelers wear face coverings in airports and on planes. All leading U.S. airlines now require passengers to wear masks, but regulators have refused a request by the airlines to make it a federal rule. The Transportation, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services departments made those and other recommendations in a report containing guidelines for reducing the risk of spreading the new coronavirus by air travel. The agencies said airlines and airports should take steps to increase social distancing, clean surfaces touched by passengers, and ask passengers about their health to discourage people who may be ill from traveling. The issue of limiting capacity on planes gained new urgency this week when American Airlines joined United Airlines in trying to fill every seat on every flight. The move was criticized by the government's top expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. __ TOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Kansas' governor and its top public health official worry that the state won't be able to reopen its K-12 schools for the new school year in August if it doesn't reverse a recent surge in reported coronavirus cases. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told legislative leaders Thursday that a desire to reopen schools is a key reason she issued an executive order requiring Kansas residents to wear masks in public and at their workplaces. The order takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, with a fine of up to $2,500 possible for violators. Kelly and other state officials don't expect strict enforcement with decisions about pursuing violations left up to prosecutors in each of the state's 105 counties. Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt can pursue violations but said he will leave them to local officials.  Also, counties can opt out of the order under a new pandemic law that took effect in June and resulted from a compromise between Kelly and lawmakers. The governor and state health secretary and Dr. Lee Normans said the goal is to increase people's use of masks to control the novel coronavirus' spread. Norman told legislative leaders that Kansas could prevent more than 11,500 new coronavirus cases between now and Oct. 1 with a mask mandate. __ CHICAGO \u2014 People traveling to Chicago from 15 states with increasing numbers of confirmed cases of the coronavirus will have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival or face possible fines, city officials announced Thursday.  To comply with the order that takes effect Monday, travelers must stay at a single home or other dwelling for 14 days except to seek medical care or be tested for COVID-19. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Twitter that the order is intended to 'preserve the gains Chicago had made.'  The city has reported 52,569 confirmed cases and 2,611 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Both categories have trended down in recent weeks and the city has allowed many businesses to reopen, including bars and restaurants with limits on customers. The city's Department of Public Health Commissioner said the specific states listed are based on the rate of new confirmed cases per 100,000 residents.  As of Thursday, that means people coming from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah will be affected.  The order also applies to city residents returning from a visit to a designated state. It wasn't immediately clear how Chicago officials will enforce the order. According to a website explaining the change, people could face fines of between $100 and $500 per day, totaling up to $7,000. __ TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence met with Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss the coronavirus situation on the same day Florida health officials reported a new single-day record total of 10,000 new cases. Pence and DeSantis encouraged everyone, especially young adults, to wear masks in public spaces and avoid large gatherings. Both wore masks when not speaking. 'It is not an either/or choice,' Pence said Thursday. 'We can slow the spread. We can flatten the curve, but it will take all of us to do it.' Pence also said Republicans are 'excited' about coming to Jacksonville in August for the Republican National Convention, noting that unspecified 'sophisticated plans' are in the works to protect attendees. Democrats criticized the White House and DeSantis for what they said was needlessly endangering lives by opening the economy too soon and not mandating masks. 'They have put politics ahead of public health,' said U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, President Bill Clinton's Health and Human Services secretary. __ ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia added nearly 3,500 confirmed coronavirus cases to its total count on Thursday, the largest single-day increase the state has experienced. Georgia has seen a sharp increase in confirmed cases as well as people hospitalized in recent weeks. Nearly 88,000 total confirmed cases of the virus have been recorded by the Georgia Department of Public Health. At least 2,849 people in Georgia have died. There were 1,649 people hospitalized with the virus in Georgia Thursday, up from 1,135 a week earlier. 'We are in exponential growth with rapidly rising infections,' Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University, tweeted Thursday. 'I am very concerned of our trajectory as we head into the 4th of July weekend,' del Rio said as he urged people to wear a mask and practice social distancing. __ AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered that face coverings must be worn in public across most of the state, a dramatic ramp up of the Republican's efforts to control spiking numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Abbott, who had pushed Texas' aggressive reopening of the state economy in May, had previously said the government could not order individuals to wear masks. His prior virus-related orders had undercut efforts by local governments to enforce mask requirements. But faced with dramatically rising numbers of both newly confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus and the number of patients so sick they needed to be hospitalized, Abbott changed course with the statewide mask order on Thursday. The order requires 'all Texans to wear a face covering over the nose and mouth in public spaces in counties with 20 or more positive COVID-19 cases, with few exceptions.' __ JOHANNESBURG \u2014 The World Health Organization says more than 6,000 health workers have been infected with the coronavirus in 38 countries across its Africa region since the pandemic began. Hundreds of health workers already have been infected in the latest hot spot of South Africa's Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria. Across South Africa, more than 2,000 health workers across have been infected. In Nigeria, nearly 1,000 have been sickened. The WHO's 47-country Africa region has the most severe health workforce shortage in the world, and concerns about adequate personal protective gear against the coronavirus are widespread. Already a handful of countries have seen more than 10% of their health workers infected as of Tuesday: Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Niger, Mozambique and Burundi. __ UNITED NATIONS \u2014 France and Germany's top diplomats are urging stepped-up action to quickly implement a new U.N. Security Council resolution demanding cease-fires in major global conflicts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a virtual council meeting Thursday that 'we now need to redouble our efforts,' pointing to conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Africa's Sahel region and Afghanistan where 'the situation remains extremely unstable and civilian populations continue to suffer the consequences.' Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who chaired the council meeting, urged its often-divided members to implement the 'long overdue' resolution by working together toward cease-fires in specific countries, which he stressed can lead to access for health and humanitarian workers and political talks. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the council that conflict zones are 'the sharp end' of pandemics where people already live on a knife edge. __ OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Coronavirus cases in Tulsa have been rising but officials say it's too early to directly link the increase to a June 20 campaign rally held there by President Donald Trump. The county has reported more than 1,300 confirmed cases of the virus in the 11 days since the rally drew about 6,200 people to a sports arena. 'Frankly (we) probably won't see until next week just because of the lag from symptoms to testing to reporting,' Bruce Dart, the director of the Tulsa Health Department, said Thursday. The incubation period for the virus is two to 14 days. Dart said previously health officials would be watching closely for six weeks for infections linked to the weekend of the president's rally.  Dart said the increase has so far been traced to smaller gatherings such as at bars, gyms, restaurants, weddings and funerals. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday said there are a reported 14,539 cases statewide. ___ NEW ORLEANS -- A study of New Orleans area residents infected with the coronavirus indicates 75 percent had no symptoms.  The study released Thursday by researchers at New Orleans-based Ochsner Health was done in May. It looked at testing of residents in New Orleans and neighboring Jefferson Parish. The study indicated a death rate among those infected of 1.63%, much more deadly than the flu.  Researchers selected 2,640 people, representing varied demographic groups from Orleans and Jefferson, from among 25,000 volunteers. They received nasal swab tests for the virus and blood tests for antibodies.  Another finding in the study: Infection rates were higher among Black residents (10.3%) than white residents (5.9%). The death rates of 1.72% and 1.58%, respectively, were not considered statistically significant. Ochsner's chief medical officer, Dr. Robert Hart, says the study demonstrated the need for masking and social distancing as the virus shows signs of resurgence in Louisiana and around the country. 'We need to assume that we could all potientially be carriers,' Hart said. ___ WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Sheriff's deputies in the Southern California city of West Hollywood will issue citations to people who don't wear masks in public, ramping up enforcement of a rule largely without penalties. The West Hollywood station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says the increased enforcement would begin this month. The non-criminal citations come with a fine of $250 for a first offense. ___ LONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization says it is still trying to understand how often people without symptoms of the coronavirus spread the disease. WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, says it was clear some people not sickened by it were still spreading the virus. 'What we're really trying to understand is the relative importance of when people transmit and how they transmit,' Van Kerkhove said. 'This virus transmits through respiratory droplets, most often when they have symptoms, but it can happen just before they develop symptomsAnd so that makes control measures that much more challenging.' Van Kerkhove say WHO was concerned by a number of recent superspreading events, including in long-term living facilities, meat packing facilities, religious gatherings and expat dormitories. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Pennsylvania has reported 830 confirmed coronavirus cases, its highest one-day total since May. Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh and 1.2 million residents, reported more than 230 cases, its highest one-day total of positive tests.  Health officials in Philadelphia and Allegheny County attribute the rising numbers to people socializing in bars, returning from beach vacations and traveling to coronavirus hot spots in other parts of the U.S. Officials say the statewide confirmed total cases is more than 88,000. It also reported another 25 coronavirus-related deaths for a statewide total of 6,712 since early March.  While the state's hospitalizations for the virus continue to fall, officials say the percentage of people testing positive has been rising the last two weeks. ___ CORVALIS, Ore. \u2014 An Oregon State Trooper is on paid administrative leave after an employee of a coffee shop complained he didn't wear a mask when entering the establishment.  It's required under a statewide order by the governor to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the assistant manager Allan's Coffee &amp;#38; Tea in Corvallis said the trooper on Wednesday told him Gov. Kate Brown had no authority to take away civil liberties and uttered a vulgarity directed toward the governor.  State police spokesman Capt. Timothy Fox said the trooper has been placed on leave and an internal investigation has begun. ___ ROME \u2014 Five Italian regions reported slight increases in coronavirus infections, for a total of 201 new confirmed cases, nearly two months after Italy began easing its lockdown.  Officials say the situation is under control and the new cases are being traced. Nationwide, the number of people hospitalized dipped below 1,000 for the first time in weeks. Hard-hit Lombardy had the most new cases with 98. Lombardy accounted for 21 of 30 deaths nationwide. Lombardy's welfare chief Giulio Gallera suggested the high day-to-day death toll might have been due to delayed reporting by hospitals and city offices. Nationwide, Italy has 240,961 confirmed cases. The official death toll in the onetime epicenter of Europe's outbreak stood at 34,818 on Thursday. ___ BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says a member of his staff has tested positive for the coronavirus and is in self-quarantine, along with a dozen other governor's office employees who were in close contact with the person.  Edwards' office says the governor isn't isolating because epidemiologists deemed he wasn't at risk because he hadn't recently been within 6 feet of the person for at least 15 minutes. The Democratic governor says the employee confirmed to have COVID-19 disease is asymptomatic.  'We are monitoring our team and, should it become necessary, will be offering testing to our staff members and tracing their contacts to determine who needs to self-quarantine and who could be at risk,' Edwards said in a statement. One of Edwards' staff members, April Dunn, died from a coronavirus infection three months ago. ___ LONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization says the world is 'lucky' there is a broad pipeline of experimental COVID-19 vaccines, with more than 150 at early stages of testing.  At the end of a two-day research meeting, the U.N. health agency says 17 vaccine candidates are in human trials and some might prove effective by the end of the year, although that the timeline of a licensed vaccine was still uncertain. 'We are very encouraged by the progression of these candidate vaccines and we are looking forward to have the results,' said Ana Maria Henao Restrapo, a vaccines expert at WHO.  She says the pharmaceuticals planning advanced tests in humans shared their protocols for proposed trials with the agency; all were randomized experiments. Several experimental vaccines, including one developed by Oxford University and made by AstraZeneca, are expected to soon move into large-scale trials that could provide data about whether they are effective. 'Whether or not we will have a vaccine in the anticipated timeline is still unknown,' Restrapo said.  ___ MEXICO CITY \u2014 The governor of the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas says he's tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the fourth state leader in the country to be infected. Gov. Francisco Cabeza de Vaca says on his official Twitter account that he'll keep working and the area is passing through 'a critical moment of infections.' The state has recorded more than 6,000 confirmed cases and at least 356 deaths, though low rates of testing mean the actual number of infections is likely higher. Mxico has reported more than 231,000 confirmed cases and 28,510 deaths. ___ FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Florida has reported 10,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases for the first time.  That daily number on Thursday is six times higher than the daily record less than a month ago. The state also reported 67 deaths for the second time in a week.  The seven-day average for daily deaths is now back over 40, a 30 percent increase from two weeks ago. The state's death rate peaked at 60 per day in early May and declined to 30 by mid-June.  Vice President Mike Pence and Gov. Ron DeSantis are scheduled to visit a medical training center in Tampa on Thursday. ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Authorities in Greece have reported 28 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths after reopening the country's regional airports. The Health Ministry says the total number of confirmed cases had reached 3,458, while the death toll remained at 192. Greece reopened its regional airports Wednesday, with direct international flights to many islands and popular holiday destinations. The government says more than 5,800 tests on travelers had been carried on the first day, using a risk assessment procedure created by a state-run disease control authority. About a third of those samples were analyzed and two infections were confirmed, the agency said ___Top 8 Companies That Are Adapting to a Post-Coronavirus World[1]The unintended consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are being played out in homes and apartments throughout the world. More and more employees are working from home, that's if they have a job to go to. Entire industries are effectively shut down as the world attempts to slow the spread of the virus. At some point, however, things will return to normal. But it will be a new normal. There are many businesses that won't reopen, and many industries that will forever be changed. As an investor, now is the time to get out your crystal ball. Timing the market is a fool's errand. But looking at what industries are positioned to thrive in a world that will be changed by the coronavirus is a prudent strategy. We've identified 8 companies that are adapting to what the economy will be like in a post-coronavirus world. It will undoubtedly be more digital than it already is. Supply chains may become more vertically integrated as 'Made in America' may take on a whole new meaning. As will the idea of working from home, going to a concert, or even preparing a meal.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix)Confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed the 10 million mark worldwide. A tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University registered the grim milestone Sunday, after India and Russia added thousands of new cases. The United States has confirmed more than 2.5 million infections, the most in the world. </p><p>Globally, the Hopkins tally has reported nearly 500,000 deaths. While Hopkins reports only confirmed coronavirus cases, experts believe the true number of people who have been infected could be as much as 10 times that figure, given that so many people can't get tested or may have the virus without showing any symptoms. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 China virus cases stabilize as Italy sees drop in deaths \u2014 What to wear: Feds' mixed messages on masks sow confusion  \u2014 Nurses, doctors feel strain as virus races through Arizona \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence has called off campaign events in Florida and Arizona for this coming week as the states experience a surge in new coronavirus cases.

The day-to-day increase reached 260 new confirmed cases on Saturday, up from 168 the previous day and 93 the day before. It is the highest number of newly infected people since April 8. It comes amid the government's easing of its restrictive measures and despite a typical lower number of tests over the weekend. The Czech Republic has had 11,306 confirmed cases while 347 people have died, according to Health Ministry figures released on Sunday. ___ ROME \u2014 Italy is honoring its coronavirus dead with a Requiem concert performed in front of the cemetery in Bergamo, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the onetime epicenter of the European outbreak. President Sergio Mattarella, the 243 mayors of cities in Bergamo province and a representative of families who lost loved ones have been invited to attend the evening concert, which is being transmitted live on RAI state television. It will feature the Requiem Mass composed by Bergamo native Gaetano Donizetti, one of Italy's most important 19th century composers. Bergamo recorded its first positive case Feb. 23 and by the end of March had registered a 571% increase in excess deaths compared to the five-year monthly average. Images in mid-March of an army convoy hauling caskets away because Bergamo's cemeteries and crematoriums were full came to epitomize the horrific toll of the virus in Italy's north. Donizetti composed the unfinished Requiem to honor his friend and fellow composer, Vincenzo Bellini, who died in 1835. During the peak of the epidemic, Bergamo's Donizetti Theater and the city government put on social media the recording of a 2017 performance of the Requiem Mass to honor the victims. ___ NEW DELHI \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi says India must focus on bolstering the economy as it exits the lockdown phase, even as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb. On Sunday, India reported additional 19,906 confirmed cases, taking the total to 528,859 with 16,095 deaths. It says 309,713 people have recovered. Modi told a radio address that during the post-lockdown period, Indians have to stay more vigilant compared to the lockdown and only alertness can save them from the coronavirus. He again urged people to wear a mask and observe social distancing norms and other precautions, or else would be putting others at risk, especially the elderly and children at home. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Swiss authorities say they've ordered 300 people into quarantine after a so-called 'superspreader' outbreak of the new coronavirus at a Zurich nightclub. Zurich officials said in a statement that a man who had been at the Flamingo Club a week ago tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, and that five people who were with him there were then tested and also were positive and reported to authorities on Friday. Working from a list of guests provided by the club, officials were then able to get in touch with the others who were there and ordered them into quarantine on Saturday for 10 days in order to try and stop any further spread of the virus as they are tested. Swiss officials say the incident shows how important it is to stick to hygiene and distance regulations as lockdown measures are gradually lifted. They say if there are more superspreader type events in clubs they will have to resort to closing such facilities again. Like many European countries, Switzerland had drastically reduced the number of new coronavirus infections, and is now starting to see a slight uptick as it tries to restart its economy. In its latest report posted Sunday, Switzerland reported 69 new cases overnight from Friday to Saturday for a total of 31,555 cases; 1,681 people have died. ___ ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan's minister for science and technology says the country has started producing locally designed ventilators, as authorities reported 83 more deaths from the coronavirus. In a tweet, Fawad Chaudhry said the first home-made ventilators will be handed over to the national disaster management agency soon. The announcement comes days after Pakistan said it was racing against time to arrange for 1,500 more ventilators as part of a contingency plan. Currently, 1,503 ventilators are available at government hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. Pakistan on Sunday reported 4.072 new cases of the coronavirus, taking the total to 202,955 with 4,118 deaths. Pakistan has witnessed a spike in new infections since last month, when Prime Minister Imran Khan lifted lockdown, saying it was necessary to save the economy. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China is reporting 17 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, all but three of them from domestic transmission in Beijing, which has seen a recent spike in coronavirus infections. But authorities in the Chinese capital say a campaign to conduct tests on employees at hair and beauty salons across the city has found no positive cases so far, in a further sign that the recent outbreak has been largely brought under control. No new deaths were reported Sunday, leaving China's reported total at 4,634 among 83,500 confirmed cases. Tens of millions of Chinese traveled during the three-day Dragon Boat Festival that ended Saturday, but anti-crowding measures were in force nationwide. Tourist sites were required to cap visitor numbers at 30% of capacity. ___ HONOLULU -- The city of Honolulu has announced that campgrounds will reopen for the first time in three months with limited permits to ensure social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hawaii News Now reported that the city will issue permits for just over 100 campsites across Oahu. Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation Public Information Officer Nathan Serota says campsites were limited to physically distance. Regular camp rules still apply. The Bellows Beach campground northeast of Honolulu will remain closed through Sept. 4 for turtle nesting. All the other campgrounds have reopened. ___ ANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Data show hundreds of new infections in densely populated neighborhoods that are more likely home to low-income residents in one California county. Orange County health officials say residents living certain parts of Anaheim and Santa Ana are more likely to live in multi-generational or multifamily households and many of them hold jobs in stores and restaurants. Cases and hospitalizations in the county have grown significantly in the last couple weeks, reflecting a statewide trend that prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom this week to sound renewed alarm bells. He urged Imperial County to reimpose a stay-at-home order to deal with a high rate of positive cases and hospitalizations. ___ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 Arkansas on Saturday reported 570 more cases of the coronavirus and 10 more deaths. The Arkansas Department of Health said that there are now 19,310 reported cases in the state. The state's total deaths from COVID-19, the illness the coronavirus causes, is now at 259. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee says he's pausing moving counties to the fourth phase of his reopening plan as coronavirus cases continue to increase. Inslee made the announcement Saturday with state Secretary of Health John Weisman. Inslee says the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the state makes it impossible to move to phase four, which would have meant basically no restrictions. A tally from Johns Hopkins University shows Washington had more than 30,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday. More than 480 new cases were reported on Friday. ___ SPRINGFIELD, Mo. \u2014 Tyson Foods has announced that 371 employees at its chicken processing plant in the far southwestern corner of Missouri have tested positive for COVID-19. The company said in a news release Friday that it tested 1,142 employees at the plant in Noel from June 17 to June 19, and 291 tested positive for COVID-19. Of those 291, Tyson said 249, or 85%, were asymptomatic. Tyson said an additional 80 Noel employees tested positive for COVID-19 in separate tests that were performed by their health care providers or the state's Department of Health and Senior Services. The announcement confirms suspicions that the large spike in McDonald County's reported COVID-19 numbers starting this past weekend was the result of large-scale testing at the plant, the Springfield News-Leader reports. ___ BRASILIA, Brazil -- The Brazilian government announced on Saturday an agreement with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to produce a promising coronavirus vaccine that is undergoing tests. Brazilian Health Ministry authorities said in a press conference that the country will pay $127 million and receive material to produce 30.4 million doses in two batches in December and January, which would allow it to quickly start inoculation efforts if the vaccine is certified to be safe and effective. The total deal is for 100 million vaccines for a country of about 210 million residents. It will be produced by local vaccine maker Fiocruz. British researchers started testing the experimental shot in May aiming to immunize more than 10,000 people, including older people and children. The vaccine is one of about a dozen in the early stages of human testing. Brazil, where coronavirus infections are still on the rise, counts more than 1 million confirmed cases and more than 55,900 fatalities. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is calling off a planned bus tour in Florida to benefit his and President Donald Trump's re-election as the state experiences a surge in confirmed coronavirus cases. Pence is still traveling to the state, the White House confirmed, saying he will meet with Gov. Ron DeSantis and his health care teams. Pence said Friday during a briefing by the White House's coronavirus task force that he would visit Florida, Texas and Arizona this week to receive a 'ground report' on spiking cases of COVD-19 across the sunbelt. Pence was to appear in Lake Wales at an event organized by pro-Trump group America First Policies billed as the 'Great American Comeback tour.' The group announced that 'Out of an abundance of caution at this time, we are postponing the Great American Comeback tour stop in Florida. We look forward to rescheduling soon.' Companies Mentioned in This Article 6 Stocks That Will Benefit From a Dovish Federal Reserve[1]The quaint correction that was labeled the 'tech wreck' of 2018 seems like a distant memory to investors. What also seems like a distant memory is any thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. At the end of 2018, the Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark federal funds rate. With the trade dispute with China dragging on, there was increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lower, stocks will generally rise as investors have no other option for growth. In July 2019, the doves got their wish. But in a move that now seems to be a 'what did they know move', the Fed dropped rates again in October. The market soared to record highs in January and early February. Since mid-February however, the market has fallen dramatically, and the Fed juiced the market one more time by cutting rates down to levels not seen since the financial crisis. None of us know for sure when the U.S. economy will be opened up. And while stocks are still a good investment, not every stock is a smart investment at this time. But some stocks perform well when interest rates are falling and that's why we've prepared this presentation. These six stocks stand to benefit from both low-interest rates and the unique economic conditions being brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Other companies are also expected to create wallets, too.</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says only Calibra will be allowed on its messaging apps. But users will be able to send or receive money from other wallets, regardless of where the transaction originated.</p><p>Marcus also confirmed that Calibra will support full data portability - so people who decide they would rather use a different Libra wallet would be able to move all their money and data there.</p><p>Even with the ability to send and receive from any wallet, Facebook will still have an advantage by allowing only Calibra within its popular messaging apps, That's because many people will choose not to download or switch to other wallets.</p><p>The limitations came out during a Senate hearing Tuesday and precede a separate hearing on the market power of Facebook and other big tech companies.</p><p>___</p><p>2:40 p.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump says federal agencies, and possibly Attorney General William Barr, should look into billionaire investor Peter Thiel's allegations that Google may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google. According to an Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\" Google denies that it works with the Chinese military.</p><p>During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump said that's a \"very big statement made by somebody who's highly respected, so we'll certainly take a look at that.\"</p><p>Trump also called Thiel a friend of his and a \"tremendous contributor\" to the Republican Party. Trump, meanwhile, has clashed with Google and other tech companies, alleging bias against conservative views.</p><p>___</p><p>12:05 p.m.</p><p>Senators are grilling Facebook on its plans to launch a new digital currency when it's still battling problems with privacy and other issues.</p><p>Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally says she doesn't trust Facebook because of repeated privacy violations and \"repeated deceit.\"</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says the company wants to innovate on behalf of its users. He says if another country were to build a successful digital currency first, the system might be out of reach of U.S. regulations and sanctions.</p><p>But Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says the question isn't whether the U.S. should take the lead, but \"why Facebook\" before it fixes its other problems.</p><p>Schatz also questioned whether Facebook has any expertise in money laundering and other financial issues. Marcus responded that Facebook now does because it has hired experts.</p><p>Facebook is defending the planned currency, Libra, before a Senate Banking Committee panel Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>11:25 a.m.</p><p>A Facebook executive says digital transactions such as those with the company's upcoming Libra currency will be better than cash in guarding against criminal activities.</p><p>Facebook's David Marcus was responding to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat who asked how the company will guard against money laundering and make sure terrorists don't use its currency to finance their activity.</p><p>Marcus says cash transactions are where most crime currently happens. He says \"it will be better\" if a lot of transactions move to digital. He says that people who use Libra through Facebook's upcoming Calibra wallet will have to upload a government ID for verification.</p><p>Masto says security pledges are one thing, but she wants to see the specifics.</p><p>Marcus is appearing before a Senate Banking Committee panel on Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>A senior Democratic senator is asserting that \"Facebook is dangerous\" as a Senate panel opens a hearing on Facebook's plan for a new currency.</p><p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, sought assurances from Facebook executive David Marcus that the plan wouldn't jeopardize the privacy of its billions of users' data.</p><p>Marcus assured that Facebook \"will take the time to get this right\" and welcomes an extensive review by federal regulators.</p><p>Brown pressed Marcus on whether he and his team would accept their salary in the new currency, Libra. Marcus says that Libra is not meant to compete with bank accounts but finally says yes, \"I would trust all my assets in Libra.\"</p><p>___</p><p>10:35 a.m.</p><p>U.S. senators from both parties are opening a hearing with tough questions and criticisms of Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency.</p><p>Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking Democrat, says it's hard to trust Facebook after a series of privacy scandals. He says it \"takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance\" to think it can run its own bank.</p><p>Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, is questioning why Facebook wants to base the project in Switzerland.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says it's not an attempt to avoid oversight but that Switzerland is a recognized international finance center. Marcus says if the U.S. fails to act, then digital currencies could be controlled by others with dramatically different values.</p><p>___</p><p>10:25 a.m.</p><p>Google is reiterating it does not work with the Chinese military after President Donald Trump said on Twitter he would \"take a look\" at Google and its relationship to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>\"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military,\" said Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto in an emailed response for comment. \"We are working with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare.\"</p><p>The comments come as a House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>___</p><p>8:45 a.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump is vowing to \"take a look\" at Google after a billionaire investor suggested it may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence</p><p>Before 5 a.m. Eastern, Trump in a tweet called Peter Thiel, \"A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!\"</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google.</p><p>According to the Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:10 a.m.</p><p>Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency faces questions from lawmakers. It's already being shadowed by negative comments from President Donald Trump, his treasury secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee. Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee will be extending its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>The Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee, which is holding a hearing on Wednesday, has called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Joe Neguse, a Democrat from Colorado, sought to pin down Facebook on the subject of \"monopoly\" during a hearing on the power of Big Tech. Facebook argues it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neguse ran Matt Perault, Facebook's head of global policy development, through several of the world's largest social-media services, measured by active users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four out of the six - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - are owned by Facebook, Neguse noted, suggesting that might qualify as a monopoly or \"monopoly power.\"</p><p>Citing a historical Facebook document, Neguse also pointed out that Facebook once prohibited its developers from replicating Facebook's \"core functionality.\" That policy, Neguse added, is now gone, because it would be seen as anti-competitive.</p><p>Perault said Facebook has reevaluated its policies over time.</p><p>4:40 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a House antitrust panel investigating the tech industry repeatedly reminded an Amazon executive he was under oath as he grilled him over the company's business practices.</p><p>Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline asked at a Tuesday hearing whether Amazon is using the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own products.</p><p>Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, says the company doesn't use \"individual data to directly compete\" with third-party sellers.</p><p>But that answer met with skepticism from Cicilline, who twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath.</p><p>\"You're a trillion-dollar company with online data in real time,\" Cicilline said.</p><p>Representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple are testifying at the hearing as the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee pursues an investigation into big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>___</p><p>4 p.m.</p><p>Matt Perault, Facebook's head of global policy development, says the social media giant is an \"American success story\" with plenty of competition in all the areas it does business in.</p><p>Speaking at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Tuesday, Perault emphasized all the ways in which Facebook doesn't dominate. The company, he pointed out, takes in less than a quarter of U.S. advertising spending. And he said some 92 percent of advertising happens \"off Facebook.\"</p><p>Next week, though, Facebook will report its quarterly earnings, likely showing sharp revenue growth as it seeks to grab a larger share of the global advertising market.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is using YouTube to live stream its hearing on antitrust issues in Big Tech, with witnesses from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>YouTube is owned by Google, the target of some lawmakers' antitrust ire.</p><p>The panel's live steam also didn't disable comments, meaning that anyone with a YouTube account can chime into the proceedings with often misspelled written commentary.</p><p>Back in April, a congressional hearing on extremism and online hate, live streamed on YouTube, turned into a vivid demonstration of the very problem it was addressing when the comment stream was bombarded with racist and anti-Semitic comments from internet users.</p><p>So far comments at the antitrust hearing have been tamer. Some have ranged from \"BORING\" to \"If 'BORING what don't you leave?\"</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a House panel investigating the market power of big tech companies says Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed them to regulate themselves.</p><p>That enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.., said at the start of a hearing.</p><p>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is hearing from executives from the four tech giants.</p><p>The panel is conducting a bipartisan examination of Big Tech's market power. But Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, says \"just because a business is big doesn't mean it's bad.\" Breaking up big companies could hurt smaller firms around the U.S. and might compound privacy problems, he says.</p><p>___</p><p>3:20 p.m.</p><p>Facebook says that its messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Messenger won't be able to use digital wallets made by other companies once Facebook launches the digital currency Libra.</p><p>Wallets will be how users store and make transactions with Libra. Facebook has announced plans to create the Calibra wallet. Other companies are also expected to create wallets, too.</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says only Calibra will be allowed on its messaging apps. But users will be able to send or receive money from other wallets, regardless of where the transaction originated.</p><p>Marcus also confirmed that Calibra will support full data portability - so people who decide they would rather use a different Libra wallet would be able to move all their money and data there.</p><p>Even with the ability to send and receive from any wallet, Facebook will still have an advantage by allowing only Calibra within its popular messaging apps, That's because many people will choose not to download or switch to other wallets.</p><p>The limitations came out during a Senate hearing Tuesday and precede a separate hearing on the market power of Facebook and other big tech companies.</p><p>___</p><p>2:40 p.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump says federal agencies, and possibly Attorney General William Barr, should look into billionaire investor Peter Thiel's allegations that Google may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google. According to an Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\" Google denies that it works with the Chinese military.</p><p>During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump said that's a \"very big statement made by somebody who's highly respected, so we'll certainly take a look at that.\"</p><p>Trump also called Thiel a friend of his and a \"tremendous contributor\" to the Republican Party. Trump, meanwhile, has clashed with Google and other tech companies, alleging bias against conservative views.</p><p>___</p><p>12:05 p.m.</p><p>Senators are grilling Facebook on its plans to launch a new digital currency when it's still battling problems with privacy and other issues.</p><p>Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally says she doesn't trust Facebook because of repeated privacy violations and \"repeated deceit.\"</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says the company wants to innovate on behalf of its users. He says if another country were to build a successful digital currency first, the system might be out of reach of U.S. regulations and sanctions.</p><p>But Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says the question isn't whether the U.S. should take the lead, but \"why Facebook\" before it fixes its other problems.</p><p>Schatz also questioned whether Facebook has any expertise in money laundering and other financial issues. Marcus responded that Facebook now does because it has hired experts.</p><p>Facebook is defending the planned currency, Libra, before a Senate Banking Committee panel Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>11:25 a.m.</p><p>A Facebook executive says digital transactions such as those with the company's upcoming Libra currency will be better than cash in guarding against criminal activities.</p><p>Facebook's David Marcus was responding to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat who asked how the company will guard against money laundering and make sure terrorists don't use its currency to finance their activity.</p><p>Marcus says cash transactions are where most crime currently happens. He says \"it will be better\" if a lot of transactions move to digital. He says that people who use Libra through Facebook's upcoming Calibra wallet will have to upload a government ID for verification.</p><p>Masto says security pledges are one thing, but she wants to see the specifics.</p><p>Marcus is appearing before a Senate Banking Committee panel on Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>A senior Democratic senator is asserting that \"Facebook is dangerous\" as a Senate panel opens a hearing on Facebook's plan for a new currency.</p><p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, sought assurances from Facebook executive David Marcus that the plan wouldn't jeopardize the privacy of its billions of users' data.</p><p>Marcus assured that Facebook \"will take the time to get this right\" and welcomes an extensive review by federal regulators.</p><p>Brown pressed Marcus on whether he and his team would accept their salary in the new currency, Libra. Marcus says that Libra is not meant to compete with bank accounts but finally says yes, \"I would trust all my assets in Libra.\"</p><p>___</p><p>10:35 a.m.</p><p>U.S. senators from both parties are opening a hearing with tough questions and criticisms of Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency.</p><p>Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking Democrat, says it's hard to trust Facebook after a series of privacy scandals. He says it \"takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance\" to think it can run its own bank.</p><p>Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, is questioning why Facebook wants to base the project in Switzerland.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says it's not an attempt to avoid oversight but that Switzerland is a recognized international finance center. Marcus says if the U.S. fails to act, then digital currencies could be controlled by others with dramatically different values.</p><p>___</p><p>10:25 a.m.</p><p>Google is reiterating it does not work with the Chinese military after President Donald Trump said on Twitter he would \"take a look\" at Google and its relationship to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>\"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military,\" said Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto in an emailed response for comment. \"We are working with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare.\"</p><p>The comments come as a House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>___</p><p>8:45 a.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump is vowing to \"take a look\" at Google after a billionaire investor suggested it may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence</p><p>Before 5 a.m. Eastern, Trump in a tweet called Peter Thiel, \"A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!\"</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google.</p><p>According to the Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:10 a.m.</p><p>Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency faces questions from lawmakers. It's already being shadowed by negative comments from President Donald Trump, his treasury secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee. Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee will be extending its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>The Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee, which is holding a hearing on Wednesday, has called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Joe Neguse, a Democrat from Colorado, sought to pin down Facebook on the subject of \"monopoly\" during a hearing on the power of Big Tech. Facebook argues it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neguse ran Matt Perault, Facebook's head of global policy development, through several of the world's largest social-media services, measured by active users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four out of the six - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - are owned by Facebook, Neguse noted, suggesting that might qualify as a monopoly or \"monopoly power.\"</p><p>Citing a historical Facebook document, Neguse also pointed out that Facebook once prohibited its developers from replicating Facebook's \"core functionality.\" That policy, Neguse added, is now gone, because it would be seen as anti-competitive.</p><p>Perault said Facebook has reevaluated its policies over time.</p><p>4:40 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a House antitrust panel investigating the tech industry repeatedly reminded an Amazon executive he was under oath as he grilled him over the company's business practices.</p><p>Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline asked at a Tuesday hearing whether Amazon is using the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own products.</p><p>Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, says the company doesn't use \"individual data to directly compete\" with third-party sellers.</p><p>But that answer met with skepticism from Cicilline, who twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath.</p><p>\"You're a trillion-dollar company with online data in real time,\" Cicilline said.</p><p>Representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple are testifying at the hearing as the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee pursues an investigation into big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>___</p><p>4 p.m.</p><p>Matt Perault, Facebook's head of global policy development, says the social media giant is an \"American success story\" with plenty of competition in all the areas it does business in.</p><p>Speaking at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Tuesday, Perault emphasized all the ways in which Facebook doesn't dominate. The company, he pointed out, takes in less than a quarter of U.S. advertising spending. And he said some 92 percent of advertising happens \"off Facebook.\"</p><p>Next week, though, Facebook will report its quarterly earnings, likely showing sharp revenue growth as it seeks to grab a larger share of the global advertising market.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is using YouTube to live stream its hearing on antitrust issues in Big Tech, with witnesses from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>YouTube is owned by Google, the target of some lawmakers' antitrust ire.</p><p>The panel's live steam also didn't disable comments, meaning that anyone with a YouTube account can chime into the proceedings with often misspelled written commentary.</p><p>Back in April, a congressional hearing on extremism and online hate, live streamed on YouTube, turned into a vivid demonstration of the very problem it was addressing when the comment stream was bombarded with racist and anti-Semitic comments from internet users.</p><p>So far comments at the antitrust hearing have been tamer. Some have ranged from \"BORING\" to \"If 'BORING what don't you leave?\"</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a House panel investigating the market power of big tech companies says Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed them to regulate themselves.</p><p>That enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.., said at the start of a hearing.</p><p>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is hearing from executives from the four tech giants.</p><p>The panel is conducting a bipartisan examination of Big Tech's market power. But Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, says \"just because a business is big doesn't mean it's bad.\" Breaking up big companies could hurt smaller firms around the U.S. and might compound privacy problems, he says.</p><p>___</p><p>3:20 p.m.</p><p>Facebook says that its messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Messenger won't be able to use digital wallets made by other companies once Facebook launches the digital currency Libra.</p><p>Wallets will be how users store and make transactions with Libra. Facebook has announced plans to create the Calibra wallet. Other companies are also expected to create wallets, too.</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says only Calibra will be allowed on its messaging apps. But users will be able to send or receive money from other wallets, regardless of where the transaction originated.</p><p>Marcus also confirmed that Calibra will support full data portability - so people who decide they would rather use a different Libra wallet would be able to move all their money and data there.</p><p>Even with the ability to send and receive from any wallet, Facebook will still have an advantage by allowing only Calibra within its popular messaging apps, That's because many people will choose not to download or switch to other wallets.</p><p>The limitations came out during a Senate hearing Tuesday and precede a separate hearing on the market power of Facebook and other big tech companies.</p><p>___</p><p>2:40 p.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump says federal agencies, and possibly Attorney General William Barr, should look into billionaire investor Peter Thiel's allegations that Google may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google. According to an Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\" Google denies that it works with the Chinese military.</p><p>During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump said that's a \"very big statement made by somebody who's highly respected, so we'll certainly take a look at that.\"</p><p>Trump also called Thiel a friend of his and a \"tremendous contributor\" to the Republican Party. Trump, meanwhile, has clashed with Google and other tech companies, alleging bias against conservative views.</p><p>___</p><p>12:05 p.m.</p><p>Senators are grilling Facebook on its plans to launch a new digital currency when it's still battling problems with privacy and other issues.</p><p>Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally says she doesn't trust Facebook because of repeated privacy violations and \"repeated deceit.\"</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says the company wants to innovate on behalf of its users. He says if another country were to build a successful digital currency first, the system might be out of reach of U.S. regulations and sanctions.</p><p>But Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says the question isn't whether the U.S. should take the lead, but \"why Facebook\" before it fixes its other problems.</p><p>Schatz also questioned whether Facebook has any expertise in money laundering and other financial issues. Marcus responded that Facebook now does because it has hired experts.</p><p>Facebook is defending the planned currency, Libra, before a Senate Banking Committee panel Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>11:25 a.m.</p><p>A Facebook executive says digital transactions such as those with the company's upcoming Libra currency will be better than cash in guarding against criminal activities.</p><p>Facebook's David Marcus was responding to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat who asked how the company will guard against money laundering and make sure terrorists don't use its currency to finance their activity.</p><p>Marcus says cash transactions are where most crime currently happens. He says \"it will be better\" if a lot of transactions move to digital. He says that people who use Libra through Facebook's upcoming Calibra wallet will have to upload a government ID for verification.</p><p>Masto says security pledges are one thing, but she wants to see the specifics.</p><p>Marcus is appearing before a Senate Banking Committee panel on Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>A senior Democratic senator is asserting that \"Facebook is dangerous\" as a Senate panel opens a hearing on Facebook's plan for a new currency.</p><p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, sought assurances from Facebook executive David Marcus that the plan wouldn't jeopardize the privacy of its billions of users' data.</p><p>Marcus assured that Facebook \"will take the time to get this right\" and welcomes an extensive review by federal regulators.</p><p>Brown pressed Marcus on whether he and his team would accept their salary in the new currency, Libra. Marcus says that Libra is not meant to compete with bank accounts but finally says yes, \"I would trust all my assets in Libra.\"</p><p>___</p><p>10:35 a.m.</p><p>U.S. senators from both parties are opening a hearing with tough questions and criticisms of Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency.</p><p>Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking Democrat, says it's hard to trust Facebook after a series of privacy scandals. He says it \"takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance\" to think it can run its own bank.</p><p>Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, is questioning why Facebook wants to base the project in Switzerland.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says it's not an attempt to avoid oversight but that Switzerland is a recognized international finance center. Marcus says if the U.S. fails to act, then digital currencies could be controlled by others with dramatically different values.</p><p>___</p><p>10:25 a.m.</p><p>Google is reiterating it does not work with the Chinese military after President Donald Trump said on Twitter he would \"take a look\" at Google and its relationship to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>\"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military,\" said Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto in an emailed response for comment. \"We are working with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare.\"</p><p>The comments come as a House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>___</p><p>8:45 a.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump is vowing to \"take a look\" at Google after a billionaire investor suggested it may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence</p><p>Before 5 a.m. Eastern, Trump in a tweet called Peter Thiel, \"A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!\"</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google.</p><p>According to the Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:10 a.m.</p><p>Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency faces questions from lawmakers. It's already being shadowed by negative comments from President Donald Trump, his treasury secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee. Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee will be extending its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>The Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee, which is holding a hearing on Wednesday, has called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Joe Neguse, a Democrat from Colorado, sought to pin down Facebook on the subject of \"monopoly\" during a hearing on the power of Big Tech. Facebook argues it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neguse ran Matt Perault, Facebook's head of global policy development, through several of the world's largest social-media services, measured by active users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four out of the six - Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - are owned by Facebook, Neguse noted, suggesting that might qualify as a monopoly or \"monopoly power.\"</p><p>Citing a historical Facebook document, Neguse also pointed out that Facebook once prohibited its developers from replicating Facebook's \"core functionality.\" That policy, Neguse added, is now gone, because it would be seen as anti-competitive.</p><p>Perault said Facebook has reevaluated its policies over time.</p><p>4:40 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a House antitrust panel investigating the tech industry repeatedly reminded an Amazon executive he was under oath as he grilled him over the company's business practices.</p><p>Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline asked at a Tuesday hearing whether Amazon is using the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own products.</p><p>Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, says the company doesn't use \"individual data to directly compete\" with third-party sellers.</p><p>But that answer met with skepticism from Cicilline, who twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath.</p><p>\"You're a trillion-dollar company with online data in real time,\" Cicilline said.</p><p>Representatives from Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple are testifying at the hearing as the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee pursues an investigation into big tech companies' market dominance.</p><p>___</p><p>4 p.m.</p><p>Matt Perault, Facebook's head of global policy development, says the social media giant is an \"American success story\" with plenty of competition in all the areas it does business in.</p><p>Speaking at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on antitrust on Tuesday, Perault emphasized all the ways in which Facebook doesn't dominate. The company, he pointed out, takes in less than a quarter of U.S. advertising spending. And he said some 92 percent of advertising happens \"off Facebook.\"</p><p>Next week, though, Facebook will report its quarterly earnings, likely showing sharp revenue growth as it seeks to grab a larger share of the global advertising market.</p><p>___</p><p>3:50 p.m.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is using YouTube to live stream its hearing on antitrust issues in Big Tech, with witnesses from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>YouTube is owned by Google, the target of some lawmakers' antitrust ire.</p><p>The panel's live steam also didn't disable comments, meaning that anyone with a YouTube account can chime into the proceedings with often misspelled written commentary.</p><p>Back in April, a congressional hearing on extremism and online hate, live streamed on YouTube, turned into a vivid demonstration of the very problem it was addressing when the comment stream was bombarded with racist and anti-Semitic comments from internet users.</p><p>So far comments at the antitrust hearing have been tamer. Some have ranged from \"BORING\" to \"If 'BORING what don't you leave?\"</p><p>___</p><p>3:30 p.m.</p><p>The chairman of a House panel investigating the market power of big tech companies says Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed them to regulate themselves.</p><p>That enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I.., said at the start of a hearing.</p><p>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is hearing from executives from the four tech giants.</p><p>The panel is conducting a bipartisan examination of Big Tech's market power. But Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, says \"just because a business is big doesn't mean it's bad.\" Breaking up big companies could hurt smaller firms around the U.S. and might compound privacy problems, he says.</p><p>___</p><p>3:20 p.m.</p><p>Facebook says that its messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Messenger won't be able to use digital wallets made by other companies once Facebook launches the digital currency Libra.</p><p>Wallets will be how users store and make transactions with Libra. Facebook has announced plans to create the Calibra wallet. Other companies are also expected to create wallets, too.</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says only Calibra will be allowed on its messaging apps. But users will be able to send or receive money from other wallets, regardless of where the transaction originated.</p><p>Marcus also confirmed that Calibra will support full data portability - so people who decide they would rather use a different Libra wallet would be able to move all their money and data there.</p><p>Even with the ability to send and receive from any wallet, Facebook will still have an advantage by allowing only Calibra within its popular messaging apps, That's because many people will choose not to download or switch to other wallets.</p><p>The limitations came out during a Senate hearing Tuesday and precede a separate hearing on the market power of Facebook and other big tech companies.</p><p>___</p><p>2:40 p.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump says federal agencies, and possibly Attorney General William Barr, should look into billionaire investor Peter Thiel's allegations that Google may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google. According to an Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\" Google denies that it works with the Chinese military.</p><p>During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump said that's a \"very big statement made by somebody who's highly respected, so we'll certainly take a look at that.\"</p><p>Trump also called Thiel a friend of his and a \"tremendous contributor\" to the Republican Party. Trump, meanwhile, has clashed with Google and other tech companies, alleging bias against conservative views.</p><p>___</p><p>12:05 p.m.</p><p>Senators are grilling Facebook on its plans to launch a new digital currency when it's still battling problems with privacy and other issues.</p><p>Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally says she doesn't trust Facebook because of repeated privacy violations and \"repeated deceit.\"</p><p>Facebook executive David Marcus says the company wants to innovate on behalf of its users. He says if another country were to build a successful digital currency first, the system might be out of reach of U.S. regulations and sanctions.</p><p>But Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz says the question isn't whether the U.S. should take the lead, but \"why Facebook\" before it fixes its other problems.</p><p>Schatz also questioned whether Facebook has any expertise in money laundering and other financial issues. Marcus responded that Facebook now does because it has hired experts.</p><p>Facebook is defending the planned currency, Libra, before a Senate Banking Committee panel Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>11:25 a.m.</p><p>A Facebook executive says digital transactions such as those with the company's upcoming Libra currency will be better than cash in guarding against criminal activities.</p><p>Facebook's David Marcus was responding to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat who asked how the company will guard against money laundering and make sure terrorists don't use its currency to finance their activity.</p><p>Marcus says cash transactions are where most crime currently happens. He says \"it will be better\" if a lot of transactions move to digital. He says that people who use Libra through Facebook's upcoming Calibra wallet will have to upload a government ID for verification.</p><p>Masto says security pledges are one thing, but she wants to see the specifics.</p><p>Marcus is appearing before a Senate Banking Committee panel on Tuesday.</p><p>___</p><p>10:55 a.m.</p><p>A senior Democratic senator is asserting that \"Facebook is dangerous\" as a Senate panel opens a hearing on Facebook's plan for a new currency.</p><p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, sought assurances from Facebook executive David Marcus that the plan wouldn't jeopardize the privacy of its billions of users' data.</p><p>Marcus assured that Facebook \"will take the time to get this right\" and welcomes an extensive review by federal regulators.</p><p>Brown pressed Marcus on whether he and his team would accept their salary in the new currency, Libra. Marcus says that Libra is not meant to compete with bank accounts but finally says yes, \"I would trust all my assets in Libra.\"</p><p>___</p><p>10:35 a.m.</p><p>U.S. senators from both parties are opening a hearing with tough questions and criticisms of Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency.</p><p>Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking Democrat, says it's hard to trust Facebook after a series of privacy scandals. He says it \"takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance\" to think it can run its own bank.</p><p>Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, is questioning why Facebook wants to base the project in Switzerland.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says it's not an attempt to avoid oversight but that Switzerland is a recognized international finance center. Marcus says if the U.S. fails to act, then digital currencies could be controlled by others with dramatically different values.</p><p>___</p><p>10:25 a.m.</p><p>Google is reiterating it does not work with the Chinese military after President Donald Trump said on Twitter he would \"take a look\" at Google and its relationship to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>\"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military,\" said Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto in an emailed response for comment. \"We are working with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, in many areas including cybersecurity, recruiting and healthcare.\"</p><p>The comments come as a House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>___</p><p>8:45 a.m.</p><p>President Donald Trump is vowing to \"take a look\" at Google after a billionaire investor suggested it may have been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence</p><p>Before 5 a.m. Eastern, Trump in a tweet called Peter Thiel, \"A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!\"</p><p>A House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>Over the weekend, Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation into Google.</p><p>According to the Axios story, Thiel said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:10 a.m.</p><p>Facebook's ambitious plan to create a financial eco-system based on a digital currency faces questions from lawmakers. It's already being shadowed by negative comments from President Donald Trump, his treasury secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Congress begins two days of hearings Tuesday on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra, starting with the Senate Banking Committee. Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee will be extending its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that Libra \"will have little standing or dependability.\"</p><p>The Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee, which is holding a hearing on Wednesday, has called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Stronger safeguards on user data might damage Facebook's core business: using what it knows about you to sell ads that target your interests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebookis proposing only narrow countermeasures that address the specifics of the furor over Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that's accused of improperly obtaining data from some 50 million Facebookusers for the purpose of influencing voters.</p><p>But those steps don't get at what many outsiders see as bigger problems at Facebook. That includes its rampant data collection from users and its embrace of political ads that target individuals and small demographic groups with precision.</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>Facebook's chief operating officer says the company is taking steps to be more transparent about how its data gets used - and misused - and apologized for the privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company that has been swirling around the social media giant.</p><p>Facebook's No. 2 executive <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>said in an interview on CNBC Thursday that the incident was a \"huge breach of trust.\" She said she was sorry the company let so many people down.</p><p>The comments came a day after CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>apologized during a CNN interview.

Facebooksuspended Kogan last week for sharing data he gathered separately and passed on to data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, which is not affiliated with the university.</p><p>Facebooktold The Guardian in a report Thursday that it provided the data in 2013 but that it contained no personally identifiable information. Facebookdid not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The study also says Kogan used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to get U.S. respondents to download an app that gave him access to their Facebookdata and the location of their friends.</p><p>___</p><p>1:30 p.m.</p><p>The leaders of a key House committee are calling on FacebookCEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to testify about a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company.</p><p>Reps.

Stronger safeguards on user data might damage Facebook's core business: using what it knows about you to sell ads that target your interests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook is proposing only narrow countermeasures that address the specifics of the furor over Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that's accused of improperly obtaining data from some 50 million Facebook users for the purpose of influencing voters.</p><p>But those steps don't get at what many outsiders see as bigger problems at Facebook. That includes its rampant data collection from users and its embrace of political ads that target individuals and small demographic groups with precision.</p><p>___</p><p>5:20 p.m.</p><p>Facebook's chief operating officer says the company is taking steps to be more transparent about how its data gets used - and misused - and apologized for the privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company that has been swirling around the social media giant.</p><p>Facebook's No. 2 executive Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview on CNBC Thursday that the incident was a \"huge breach of trust.\" She said she was sorry the company let so many people down.</p><p>The comments came a day after CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized during a CNN interview. And like Zuckerberg, Sandberg said she expected more regulation in Facebook's future.</p><p>The pressure to impose more controls on influential tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon has been building as their services and infiltrate more and more into daily life.</p><p>\"It's not a question of 'if' regulation it's a question of what type,\" she said.</p><p>__</p><p>1:55 p.m.</p><p>Two Facebook employees co-authored a 2015 study with embattled Cambridge researcher Aleksandr Kogan that used anonymized data that tallied 57 billion friendships around the world.</p><p>The study was hailed by Cambridge University as the first output of ongoing collaborations between Kogan's lab and Facebook. Facebook suspended Kogan last week for sharing data he gathered separately and passed on to data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, which is not affiliated with the university.</p><p>Facebook told The Guardian in a report Thursday that it provided the data in 2013 but that it contained no personally identifiable information. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The study also says Kogan used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to get U.S. respondents to download an app that gave him access to their Facebook data and the location of their friends.</p><p>___</p><p>1:30 p.m.</p><p>The leaders of a key House committee are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company.</p><p>Reps. Greg Walden of Oregon and Frank Pallone of New Jersey say in a statement the \"latest revelations regarding Facebook's use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concerns.\" They say their staffs received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials that left many questions unanswered.</p><p>Walden is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Pallone is the panel's top ranking Democrat.</p><p>Their statement comes a day after Zuckerberg told CNN that he would be \"happy\" to testify before Congress.</p><p>The lawmakers say they'll work with Facebook and Zuckerberg to set a date and time \"in the near future.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:35 p.m.</p><p>Special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between President Donald Trump's campaign and the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica has come under fierce criticism from U.S. and British lawmakers over reports it swiped the data of more than 50 million Facebook users to sway elections.</p><p>Mueller's investigators have asked former campaign officials about the Trump campaign's data operations, particularly how it collected and utilized voter data in battleground states.</p><p>That's according to a person with direct knowledge of the line of inquiry who isn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>___</p><p>12:20 p.m.</p><p>A personal assistant to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has responded to reports of Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the country's 2015 election, retweeting an image of a dejected-looking former leader Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>The post retweeted by Bashir Ahmad says: \"When you give Cambridge Analytica $3m and still lose the election.\"</p><p>A report in The Guardian newspaper cites people with knowledge of the campaign as saying Cambridge Analytica's parent company was hired by a Nigerian billionaire to ensure Jonathan won another term.</p><p>The report cites the people with knowledge of the campaign as saying suspected Israeli hackers offered Cambridge Analytica access to Buhari's private information.</p><p>The report says the company has disputed those claims but confirmed it had been hired for marketing and advertising services to help Jonathan's campaign.</p><p>___</p><p>12:05 p.m.</p><p>The British Parliament's media committee has recalled the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to testify in its investigation into fake news.</p><p>Committee chair Damian Collins told Nix in a letter Thursday that there were \"a number of inconsistencies in your evidence.\" Collins highlighted Nix's denial that he received data from the Global Science Research company, the entity set up by a Cambridge academic who created the app blamed for harvesting information from some 50 million Facebook accounts.</p><p>A whistleblower has alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly used the material in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.</p><p>Collins warned Nix that \"giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter. We urge you to come forward and explain your comments to a committee hearing.\"</p><p>___</p><p>11:45 a.m.</p><p>Israel says it is launching an investigation into Facebook following the scandal involving data mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>The Israeli Privacy Protection Authority says Thursday the alleged privacy breach raised the possibility of \"infringements\" of Israel's privacy law. The law states that personal data may only be used for \"the purpose for which it was given, with the consent of the individual,\" the authority says in a statement.</p><p>The authority says it will investigate whether the personal data of Israelis was illegally used.</p><p>Facebook has faced a backlash over the scandal. Politicians in the U.S. and Britain have called for the company to explain its data practices in detail. State attorneys general in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey have opened investigations into the case. And some have rallied to a movement that urges people to delete their Facebook accounts entirely.</p><p>___</p><p>11:20 a.m.</p><p>If you're fed up with Facebook, you're not alone.</p><p>A growing number of people are deleting it, or at least wrestling with whether they should, in light of its latest privacy debacle.

Facebook suspended Kogan last week for sharing data he gathered separately and passed on to data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, which is not affiliated with the university.</p><p>Facebook told The Guardian in a report Thursday that it provided the data in 2013 but that it contained no personally identifiable information. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The study also says Kogan used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to get U.S. respondents to download an app that gave him access to their Facebook data and the location of their friends.</p><p>___</p><p>1:30 p.m.</p><p>The leaders of a key House committee are calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining company.</p><p>Reps.

The law states that personal data may only be used for \"the purpose for which it was given, with the consent of the individual,\" the authority says in a statement.</p><p>The authority says it will investigate whether the personal data of Israelis was illegally used.</p><p>Facebook has faced a backlash over the scandal. Politicians in the U.S. and Britain have called for the company to explain its data practices in detail.

He outlined steps to protect user data and said companies have a responsibility to act.</p><p>But Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said Thursday that Parliament and society should set the rules as to what the appropriate for privacy and innovation - not any one company.</p><p>Hancock says \"that's the approach that we are taking.

It follows a Friday announcement of a similar multistate probe targeting Facebook.</p><p>Another group, Public Knowledge, says the state-led investigations are a powerful step forward after years in which the companies' market power went largely unexamined.</p><p>The advocacy groups say the action from states might also put pressure on federal antitrust enforcers, who have already opened similar investigations.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute, which favors more competition, is also weighing in with support.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>California and Alabama are the two states that haven't joined an investigation into Google's market dominance.</p><p>The coalition conducting the probe is led by Texas and consists of 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

It follows a Friday announcement of a similar multistate probe targeting Facebook.</p><p>Another group, Public Knowledge, says the state-led investigations are a powerful step forward after years in which the companies' market power went largely unexamined.</p><p>The advocacy groups say the action from states might also put pressure on federal antitrust enforcers, who have already opened similar investigations.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute, which favors more competition, is also weighing in with support.</p><p>___</p><p>2:30 p.m.</p><p>California and Alabama are the two states that haven't joined an investigation into Google's market dominance.</p><p>The coalition conducting the probe is led by Texas and consists of 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

She says she won't confirm or deny the existence of any investigation.

John Hickenlooper tells a house party in Dubuque, Iowa, that immigration hard-liners have to accept that they won't be able to drive out everyone who is in the U.S. illegally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hickenlooper says it would be \"crazy\" to think that a country founded and defined by immigrants would ever expel 10 million to 11 million people.</p><p>Hickenlooper launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination this week. He is on his first Iowa swing as an official candidate and is positioning himself as a uniter who can get things done.</p><p>In his remarks Saturday, the former governor said the perennial immigration standoff should be a simple problem to fix and that both sides need to sit down.</p><p>___</p><p>4:15 p.m.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren has defended her new call to break up big U.S. technology companies at a major tech conference in Texas.</p><p>The Democratic presidential candidate appeared Saturday at Austin's South by Southwest Festival a day after making her pitch to reign in the influence of tech giants. She described them as monopolists making fewer monopoly profits, adding \"boo hoo.\"</p><p>The Massachusetts senator was also asked whether Sen. Bernie Sanders had discouraged her from entering the 2020 race. She said they had a private dinner but wouldn't divulge what they discussed.</p><p>Warren is among several 2020 Democratic candidates appearing at SXSW this weekend. Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee are speaking Sunday.</p><p>___</p><p>3 p.m.</p><p>A documentary released Saturday about Beto O'Rourke's near-upset of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz contains no hints about his 2020 plans - and the candidate himself was just as coy after its screening.</p><p>O'Rourke attended the premiere of \"Running with Beto\" at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, with his wife and daughter.</p><p>Afterward, O'Rourke repeated that he's made up his mind about running for president and plans to let everyone know soon.</p><p>The documentary will air on HBO and was cobbled together from 700 hours of Texas Senate campaign footage.</p><p>O'Rourke briefly took questions from reporters afterward but provided no details on when he'll announce his next move. He called seeing the documentary \"very emotional.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:50 p.m.</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders has told a packed house in Des Moines that as president his power to reform industries and institutions would be limited, but he'd still fulfill his campaign promises with their support.</p><p>Sanders said \"no president, not the best-intentioned in the world, can take on those extraordinarily powerful forces.\" He went on to say: \"But we have something they don't have - we have the people!\"</p><p>The crowd packed into the Animal Learning Center on the Iowa State Fairgrounds roared their approval of Sanders, who is making another run for the Democratic nomination. Many were decked out in his 2016 campaign gear or waved \"IA loves Bernie\" signs.</p><p>About 50 volunteers showed up to support the Vermont senator at the final stop of his three-day swing through the state, part of an Iowa volunteer force that Sanders said already totals 7,000.</p><p>\"We need you to add to that number!\" he said, to roars from the crowd.</p><p>___</p><p>12:35 p.m.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota isn't calling for a breakup of the biggest U.S. technology companies like one of her Democratic presidential rivals, Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>Klobuchar on Saturday was the first of several 2020 candidates to speak at the tech-centric South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. Asked if Google or Facebook should be broken up, Klobuchar said she would first want an investigation.</p><p>Warren is also scheduled to appear at SXSW. On Friday, the Massachusetts senator said that as president she would pick regulators who would seek to break up what she called \"anti-competitive mergers.\" One example is Facebook's recent purchase of Instagram.</p><p>But Klobuchar criticized big tech in a city rapidly transformed by the industry. She said tech companies didn't like her efforts to improve disclosure requirements for online political ads and floated the idea of taxing social media companies when they sell personal data.</p><p>___</p><p>11:50 a.m.</p><p>Sen.

John Hickenlooper tells a house party in Dubuque, Iowa, that immigration hard-liners have to accept that they won't be able to drive out everyone who is in the U.S. illegally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hickenlooper says it would be \"crazy\" to think that a country founded and defined by immigrants would ever expel 10 million to 11 million people.</p><p>Hickenlooper launched his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination this week. He is on his first Iowa swing as an official candidate and is positioning himself as a uniter who can get things done.</p><p>In his remarks Saturday, the former governor said the perennial immigration standoff should be a simple problem to fix and that both sides need to sit down.</p><p>___</p><p>4:15 p.m.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren has defended her new call to break up big U.S. technology companies at a major tech conference in Texas.</p><p>The Democratic presidential candidate appeared Saturday at Austin's South by Southwest Festival a day after making her pitch to reign in the influence of tech giants. She described them as monopolists making fewer monopoly profits, adding \"boo hoo.\"</p><p>The Massachusetts senator was also asked whether Sen. Bernie Sanders had discouraged her from entering the 2020 race. She said they had a private dinner but wouldn't divulge what they discussed.</p><p>Warren is among several 2020 Democratic candidates appearing at SXSW this weekend. Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee are speaking Sunday.</p><p>___</p><p>3 p.m.</p><p>A documentary released Saturday about Beto O'Rourke's near-upset of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz contains no hints about his 2020 plans - and the candidate himself was just as coy after its screening.</p><p>O'Rourke attended the premiere of \"Running with Beto\" at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, with his wife and daughter.</p><p>Afterward, O'Rourke repeated that he's made up his mind about running for president and plans to let everyone know soon.</p><p>The documentary will air on HBO and was cobbled together from 700 hours of Texas Senate campaign footage.</p><p>O'Rourke briefly took questions from reporters afterward but provided no details on when he'll announce his next move. He called seeing the documentary \"very emotional.\"</p><p>___</p><p>12:50 p.m.</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders has told a packed house in Des Moines that as president his power to reform industries and institutions would be limited, but he'd still fulfil his campaign promises with their support.</p><p>Sanders said \"no president, not the best-intentioned in the world, can take on those extraordinarily powerful forces.\" He went on to say: \"But we have something they don't have - we have the people!\"</p><p>The crowd packed into the Animal Learning Center on the Iowa State Fairgrounds roared their approval of Sanders, who is making another run for the Democratic nomination. Many were decked out in his 2016 campaign gear or waved \"IA loves Bernie\" signs.</p><p>About 50 volunteers showed up to support the Vermont senator at the final stop of his three-day swing through the state, part of an Iowa volunteer force that Sanders said already totals 7,000.</p><p>\"We need you to add to that number!\" he said, to roars from the crowd.</p><p>___</p><p>12:35 p.m.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota isn't calling for a breakup of the biggest U.S. technology companies like one of her Democratic presidential rivals, Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>Klobuchar on Saturday was the first of several 2020 candidates to speak at the tech-centric South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. Asked if Google or Facebook should be broken up, Klobuchar said she would first want an investigation.</p><p>Warren is also scheduled to appear at SXSW. On Friday, the Massachusetts senator said that as president she would pick regulators who would seek to break up what she called \"anti-competitive mergers.\" One example is Facebook's recent purchase of Instagram.</p><p>But Klobuchar criticized big tech in a city rapidly transformed by the industry. She said tech companies didn't like her efforts to improve disclosure requirements for online political ads and floated the idea of taxing social media companies when they sell personal data.</p><p>___</p><p>11:50 a.m.</p><p>Sen. Kamala Harris says she's committed to shoring up rural communities, a message the Democratic presidential hopeful is sharing with voters in some of the most sparsely populated parts of the early voting state of South Carolina.</p><p>The California senator told a crowd of several hundred gathered in tiny St. George, South Carolina, on Saturday morning that a national infrastructure of crumbling roads and bridges makes it difficult for people in communities like this one to get to their jobs, which may be miles and miles away.</p><p>Harris also says she wants to make changes to rural hospital funding, tweaks that she hopes will lead fewer health care facilities in such areas to close.</p><p>On Friday, Harris shared a similar message with voters in Hemingway, a tiny community of about 500.</p><p>___</p><p>9:30 a.m.</p><p>Texas is an unlikely can't-miss stop for the Democratic presidential candidates, but many of them are making appearances this weekend at the trendy and techie South by Southwest Festival in Austin.</p><p>Texas is an early primary state, but the real draw of the event for Democrats is the chance to spend time with the party's ascendant young and liberal wing.</p><p>Beto O'Rourke, a former Texas congressman, is expected to attend the premiere of a documentary film chronicling his longshot U.S. Senate campaign last year. It ended in a narrow loss to the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz.</p><p>O'Rourke hasn't said yet whether he's in or out of the 2020 White House race.</p><p>First up on Saturday at the festival are two senators who are running - Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-80fc42698bc746c09764f5b87a24ffd2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKY-S7P1-DY9S-T4TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><timeReceived>05:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 9, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on testimony in Congress by the CEOs of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google (all times local): 4:45 p.m. A key House lawmaker investigating Big Tech's power is squarely targeting Amazon.  Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at a hearing Wednesday that evidence shows that the e-commerce giant is only interested in dominating the market and is 'fundamentally anti-competitive.' </p><p> Cicilline said 'Congress must take action.'  As chair of a House Judiciary panel, Cicilline is looking toward possible new legislation to update century-old antitrust laws. But Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner rejects the idea that legislation is needed \u2014 showing it could be a difficult mission for Democrats in Congress. The Bezos, along with the CEOs of Apple, Facebook and Google were answering lawmakers' questions about their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the technology industry. ___ 3:50 p.m. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos says he can't guarantee that the company isn't accessing seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives had previously denied.  His comments came Wednesday during a congressional hearing into the market dominance of four tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been scrutinizing Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.  'We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,' said Bezos, in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Amazon's home state of Washington. 'But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.' (Ad) The last time Bill O'Reilly tried to do something like this, the networks went crazy. But this new O'Reilly message is a lot differentIt's about a single strategy that's being called 'the smartest investment strategy of all-time.'A Wall Street Journal article from April quoted Amazon employees who said they did have access to seller data to make competing products, including a car trunk organizer that Amazon copied.  Bezos said he was aware of the article and is still looking into the allegations. 'I'm still not satisfied that we've gotten to the bottom of it,' he said. ___ 3:30 p.m. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is again being put on the defensive in a congressional hearing over the social network's role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  And Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, has brought the issue current with concerns that right-wing groups are using Facebook to infiltrate the Black Lives Matter movement and to spread anti-Semitic propaganda. Zuckerberg says Facebook uses sophisticated technology to intercept hate speech, often before it's seen on the platform. 'It hurts our business,' he said. Zuckerberg's comments came at hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The CEOs are answering for their companies' practices as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry. ___ 2:45 p.m. Facebook internal company documents are being deployed against CEO Mark Zuckerberg by lawmakers asserting that the company has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg at a hearing Wednesday that documents obtained from the company 'tell a very disturbing story' of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service. He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could 'meaningfully hurt' Facebook. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a 'complement' to Facebook's services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing. Some critics of Facebook have called for the company to divest Instagram and its WhatsAPP messaging service. The questioning came at a congressional hearing that also featured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. ___ 2:30 p.m. The chairman of a Congressional committee investigating the power of major technology companies accused Google of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits. Rep. David Cicilline peppered Google CEO Sundar Pichai with the allegations of abusive behavior while grilling him Wednesday during a hearing that is also putting Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on virtual hot seats while answering questions posed through a video stream. Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing. Pichai struggled to answer one question about whether Google threatened to dump Yelp from its search engine database after the restaurant review site told Google to stop scraping its site for content. Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.

Tim Walters is a co-founder of the ReOpen Maryland movement. The Capital Gazette and Washington Post report that he announced on social media that he has tested positive. </p><p>In a Facebook video, he said he was diagnosed at a hospital emergency room. The newspapers report that he said, 'Here I am months after not wearing a mask at rallies, churches and so on and so it's funny how capricious this thing is.'  Walters declined interview requests from the papers. He said he would not provide any information to public health officials trying to trace the spread of the disease. Walters emphasized he had contacted people he'd recently interacted with.  Republican Gov. Larry Hogan posted a link to the Annapolis paper's story to his own Facebook page Friday. He noted that health experts 'are strongly encouraging anyone who attended a demonstration or mass gathering to immediately get tested for coronavirus.\" ___ BERLIN \u2014 The southern German state of Bavaria says it's starting a program to offer coronavirus testing for all residents. State Health Minister Melanie Huml said Sunday that the 'corona test offensive' will help provide Bavarians 'clarity if they have been infected.' Bavaria is Germany's largest state by area and is home to some 13 million people. It has been the worst hit by the coronavirus both in terms of infections per capita and in total numbers. As of Sunday, the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's disease control center, reported the state had 48,294 of Germany's overall 193,499 cases, with 2,592 of its 8,957 deaths. Bavaria is the first of Germany's 16 states to undertake universal testing. The state plans to pay for tests that aren't already covered under the country's health care system. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.Until now, testing has been focused on people with symptoms or possible exposure, as well as in certain professions where they are more likely to have come into contact with the virus. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Virus cases worldwide hit 10 million \u2014 Experts look to set expectations on any virus vaccine \u2014 A divided Poland holds presidential vote delayed by pandemic, while France holds municipal elections. \u2014 Nurses, doctors feel strain as virus races through Arizona \u2014 The pandemic means that millions of women in Africa and other developing regions could lose years of success in contributing to household incomes, asserting their independence and expanding financial inclusion. ___  Follow all of AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: MOSCOW \u2014 Russia has recorded 6,791 new cases in the past day. The national coronavirus task force said Sunday that the total number of cases rose to 634,437. It said 104 people died of the virus over the past day, bringing the total dead to 9.073. Russia has the third-highest coronavirus infection case count in the world. But it has reported far fewer deaths than many countries with smaller infection case counts, leading to speculation that figures are manipulated which Russian officials vehemently deny. ___ LONDON \u2014 Britain's government is pledging to support local officials the central English city of Leicester, amid reports that a spike in COVID-19 cases would prompt authorities to lock the community down. The Sunday Times reports that a lockdown would come within days after 658 new cases were recorded in the Leicester area in the two weeks to June 16. It would be the first time Britain had locked down a single area during the pandemic. The Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday acknowledged the city was an area of concern. It says it is 'supporting the council and local partners in Leicester to help prevent further transmission of the virus.' ___ Confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed the 10 million mark worldwide. A tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University registered the grim milestone Sunday, after India and Russia added thousands of new cases. The United States has confirmed more than 2.5 million infections, the most in the world. Globally, the Hopkins tally has reported nearly 500,000 deaths. While Hopkins reports only confirmed coronavirus cases, experts believe the true number of people who have been infected could be as much as 10 times that figure, given that so many people can't get tested or may have the virus without showing any symptoms. ___ PRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic has been registering a steep increase of the number of people infected with the coronavirus. The day-to-day increase reached 260 new confirmed cases on Saturday, up from 168 the previous day and 93 the day before. It is the highest number of newly infected people since April 8. It comes amid the government's easing of its restrictive measures and despite a typical lower number of tests over the weekend. The Czech Republic has had 11,306 confirmed cases while 347 people have died, according to Health Ministry figures released on Sunday. ___ ROME \u2014 Italy is honoring its coronavirus dead with a Requiem concert performed in front of the cemetery in Bergamo, one of the hardest-hit provinces in the onetime epicenter of the European outbreak. President Sergio Mattarella, the 243 mayors of cities in Bergamo province and a representative of families who lost loved ones have been invited to attend the evening concert, which is being transmitted live on RAI state television. It will feature the Requiem Mass composed by Bergamo native Gaetano Donizetti, one of Italy's most important 19th century composers. Bergamo recorded its first positive case Feb. 23 and by the end of March had registered a 571% increase in excess deaths compared to the five-year monthly average. Images in mid-March of an army convoy hauling caskets away because Bergamo's cemeteries and crematoriums were full came to epitomize the horrific toll of the virus in Italy's north. Donizetti composed the unfinished Requiem to honor his friend and fellow composer, Vincenzo Bellini, who died in 1835. During the peak of the epidemic, Bergamo's Donizetti Theater and the city government put on social media the recording of a 2017 performance of the Requiem Mass to honor the victims. ___ NEW DELHI \u2014 Prime Minister Narendra Modi says India must focus on bolstering the economy as it exits the lockdown phase, even as the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb. On Sunday, India reported additional 19,906 confirmed cases, taking the total to 528,859 with 16,095 deaths. It says 309,713 people have recovered. Modi told a radio address that during the post-lockdown period, Indians have to stay more vigilant compared to the lockdown and only alertness can save them from the coronavirus. He again urged people to wear a mask and observe social distancing norms and other precautions, or else would be putting others at risk, especially the elderly and children at home. ___ BERLIN \u2014 Swiss authorities say they've ordered 300 people into quarantine after a so-called 'superspreader' outbreak of the new coronavirus at a Zurich nightclub. Zurich officials said in a statement that a man who had been at the Flamingo Club a week ago tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, and that five people who were with him there were then tested and also were positive and reported to authorities on Friday. Working from a list of guests provided by the club, officials were then able to get in touch with the others who were there and ordered them into quarantine on Saturday for 10 days in order to try and stop any further spread of the virus as they are tested. Swiss officials say the incident shows how important it is to stick to hygiene and distance regulations as lockdown measures are gradually lifted. They say if there are more superspreader type events in clubs they will have to resort to closing such facilities again. Like many European countries, Switzerland had drastically reduced the number of new coronavirus infections, and is now starting to see a slight uptick as it tries to restart its economy. In its latest report posted Sunday, Switzerland reported 69 new cases overnight from Friday to Saturday for a total of 31,555 cases; 1,681 people have died. ___ ISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan's minister for science and technology says the country has started producing locally designed ventilators, as authorities reported 83 more deaths from the coronavirus. In a tweet, Fawad Chaudhry said the first home-made ventilators will be handed over to the national disaster management agency soon. The announcement comes days after Pakistan said it was racing against time to arrange for 1,500 more ventilators as part of a contingency plan. Currently, 1,503 ventilators are available at government hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. Pakistan on Sunday reported 4.072 new cases of the coronavirus, taking the total to 202,955 with 4,118 deaths. Pakistan has witnessed a spike in new infections since last month, when Prime Minister Imran Khan lifted lockdown, saying it was necessary to save the economy. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China is reporting 17 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, all but three of them from domestic transmission in Beijing, which has seen a recent spike in coronavirus infections. But authorities in the Chinese capital say a campaign to conduct tests on employees at hair and beauty salons across the city has found no positive cases so far, in a further sign that the recent outbreak has been largely brought under control. No new deaths were reported Sunday, leaving China's reported total at 4,634 among 83,500 confirmed cases. Tens of millions of Chinese traveled during the three-day Dragon Boat Festival that ended Saturday, but anti-crowding measures were in force nationwide. Tourist sites were required to cap visitor numbers at 30% of capacity. ___ HONOLULU -- The city of Honolulu has announced that campgrounds will reopen for the first time in three months with limited permits to ensure social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hawaii News Now reported that the city will issue permits for just over 100 campsites across Oahu. Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation Public Information Officer Nathan Serota says campsites were limited to physically distance. Regular camp rules still apply. The Bellows Beach campground northeast of Honolulu will remain closed through Sept. 4 for turtle nesting. All the other campgrounds have reopened. ___ ANAHEIM, Calif. \u2014 Data show hundreds of new infections in densely populated neighborhoods that are more likely home to low-income residents in one California county. Orange County health officials say residents living certain parts of Anaheim and Santa Ana are more likely to live in multi-generational or multifamily households and many of them hold jobs in stores and restaurants. Cases and hospitalizations in the county have grown significantly in the last couple weeks, reflecting a statewide trend that prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom this week to sound renewed alarm bells. He urged Imperial County to reimpose a stay-at-home order to deal with a high rate of positive cases and hospitalizations. ___ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 Arkansas on Saturday reported 570 more cases of the coronavirus and 10 more deaths. The Arkansas Department of Health said that there are now 19,310 reported cases in the state. The state's total deaths from COVID-19, the illness the coronavirus causes, is now at 259. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee says he's pausing moving counties to the fourth phase of his reopening plan as coronavirus cases continue to increase. Inslee made the announcement Saturday with state Secretary of Health John Weisman. Inslee says the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the state makes it impossible to move to phase four, which would have meant basically no restrictions. A tally from Johns Hopkins University shows Washington had more than 30,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday. More than 480 new cases were reported on Friday.8 Pharmaceutical Companies Working on a Coronavirus Cure[1]We are living through interesting times. Not an hour goes by when Americans don't receive some reminder of the impact the coronavirus has on our lives. The race is on for an effective, FDA-approved treatment for the virus. Despite, vaccines being available for human trial in record time, we are many months away from having a viable vaccine. However, we may be somewhat closer in finding some antiviral treatments. And if you've watched the market closely this week, any news on that front tends to move the market in a positive direction. That brings up another truth of investing. There are some stocks that thrive from other stocks misery. And that's why we've put together this special report. If you're an investor who is looking to jump into this bear market, the pharmaceutical sector is a logical choice.

The city is allowing bars to open - with limited capacity and without live music - on Saturday. Bars were among the businesses shut down in mid-March as coronavirus infections increased in New Orleans and Louisiana became a hot spot for the disease. (AP Photo/Kevin McGill)MIAMI \u2014 Mayors of some of the largest municipalities in hard-hit Miami-Dade County, gathered at a press conference on Monday and challenged Florida governor's contention over the weekend that a spike in cases in the state could be attributed to an increase in testing and positive test results from people without symptoms. </p><p> They announced they will start requiring people to wear masks the moment they step out of their homes. 'This is a real spike. This is a real trajectory,' said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber. 'People can argue about the number of positives, being related to more testing, but they can't argue with the percentage at now over 10%, which is what the CDC says tells you you have too much virus in your community.' ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 The WHO chief is warning world leaders not to politicize the pandemic. \u2014 As virus surges, Pakistan says there's no choice but to open. \u2014 From shopping to dining out, New York City reopens but some remain wary. \u2014 Coronavirus lockdowns have increased wildlife poaching in Asia and Africa, and it may worsen as countries reopen.  \u2014 Young baseball players, deprived of a treasured tournament, get a memento from the stadium. ___ Follow all of AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: BOISE, Idaho -- Idaho is experiencing a sharp increase in confirmed coronavirus cases, with 544 new cases reported in a five-day span.  That brings the state's total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to more than 4,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.  Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered a statewide stay-at-home order in late March, and those restrictions have been gradually lifted over the last several weeks. The state is currently in the fourth and final stage of Little's reopening plan, with gatherings of more than 50 people allowed. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.However, the numbers of people becoming infected have climbed as more businesses reopened and more people resumed normal activity levels. One outbreak in the Boise area was tied to young people going to downtown bars as they reopened. Health districts in the Twin Falls region and in eastern Idaho have all seen a recent increase in COVID-19 cases in people under the age of 50, Boise State Public Radio reported. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The head of the Los Angeles County Public Health Department says expressions of hatred and daily threats against herself and public health professionals across the country are worrisome and disheartening. Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday that the death threats against her started last month during a COVID-19 Facebook Live briefing when someone casually suggested that she should be shot. Ferrer said she didn't immediately see the threat but her husband, children and colleagues did. She said threats against the public health agency by email, public postings and letters have been going on since March. Ferrer conducts televised briefings that have made her the public face of efforts to fight the virus in Los Angeles County. 'The virus has changed our world as we know it, and people are angry,' Ferrer said in a statement. 'And while frustration boils over in our communities as people are done with this virus, this virus is not done with us.' ___ Two more members of President Donald Trump's campaign working on his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma have tested positive for the coronavirus. The president's campaign put out a statement Monday that said the two staffers, part of the advance team for Saturday's rally, tested positive before they boarded their flight out of Oklahoma. The two were then quarantined and the campaign began contact tracing protocols. These positive tests follow the news that six other staffers, including two Secret Service agents, tested positive in the hours before Saturday's rally. The rally was believed to be the largest indoor event in the nation since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The White House did not immediately plan any specific infection monitoring for the event. ___ LIVINGSTON, La. \u2014 Laine Hardy, the 2019 winner of 'American Idol,' says he has been diagnosed with COVID-19 but his symptoms are mild and he is recovering under home quarantine. 'This wasn't what I expected on the first day of summer,' the 19-year-old singer from Livingston, Louisiana, wrote on his Facebook page and on Instagram. 'My doctor confirmed I have Coronavirus, but my symptoms are mild.' He ended his tweet: 'Y'all stay safe &amp;#38; healthy!' Hardly had performed Friday, singing the national anthem at swearing-in ceremonies for Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard's third term, The Advocate reported.  Hardy also recently completed a virtual tour that was watched by more than 2 million viewers. And his next livestream is scheduled Thursday evening.  Acoustic versions of his new songs 'Ground I Grew Up On' and 'Let There Be Country' will debut on Friday. ___ ATLANTA \u2014 The number of people hospitalized in Georgia because of COVID-19 hase risen to 1,000, erasing a month's worth of progress and showing that an accompanying increase in confirmed infections is leading to serious illness. Coronavirus infections have been rising throughout June and are now at the highest level since the pandemic began. Georgia has averaged 1,073 infections reported daily over the last seven days, according to figures kept by The Associated Press. Since Friday, the average has been higher than the previous peak of 857 set on April 13.  Almost 66,000 Georgians have now been infected since the start of the outbreak, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported, and 2,648 people have died statewide. The surge in infections comes nearly two months since Georgia began lifting restrictions April 24 on hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and other businesses that had been forced to close to slow the virus. Restaurants, retail stores and bars have since reopened as well. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said Monday he's so alarmed by the rapidly increase in infections that he wants to require people to wear masks in public places. He asked the city's attorney to begin drawing up an emergency order to make face coverings mandatory. ___ PHOENIX \u2014 Demand for tests has been growing especially in underserved communities of color in Arizona, which the COVID Tracking Project says has now has a 7-day average positive test rate above 20 percent. On Saturday, dozens of people waited for as long as 13 hours in triple-digit temperatures outside a sports complex for free drive-up COVID-19 testing in the sprawling west Phoenix community of Maryvale, a predominantly working class neighborhood of Hispanic families.  Toms Leon, senior vice president for Equity Healthcare, said staff had to turn people away as night approached, after nearly 1,000 tests were administered by the private firm that focuses on equitable health care. 'I've never heard of that many people showing up to any of the testing events,' said Leon, who attended the event. 'Usually it's about 100 people.' Equity Health plans another free testing event for people without insurance at the same Maryvale site next Saturday, Leon said.  'We were really overwhelmed by the response to our grassroots effort to get out the word,' said Leon. He said a testing event that Equity Health held May 16 at an African American church in downtown Phoenix drew more than 300 people. ___ BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Louisiana won't be further easing its restrictions on businesses because the state is seeing a troubling, recent uptick in coronavirus cases. Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Monday that he'll keep in place the current limitations on restaurants, bars and retailers enacted on June 5, which were set to expire Friday. He's extending the restrictions until July 24. The decision comes as Louisiana exceeded the grim mark of 3,000 deaths from the outbreak. The Democratic governor was considering moving Louisiana from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of reopening under the White House guidelines. But he decided against the move based on the latest surge in cases of the COVID-19 disease and hospitalizations over the last week. 'We do have a new normal, whether we like it or not,' Edwards said. 'There are a lot of people out there saying they are done with this virus. Well, the virus isn't done with us.' The regulations that will be renewed keep churches, restaurants, coffee shops, bars with a food permit, gyms, hair and nail salons, museums and other businesses limited to 50% capacity. Bars that don't have a food permit will remain limited to 25% occupancy. ___ HOUSTON \u2014 COVID-19 hospital admissions in Houston have tripled since Memorial Day to more than 1,400 admissions across eight hospital systems, said Dr. Marc Boom, CEO of Houston Methodist Hospital. 'It is snowballing,' Boom said. 'We will most certainly see more people die as a result of this spike.' In three weeks, Boom predicted, hospitals could be overwhelmed and 'although we may not have a government, official shutdown, we may be in an effective shutdown.' He pleaded with Houston residents to wear masks and practice social distancing. 'It is possible to open up at a judicious pace and coexist with the virus, but it requires millions and millions of people to do the right thing. Right now, we don't have that' because people have let their guards down. Other hospital officials share his concern, Boom said. 'None of us sees an end in sight,' he said. ___ ROME \u2014 Italy added another 218 coronavirus infections to its official count, evidence that the virus is still circulating in the one-time European epicenter. Another 23 people died in the past day, one of the lowest day-to-day death tolls and bringing Italy's total number of confirmed victims to 34,657. Hard-hit Lombardy again counted most of the new infections with 143. But about half of them were in people who got tested only because they did a blood test that showed they had coronavirus antibodies. In Italy, anyone who tests positive for the antibodies must be tested for the virus. Lombardy welfare chief Giulio Gallera said these cases are considered 'weak positives' since people might have been infected a long time ago, but simply haven't shed all the virus from their systems. ___ MADRID and RABAT, Morocco \u2014 A Spanish official has welcomed Morocco's decision to cancel the visit by millions of residents in Europe to their relatives in the north African country in order to avoid further spread of the coronavirus. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita announced Monday that the annual 'Marhaba operation' across the Strait of Gibraltar to facilitate the return of nationals who live and work in Europe wouldn't take place. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, who heads Spain's response to the outbreak, said Monday that Rabat's decision was 'a big favor' given that most of the 3 million travelers who depart use ferries on Spain's southern coast after traveling by car across Europe. Over 3.3 million people, most of them Moroccans residing in Spain, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Italy, traveled last year in about 760,000 vehicles to visit relatives and friends back home during their summer holiday. In March, when countries around the world closed their borders to foreigners to keep out the virus, Morocco barred its own citizens from returning home. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said that by the end of the week the north African country will have repatriated 7,800 citizens stranded abroad during the country's rigid lockdown measures. Moroccan diasporas wishing to return home will have to undergo a compulsory nine-day quarantine and two tests for infection, he said in Parliament. Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita also announced in Parliament the annual 'Marhaba operation' across the Strait of Gibraltar to facilitate the return of nationals who live and work in Europe would not take place this summer. ___ OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 A day after President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, the Oklahoma State Department of Health urged people who have attended large-scale events recently to be tested for the coronavirus.  The department didn't specify any event in the statement it released. The president's rally at the BOK Center in Tulsa was attended by nearly 6,200 and the vast majority, including Trump, didn't wear face masks which, along with social distancing, is encouraged by the department.  'Personal responsibility remains key in protecting yourself and our local communities from COVID-19. We continue to encourage Oklahomans to consider wearing a mask, to routinely wash hands, and to use physical distancing measures,' interim state Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said in the statement. The state reported at least 10,733 cases Monday, including 218 new infections. ___ GUATEMALA CITY \u2014 Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said Monday that 151 of the people who work at his official residence have tested positive for COVID-19, and one has died. Many of the infections were found among workers in the Secretariat of Administrative Affairs and Security at the presidential residence, which includes his offices, in downtown Guatemala City. Giammattei said 69 of those infected have recovered and at least five, who had been in critical condition, have improved. The president, himself a physician, hasn't tested positive. Nationwide, Guatemala has reported 12,614 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 531 deaths. ___ GENEVA \u2014 The record levels of new daily COVID-19 cases are due to the fact that the pandemic is peaking in a number of big countries at the same time and reflect a change in the virus' global activity, the World Health Organization said.  At a media briefing on Monday, WHO's emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said that 'the numbers are increasing because the epidemic is developing in a number of populous countries at the same time.' Some countries have attributed their increased caseload to more testing, including India and the U.S. But Ryan dismissed that explanation. 'We do not believe this is a testing phenomenon,' he said, noting that numerous countries have also noted marked increases in hospital admissions and deaths \u2014 neither of which cannot be explained by increased testing. 'There definitely is a shift in that the virus is now very well established,' Ryan said. 'The epidemic is now peaking or moving towards a peak in a number of large countries.' He added the situation was 'definitely accelerating' in a number of countries, including the U.S. and others in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. ___ LISBON, Portugal \u2014 Portuguese authorities are providing crack addicts with pipes free of charge as part of an effort to halt the spread of the new coronavirus. Officials said Monday the crack pipes are being bought for 78,000 euros (about $88,000) and distributed to nongovernmental health workers who deal with addicts. The Intervention Service for Addictive Behaviors, a government body, said in an email to The Associated Press that crack use has increased in recent years and users can contaminate each other with diseases such as COVID-19, HIV and hepatitis. Portugal has won renown for its innovative approach to drug addiction and use. A ground-breaking 2001 law sent drug users into the public health system, instead of to the criminal courts. Though drug use remains illegal, the change in tactics was successful in substantially reducing the country's problems with addiction, especially heroin. Authorities have been providing heroin addicts with clean syringes to stop the spread of disease since the early 1990s. ___ LONDON \u2014 The British government says more than 2 million elderly and vulnerable people who have been in isolation at home for three months will soon be able to meet other people. Lockdown has gradually been easing for most Britons, but many of the elderly and those with some underlying health conditions have been told to remain isolated. The government says that from July 6, people in this group in England will be allowed to meet outdoors in groups of up to six, and some can form a 'support bubble' with another household. The government also says the 'shielding' program, which has provided food and support to those at greatest risk from the coronavirus, will be phased out at the end of July. Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, says it's safe to relax the rules because 'the prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and chances of getting infected are reduced.' Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanked everyone who has been shielding, saying 'I know what a burden it has been.' He said 'these measures have been vital for saving lives.' ___ MOSCOW \u2014 The mayor of Moscow says the Russian capital's gyms and pools can open after three months of coronavirus shutdown and restaurants can begin full service.  Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced these operations can resume on Tuesday.  Some other restrictions will remain, including a ban on mass gatherings. Moscow's daily tally of new coronavirus infections has fallen notably this month: 1,068 new cases were reported on Monday, about half as many as in early June. ___ MIAMI \u2014 In Miami, officials have been cracking down on businesses not following rules restricting capacity and requiring the use of masks as COVID-19 infections have been rising in the state. The county conducted more than 10,000 checks and issued warnings to 45 businesses. Police in the city of Miami last weekend shut down two restaurants in the artsy neighborhoods of Wynwood and Design District and another one in Little Havana. The mayor of Miami-Dade County, Florida's largest, says he has no plans on ordering businesses and places that had reopened to close back again due to the increase in coronavirus cases. The owners of businesses not complying with the rules may face a $500 fine and up to 180 days in jail. ___ CHICAGO \u2014 Illinois is poised to move to the next phase of reopening Friday, allowing museums, gyms and zoos to open their doors with restrictions.  Health officials said Monday that health metrics required for reopening under state and city plans have been met, with a continuing decline in COVID-19 cases.  Previously, Chicago's reopening had been on a slower pace than Illinois. Indoor dining will be allowed, but capped at 25%. Indoor gatherings are limited to 50 people, up from 10. Outdoor gatherings will be capped at 100 people, up from 50 people.  Some venues, like the Lincoln Park Zoo, will require reservations.10 Oversold Stocks That Are Ready For a Comeback[1]A fundamental concept of investing is to buy stocks at a value. One strategy used by investors is to focus on stocks that are oversold. Fundamental analysis can give investors an idea of certain stocks to look at. However, momentum is also important. For that reason, investors look for technical indicators to help them find oversold stocks that might be ready for a comeback. One of the most popular tools is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the velocity and magnitude of price movements. The index also compares them with the magnitude of average gains and average losses. The formula for calculating RSI is as follows: RSI = 100 - ( 100 / 1 + RS) Where RS (Relative Strength) is the average gain divided by the average loss. Investors can use virtually any timeframe they wish. One of the most common is a 14-day RSI. Decreasing the number of days makes the RSI more sensitive to price changes. Conversely increasing the number of days makes the indicator less sensitive to price changes. Investors may have different overbought or oversold indicators, but standard benchmarks are a stock may be overbought if its RSI exceeds 70 and may be oversold if its RSI exceeds 30. The stocks in this presentation are chosen for a variety of fundamental and technical indicators. And all the stocks have been affected in one form or another by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Defense Ministry says Serbia's Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin has tested positive with the coronavirus. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic, File) SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged officials to maintain 'maximum alert' against the coronavirus pandemic, criticizing unspecified complacencies in the country's anti-virus campaign that he said risked 'unimaginable and irretrievable crisis.'  Despite the warnings, state media said Friday that Kim reaffirmed government claims that there hasn't been a single case of COVID-19 in North Korea. </p><p>Kim told a ruling party meeting that the country has 'thoroughly prevented the inroad of the malignant virus and maintained stable anti-epidemic situation despite the worldwide health crisis.' The North's claim of being COVID-19 free has been questioned by outside experts, who say a major outbreak in the country could possibly have dire consequences because of its chronic lack of medical supplies and poor health care infrastructure. Describing its anti-virus efforts as a 'matter of national existence,' the country has shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned tourists, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized tens of thousands of health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms. Experts say the country's self-imposed lockdown is also hurting an economy already battered by stringent U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program. __ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 Four U.S. states \u2014 Arizona, California, Florida and Texas \u2014 reported a combined 25,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases heading into the July Fourth holiday weekend. \u2014 California has gone from a coronavirus success story to a cautionary tale. \u2014 US unemployment falls to 11%, but new shutdowns are underway \u2014 Texas governor issues mask order to fight coronovirus \u2014 Closing bars to stop coronavirus spread is backed by science. (Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! ___ Follow all of AP's pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url>  HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom urged Californians to turn to their 'better angels' and use common sense by wearing masks and skipping traditional gatherings with family and friends during the holiday weekend. California had been on a good trajectory with its virus efforts until mid-June, but infections and hospitalizations are now rising rapidly in many parts of the state. Los Angeles and 18 other counties with the most troubling virus increases have been forced to shutter bars, forbid inside restaurant dining and close movie theaters. Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state's top health official, called the Fourth of July holiday weekend a 'big deal' for efforts to contain the virus. He urged people to behave differently than they did on Memorial Day weekend, when many gathered socially. Authorities say that behavior helped spur the latest surge of cases.  'This is another time for Californians to pay attention to what happened over the last month and make a different set of decisions now,' he said. ___ BEIJING \u2014 China reported five newly confirmed cases of coronavirus, two of them in the capital Beijing and three brought from outside the country, according to the National Health Commission. No new deaths were registered Friday, leaving the toll at 4,634 among 83,542 total cases of COVID-19 reported since the virus was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Another 103 people were in isolation being monitored as suspected cases or for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms. Strict quarantine, social distancing and case tracing measures have helped radically bring down infections. Mask wearing is still universal in indoor spaces, while many venues also require proof on a mobile phone app that the person is healthy. Even with the opening of the economy, however, millions are faced with job losses and government assistance has been limited due to already massive levels of debt. __ U.S. officials said airlines should consider limiting capacity on planes to promote social distancing, but they are not considering making the airlines do it. The officials also recommended \u2014 but did not move to require \u2014 that travelers wear face coverings in airports and on planes. All leading U.S. airlines now require passengers to wear masks, but regulators have refused a request by the airlines to make it a federal rule. The Transportation, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services departments made those and other recommendations in a report containing guidelines for reducing the risk of spreading the new coronavirus by air travel. The agencies said airlines and airports should take steps to increase social distancing, clean surfaces touched by passengers, and ask passengers about their health to discourage people who may be ill from traveling. The issue of limiting capacity on planes gained new urgency this week when American Airlines joined United Airlines in trying to fill every seat on every flight. The move was criticized by the government's top expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. __ TOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 Kansas' governor and its top public health official worry that the state won't be able to reopen its K-12 schools for the new school year in August if it doesn't reverse a recent surge in reported coronavirus cases. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told legislative leaders Thursday that a desire to reopen schools is a key reason she issued an executive order requiring Kansas residents to wear masks in public and at their workplaces. The order takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday, with a fine of up to $2,500 possible for violators. Kelly and other state officials don't expect strict enforcement with decisions about pursuing violations left up to prosecutors in each of the state's 105 counties. Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt can pursue violations but said he will leave them to local officials.  Also, counties can opt out of the order under a new pandemic law that took effect in June and resulted from a compromise between Kelly and lawmakers. The governor and state health secretary and Dr. Lee Normans said the goal is to increase people's use of masks to control the novel coronavirus' spread. Norman told legislative leaders that Kansas could prevent more than 11,500 new coronavirus cases between now and Oct. 1 with a mask mandate. __ CHICAGO \u2014 People traveling to Chicago from 15 states with increasing numbers of confirmed cases of the coronavirus will have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival or face possible fines, city officials announced Thursday.  To comply with the order that takes effect Monday, travelers must stay at a single home or other dwelling for 14 days except to seek medical care or be tested for COVID-19. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Twitter that the order is intended to 'preserve the gains Chicago had made.'  The city has reported 52,569 confirmed cases and 2,611 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Both categories have trended down in recent weeks and the city has allowed many businesses to reopen, including bars and restaurants with limits on customers. The city's Department of Public Health Commissioner said the specific states listed are based on the rate of new confirmed cases per 100,000 residents.  As of Thursday, that means people coming from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah will be affected.  The order also applies to city residents returning from a visit to a designated state. It wasn't immediately clear how Chicago officials will enforce the order. According to a website explaining the change, people could face fines of between $100 and $500 per day, totaling up to $7,000. __ TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence met with Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss the coronavirus situation on the same day Florida health officials reported a new single-day record total of 10,000 new cases. Pence and DeSantis encouraged everyone, especially young adults, to wear masks in public spaces and avoid large gatherings. Both wore masks when not speaking. 'It is not an either/or choice,' Pence said Thursday. 'We can slow the spread. We can flatten the curve, but it will take all of us to do it.' Pence also said Republicans are 'excited' about coming to Jacksonville in August for the Republican National Convention, noting that unspecified 'sophisticated plans' are in the works to protect attendees. Democrats criticized the White House and DeSantis for what they said was needlessly endangering lives by opening the economy too soon and not mandating masks. 'They have put politics ahead of public health,' said U.S. Rep. Donna Shalala, President Bill Clinton's Health and Human Services secretary. __ ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia added nearly 3,500 confirmed coronavirus cases to its total count on Thursday, the largest single-day increase the state has experienced. Georgia has seen a sharp increase in confirmed cases as well as people hospitalized in recent weeks. Nearly 88,000 total confirmed cases of the virus have been recorded by the Georgia Department of Public Health. At least 2,849 people in Georgia have died. There were 1,649 people hospitalized with the virus in Georgia Thursday, up from 1,135 a week earlier. 'We are in exponential growth with rapidly rising infections,' Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University, tweeted Thursday. 'I am very concerned of our trajectory as we head into the 4th of July weekend,' del Rio said as he urged people to wear a mask and practice social distancing. __ AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered that face coverings must be worn in public across most of the state, a dramatic ramp up of the Republican's efforts to control spiking numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. Abbott, who had pushed Texas' aggressive reopening of the state economy in May, had previously said the government could not order individuals to wear masks. His prior virus-related orders had undercut efforts by local governments to enforce mask requirements. But faced with dramatically rising numbers of both newly confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus and the number of patients so sick they needed to be hospitalized, Abbott changed course with the statewide mask order on Thursday. The order requires 'all Texans to wear a face covering over the nose and mouth in public spaces in counties with 20 or more positive COVID-19 cases, with few exceptions.' __ JOHANNESBURG \u2014 The World Health Organization says more than 6,000 health workers have been infected with the coronavirus in 38 countries across its Africa region since the pandemic began. Hundreds of health workers already have been infected in the latest hot spot of South Africa's Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria. Across South Africa, more than 2,000 health workers across have been infected. In Nigeria, nearly 1,000 have been sickened. The WHO's 47-country Africa region has the most severe health workforce shortage in the world, and concerns about adequate personal protective gear against the coronavirus are widespread. Already a handful of countries have seen more than 10% of their health workers infected as of Tuesday: Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Niger, Mozambique and Burundi. __ UNITED NATIONS \u2014 France and Germany's top diplomats are urging stepped-up action to quickly implement a new U.N. Security Council resolution demanding cease-fires in major global conflicts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a virtual council meeting Thursday that 'we now need to redouble our efforts,' pointing to conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Africa's Sahel region and Afghanistan where 'the situation remains extremely unstable and civilian populations continue to suffer the consequences.' Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who chaired the council meeting, urged its often-divided members to implement the 'long overdue' resolution by working together toward cease-fires in specific countries, which he stressed can lead to access for health and humanitarian workers and political talks. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the council that conflict zones are 'the sharp end' of pandemics where people already live on a knife edge. __ OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Coronavirus cases in Tulsa have been rising but officials say it's too early to directly link the increase to a June 20 campaign rally held there by President Donald Trump. The county has reported more than 1,300 confirmed cases of the virus in the 11 days since the rally drew about 6,200 people to a sports arena. 'Frankly (we) probably won't see until next week just because of the lag from symptoms to testing to reporting,' Bruce Dart, the director of the Tulsa Health Department, said Thursday. The incubation period for the virus is two to 14 days. Dart said previously health officials would be watching closely for six weeks for infections linked to the weekend of the president's rally.  Dart said the increase has so far been traced to smaller gatherings such as at bars, gyms, restaurants, weddings and funerals. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday said there are a reported 14,539 cases statewide. ___ NEW ORLEANS -- A study of New Orleans area residents infected with the coronavirus indicates 75 percent had no symptoms.  The study released Thursday by researchers at New Orleans-based Ochsner Health was done in May. It looked at testing of residents in New Orleans and neighboring Jefferson Parish. The study indicated a death rate among those infected of 1.63%, much more deadly than the flu.  Researchers selected 2,640 people, representing varied demographic groups from Orleans and Jefferson, from among 25,000 volunteers. They received nasal swab tests for the virus and blood tests for antibodies.  Another finding in the study: Infection rates were higher among Black residents (10.3%) than white residents (5.9%). The death rates of 1.72% and 1.58%, respectively, were not considered statistically significant. Ochsner's chief medical officer, Dr. Robert Hart, says the study demonstrated the need for masking and social distancing as the virus shows signs of resurgence in Louisiana and around the country. 'We need to assume that we could all potientially be carriers,' Hart said. ___ WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Sheriff's deputies in the Southern California city of West Hollywood will issue citations to people who don't wear masks in public, ramping up enforcement of a rule largely without penalties. The West Hollywood station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says the increased enforcement would begin this month. The non-criminal citations come with a fine of $250 for a first offense. ___ LONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization says it is still trying to understand how often people without symptoms of the coronavirus spread the disease. WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, says it was clear some people not sickened by it were still spreading the virus. 'What we're really trying to understand is the relative importance of when people transmit and how they transmit,' Van Kerkhove said. 'This virus transmits through respiratory droplets, most often when they have symptoms, but it can happen just before they develop symptomsAnd so that makes control measures that much more challenging.' Van Kerkhove say WHO was concerned by a number of recent superspreading events, including in long-term living facilities, meat packing facilities, religious gatherings and expat dormitories. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Pennsylvania has reported 830 confirmed coronavirus cases, its highest one-day total since May. Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh and 1.2 million residents, reported more than 230 cases, its highest one-day total of positive tests.  Health officials in Philadelphia and Allegheny County attribute the rising numbers to people socializing in bars, returning from beach vacations and traveling to coronavirus hot spots in other parts of the U.S. Officials say the statewide confirmed total cases is more than 88,000. It also reported another 25 coronavirus-related deaths for a statewide total of 6,712 since early March.  While the state's hospitalizations for the virus continue to fall, officials say the percentage of people testing positive has been rising the last two weeks. ___ CORVALIS, Ore. \u2014 An Oregon State Trooper is on paid administrative leave after an employee of a coffee shop complained he didn't wear a mask when entering the establishment.  It's required under a statewide order by the governor to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the assistant manager Allan's Coffee &amp;#38; Tea in Corvallis said the trooper on Wednesday told him Gov. Kate Brown had no authority to take away civil liberties and uttered a vulgarity directed toward the governor.  State police spokesman Capt. Timothy Fox said the trooper has been placed on leave and an internal investigation has begun. ___ ROME \u2014 Five Italian regions reported slight increases in coronavirus infections, for a total of 201 new confirmed cases, nearly two months after Italy began easing its lockdown.  Officials say the situation is under control and the new cases are being traced. Nationwide, the number of people hospitalized dipped below 1,000 for the first time in weeks. Hard-hit Lombardy had the most new cases with 98. Lombardy accounted for 21 of 30 deaths nationwide. Lombardy's welfare chief Giulio Gallera suggested the high day-to-day death toll might have been due to delayed reporting by hospitals and city offices. Nationwide, Italy has 240,961 confirmed cases. The official death toll in the onetime epicenter of Europe's outbreak stood at 34,818 on Thursday. ___ BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says a member of his staff has tested positive for the coronavirus and is in self-quarantine, along with a dozen other governor's office employees who were in close contact with the person.  Edwards' office says the governor isn't isolating because epidemiologists deemed he wasn't at risk because he hadn't recently been within 6 feet of the person for at least 15 minutes. The Democratic governor says the employee confirmed to have COVID-19 disease is asymptomatic.  'We are monitoring our team and, should it become necessary, will be offering testing to our staff members and tracing their contacts to determine who needs to self-quarantine and who could be at risk,' Edwards said in a statement. One of Edwards' staff members, April Dunn, died from a coronavirus infection three months ago. ___ LONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization says the world is 'lucky' there is a broad pipeline of experimental COVID-19 vaccines, with more than 150 at early stages of testing.  At the end of a two-day research meeting, the U.N. health agency says 17 vaccine candidates are in human trials and some might prove effective by the end of the year, although that the timeline of a licensed vaccine was still uncertain. 'We are very encouraged by the progression of these candidate vaccines and we are looking forward to have the results,' said Ana Maria Henao Restrapo, a vaccines expert at WHO.  She says the pharmaceuticals planning advanced tests in humans shared their protocols for proposed trials with the agency; all were randomized experiments. Several experimental vaccines, including one developed by Oxford University and made by AstraZeneca, are expected to soon move into large-scale trials that could provide data about whether they are effective. 'Whether or not we will have a vaccine in the anticipated timeline is still unknown,' Restrapo said.  ___ MEXICO CITY \u2014 The governor of the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas says he's tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the fourth state leader in the country to be infected. Gov. Francisco Cabeza de Vaca says on his official Twitter account that he'll keep working and the area is passing through 'a critical moment of infections.' The state has recorded more than 6,000 confirmed cases and at least 356 deaths, though low rates of testing mean the actual number of infections is likely higher. Mxico has reported more than 231,000 confirmed cases and 28,510 deaths. ___10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now[1]The stock market is having its worst week since the financial crisis. For some investors, a flight to safety has them getting out of the market. But other investors are taking a flight to quality. And when it comes to quality in equities, these are the moments when dividend stocks shine. Already JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are projecting that the coronavirus may wipe out corporate earnings growth for 2020. If investors can't count on their equities to provide capital gains, they look to dividends to boost their total return. But like any investment, not all dividend stocks are alike. Some of the best dividend stocks are the dividend aristocrats. By definition, for a company to become a dividend aristocrat, they must have at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth (not just issued a dividend). These companies have a proven track record of weathering market turbulence and delivering solid performance. And, right now, there are only 64 of these companies. In this presentation, we'll give you 10 dividend aristocrat stocks you can invest in right now. View the \"10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now\"[2].

Pakistan's National Command and Control Center says raids are being carried out to impose fines and shut markets, industries and shops where social distancing regulations were being violated. The sealing of high-risk areas began after Pakistan reported a big jump in COVID-19 deaths and a steady increase in infections. Pakistan put its entire population of 220 million under lockdown from March until last month, when Prime Minister Imran Khan's government loosened restrictions, saying it was necessary to save the country's economy. </p><p>Critics say the government's gamble resulted into a sharp increase in infections and deaths. On Tuesday, Pakistan reported 111 new COVID-19 fatalities. It raised the overall death toll from the virus to 2,839 among 148,921 confirmed cases. ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 China reimposes some travel restrictions in the capital to contain a new outbreak, highlighting calls for vigilance as the U.S., Europe and Latin America continue to reopen. \u2014 Health care workers are reckoning with the psychological toll of their work treating virus patients and fears of a resurgence. \u2014 U.S. data says death rates are 12 times higher for virus patients with chronic illnesses, hospitalization 6 times more likely than for otherwise healthy patients.  \u2014 A judge ruled the U.S. Treasury Department must release $679 million in coronavirus relief funding for tribes that it intended to withhold while a challenge over payments to tribal governments played out in court. \u2014 Many businesses are requiring customers and workers to sign forms saying they won't sue if they catch the coronavirus. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.\u2014 Baseball commissioner says whole season in jeopardy after a breakdown in talks over money issues. ___ Follow AP pandemic coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</url> ___ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkey has made the wearing of face masks mandatory in five more provinces, following an uptick in COVID-19 cases. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted early Tuesday that the wearing of masks was now compulsory in 42 of Turkey's 81 provinces. In the remaining provinces, residents are required to wear masks on public transportation and in shops and malls, and are being advised to wear masks and keep to social distancing practices elsewhere. Koca tweeted: 'We cannot struggle against the virus without masks.' Turkey is seeing an upward trend in the daily number of infections after the government authorized cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen, lifted inter-city travel restrictions and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June. The daily number of infections climbed to above 1,500 in the past five days after hovering around 800-900 previously. \u2014- JOHANNESBURG \u2014 Africa's coronavirus cases are now above a quarter-million after South Africa registered a series of daily record-high new cases over the weekend.  South Africa further loosened its lockdown measures on June 1, allowing alcohol sales, more business openings and religious gatherings limited to 50 people.  The country has more than a quarter of the cases on the 54-nation African continent with more than 73,000. It saw its highest jump in cases on Sunday with more than 4,300.  South Africa's struggle to balance measures to slow the spread of the virus and relieve economic pain are common throughout Africa, where the World Health Organization last week said the pandemic is now 'accelerating.' ___ ATHENS, Greece \u2014 Hundreds of health care workers have marched through central Athens demanding the hiring of permanent workers for the health sector, while Greece's hospital doctors' union declared a 24-hour strike Tuesday. The union for state hospital workers also declared a seven-hour work stoppage for the Greek capital and a 24-hour strike for the rest of the country with the same demands. Greece's center right government hired hundreds of workers for state hospitals on fixed-term contracts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Unions are demanding permanent hires, and for funding for the country's health care system. \u2014- NEW DELHI \u2014 India recorded another 10,000-plus coronavirus infections as patients swamp health services in its largest cities. The Health Ministry on Tuesday also reported a 24-hour increase of 380 deaths due to COVID-19, driving the death toll to 9,900. The 10,667 new cases raise the nation's total to 343,091, fourth-highest in the world behind the U.S., Brazil and Russia. The actual numbers, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons such as limited testing. Maharashtra, the western state that is home to Mumbai, India's financial and entertainment capital, continues to have the highest state toll. Mumbai, Chennai and the capital New Delhi are seeing rising infections swamp their health services. New Delhi is a growing concern with the federal government criticizing its contact tracing and hospital capacity. The capital has about 10,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients, half of which are already occupied. Hotels and sports stadiums are being considered for use as field hospitals. ___ WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 New Zealand is no longer free from the new coronavirus after two women who flew from London to see a dying parent tested positive. The new cases sparked a round of testing for anybody who might have been close to them, including their flight's fellow passengers and crew, staff members at a hotel and a family member.  The women are isolated and have delayed the funeral of their parent until they have recovered.  New Zealand has counted 22 deaths from COVID-19, and until Tuesday, everyone else among the 1,500 people known to have been infected had recovered.  ___ MANILA, Philippines \u2014 Philippine officials have placed a central city back under strict lockdown and retained quarantine restrictions in the capital for another two weeks as coronavirus infections continue to spike alarmingly. President Rodrigo Duterte approved in a televised meeting Monday night with key Cabinet officials a recommendation to lock down Cebu city anew and retain quarantine restrictions in metropolitan Manila, where many of the nearly 26,500 infections and more than 1,000 deaths have been recorded. First imposed in mid-March, the COVID-19 restrictions in metropolitan Manila have been among the longest in the world. 'The battle with COVID isn't over,' Duterte said. 'I can't stop you from going out and I can't catch all of you ... don't blame us. Do not forget that we warned you about the grave consequences.' ___ HONOLULU -- A woman traveling with a group of 21 people arrested on suspicion of violating Hawaii's coronavirus quarantine says they have agreed to leave the state because they have received threats from residents. Kendra Carter says that when the group arrived earlier this month, they didn't realize Hawaii's mandatory 14-day quarantine would be enforced. Court documents say they were seen at a beach park shortly after arriving. The quarantine doesn't allow travelers to leave a residence or hotel room for any reason except medical emergencies. The leader of the group, Eligio Bishop, pleaded no contest Monday to the quarantine violation. Attorney Donald Wilkerson, who represents two other men arrested with the group, said the other cases will be dismissed but would be refiled if they return to Hawaii and violate the quarantine. ___ CARSON CITY, Nev. \u2014 Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said current limits on businesses and gatherings would remain in place while health officials evaluate whether the state's uptick in cases is cause for concern. 'Recently we've experienced some trends that require additional evaluation and analysis,' Sisolak said at a news conference, mentioning the upward trend in the number of new daily cases reported in the last three weeks and the percent of individual tests that come back positive. Nevada reported 106 additional coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the statewide total to 11,279 confirmed cases, including 8,815 in Clark County. No new deaths were reported Sunday, keeping the statewide death toll at 465. On June 11, the state reported 277 new confirmed cases, the second-highest daily uptick since the start of the pandemic, behind May 22. Sisolak said he and state health officials anticipated an increase in new cases after reopening and expanding testing capacity throughout June.  ___ BEIJING \u2014 Beijing is imposing further control measures in an attempt to prevent a new outbreak in the capital from spreading to other parts of the country. In addition to locking down communities and ordering mass testing, China's capital is banning residents of areas considered at high risk from leaving the city, health authorities say. Those from such areas who have already left must report to local health bureaus as soon as possible. The number of passengers on buses, trains and subways will also be limited and all will be required to wear masks. The outbreak traced to a wholesale market in the city's southwest may also be disrupting plans to restart China Super League soccer as early as next month. Coaches and players for Beijing Guoan, the city's top team have been tested and given a week off because their training camp is in the same district as the source of the latest outbreak, local media reported Tuesday.7 Boring Stocks That Are Winners[1]Some stocks just don't get much attention during bull markets. They can be too boring for a growth portfolio. But when the market is going through a period of volatility and uncertainty, these tried-and-true performers have a way of making their way back to popularity. And there are good reasons for this. First, many of these boring stocks pay dividends. This simply means that the company will reward shareholders simply for holding on to its stock. Dividend stocks aren't designed to make you rich quickly. However they are designed to offer investors an amount of predictability. And we could all use a little bit of that right now. And predictable stocks can also help investors manage risk. It can be fun to invest in speculative stocks. But they include a risk premium. When these stocks go up (as they sometimes do) they usually have a return that exceeds the broader market. But when they go down (and they usually do) they usually go down more than the broader market. But 'boring' stocks tend to move closer to the broader market.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF THE HOUR: \u2014 Trump hopeful to have virus vaccine on market by end of year or shortly after \u2014 New York to open some beaches by Memorial Day weekend \u2014 Parts of western Pennsylvania begin to ease restrictions ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is adding five new members to the government's coronavirus task force as the White House increasingly focuses on efforts to reopen the country safely and hasten the development of vaccines for COVID-19. The new members include two doctors focused on vaccine development: Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. </p><p>Also joining the task force of about 20 members are Thomas Engels, director of the Health Resources and Services Administration, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. Pence made the changes barely a week after the White House bowed to public pressure and shelved plans to begin to shut down the task force, which has been managing the U.S. response to the coronavirus since late January. The task force announcement comes as Trump named a former pharmaceutical executive to lead his administration's all-out effort to produce and distribute a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. __ West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice on Friday stressed that medical experts are leading his plan to lift coronavirus restrictions, days after he widened his strategy at the request of business owners. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.  The Republican governor has expanded the most aggressive stage of his reopening plan to allow the reopening of gyms and tanning salons next week after he said the businesses bombarded his office with calls. Still, he said it's 'way out in left field' to suggest he is making decisions based on political pressure. 'That noise or that pressure is not going to influence a decision in any way, no possibility,' he said. The governor has timed several reopenings around Memorial Day weekend. Gyms can open Monday. On Thursday, tanning salons, restaurants at half-capacity, big box stores and all-terrain vehicle rental businesses can reopen. Campgrounds can open for in-state residents Thursday, as can the Hatfield-McCoy trails, whitewater rafting and zipline businesses. The Greenbrier, a private resort Justice owns, is also set to reopen May 22. It is unclear exactly what criteria Justice is using to decide when certain businesses resume operations. A visibly frustrated Justice also railed against Democrats, including state lawmakers and U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, for requesting that he spend the $1.25 billion the federal government sent West Virginia to cover medical expenses for the pandemic. 'I am absolutely not going to put this pandemic up with politics,' he said in an aside that referenced House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has become a frequent target during Justice's daily news briefings. Justice has said he wants to use the federal aid package to backfill the state's ailing budget, though rules prevent such spending. At least 62 people in West Virginia have died from the virus and around 1,400 have tested positive, health officials said. ___ VANCOUVER, British Columbia. Canada's Pacific Coast province of British Columbia is allowing schools to reopen on June 1 but on an optional and part time basis. British Columbia Education Minister Rob Fleming says kindergarten through grade five will be open two or three days. Fleming says there will be staggered lunches and recesses. Fleming says grade six through 12 students will likely only attend school once a week. Parents will be given the choice to allow their children to attend. British Columbia Premier John Horgan says these steps will pave the way for a full start in September if it is safe. The province has roughly 2,392 of Canada's 74,532 confirmed cases. ___ LOS ANGELES -- A Navy hospital ship that came to the Port of Los Angeles to help the region during the coronavirus crisis has departed. Tugs pulled the Mercy away from its dock shortly after 7 a.m. Friday.  The 1,000-bed ship arrived in Los Angeles harbor at the end of March to provide beds for non-coronavirus cases to take the load off regional medical centers preparing for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. However, Los Angeles hasn't been overrun with virus cases, and so the Mercy didn't play a huge role as a safety net. The ship is returning to San Diego. ___ HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Another 2.6 million people across western Pennsylvania began to emerge from pandemic restrictions Friday as Gov. Tom Wolf prepared to announce that 12 more counties soon would join them in a partial easing. Wolf planned to announce that Adams, Beaver, Carbon, Columbia, Cumberland, Juniata, Mifflin, Perry, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Wayne and York will be the next batch of counties moving to the 'yellow' phase of his reopening plan, effective May 22, The Associated Press has learned. They are primarily in the south-central and northeast regions of the state. They'll join residents of 13 lightly impacted counties \u2014 including the cities of Pittsburgh, Johnstown and Altoona \u2014 where Wolf lifted his stay-at-home orders on Friday and gave permission for retailers and other types of businesses to reopen. Twenty-four counties across a vast swath of primarily rural northern Pennsylvania were the first to see a partial reopening last week. All told, by the end of next week, more than 40% of Pennsylvania's population of 12.8 million will have seen an easing of pandemic restrictions that were intended to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with very ill COVID-19 patients.  ___ SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile's capital is increasing restrictions on movement as of Friday night to battle an upsurge in COVID-19 cases. The 8 million people in metropolitan Santiago have accounted for more than 80% of the 39,542 confirmed casess in the country of 18 million people. Cases have almost duplicated over the past week. There have been nearly 400 deaths in all. Under the new restrictions, people will have to receive a police permit to leave home \u2014 though the online system allows as many as seven per week. Food markets and pharmacies will remain open and workers in fields such as health, water and energy services are exempt. Violators can be fined the equivalent of thousands of dollars. The Ministry of Health said critical care units for COVID-19 at hospitals in the region are at at 90% to 95% capacity. Hours before the new restrictions were to take effect, highways were crowded with people trying to have the city for the coast in spite of prohibitions on people using second homes to ride out the quarantine. Long lines formed at supermarkets. ___ TIRANA, Albania - An Albanian private media outlet on Friday said government health authorities have put heavy fines and asked it to close the television signal for not respecting the social distancing in its shows. The RTV Ora News said the State Health Inspectorate put two heavy fines of 1 million Albanian leks each (16,000 euros in total) and then ordered it to close its activity after two of its anchormen held shows with three persons from the maximum of two persons allowed from rules set from the start of the country's lockdown to contain the coronavirus. 'They are not closing the business but the free speech,' said its top editor Brahim Shima. The State Health Inspectorate did not respond to the phone calls. Albania set strict rules after shutting down all its borders and the local businesses, also amending its penal code for violators of those rules with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment. The coronavirus pandemic in Albania has killed 31 people and has infected 900 confirmed cases as of Friday. Tourists are once again roaming portions of Grand Canyon National Park after some areas reopened Friday, despite concerns that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus. During the early morning, more than two dozen people were enjoying some viewpoints along the South Rim. Park officials said the South Rim entrance will only be open until 10 a.m. through Monday. Visitors will have limited access to viewpoints and other sites. Officials on the hard-hit Navajo Nation, which stretches into northern Arizona, expressed disappointment at the reopening. There have been at least 3,632 positive cases and 127 deaths on the reservation, which also includes portions of New Mexico and Utah. ___ LONDON -- British Health Secretary Matt Hancock says all care home residents and staff in England will have been tested for the coronavirus by early June, following days of criticism of the government over the scale of the epidemic in care homes.  The government said another 384 people who tested positive for COVID-19 have died in all settings, including care homes, taking the total to 33,998. That's the highest death toll in Europe and second only to the U.S.  Government scientists also said their estimate for the reproduction rate of coronavirus \u2014 the so-called R value \u2014 has increased modestly as a result of the spread of the virus in care homes.  The R measures how many people on average one infected person transmits the disease to. Because of lag factors involved in measuring infections, it's based on what occurred two to three weeks back. The R is thought to have risen to between 0.7 and 1 from the previous range of 0.5 and 0.9 .___ PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island sued Friday, seeking the release of dozens of detainees at a federal lockup where a lawyer says the coronavirus is spreading 'uncontrollably.'  The number of detainees testing positive has more than doubled in recent days at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls from 15 to 38, the ACLU said. Ten staff members have also tested positive.  The lockup holds as many as 770 inmates in the custody of agencies including the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but it's not clear how many are currently there. The ACLU argues detainees can't follow social distancing guidelines in small cells.  'The alarming news is that COVID-19 is spreading uncontrollably at the Wyatt,' lawyer Deborah Gonzalez said. Spokespeople for ICE and the lockup declined to comment on the lawsuit but said additional testing and monitoring is possible. Three ICE detainees were already released after a prior ACLU lawsuit. ___ WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Friday that he's hopeful to have a coronavirus vaccine on the market by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump has tapped to serve as the administration's virus czar, said that early trial data suggests that 'a few hundred million doses of vaccine' will be delivered by late 2020. Trump, speaking at a Rose Garden event, reiterated that he wants to see states move forward with reopening their economies. 'We are back, vaccine or no vaccine,' Trump said. ___ BRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union and Spain say they are convening a donor conference this month in support of refugees and migrants from Venezuela as the coronavirus pandemic deepens their plight. Venezuela is gripped by a deepening political and economic crisis under President Nicols Maduro. Refugee agencies have said that the number of people fleeing the country could reach 6.5 million by the end of 2020. Most stay in Latin America and the Caribbean In a statement Friday, the EU said the aim of the May 26 event is to 'mobilize resources to support the displaced population and the main host communities, tackle the aggravated situation created by COVID-19, and facilitate greater commitment and coordination of the key actors.' The EU fears the crisis is being ignored but hopes that around 40 countries as well as UN agencies and world financial institutions will take part. Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzlez Laya says 'the international community cannot remain aloof from the drama of the Venezuelan exodus. It is necessary to act without further delay.' ___ NEW YORK -- After two months of strict limits on business and social distancing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo welcomed the first loosening of restrictions in many parts of the state Friday and announced that beaches would be allowed to open in time for the Memorial Day weekend. State and municipal beaches throughout the state will be allowed to open the Friday before the holiday, but with limits, the Democrat said. Capacity will be limited to no more than 50 percent of normal, with parking limited to trim crowds. Group activities will not be allowed. Picnic areas and playgrounds will stay closed. Employees need to wear masks. It will be up to local governments, Cuomo said, to decide whether to allow municipal beaches to reopen. If they do, they must follow the state's rules. 'If there is a problem, and the locals do not enforce those regulations, we will close those beaches,' Cuomo said. Beaches in New Jersey and Connecticut will also be open for the holiday weekend, and Cuomo said part of the rationale for reopening was to prevent New Yorkers from flocking to those states as the weather warms. ___ NEW YORK -- New York City will spend $55 million to provide 74,000 free air conditioners to low-income older adults who may be cooped up inside their apartments all summer because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. 'Knowing that low-income seniors are the most vulnerable, we're going to start an initiative right away to get them air conditioners,' de Blasio said. Other measures aimed at helping New Yorkers survive summer in the era of social distancing will include setting up air-conditioned cooling centers in facilities such as gyms and libraries and opening fire hydrants safely. 'This is all about protecting New Yorkers and helping them through the summer,' de Blasio said. ___ LONDON -- Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has confirmed that the lockdown restrictions in his country will start to be eased from Monday. Varadkar said in a tweet that it is 'safe to proceed' with the first stage in the government's plan to ease the restrictions. Earlier this month, the Irish government set out a road map of how to reopen society. Each one of the five stages will be staggered three weeks apart. From Monday, groups of up to four people, who can be family or friends, may meet outdoors within 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of home. And some workers, such as those in construction, can return to their jobs, while the rules on exercise have been relaxed. And garden centers, as well as other primarily outdoor retail businesses, will be able to reopen. Social distancing rules have to be observed in all cases. Ireland is widely seen as having controlled the virus relatively well. The government has said that 1,506 people who tested positive for COVID-19 have died. ___ ROME \u2014 Italy registered an increase of 789 COVID-19 infections from Thursday to Friday as the country anxiously waits to learn if partial easing of lockdown restrictions earlier this month has triggered any uptick in contagion rate.  Other Health Ministry figures released on Friday evening indicated the number of patients needing intensive care in hospitals has continued to steadily decline. Currently 808 people with coronavirus infections occupy ICU beds in Italy. Early in the outbreak, ICU units were overwhelmed in the north, Italy's epicenter for coronavirus cases, helping to sharply drive up the number of deaths. Italy's known death toll by Friday evening stood at 31,610, after 242 deaths were registered in the last 24 hours. Overall, Italy has registered 223,885 cases since the nation's outbreak began in late February.  On May 4, the government loosened some lockdown rules, including allowing citizens to frequent public parks and to visit family members throughout their home region. Epidemiologists have said that it would take roughly 14 days to assess whether the regained partial freedom of movement might send Italy's infection rate climbing again.
