The Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are seen as almost invincible and at The Times CEO Summit last week most participants argued for regulatory solutions to cut them down to size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dame Carolyn McCall, ITV's chief executive, called for Google and Facebook to be regulated as if they were publishers to create a \"level playing field\". Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the RSA, said that Amazon ought to be broken up.</p><p>Only Jan Hammer, a partner of Index Ventures, argued that it was possible to out-compete the Faangs. On the face of it, that sounds impossible. Their prodigious cashflow lets them invest vast sums in blue-sky projects as well as conventional capex, giving them a huge advantage over start-ups. Their big and well-developed regulatory arms are another advantage. They can suck up talent with lavish share option packages to crowd out rivals.</p><p>Yet there are ways in which the Faangs are being out-competed. Here's one example: think about how you look at the weather forecast online. Five years ago you would probably have typed \"weather\" into Google. Today you probably have a weather app on your phone. Google has, in this instance, been superseded. It may only be in one small product area and will not hit Google's revenues meaningfully but still it shows how Faangs can be displaced.</p><p>There are other examples. Mr Hammer cited Farfetch, the website based in London that competes with Amazon in luxury fashion, and Criteo in Paris, which is taking on Google in targeted advertising.</p><p>The dominance of the Faangs was made possible in part by the \"platform' model\", which offers a one-stop shop. It enables the platform to have scale and add services relatively cheaply. Arguably, the likes of Google and Facebook are now so dominant that the entry barriers to creating a successful new platform are too high. Yet other growth drivers are taking hold, such as cybersecurity, voice recognition, augmented reality, blockchain and artificial intelligence, all of which have the potential to give rise to new tech giants. The Faangs may also find themselves out-competed in sectors where they are relative newcomers.</p><p>Mr Hammer argued: \"There is an opportunity to build businesses that just are better technologically. Entrepreneurs [should] rise to that opportunity, see the world as one global market and go and compete in transport, food, pharmaceuticals and other industries where Google is investing its profits.\"</p><p>Viable competitors already exist. China has Bat (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), which dominate search, ecommerce and, increasingly, payments. So far they have preferred to operate mainly at home but they could conceivably go toe-to-toe with some of the Faangs in future.</p><p>Alibaba, in particular, looks to be an extremely potent threat to Amazon.</p><p>In his book The Four, Scott Galloway, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, notes that today's tech giants all had to take on dominant businesses such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard. Apple got a toe in the market by targeting individuals rather than the corporate market. Google and Facebook overcame Yahoo and MySpace respectively by positioning themselves as smaller, safer, humbler players.</p><p>Mr Galloway adds: \"There is no reason to believe that these strategies - insurgency, false humility, security and simplicity plus discounting - won't work again one day against [the giants].</p><p>\"Giant companies face their own challenges: they lose their best talent to more rewarding start-ups; their physical plant grows old; their empires grow so big they can no longer co-ordinate their pieces; they get distracted by investigations from envious or nervous governments.\"</p><p>Gravity will ultimately catch up with some or all of the Faangs. The only question is when.</p><p>Ian King is business presenter for Sky News.

Roughly $1 trillion in FAANGs market value has vaporized from their highs, according to CNBC, with Facebook off 40 percent.</p><p>Yet we're told the economy is strong. Unemployment is plumbing record lows. And gyrating equity markets that this week erased all the gains this year are not, we're also told, good predictors of the health of the economy.</p><p>Let's hope so, though I hear a distinctly audible bell reminding that I've heard that one before. That and echoes of CNBC's Jim Cramer thundering: \"They know nothing!\"</p><p>Headwinds are stiffening for an economic expansion given a second boost after the 2016 election and passage of the GOP tax cuts. It's getting harder to make money, thanks to outsized expectations, overreaching politicians and Silicon Valley moguls whose business practices skew more 19th-century Robber Baron than 21st-century corporate citizen.</p><p>Blame President Trump, whose escalating trade war with China is making business more expensive. Blame the new Democratic majority in Congress, whose leaders vow to re-regulate the banks and finally regulate the unregulated tech companies barely able to manage their own platforms.</p><p>Blame the Russians, whose decades-long history of making mischief in American politics now is turbo-charged by internet-fueled tools created right here at home. Blame the Chinese, whose mercantile imperialism and penchant for mischief invite the pushback Team Trump is willing to exert. Blame investors, said to like divided government in the aftermath of the Democrats regaining control of the House in the mid-terms.</p><p>Throwing it all together produces a toxic sludge likely to gum the gears of commerce: more and higher tariffs raise costs for businesses and consumers. Renewed regulation makes the financial sector costlier. And arguably overdue oversight for tech companies like Facebook - whose management shows an alarming inability to control, much less understand, the power of its creation - now seems inevitable.</p><p>Investors' insatiable search for growth has endowed the FAANGs and the tech sector with enormous market-shaping power. It's vested their leaders with an air of invincibility. And investors persuaded themselves that growth would continue unimpeded. Only one of those is true - the market power punishing the broader market despite stronger fundamentals.</p><p>Just about anyone who has skin in the market or the economy could feel the pinch, if only a little. The FAANGs are in your pocket, your smartphone, your laptop and your home. They track your shopping preference, your browsing history and at least one of them - Amazon.com Inc. - is pushing around mayors, governors and state legislatures with impunity.</p><p>The Seattle-based online retailing giant last year launched a sweepstakes seeking sites for a second North American headquarters, dubbed \"HQ2.\" More than 200 cities and regions submitted bids, including Metro Detroit. Ol' Amazon went strictly establishment, choosing the money of New York and the power of Washington.</p><p>That tells you just about everything you need to know.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:daniel.howes@detroitnews.com\">daniel.howes@detroitnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Reckoning in big tech shares erases $1 trillion in market value despite markers of strong U.S. economy; oil price slide to pressure shale producers.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-tdndc573vfpkue95vqzy9ugm0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C944EC2A39E NWBKMI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9V-YSF1-JBCN-4230-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Digital First Media [Detroit]<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It's also changed how it displays shopping results, overhauled its privacy policy and relaxed its grip on the Android mobile market.</p><p>The tech giant said Tuesday it made many of the changes \"in direct response to formal concerns raised by the European Commission.\" Other shifts have been forced by court rulings and new EU data rules.</p><p>Google now looks very different, as a result. </p><p>Antitrust</p><p>Wednesday's antitrust fine is the third against Google in less than two years. The fines --- the three largest of their kind against a single company ---- total (EURO)8.2 billion ($9.3 billion). But the penalties are about more than money. </p><p>The Commission has ordered Google to change the way it pushes its apps on Android users, and how it uses its search engine to boost its shopping service. </p><p>Margrethe Vestager, Europe's top antitrust official, said the changes are producing results.</p><p>Only 6% of clicks from Google's shopping results went to competitors in July 2018, but that figure has increased to around 40%, she said.</p><p>Google can no longer force smartphone makers to install Google's search and browser products if they use the Google Play Store. The company said this week it will now ask Android users which browser and search engine they prefer. </p><p>Privacy</p><p>Sweeping new privacy laws, the General Data Protection Regulation, came into effect in May 2018.</p><p>The law affects organizations that hold or use data on people inside the European Union. It gives people more control over their data and forces companies to make sure the way they collect, process and store data is safe.</p><p>Google has already got itself in trouble over the rules. France's data privacy watchdog fined Google (EURO)50 million ($65 million) in January, the first major fine given under the new rules. </p><p>The regulator said Google didn't provide users adequate information and failed to obtain their valid consent in regards to personalized advertisements. Google has appealed the decision. </p><p>Right to be forgotten </p><p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a landmark ruling in 2014 that search engines like Google must remove certain unwanted links upon request, establishing a legal precedent across the European Union.</p><p>In a report on the issue published in February 2018, Google said it removed over 1 million results in the three years following the ruling. It said that 8% of the results were related to \"crime\" and 7% to \"professional wrongdoing.\"</p><p>The ECJ is currently deciding a separate case over whether the right to be forgotten should be extended globally ---- something Google has been resisting. </p><p>Next battlegrounds: Copyright, illegal content, taxes</p><p>Google and other big tech companies are facing numerous other potential problems in Europe. </p><p>The most pressing: EU copyright law proposals that will be voted on by the European Parliament in the next few weeks. Google and others have been lobbying against the law, saying it could dramatically change the internet. </p><p>The main sticking point is whether content sharing platforms like YouTube, which is owned by Google, should be liable for copyright infringements committed by their users. </p><p>Another section of the proposal would require sites like Google News to pay publishers for displaying snippets of content. Google says that would prevent it from sending traffic to media sites.</p><p>The European Union is also pushing tech companies to clean up their act when it comes to illegal content and hate speech, threatening to legislate new rules if voluntary arrangements don't work. </p><p>Another issue is the digital services tax, which would require companies like Google to pay tax on sales in countries where they are made. An EU-wide proposal has been put on hold, but some countries are pressing ahead.</p><p>Break up?</p><p>The European Parliament has repeatedly voted to break up Google to weaken its dominance across the region. The votes are not binding, but they give a sense of sentiment towards the company in Europe.</p><p>Regulators have so far steered clear of the idea. </p><p>\"For us, that would be a measure of very, very last resort,\" Vestager told CNN on Wednesday. But she hinted that the next big antitrust fight could be about the huge amount of data held by tech companies. </p><p>\"If you cannot get access [to the data], well, the number of competitors may dry out and the number of innovators may dry out as well,\" she said.</p><p>Erin McLaughlin and James Frater contributed reporting.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The kids, of course, had the best signs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Save our cat videos!\" read one poster spotted in Berlin. Several held up signs declaring \"We are not bots!\" a sly reference to certain politicians in favor of the new law, who claimed any opposition came from internet bots, not real EU citizens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the people were real. And so was their anger. The new law, officially called the Directive on Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market, has been the subject of fierce debate for more than two years. The likes of Paul McCartney and Lady Gaga - as well as European directors and screenwriters including Mike Leigh and Pawel Pawlikowski - backed the directive. Big tech was opposed: YouTube and Facebook in particular, but also not-for-profit sites like Wikipedia, whose founder, Jimmy Wales, joined internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in condemning the legislation. Among the protesters, most demonstrated against the directive.</p><p>In the end, Gaga and McCartney won out. On March 26, in a vote of 348 to 274, the European Parliament approved the directive. And on April 15, at the European Council, the European Union's executive body - 19 countries representing a majority of the European population, including France and Germany - endorsed the legal overhaul that, experts say, represents the biggest change to how companies can operate online since Berners-Lee came up with the idea for the World Wide Web all those years ago.</p><p>The Copyright Directive is far-reaching and has widespread - and sharply different - implications for different sections of the entertainment industry, as well as online platforms and ordinary users. One of the most radical changes is outlined in Article 17 of the directive. It reverses current law, making online platforms, and not their users, legally liable for copyright-protected songs, films, TV series or other content uploaded to their sites.</p><p>The law does not apply only to typical piracy - someone uploading the new Beyonc\u00e9 album or a bootleg episode of Game of Thrones - but also when, say, a parent posts a video of her child singing a song from that Beyonc\u00e9 album, or when a YouTuber comments on that GoT episode, using a clip from the show. This is the opposite of current U.S. law, under which the user is liable for copyright infringement and platforms have to take down material only if notified by copyright holders.</p><p>Going forward, platforms operating in the European Union will have to show that they have made their \"best efforts\" to detect and block protected content. The law also requires them to acquire licenses for the content that is shared on their sites.</p><p>The potential impact on Hollywood and Silicon Valley is enormous. Facebook and Google both earn between a quarter and a third of their revenue in Europe ($4.15 billion for Facebook last quarter, $44.5 billion for Google parent company Alphabet Inc). And the new law will affect any film or television studio - as well as any writer, director or performer - whose work is sold or distributed in Europe, a territory of some 515 million people with a collective GDP of more than $20 trillion.</p><p>The actual financial repercussions of the new legislation will depend on how it is implemented and how companies - both social media platforms and rights holders - react. But Facebook and Google could have to shell out billions in new licensing revenue to publishers, music companies and film and TV creators.</p><p>While Facebook and YouTube haven't commented directly on the EU directive, a Google spokesperson said the new law was an improvement on two-decades-old copyright legislation in Europe but \"will still lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe's creative and digital economies.\"</p><p>And Europe's present could be America's future. U.S. legislators, reacting to the growing public backlash against the power and influence of the digital giants, are increasingly pointing to the European model as a solution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking in April shortly after the European Parliament passed the Copyright Directive, said she supports a change in U.S. law to make internet companies responsible for what is posted on their platforms. On an April 12 podcast interview with Kara Swisher of Recode, Pelosi echoed the supporters of the EU law, saying the \"era of self-regulation\" for the likes of Facebook and YouTube should \"probably\" come to an end.</p><p>\"For the platforms, the [EU directive] is a complete paradigm shift - it changes everything,\" says Stephan Dreyer, a senior researcher in media law and media governance at the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It completely shifts the position of power from the platforms to the rights holders. For Facebook, Google and company, it won't be easy.\"</p><p>\"It is going to be very difficult for companies to put a strategy in place,\" adds Mike Shaw, partner at Marks &amp; Clerk, a London-based group of intellectual property attorneys and consultants. \"The obvious solution would be to limit the amount of content that users are allowed to upload - to block as much as possible to avoid infringements and copyright fees. But that goes against the whole purpose of these social media platforms - they'd be accused of censorship and would lose public support.\"</p><p>Evan Engstrom, executive director of tech advocacy group Engine, which has received funding from Google, notes that even if the digital giants wanted to block everything, they wouldn't be able to. \"Upload filters just don't work like that,\" he says. \"They only work if you have a fully accurate library of all the content out there. And if you have even a slight change - a different edit, music or technical alteration - the filter can't catch it.\"</p><p>Indeed, the sheer volume of content involved is colossal. YouTube estimates that its users upload 400 hours of video content to the site every minute. The company has invested $100 million in content-matching software ContentID and, by its own estimation, has paid out more than $3 billion to rights holders since 2007. Facebook offers something similar, called Rights Manager, though it doesn't disclose the revenue it pays out to rights holders.</p><p>For many, particularly in the music business, which has seen artists' content widely distributed and pirated online, that isn't nearly enough. The music industry association IFPI notes that YouTube pays less than $1 per user in royalties to musicians, compared to around $20 per user paid by subscription streaming service Spotify. The promise of increased revenue - closing what the labels call the \"value gap\" between the demand for their content and the money the platforms pay them - is the main reason the Copyright Directive has near-universal support among musicians and major labels.</p><p>Big publishing companies - including German newspaper and magazine giant Axel Springer, which lobbied hard to push the law through - also hope the directive will close the \"value gap\" in news and journalism. A section of the legislation, Article 11, requires aggregators such as Google News to pay a \"link tax\" if they reproduce snippets or previews of an article in their search results. Wikipedia and other nonprofit or open-source platforms will be exempt. Richard Gingras, Google's vp news, has warned that the company could switch off its Google News service entirely in the EU if the \"link tax\" proves too onerous or unworkable.</p><p>But if tech companies - broadly - think the EU directive is a bad thing, and the music and news industries - broadly - welcome it, things are more complicated for the film and TV industry. The Motion Picture Association has warned that the new law hurts film and television producers by \"improving the position of platforms, but not of rights holders\" because the platforms can escape liability for copyright violation if they can show they made their \"best efforts\" to detect and block illegal content.</p><p>Production companies, including the Hollywood studios, have criticized the directive, claiming it is actually too lax when it comes to copyright protection. They note the final version of the directive does not explicitly require platforms to introduce upload filters. And smaller companies - those with less than $11 million in annual revenue or fewer than 5 million monthly unique visitors - will be exempt. \"The studios have no interest in having their material on YouTube at all,\" says Dreyer, \"so they want restrictions to be as tight as possible.\"</p><p>Not so with writers and directors, who have backed the EU directive and celebrated a major victory when the law passed. The directive greatly strengthens the rights of authors by forcing production companies and distributors to report how much they earn from online sales and to properly compensate the original creators. Many in the creative community see the directive as a key first step toward a rebalance of power between European writers and the industry's traditional gatekeepers - be they broadcasters, studios or platforms. Currently, the vast majority of European creatives are signed to buyout contracts and receive zero backend remuneration for their work, no matter how successful it is.</p><p>\"This is just what we needed and just what we had hoped for,\" says French screenwriter Yves Nilly, president of Writers &amp; Directors Worldwide, a lobbying group. \"Finally we have the power to negotiate with producers &amp;hellip; for better terms.\"</p><p>There is still plenty of time to debate since the European Copyright Directive won't actually be enforced until at least 2021. The individual parliaments across 27 European countries have two years to interpret the directive and write it into their own national law. Six countries - Italy, Sweden, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - actually voted against the directive, so implementation is likely to be uneven, setting the stage for legal challenges later on.</p><p>\"There's going to be muddling through, a whole lot of muddle, before we get legal clarity on this,\" says Steven Wilf, professor of global commerce at the University of Connecticut Law School. \"But what I do know is that it won't be as bad as the naysayers think and it won't be as good as the supporters hope. &amp;hellip; It won't be an end to social media; it won't crush freedom of speech; the old business models will continue to exist, they will just have to adapt.\"</p><p>Even its harshest critics admit that the directive is unlikely to \"break the internet,\" as some activists once claimed. The lasting impact of the legislation, however, may not be seen in your Facebook feed or in YouTube's balance sheet.</p><p>\"The vast majority of users will barely notice the changes,\" Dreyer also concedes. \"But I worry about this trend. Each individual law seems reasonable enough. But slowly, systematically, we are putting limits on freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Still Legal? Five Online Activities That Could Change Under the New Euro LawFrom memes to cat videos, the EU copyright legislation could impact anyone using the internet to post or share content online</p><p>Movie ClipsEXAMPLE: A YouTube star mocks a scene from the new Avengers movie, using a clip from the film.</p><p>Going forward, platforms like YouTube will be legally liable if their users post unlicensed content - like a movie clip - to their site. Most expect YouTube will sign deals with the big studios and record labels to make sure none of their content gets blocked.</p><p>MusicEXAMPLE: A comedian posts a parody of a new Beyonc\u00e9 song to his own site, using the same melody as the original.</p><p>It depends on how popular the comedian is. Smaller sites - ones with fewer than 5 million unique users a month and annual revenue of less than $11 million - will continue to operate under the old laws, having to license or take down content only if rights holders ask them to.</p><p>News StoriesEXAMPLE: You tweet a comment to a news story, quoting the original story at length.</p><p>Twitter, Google News, Facebook and other platforms will be required to pay a \"link tax\" if users' posts include more than a \"short snippet\" from an original news article. Just how \"short\" and \"snippet\" are defined will be the focus of future legal battles.</p><p>MemesEXAMPLE: You screen-grab an embarrassing moment from the Oscars, add a comment and turn it into an Instagram meme.</p><p>Internet rights activists have called the Copyright Directive \"the death of the meme,\" but, as written, the legislation explicitly protects this sort of freedom of expression. Expect technical hiccups, however, as upload filters misidentify legal memes as illegal piracy.</p><p>Personal Photos or VideosEXAMPLE: You find a cute picture of a cat online and post it to your Facebook friends.</p><p>If you took the picture yourself, you own it. But if it's someone else's cat pic, there could be a problem. Still photos - among the easiest content to watermark and track online - could be blocked en masse, leading to a lot of very angry cat people. - S.R.</p><p>A version of this story first appeared in the April 24 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-<person><nameText>Eric Schmidt, </nameText></person>former CEO of Google, now executive chairman of Alphabet, Inc.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech firms like Facebook, Google and Amazonhave become indispensable presences in our lives. We are addicted to these platforms as they steer us to unseen news, gossip, products and entertainment. We check our mobiles through the day, attempting to skate over micro-moments of anxiety and boredom through the endorphins that clicks and 'likes' generate. We are experiencing a civilizational transition and thinkers in various disciplines are grappling with the significance of the moment.</p><p>Among them is Franklin Foer, a former editor of the New Republic, who offers a fascinating look at how Big Tech is reshaping humanity, democracy and world culture at large in his new book World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech. His argument is straightforward - data is indeed the new oil, big tech firms are harvesting our personal data in granular detail; they build user profiles to provide us services we seek and push targeted advertising alongside. More crucially their (secret) algorithms decide what we see and do not see; they are constantly curating the knowledge we are exposed to, they determine \"the news we read, the goods we buy, the path we travel, the friends we invite into our circle.\" Our thought-life is, to a significant extent, being shepherded by machines.</p><p>This plays out in several ways. Producers of content, like newspapers and magazines, are dependent on these platforms for distribution of their material but users have little control on what appears on their feed. Facebookusers ordinarily go through a fraction of what they expect to see because its algorithms prioritise the material. Google, likewise, classifies knowledge and imposes order, as Foer says, on the bewildering mass of material and tailors our engagement with journalistic and academic material.</p><p>The thing about algorithms is that while they scan data for patterns, they can be also manipulated to serve specific purposes - to reflect \"the minds of its creators, the motives of its trainers\". Amazon \"steers you to the sort of books that you've seen before\" while \"Netflix directs users to the unfamiliar\", because \"obscure fare\" is cheaper for the company to stream rather than blockbuster films. Googlecan \"suppress pornography\" and \"not.anti-Semitic conspiracists\", its search results privilege recent articles rather than older ones. Facebook's ability to influence people is increasingly well-known; it has run experiments to see if emotions are contagious, it has \"bragged about\" increasing voter turnout and organ donations \"by subtly amping up the social pressure that compel virtuous behaviour.\" The impact of political ads on Facebookplaced by Russia-based entities during the US presidential election is now being unravelled. The Trump campaign used Facebookeffectively while Barack Obama's reportedly drew on GoogleAnalytics during the 2012 election.</p><p>Foer argues that the capacity of Big Tech firms to act as gatekeepers of knowledge and actively influence peoples' views gives these firms \"tremendous cultural power\". People are increasingly accessing worlds of knowledge primarily through Facebook, Google and Amazonand this leads Foer to conclude that humans are outsourcing thinking to machines, that algorithms are relieving humans of the burden of choosing and thereby eroding free will itself.</p><p>One of the problems with this situation is that Big Tech platforms are agnostic about quality and are not particularly interested in elevating people's sensibilities. They focus on capturing attention and</p><p>as a result pandering to popular tastes is the norm. If people want videos instead of words then that's what they will increasingly get, never mind if traffic to serious, print sources will plummet. Facebookand Googleare thus having a devastating impact on journalism, and by extension democracy, as a result. News outlets cannot do without the platforms to distribute content and yet they get very little in return in terms of revenue. And since income from ads depends on numbers of page views there is a tendency to produce shallow, clickbaity material. Content is produced at a frenzied pace while resources for deep, research-based, time-consuming journalism are simply not available. All this, Foer says, has a created a narrow culture and \"put on a path to a world without private contemplation, autonomous thought, or solitary introspection\", a world, in his view, \"without mind.\"</p><p>Foer's book is valuable for the way it charts the rise of Big Tech firms. It traces Silicon Valley's success to the intellectual endeavours of Rene Descartes, Gottfried Leibniz, Alan Turing and the 1960s counterculture; it relates the intellectual convictions of the founders of Google, Facebookand Amazon, their optimism about technology's ability to address the world's problems and the scope of their ambition (that include Google's aim to achieve AI complete, \"the creation of machines with the ability to equal and eventually exceed human intelligence.\") He also explains how the evolving application of anti-trust law in the US enabled these monopolies to emerge in ways that would have been unthinkable in the past.</p><p>Foer points to several factors that will sustain the dominance of Big Tech companies. One is their tax evasion practices and their ability to \"transfer their core assets, their intellectual property, to whatever tax haven offers the sweetest deal.\" Tech companies lobby governments and have \"culturally and electorally\" aligned themselves with the left and the Democratic Party and \"defanged their most likely critics\". They are also far ahead of the competition because \"they have such a large stockpile of a precious asset\", which is data. Bruce Schneier has famously said that \"surveillance is the business model of the internet\"; harvesting personal data is vital for the operations of tech firms and that would entail continued invasion of user privacy.</p><p>Foer concedes that the internet may be unusable without these platforms as they organise knowledge in helpful ways but he sharply highlights the trade-offs in terms of personal autonomy and privacy and the effects informational monopolies like Facebookand Googlehave on democracy.</p><p>Is there a way to counter these trends? Foer has several prescriptions. They include getting back to paper -in the form of books, magazines, and newspapers -to cultivate a space beyond the monopolies \"where we don't leave a data trail, where we are untracked.\" He wants constraints on data that can be collected. Citizens, not corporations, should own their own data and have the right to purge it from servers. He wants consumers to pay for content and calls for a revolution in approaches to reading along the lines of the counterculture's approach to food, where it influenced people to jettison the cheap in favour of the healthy. He advocates breaking up of the monopolies, treating Facebook, Google and Amazon\"with the same firm hand that led government to wage war on AT&amp;T, IBM and Microsoft - even dismembering them into smaller companies if circumstances.demand a forceful response.\"</p><p>These ideas will be debated and have some way to go. Foer is of the view that tech companies may be one mega-hack away (e.g. massive leak of personal data) from a backlash that could make them vulnerable to regulation. World Without Mind is a fluent read and makes a compelling argument on the costs of dependence on Big Tech and the challenges the latter face heading into the future.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Legislation introduced last month would revamp Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 the legal shield that safeguards tech stalwarts, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube against being sued for what its users post. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, one of tech's loudest critics in Washington, D.C., proposed an amendment that essentially would strip these companies of their protection unless their content moderation is deemed 'politically neutral.' </p><p>The consequences of curtailing Section 230 would be dire for Facebook, Twitter and the like. Hawley did not respond to TheWrap's request for comment. 'It's a very simple explanation: it opens them up to liability for information that's published on their platform,' Matt Bilinsky, a tech and media-focused attorney in Los Angeles, told TheWrap. Today, if a user defames another on Facebook, erroneously claiming that person gave them a venereal disease, for instance, the social network is under no legal threat. As Bilinsky explained, the law differentiates between publishers and platforms. 'But if you remove Section 230 protection, it opens up Pandora's box. [Facebook and other tech giants] are going to start getting those lawsuits,' Bilinsky continued. 'And where they land, who knows? The expense for Facebook and Twitter to find out would be costly.' The new legislation would task the Federal Trade Commission with certifying that tech companies approach moderation in a neutral fashion. It would apply to any company with more than 30 million monthly active users in the U.S., 300 million monthly active users globally or $500 million in global revenue. What's more, a supermajority vote would be required every two years. A company could potentially lose its immunity and be subject to legal liability. How'd we get here? Also Read: LinkedIn Live Video: More Engagement Than Video on Demand[1] Section 230 dates back to 1996 \u2014 the Dark Age of the internet. Prior to its enactment, 'there was an interpretation of the rules that, if you exercised any editorial control over content, you incurred more liability for it,' Jeff Kosseff, a law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of 'The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,' a new book on Section 230, told TheWrap. Legislators, according to Kosseff, adopted Section 230 to give sites the 'breathing room' to moderate content, rather than shy away due to fears of being slapped with a lawsuit. 'Congress passed it because they did not want the platforms to be hands-off,' Kosseff continued. 'They gave platforms the tremendous flexibility to moderate objectionable content. That was a policy choice that Congress made.' But rather than encourage heavy regulation, the act was intended to foster growth, Bilinsky said. And for two decades, it did just that, allowing companies like Facebook and Google-owned YouTube to flourish behind user-generated content, without fear they'd be sued for something a user said. It was taken as 'gospel,' Bilinsky said, 'that more was better: more sharing, more speech, more information.' Fast forward 23 years, and that gospel isn't as readily accepted by the tech faithful. Now, moderation and fighting 'hate speech' \u2014 a term the major platforms can't agree on \u2014 has become a way to build trust with an increasingly wary audience. In May, Facebook banned a number[2] of far-right commentators, including Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, for violating its policies on 'dangerous individuals and organizations.' The company policy[3] says that it 'does not allow any organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence' to have Facebook accounts. But Facebook did not share specific infractions that led to the bans \u2014 making the decision appear capricious. Twitter also has spent much of the last year purging its platform, after chief Jack Dorsey said the company needed to improve the 'health' of public conversation. But the company's arbitrary enforcement of its arcane rules[4] has led to confusion[5] from both the left and the right. When pressed by Joe Rogan on his podcast earlier this year, Dorsey, on several occasions, said he didn't know the 'exact specifics' behind a number of bans. The result is no one is satisfied with the current arrangement. 'On one side you have the Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley argument that there's too much moderation of particular points of view,' Kosseff said. 'Then you also have a whole other criticism, which is that the platforms don't moderate enough. He continued: 'The platforms really have two different, almost polar opposite criticisms of them, and they're caught in the middle.' This was especially clear last month, when YouTube decided to demonetize[6], but not ban, conservative commentator Steven Crowder, after Vox reporter Carlos Maza shared a video compilation of Crowder calling him a 'lispy queer' and 'gay Latino,' among other slights, while critiquing his political opinions. (Maza said many of Crowder's fans had also harassed him and texted him to debate the commentator.) Crowder, who hosts a right-leaning comedy show, had his entire channel demonetized for a 'pattern of egregious actions' that \u2014 despite YouTube stating that he didn't violate its policies \u2014 'harmed the broader community,'[7] according to the Google-owned video service. That decision came a day after YouTube had initially said it wouldn't take action against Crowder because he hadn't violated its rules. Ultimately, YouTube's move to demonetize Crowder did little to placate Maza, who tweeted that the company 'made this problem worse than it already was' by not banning Crowder altogether. Republicans \u2014 including President Trump on several occasions \u2014 have ridiculed Silicon Valley's attempts to moderate speech. And now, with Sen. Hawley's 'End Support for Censorship Act,' lawmakers are at least considering yanking tech's ability to lean on Section 230 when making content decisions. 'With Section 230,' Sen. Hawley said in a statement last month, 'tech companies get a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys-complete exemption from traditional publisher liability in exchange for providing a forum free of political censorship. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, big tech has failed to hold up its end of the bargain.' Also Read: FITE TV Eyes Addition of Music and Motorsports Verticals (Exclusive)[8] This is where it gets hairy for Silicon Valley. Operating 'commonly understood and reasonable community guidelines' is completely kosher under Section 230, Bilinsky explained, but moderation in moderation is key. 'The more extensive you make the guidelines, the more selectively you enforce them, the more discretion you start to exercise over your platform, you start to move away from what seems like a platform and more like what looks like a publisher,' Bilinsky said. That move is what has put Section 230 up for debate \u2014 and has put companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google in increased danger. Without their current protections, these companies are looking at bloated legal fees and the potential abandonment of the user-generated content that helped build them up in the first place.Related

Don't be taken in. Facebook wants the burden of compliance with all those KYC, AML and CFT rules. Being able to identify what its users are paying for is a treasure trove. The banking system and the world's central banks, as the more enlightened already see, had better gear up for new competition.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At meetings of the G7, at the gathering of world central bankers at Jackson Hole, across this year's IMF and World Bank confab, indeed wherever financial policymakers assemble, Facebook's Libra project remains the hot topic. Can it succeed? How will it work? What does it mean?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Financial types have been earnestly debating the nature of money, reform of the payments system, the prospect for societies going cashless or even card-less, for years now, ever since the great financial crisis and the rise of fintech. Suddenly it's all getting real.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Libra could be the project that takes virtual currency away from the crypto nerds and the masters of the established financial order, and finally drops it into the lap \"\" or onto the phone \"\" of a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>In the process, it might just create a new world currency, something reminiscent of the European currency unit, first created in 1979 and used as the unit of account for the European Community until the advent of the euro itself 20 years later. Libra could be a bigger, global version of this and one that people (not just a few sovereign and multilateral bond issuers) use in everyday life, to pay for coffee, groceries or a ride on the subway. It could also allow expatriate workers to remit funds to their home countries safely and cheaply.</p><p>Trade wars look poised to give way to currency wars. A return of FX volatility may be good for banks. But it might make a virtual stablecoin, backed by a reserve basket of government bonds and bank deposits in the world's leading fiat currencies, a highly desirable way of ironing out volatility for users who just want to store and transmit value. Especially so if they are based in a weakening currency like sterling and want to pay for goods normally denominated in a strengthening one like the US dollar.</p><p>Much attention will focus on the on and off ramps to Libra: the mechanisms for users to exchange fiat currency into Libra and Libra back into fiat. But conceptually it's not hard to grasp how such a global currency stablecoin could be adopted by a vast network of users and co-exist with national currencies.</p><p> Traditional finance, in particular, has become bloated, inefficient and inappropriately costly; and frankly it's time for a change\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Dave Hodgson, NEM Ventures </p><p>In July, the IMF published a paper by Tobias Adrian and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli on the rise of digital money that goes even further. It argues that the two most common forms of money today could even be surpassed. Even if that doesn't happen, the authors say, cash and bank deposits will certainly face a battle with e-money, electronically stored monetary value denominated in, and pegged to, a common unit of account such as the euro, dollar or renminbi \"\" or a basket of these, as with Facebook's newly proposed Libra stablecoin.</p><p>\"Across the globe countries are tackling inflation, expensive remittances and financial exclusion. Digital currencies, in particular stablecoins, are being explored by private sector firms with the aim of solving these issues,\" says Christophe De Courson, chief executive of Olymp Capital, one of the earliest investment fund managers in Europe dedicated to the blockchain and digital asset class. \"It's becoming increasingly evident that they may succeed, as the [IMF] report correctly points out \"\" big tech firms and fintech startups are experts at delivering convenient, attractive, low-cost and trusted services to a large network of customers.\"</p><p>The banks knew it was coming, but thought they had a stranglehold on the fintech challenge, keeping an eye on them all, buying the best, dragging their heels to deliver a fast, low-cost domestic and especially cross-border payment mechanism to businesses and their customers.</p><p>\"Traditional finance, in particular, has become bloated, inefficient and inappropriately costly; and frankly it's time for a change,\" says Dave Hodgson, director and co-founder of NEM Ventures, the venture capital and investments arm of the NEM blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>\"Digital currencies allow for the efficient and cost-effective transfer of value between two parties, and aren't reliant on national borders. This makes them largely resilient to attempts at national control and manipulation, while also removing systemic inefficiencies within the current financial systems, namely with layers of intermediaries.</p><p>\"I can receive an Amazon parcel from the USA to Europe, faster than I can remit funds via Swift to pay for it; that's not good enough.\"</p><p>Now big tech has finally made its move.Warnings</p><p>Every week since the announcement there have been headlines warning of opposition to Libra from central banks, legislators, data regulators and competition authorities. And there are rumours that some of the 27 other companies Facebook persuaded to join it in the Libra Association \"\" including Visa and Mastercard, a clutch of tame NGOs, some venture capitalists and other networks like eBay, Uber and Spotify \"\" may be getting cold feet. As Euromoney went to press, it wasn't clear whether these founding members had progressed beyond signing letters of intent and putting down the $10 million table stakes to operate validator nodes on the Libra blockchain.</p><p>But with each knocking headline, instead of dying out, interest in the project only grows. How big could it be and how does it all play out from here?<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mark Carney,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bank of England</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Mark Carney must have surprised his peers at Jackson Hole in late August. When the Bank of England governor's turn finally came to speak on the chosen topic for the latest annual symposium of central bankers, the growing challenges for monetary policy, he actually had something to say.Most before him had discussed the now depressingly familiar limits on monetary policy to stimulate demand or boost inflation in a world of already low or negative policy rates and negative government bond yields. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell had further pointed out that the Fed simply has no tools to combat lower growth stemming from weak investment, thanks to rising trade uncertainties.This seemingly innocuous remark so enraged the initiator of those trade tensions that the man who appointed Powell promptly described the head of the Federal Reserve as one of America's greatest enemies. (US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin later had to explain that on this we should probably be taking president Trump seriously but not literally.)Rather than repeat the confessions of impotence, Carney offered some bigger ideas both about what has gone wrong with the international monetary and financial system and how eventually it should be rebuilt.His core observation, not an entirely original thought, is that the dominance of the US dollar \"\" as the currency in which a high proportion of trade is invoiced, in which central banks around the world hold reserve assets and in which companies borrow and institutions invest \"\" is a growing problem. Even though the US share of global GDP has declined in recent decades, the rising prominence of its currency is increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap and lowering the global equilibrium interest rate.As the old global order splinters and protectionism rises, each financial market panic leads to accumulation of safe haven assets in the dominant global currency. That contributes to central banks being powerless today.The primacy of the dollar also amplifies the speed and impact with which increasingly frequent convulsions in developed market economies transmit to emerging ones. The dollar is the currency of choice for at least half of international trade invoices, around five times greater than the US share of world goods imports and three times its share in world exports. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jerome Powell,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Federal Reserve</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>This dominance of the US dollar is surprising given the transformation of the global economy in recent decades. At the time of the Latin American debt crisis, Carney pointed out, emerging market economies made up a little more than a third of global GDP. Since the last Fed tightening cycle, their share of global activity had risen from around 45% to 60%. And by 2030, it is projected to rise to around three quarters.Yet increasing reliance on the US dollar means that developments in the US have significant spillovers into both the trade performance and the financial conditions of countries even with relatively limited direct exposure to the US economy.Greater currency diversification of the international monetary and financial system would be a benefit. However, transitions in the leading currencies for central bank reserves, trade invoicing and international capital markets are extremely rare.The only obvious potential challenger to the US dollar is the Chinese renminbi. China is the world's leading trading nation, overtaking the US at the start of this decade. This is just starting to appear in trade invoicing. The renminbi is now more common than sterling in oil future benchmarks, despite having no share in the market before 2018, said Carney. And the greater use of the renminbi in international trade is also leading to its growing use in international finance.But much remains to be done in the liberalization of foreign exchange and other controls for the Chinese currency to achieve the status of a leading store of value and a major reserve currency for other central banks. And this is where Carney gets really interesting.\"History shows that the rise of a reserve currency is founded on its usefulness as a medium of exchange, by reducing the cost and increasing the convenience of international payments,\" Carney said. \"The additional functions of money \"\" as a unit of account and store of wealth \"\" come later and reinforce the payments motive.\"And that brings us straight to digital e-money and the new cryptocurrencies.\"Technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency from being displaced,\" said Carney.He points out that the relatively high costs of domestic and cross-border electronic payments are encouraging innovation, with new entrants applying new technologies to offer lower-cost, more convenient retail payment services.\"The most high profile of these has been Libra \"\" a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro and sterling. It could be exchanged between users on messaging platforms and with participating retailers.\"Is the governor of the Bank of England now saying that the blockchain-based virtual currency that regulators and politicians have been attacking ever since Facebook first announced it in late June \"\" not a single of unit of which has yet changed hands and which won't launch before next year at the earliest \"\" could become a global reserve currency and challenge the mighty US dollar?Not quite so fast.\"There are a host of fundamental issues that Libra must address, ranging from privacy to AML/CFT [anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism] and operational resilience,\" said Carney. And there are good reasons why policymakers are on guard. \"In addition, depending on its design, it could have substantial implications for both monetary and financial stability.\" It is an open question whether such a new synthetic hegemonic currency would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Mark Carney, Bank of England The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear, Carney emphasized: \"That unlike in social media, for which standards and regulations are only now being developed after the technologies have been adopted by billions of users, the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch.\"As a consequence, it is an open question whether such a new synthetic hegemonic currency would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies.\"How could any human heart not thrill to the idea of a synthetic hegemonic currency, especially one in which world central banks cooperate?And this is the core of Carney's message: that even if it does not become a challenger to the US dollar itself, Facebook's Libra could perhaps be an inspiration or a model for central banks to work together on a new global reserve currency. One that might support better global outcomes than either the prevailing dependence on the US dollar or the risky transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the renminbi. Lightning rodIn one way Libra has already succeeded. Before it becomes a currency, Facebook's idea for a new global currency is right now a lightning rod, conducting the ambitious hopes of the cryptocurrency crowd and the heightened anxieties of regulators and central bankers around the world \"\" like nothing before it.Bitcoin they could not quite ignore but certainly ridicule and dismiss. It simply lacks the processing scale ever to replace conventional money and its brand has been poisoned by hacks of exchanges, association with illegal activity and lurching volatility. It may be a vehicle for speculative trading, as if another one were needed, but it is not a medium of exchange \"\" nobody uses it to buy stuff \"\" nor is it a unit of account or a particularly reliable store of value.Bitcoin has been running since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Eight years later, in 2017, a much-cited Cambridge University study suggested it had attracted between 2.9 million and 5.8 million active users.Facebook is only five years older than bitcoin. It was founded in 2004. At the end of June 2019, it had 2.41 billion monthly active users, of which 1.59 billion are on it every day. And there are 2.7 billion monthly users of all its services, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. Around 2.1 billion people use at least one of those every day. Libra will be made available across not just Facebook itself but those other apps. So, more than a quarter of the people on the planet may soon be just a couple of taps away from Libra at least once a day.   Source: Facebook As more and more human interaction and economic activity takes place online, Libra is a virtual currency designed to be a stable payment mechanism for use across platforms and apps.And if a significant portion of those 2.1 billion daily users are tempted by the promised ease of use of the Calibra wallet and the low cost of sending money across borders in seconds \"\" like sending a WhatsApp message or a photo \"\" then that changes the how money moves and even what money is. The banking system, as it stands today, is at risk.Only 10% of Facebook users are in the US and Canada, with another 16% in Europe. Fully 74% are either in Asia Pacific or the rest of the world, even if those regions for now account for just under 28% of Facebook revenues. Facebook's leaders are absolutely driven. They are on a mission to monetize these users in new ways.   Source: Facebook Euromoney talks to an old contact now working in a technology startup in Indonesia. \"What I see around me is that the people here pay for every day goods and services in one of two ways. They either use cash or they use digital cryptocurrency. As an expatriate arriving with my bank account set up and my credit cards, I'm feeling quite left behind.\"And while China won't allow Libra to flourish there for now, Hodgson at NEM Ventures points out: \"It's also worth noting that in Asia the concept of digital money is well established with services such as Alipay and WeChat.\"For now, the overwhelming majority of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising, particularly mobile advertising. But it is moving more directly into commerce and along with that into payments.It's not that Facebook's early claims for Libra as a way to help the financially excluded and the unbanked 31% of the world was pure hype. It may do that. But it obviously isn't the full story, as David Marcus, head of Calibra \"\" the Facebook subsidiary designing the new global cryptocurrency \"\" explained to the Senate banking committee.\"We expect that the Calibra wallet will be immediately beneficial to Facebook more broadly because it will allow many of the 90 million small and medium-sized businesses that use the Facebook platform to transact more directly with Facebook's many users, which we hope will result in consumers and businesses using Facebook more.\"That increased usage is likely to yield greater advertising revenue for Facebook.\"If customers browse the clothes and other products that influencers promote on Instagram, the next step for Facebook, after it has taken premium advertising revenue from those clothes stores and designers for highly-targeted ads, is to enable customers to buy on Instagram and to pay. In a way, Facebook wants to become Amazon.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mark Zuckerberg,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Mark Zuckerberg laid this out on Facebook's second quarter earnings call at the end of July. \"Instagram Shopping will improve the experience of browsing and shopping from your favorite brands and creators, while also giving emerging creators a powerful new way to build a business and sustain their community. Facebook Marketplace gives people a way to buy and sell goods in a trusted network with real identities. Hundreds of millions of people are already using Marketplace monthly.\"In Facebook Marketplace, the company is perhaps competing more with eBay. And it's not stopping there.\"We're also building ways for people to interact with businesses through messaging like WhatsApp Business,\" said Zuckerberg, \"because people don't like having to call businesses and would rather engage asynchronously over messaging if possible.\"Payments is not just the obvious next step, it is possibly the biggest step.\"When I look at the kinds of private interactions we can make easier, payments may be the most important for the long term,\" said Zuckerberg.The company continues to test payments on WhatsApp in India and is close to launching in other countries.\"We're very focused on payments with fiat currencies as well and making it so that when you pay in one service, whether it's WhatsApp or in Instagram Shopping or in Marketplace, your credentials can be shared and there's a shared payment system across all those things. So that's certainly a big area for investment,\" Zuckerberg explained.Facebook's reputation remains under a cloud thanks to previous privacy failures and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It recently announced a $5 billion civil penalty with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the largest ever imposed on a company anywhere for violating consumers' privacy and one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the US government for any violation.The order outlines a new system of independent control, multi-layer accountability and personal responsibility over Facebook's practices, and substantially limits Mark Zuckerberg's unfettered say in privacy decisions, according to the FTC. In fact, for the next 20 years, anytime Facebook makes a privacy decision, multiple independent watchdogs will be looking over its shoulder.\u00a0But for all that, the business is humming, with revenues 28% up on the second quarter in 2018.\"The platform remains highly valuable for users as they enjoy the many free services Facebook offers, like staying in touch with friends, finding communities with shared interests or starting a new business,\" says Christopher Rossbach, CIO of private investment firm J Stern &amp; Co. \"Payments could become a further growth initiative, creating another reason to login and interact with the Facebook family of apps. Facebook's huge addressable audience of 2.7 billion monthly active users across all its apps increases the potential for broad adoption for the cryptocurrency with the integration of Facebook's Calibra wallet into each of the apps.\" As large technology or financial firms could leverage vast existing customer bases to rapidly achieve a global footprint, it is imperative that authorities be vigilant in assessing risks and implications for the global financial system\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Mario Draghi, ECB What can the guardians of the old financial system do about this?Central banks used to be all powerful, particularly, it seemed, when they nursed the developed world through the worst of a recession caused by financial market collapses that nearly broke their excessively financialized economies. Today they bemoan the inability of monetary policy to drag economies towards self-sustaining growth.\"Today, the combination of heightened economic policy uncertainty, outright protectionism and concerns that further, negative shocks could not be adequately offset because of limited policy space is exacerbating the disinflationary bias in the global economy,\" said Carney.What comes next is further irrelevance if a large scale monetary system emerges that bypasses national currencies. And governments, too, worry about loss of power over the money their populations use.That is why, long before it even launches, Facebook's blockchain based cryptocurrency, which is to be fully backed by the Libra reserve of cash and equivalent high quality fiat-currency assets, has had regulators and legislators hyperventilating with anxiety.'National security issue'The day before David Marcus testified to Congress in July, US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, made it clear that: \"The Treasury department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers.\"Casting the Facebook project in with bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Mnuchin declared: \"This is indeed a national security issue.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mario Draghi,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ECB</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Pressed for his view on Libra one week later at the press conference after the ECB's governing council meeting in late July, president Mario Draghi said it didn't even come up but then unleashed a torrent of anxieties.\"On Libra, we didn't discuss that in this meeting of the Governing Council, but we did discuss this quite extensively in the G7. The bottom line of this discussion is that there is interest of course by the G7 governments, and I believe by all the governments in the world, for this development. But there was a pretty unanimous view that there are concerns as well as interest and we and they better first address the concerns. These concerns are concerns about cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, terrorism financing, use of these currencies for criminal purposes. All this is linked also to the anonymity. How would this work? At the same time, concerns about privacy. I mentioned cyber risks. Tax evasion, monetary policy transmission, financial stability and the global payment system. How would this change the global payment system?\"This is hand-wringing stuff.Thank goodness Draghi had managed to calm down later that day when he wrote to German MEP Markus Ferber, a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs. \"The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is closely monitoring innovation in the financial sector, including stablecoin projects such as Libra,\" Draghi assured Ferber, highlighting the G7 working group on stablecoins, chaired by ECB executive board member Beno\u00c3\u00aet C\u00c5\"ur\u00e9.\"As part of this group, the ESCB carries out a comprehensive assessment of the potential risks of stablecoin initiatives to financial stability, operational and cyber resilience as well as their potential impact on the tasks of central banks, including ensuring the safety and efficiency of payment systems and the smooth conduct of monetary policy\" wrote Draghi.He acknowledged Facebook's size \"\" its average monthly users compare to the US with a population of 327 million and the eurozone with a population of 341 million \"\" while attempting to assert some notional authority over its move into cryptocurrency.\"As large technology or financial firms could leverage vast existing customer bases to rapidly achieve a global footprint, it is imperative that authorities be vigilant in assessing risks and implications for the global financial system. Stablecoin initiatives must ensure public trust by meeting the highest regulatory standards and be subject to prudent supervision and oversight.\" I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0David Marcus, Calibra For his part, Mark Carney had already covered much the same ground when the Bank of England released its latest financial stability report in mid-July. But he was also honest enough to discuss why Libra, or something like it, might be needed and why the monetary system remains vulnerable to disruption because it serves people poorly.\"We've got to recognize that this is trying to solve a series of issues that exist in the system. It's way too expensive to do domestic payments. It's way too slow and that hurts consumers and businesses. It stifles innovation. And it's far too expensive to send money cross border and there are huge financial inclusion issues related to that and cost related to that. So, while we're trying to address all these issues we have to absolutely acknowledge the problem that they're trying to solve and if it's not this, we better have some answers for what else it is.\"It has always seemed to Euromoney that the likely outcome for Libra is binary. It either comes to nothing or it succeeds massively.Carney agrees. \"If it's successful it becomes systemic because it would involve a very large number of users,\" he said. \"And, you know, if you're a systemic payment system it's five sigma. You have to be on all the time. You can't have teething issues. You can't have people losing money out of their wallets.\"Euromoney read the Libra white paper and all the documents Facebook has published on the Libra reserve, the Libra blockchain and the Libra Association so that you don't have to. But we came away with far more big concepts than firm details of how it will work.While Libra will not run on any of the existing public blockchains, Facebook has said that in the long run, it hopes to open up the Libra blockchain as a permission-less one that anybody can participate in. It's hard to see how that can fly.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Steven Mnuchin,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">US Treasury</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Much has been made, not least by secretary Mnuchin, of regulators' opposition to anything like the anonymous or rather pseudonymous bitcoin blockchain.Mnuchin says the Treasury has made it clear to Facebook \"\" as well as to other providers of digital financial services \"\" that they must implement the same AML and CFT safeguards as traditional financial institutions and register with the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).For his part, David Marcus confirmed in his prepared testimony to Congress that the Libra Association will happily do this, although he seemed to be rather stretching his credibility with an initial appeal to patriotism. \"I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will,\" said Marcus, cheekily allowing the thought to hang in the air that an attack on Facebook is somehow an attack on America.He rather undermines this by explaining that the Libra Association will be headquartered in Geneva and so it will be supervised by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma), which is positioning itself to promote Switzerland as a crypto centre. But it will also register with FinCENWhen Calibra is available, Facebook has already told users they will need a government-issued ID to sign up for an account and that identity verification is important to both comply with laws and prevent fraud. Calibra's website explains in its frequently asked questions that: \"Facebook and WhatsApp account information are also used when available to verify identity and prevent fraud.\"Are all sides here performing a Kabuki dance? Regulators may be forcing Facebook to travel in exactly the direction it already wants to go.Euromoney has been debating with bank chief executives all year the question of who has the best and most valuable insights into consumer behaviours. Is it the social networks that can see what you're talking with friends and browsing on the internet? Or is it the banks that can see where you spend your money in increasing detail?New financial technology promises soon to break down not just what businesses bank customers have transferred payments to but also what individual items were in their shopping baskets. Knowing your customer is not the sole province of Facebook and Google. I would rather be JPMorgan. Banks know everything about what you do with money\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0John Reed, CaixaBank John Reed, former chief executive of Citigroup and today a director of Spain's CaixaBank, told Euromoney in June: \"Knowing your customer is not the sole province of Facebook and Google. I would rather be JPMorgan. Banks know everything about what you do with money, where it comes from, what you spend it on, your taxes. When I was running Citi, we didn't have artificial intelligence and machine learning, but we knew when people got paid, what they would spend. Sometimes we might know they were heading for divorce before they did, because we could see their partners going crazy on their credit cards. If you really want to know consumers, I would go through the financial door.\"With Libra, if regulators force Facebook to map users' payments activity against the identities already established on the social network and the company's other platforms, that potentially becomes a hugely powerful store of information for it to monetize, assuming of course that it seeks users' permission in compliance with new privacy laws.Recent experience teaches that most users will happily give up their data in return for convenience and are even impatient to do so.Facebook's paper on the Libra Reserve says that: \"Like many other blockchains, the ledger of transactions on the Libra Blockchain will be publicly accessible so that it is possible for third parties to do analysis to detect and penalize fraud.\"To penalize fraud, you have to be able to identify who commits it. Regulators may be shoving Facebook through a doorway it's desperate to cross. And to what other third parties might data go, assuming permission is properly obtained?ReputationFor now, even while growing numbers of users continue to populate its platforms, Facebook's reputation is low. It may be peanuts given the company's cash generation, but even if you can wear a $5 billion \"fine\" (Mark Zuckerberg's word) from the FTC, it still does not look good. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">David Marcus,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Calibra</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>When David Marcus appeared before congress, senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, went straight to what has always been the key point, which is not trust in cryptocurrency but rather trust in Facebook. \"Facebook has a long track record of abusing users' trust,\" he opened up. \"You know that Mr. Marcus. Until recently, you headed Facebook Messenger when you were allowing other companies access to read Facebook users' private messages.\"Do you really think people should trust Facebook with their hard-earned money?\"And here is one of the delicious ironies of the Libra project. Facebook apparently imagines that it can re-cast itself as gamekeeper instead of poacher. The Lbra White paper explains: \"An additional goal of the association is to develop and promote an open identity standard. We believe that decentralized and portable digital identity is a prerequisite to financial inclusion and competition.\"And of course, for anyone who can develop that and win widespread acceptance of it there will be a good financial return too.However, what most intrigues Euromoney is the Libra reserve. It is this that underpins the notion of a new and stable global digital currency and gives it, unlike bitcoin, an intrinsic value from day one. Facebook, or strictly speaking its Calibra subsidiary, has made clear that the reserve will invest in a collection of low-volatility assets, including bank deposits and short-dated government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.Just for a moment, let's wonder who inside the Libra Association gets to adjudicate which central banks are reputable and stable, while central banks and regulators make their pronouncements on Libra. Could Mark himself have a say?As the value of Libra will be effectively linked to this basket of fiat currencies, there will be fluctuations in the value of Libra against any user's native currency. It's not clear whether the reserve basket will be constructed using a global GDP weighting, some other criteria or simply be based on the accumulation of fiat cash deposited by users switching out of their home currencies.That last doesn't look like a good way to construct the basket, especially if most early adopters of Libra are based in emerging markets potentially subject to heightened currency volatility.PrecedentsThere are precedents here. The so-called world currency unit (Wocu), based on the idea of the European currency unit, is a notional synthetic basket licensed by a London-based fintech and used by international investors to benchmark and hedge exposures. It is made up from a GDP-weighted basket of the currencies of the 20 largest national economies as ranked by the IMF.After its most recent re-weighting in May, the leading currencies comprising the Wocu were the US dollar (30%), Chinese renminbi (20%), Japanese yen (7%) with the euro making up 16% reflecting the combined economies of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands in the global top 20. Sterling accounts for 4%, the same proportion as India.Rather than laying out parameters for a GDP-weighted basket, Facebook has only said that the makeup of the Libra reserve is designed to mitigate the likelihood and severity of fluctuations, and that it will be structured with liquidity as well as capital preservation in mind.It is not clear who within the Libra Association will manage the reserve or whether management may be outsourced. But the Libra Association has said it will only invest in debt from stable governments, with a low default probability, that are unlikely to experience high inflation. The association plans to rely on short-dated securities issued by these governments that are all traded in liquid markets regularly accommodating daily trading volume measured in the tens or even hundreds of billions.This will be important if the new currency achieves large scale because it will allow the size of the underlying reserve to be easily adjusted as the number of Libra in circulation expands or contracts.Calibra says the reserve will not conduct its own monetary policy but rather simply mint and burn Libra in response to supply and demand as users exchange into and out of fiat currency. It invites comparison with a classic monetary board, such as that in Hong Kong.Users will not directly interact with the reserve itself but rather with authorized resellers, who will be the only entities authorized by the association to transact large amounts of fiat and Libra in and out of the reserve. These authorized resellers will integrate with exchanges and other institutions that buy and sell cryptocurrencies with users, and will provide these entities with liquidity for users who wish to convert from cash to Libra and back again. Regulators are scrutinizing Libra and other cryptocurrencies and expressing significant concerns\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Christopher Pallotta, Templum Could these resellers one day become banks? Could they lend Libra to users? It's not at all clear.Established stablecoins, such as those linked to the US dollar and that claim to be backed one-to-one by an actual reserve of underlying fiat currency, have faced suspicions that they are only fractionally backed if they do not disclose the banks where these reserves are deposited. Calibra has only said that it will use a geographically distributed network of custodians with investment grade credit ratings to limit counterparty risk while avoiding the risks of a centralized reserve.Presumably these custodians will be banks, although Calibra has not confirmed that.One thing that it has made clear, however, is that users of Libra that might forego interest on fiat cash exchanged into the cryptocurrency will not receive any income from the Libra reserve. The reserve will earn income of course, but that income will go first to members of the Libra Association to pay operating expenses, which will no doubt include incentives to merchants and users to promote adoption.How the Libra reserve works matters a lot. It looks like a money market fund with a variable net asset value and even though holders of Libra coins won't be earning any yield, they will be exposed to possible loss or gain when they exchange from Libra back into their native currency, assuming that Libra itself does not quickly become a universally accepted currency.There is a notion abroad that securities regulators, having warned investors that most initial coin offerings were Ponzi schemes, are now embracing security tokens in expectation that conventional securities markets may come to run on distributed ledger technology, with increasing tokenization of equity, debt and other investments beyond currencies and commodities. Rather than fight the trend, securities regulators want to establish the fact that they have authority over anything that walks, talks and looks like a security.James Kaufmann, a partner at law firm Howard Kennedy, says: \"It is likely that Facebook's announcement to launch its Libra digital coin has added pressure to financial regulators at an international level to clarify their thinking on this subject.\"Banking regulatorsThere is a popular notion that banking regulators are going to be tough on Libra even while securities regulators smooth the way for blockchain-based new issues and trading. Christopher Pallotta, chief executive of Templum, a fintech focused on development of market infrastructure for so-called smart securities, sees a line being drawn in recent weeks.\"Regulators are scrutinizing Libra and other cryptocurrencies and expressing significant concerns. On the other hand, regulators have taken a more balanced approach with respect to acknowledging the potential promise of digital securities,\" says Pallotta. \"With Libra, regulators are swinging a heavy hand and are seen as a barrier to product development. With digital securities, the talk is much more cooperative.\"But that's not how it may work out. If Libra comes to be treated as a tokenized security representing ownership of a money market fund, that could set the project back. Banking regulators may look like they're being tough, but they are doing exactly what Facebook wants. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mike Corbat,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Citi</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Banks had better wake up fast.

It announced JPM Coin, its US dollar stablecoin secured against client deposits, back in February.\"We've been talking about blockchain for seven years and very little has happened, and you're going to be talking about Libra three years from now,\" chief executive Jamie Dimon told analysts on JPMorgan's second-quarter earnings call. \"I wouldn't spend too much time on it.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jamie Dimon,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">JPMorgan</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Dimon set out the message US policymakers and global regulators appear already to have received loud and clear. \"We don't mind competition and the request is always going to be the same \"\" you need one level playing field, and governments are going to insist that people who hold money or move money all live according to rules where they have the right controls in place.\"</p><p>Almost as calm as Jamie Dimon is Mark Zuckerberg.

It was September 2017, more than a year after Facebook engineers discovered suspicious       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Russia</url>-linked activity on its site, an early warning of the Kremlin campaign to disrupt the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">2016 US election</url>. Congressional and federal investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it was not the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms Sandberg. It was the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr Stamos' briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read more</p><p>Facebook and Twitter executives grilled in hearings before US Congress</p><p>\"You threw us under the bus!\" she yelled at Mr Stamos, according to people who were present.</p><p>The clash that day would set off a reckoning - for Mr Zuckerberg, for Ms Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.</p><p>But as evidence accumulated that Facebook's power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.</p><p>When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">President Donald Trump</url>, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.</p><p>And when that failed - as the company's stock price plummeted and sparked a consumer backlash - Facebook went on the attack.</p><p>While Mr Zuckerberg conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook's critics, shift public anger towards rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Republican</url> opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to liberal financier       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">George Soros</url>. It also tapped its business relationships, persuading a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">antisemitic</url>.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Washington</url>, allies of Facebook, including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Senator Chuck Schumer</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Democratic</url> Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook's reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.</p><p>This account of how Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg navigated Facebook's cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorised to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.</p><p>Facebook declined to make Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson acknowledged Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.</p><p>\"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\" the statement said. \"While these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\"</p><p>Even so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook's conduct with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Cambridge Analytica</url>, a political data firm that worked with Mr Trump's 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a years-long struggle over the future of Facebook's data-hungry business model.</p><p>\"We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\" Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg, 34, and Ms Sandberg, 49, remain at the company's helm, while Mr Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook's priorities. Mr Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 per cent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.</p><p>His answer each time: a resounding \"No.\"</p><p>Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg responds to Cambridge </p><p>Analytica</p><p> scandal: 'we have the responsibility to treat people's data carefully'</p><p>'Don't Poke the Bear'</p><p>Three years ago, Mr Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Harvard</url>, was celebrated for the company's extraordinary success. Ms Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Google</url> veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \"Lean In\", in 2013.</p><p>Like other technology executives, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook's lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \"Our mission is to make the world more open and connected.\"</p><p>But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried any such efforts would backfire.</p><p>Then Mr Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on Muslims entering the United States. Mr Trump's call to arms - widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans - was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site's power to spread racist sentiment.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg, who had helped found a non-profit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms Sandberg and other executives if Mr Trump had violated Facebook's terms of service.</p><p>The question was unusual. Mr Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms Sandberg's domain. In 2010, Ms Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook's chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms Sandberg and later served in the George W Bush administration.</p><p>Some at Facebook viewed Mr Trump's 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform. But Ms Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Mr Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Ms Sandberg had recruited as the company's head of global policy. Ms Sandberg also turned to the Washington office - particularly to Mr Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.</p><p>In video conference calls between the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Silicon Valley</url> headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company's terms of service to see if the post, or Mr Trump's account, violated Facebook's rules.</p><p>Mr Kaplan argued Mr Trump was an important public figure and shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He also said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.</p><p>\"Don't poke the bear,\" Mr Kaplan warned.</p><p>Minimising Russia's Role</p><p>In the final months of Mr Trump's presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a year-long effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.</p><p>Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyber-warfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr Stamos.</p><p>Mr Stamos' team discovered Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr Trump battled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Hillary Clinton</url> in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.</p><p>Mr Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.</p><p>Mr Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinise the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr Trump, Mr Stamos - alarmed that the company's chief executive seemed unaware of his team's findings - met with Mr Zuckerberg, Ms Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.</p><p>Ms Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr Stamos why they had not been told sooner.</p><p>Still, Ms Sandberg and Mr Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr Stamos' work, creating a group called Project P, for \"propaganda\", to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew Mr Stamos' original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.</p><p>But Mr Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by US intelligence agencies that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Vladimir Putin</url>, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr Trump.</p><p>If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians' fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.</p><p>Ms Sandberg sided with Mr Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr Zuckerberg - who spent much of 2017 on a national \"listening tour,\" feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota - did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was published that April, the word \"Russia\" never appeared.</p><p>Ms Sandberg's subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, R-NC, and Mark Warner, D-Va. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators' concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.</p><p>But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded the situation had become what one called a \"five-alarm fire,\" said a person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings and laid plans to release a blog post on 6 September 2017, the day of the company's quarterly board meeting.</p><p>After Mr Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr Zuckerberg also asked Mr Stamos and Mr Stretch to brief the board's audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.</p><p>Mr Stretch and Mr Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.</p><p>The disclosures set off Mr Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.</p><p>When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company's headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr Bowles pelted questions at Facebook's founder and second-in-command. Ms Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologised. Mr Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.</p><p>Later that day, the company's abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 - a relatively tiny sum - on approximately 3,000 ads.</p><p>Just one day after the company's carefully sculpted admission, </p><p>The Times</p><p> published an investigation of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.</p><p>A Political Playbook</p><p>The combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans, already concerned the platform was censoring conservative views, accused Facebook of fuelling what they claimed were merit-less conspiracy charges against Mr Trump and Russia. Democrats, long-allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Mr Trump's win partly on Facebook's tolerance for fraud and disinformation.</p><p>After stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.</p><p>The same month, Mr Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites - a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.</p><p>\"It's time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\" Ms Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.</p><p>Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr Warner's former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr Kaplan's team took a larger role in managing the company's Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.</p><p>Ms Sandberg also reached out to Ms Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms Sandberg's empowerment initiative. Ms Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms Klobuchar's 2015 memoir and the senator's chief of staff had previously worked at Ms Sandberg's charitable foundation.</p><p>But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms Sandberg complained about Ms Klobuchar's attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialled down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that autumn on her own Facebook page, Ms Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ms Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook's lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \"Facebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\" he said.</p><p>In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, which had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialised in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations - an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.</p><p>Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesperson for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that's being pushed out about your competitor.\"</p><p>Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favour of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.</p><p>Opposition Research</p><p>In March, </p><p>The Times </p><p>and </p><p>The Observer/Guardian</p><p> prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, </p><p>The Times </p><p>presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.</p><p>They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.</p><p>\"We're not going to traffic in your personal life,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Tim Cook</url>, Apple's chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \"Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty.\" (Mr Cook's criticisms infuriated Mr Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple's.)</p><p>Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \"We Get It\", meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.</p><p>Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr Kaplan prevailed on Ms Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company's US lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.</p><p>In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \"Here Together\", to apologise to its users. Days before Mr Zuckerberg's appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced it was endorsing Ms Klobuchar's Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>But Mr Zuckerberg's goodwill tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company's communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic - a suspicion confirmed by Facebook's pollsters.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg's political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Representative Greg Walden, R-Ore, who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.</p><p>Mr Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook's leader, Mr Walden realised, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.</p><p>Personal Appeals in Washington</p><p>Ms Sandberg had said little publicly about the company's problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.</p><p>Some colleagues believed Ms Sandberg - whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company - was protecting her own brand at Facebook's expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.</p><p>Billionaire investor George </p><p>Soros</p><p> calls more stringent regulations for monopolies like Google and Facebook</p><p>So Ms Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company's Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish Mr Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage sceptical Republicans, who grumbled Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its workforce than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.</p><p>Facebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after </p><p>The Times</p><p> reported on Facebook's previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers - partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers - executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.</p><p>In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.</p><p>Deflecting Criticism</p><p>By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.</p><p>In July, organisers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organisers held aloft signs depicting Ms Sandberg and Mr Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Anti-Defamation League</url>, a leading Jewish civil rights organisation, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat antisemitism and hate speech online.</p><p>That afternoon, the ADL issued a warning from its Twitter account.</p><p>\"Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic antisemitic trope,\" the organisation wrote. \"Protest Facebook - or anyone - all you want, but pick a different image.\" The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \"extreme anti-Israel groups.\"</p><p>An ADL spokesperson, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of antisemitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \"Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\" Ms Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticised Facebook, including when Mr Zuckerberg suggested his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)</p><p>Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr Soros, a long-time bogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense antisemitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.</p><p>He was a natural target. In a speech at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">World Economic Forum</url> in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \"menace\" with \"neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\"</p><p>Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr Soros' family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Colour of Change, an online racial justice organisation, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr Soros' son. The research documents also highlighted those groups' unrelated criticisms of Mr Trump. (Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.)</p><p>In at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long-worked to advance Silicon Valley's interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Mr Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook's New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>In July, as Facebook's troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr Schumer confronted Mr Warner, by then Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress.</p><p>Back off, he told Mr Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr Schumer's intervention. Mr Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr Schumer's efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.</p><p>Mr Schumer declined to comment on the conversation. A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said Mr Schumer had not wanted Mr Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.</p><p>The War Room</p><p>One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook's Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.</p><p>But Ms Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee - a pivotal encounter for her embattled company - and her aides were taking no chances.</p><p>Inside the room, they laboured to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialised in training corporate executives.</p><p>Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr Burr, who was determined to avoid a circus-like atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Facebook blocks 115 accounts ahead of US midterm elections</p><p>Trump defends 'racist' campaign ad as networks pull it off air</p><p>Facebook and Instagram ban Proud Boys groups for 'organised hate'</p><p>Why has Facebook hired Nick Clegg?</p><p>Facebook employee group criticises its 'intolerant' liberal culture </p><p>In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labelled \"Google.\" Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr Burr announced that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Larry Page</url>, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sheryl-sandberg\">Jack Dorsey</url>, Twitter's chief executive.</p><p>Mr Dorsey showed up. Mr Page did not.</p><p>As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook's rival.</p><p>Ms Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.</p><p>In large letters were her stage directions: \"Slow, Pause, Determined.\"</p><p>The New York Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-49236714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRF-3M51-F021-61JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5040\"/><timeReceived>9:53 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>campaign declined to embed the companies' employees in her operations, instead opting to develop its own digital apparatus and call in the tech firms to help execute elements of its strategy.</p><p>\"<person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Twitter, and Google [went] beyond promoting their services and facilitating digital advertising buys,\" the paper concludes, adding that their efforts extended to \"actively shaping campaign communications through their close collaboration with political staffers.\"</p><p>\"The extent to which they were helping candidates online was a surprise to us,\" said co-author Daniel Kreiss, from UNC Chapel Hill. He called the assistance \"a form of subsidy from technology firms to political candidates.\"</p><p>The study was published Thursday in the journal Political Communication.</p><p>Kreiss and the University of Utah's Shannon McGregor interviewed tech company liaisons to the <person><nameText>Trump and Clinton </nameText></person>operations as well as officials from a range of campaigns, including those of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sens. Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.</p><p>The researchers' findings add to the many questions surrounding the part that the country's biggest tech companies played in the 2016 election. <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google and Twitter already face heavy criticism for allowing the spread of disinformation, \"fake news\" and divisive advertising during the campaign - much of which targeted Clinton. All three companies are set to testify at congressional hearings beginning next week on Russian use of their platforms to interfere with the election.</p><p>The idea that the tech companies were so deeply enmeshed in the efforts to elect Trump in particular could also complicate the companies' reputations as political actors. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>CEO Mark Zuckerberg is among those in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley who have roundly condemned Trump's actions as president on topics like LGBT issues and immigration.</p><p>As Trump emerged as the likely Republican nominee, staffers from each of the three companies set up shop in a strip-mall office rented by the Trump campaign in San Antonio, Texas, home to the campaign's lead digital strategist, Brad Parscale, the study reports. It attributes that information to Nu Wexler, a Twitter communications official at the time, who is explicit about the value of the arrangement for Trump.</p><p>\"One, they found that they were getting solid advice, and two, it's cheaper. It's free labor,\" Wexler said in the study.</p><p>While the paper does not detail the specific tasks <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>carried out for Trump, it describes the sort of work the company did generally for 2016 candidates, including coordinating so-called dark posts that would appear only to selected users and identifying the kinds of photos that perform best on <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>-owned Instagram. Twitter, meanwhile, would help candidates analyze the performances of their tweet-based fundraising pushes to recommend what moves the campaigns should make next. Google kept tabs on candidates' travels to recommend geographically targeted advertisements. </p><p>Digital experts interviewed by the researchers concluded that the tech company employees, who would work in San Antonio for days at a time, helped Trump close his staffing gap with Clinton. </p><p>The White House referred questions to the Trump campaign, and Parscale did not respond to requests for comment. Parscale said in an Oct. 8 episode of \"60 Minutes\" that he actively solicited the companies' support, saying that he told them: \"I wanna know everything you would tell Hillary's campaign plus some. And I want your people here to teach me how to use it.\" </p><p>A source close to the Clinton campaign rejected the notion that her team failed to take advantage of a valuable resource, arguing that her operation was in regular contact with the tech companies to tap their expertise. The source, who would only speak anonymously because of the sensitivity around attributing causes of Clinton's defeat, said there would have been no advantage to having tech company employees sitting at desks at Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters.</p><p>One unnamed tech company staffer is quoted in the study as saying, \"Clinton viewed us as vendors rather than consultants.\"</p><p>Asked about the arrangement with Trump, the tech companies were quick to point out that they make their services available to all political players regardless of party. </p><p>\"<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>offers identical levels of support to candidates and campaigns across the political spectrum, whether by <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>politics and government or ad sales teams,\" a spokesperson for the social network said in a statement. </p><p>That sentiment was echoed by Twitter, which said it offered help to both the Clinton and Trump campaigns, and by Google, which stressed that it is up to each candidate to determine how extensively to work with the company. During the primary season, Google made available to each candidate an eight-hour session with the company's creative teams, but only Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul's campaign took them up on it, according to the study.</p><p>But at least one tech veteran said he can see how it would raise alarms that the bulk of Silicon Valley's hands-on campaign support went to Trump rather than to Clinton.</p><p>\"It can be confusing from the outside looking in when it appears one campaign or another is getting more support,\" Adam Sharp, a former Twitter executive who led the company's elections team from 2010 to 2016, said in an interview. But while the companies strive to be balanced, they cannot inform voters \"when a candidate doesn't heed the help,\" he said.</p><p>An intimate relationship between tech companies and candidates has considerable upside for both. The campaign gets high-quality advice and advance notice on cutting-edge products. The company gets national exposure for its products and builds relationships with politicians who might be in a position to regulate it once they get to Washington. </p><p>Silicon Valley had additional considerations during the 2016 campaign. The big tech companies were eager to fight the perception they were unfair to conservatives - and few in the liberal-leaning industry expected Trump to win, with or without their assistance.</p><p>Kreiss and McGregor recount one interview in which a pair of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>reps struggled to come up with a shorthand way of describing the support they provide candidates. Katie Harbath, head of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>elections team, suggested \"customer service plus.\" Ali-Jae Henke, who as an account executive at Google worked with Republican campaigns, including Trump's, described the role as \"serving in an advisory capacity.\"</p><p>The history of the tech companies' campaign outreach dates back to the 2008 presidential contest. That year, Randi Zuckerberg, sister of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>CEO, traveled to both the Democratic and Republican conventions to pitch the political utility of the then-4-year-old social network. Around that same time, the company began offering congressional offices one-on-one guidance on how to use <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person></p><p>The outreach didn't always work at first. \"I was, like, begging people to meet with us,\" Randi Zuckerberg said of the GOP's 2008 convention. But as political spending on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>ad products and elected leaders' dependence on the platform skyrocketed over the years, so too did the company's close work with politicians.</p><p>One constant in the dynamic: The companies break down their political outreach teams along party lines. <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>point of contact to Clinton's 2016 White House run, Crystal Patterson, was a veteran of Democratic politics, and Henke - Google's liaison to the Trump operation and other 2016 Republican bids - was once the director of operations for the Western Republican Leadership Conference. </p><p>That partisan matching is needed, company representatives say, to allow all involved to speak freely when providing advice. Caroline McCain, social media manager for Rubio's White House bid, is quoted in the paper saying that when tech company staffers have a similar political background as the campaign they're assigned to, it raises the campaign's comfort level in working with them. </p><p>\"When you realize, 'Oh yeah, the person I'm working with at Google, they actually worked on Romney back in 2012,' like, 'Oh, okay, they actually might have our best interest at heart,'\" McCain said. After the campaign, McCain took a position at <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>Kreiss, the paper's co-author, said the symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and political campaigns demands further examination.</p><p>\"It raises the larger question of what should be the transparency around this, given that it's taking place in the context of a democratic election,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-244195</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PTH-3311-F118-924T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1697\"/><timeReceived>11:28 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 26, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Elizabeth Warren has called for the breakup of big tech companies like Facebook. Regulators have opened investigations into Facebook's power in social networking. Even one of Facebook's own founders has laid out a case for why the company needs to be split up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the world's biggest social network has started to modify its behavior \u2014 in both preemptive and defensive ways \u2014 to deal with those threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Late last year, Facebook halted acquisition talks with Houseparty, a video-focused social network in San Francisco, for fear of inciting antitrust concerns, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Acquiring another social network after Facebook was already such a dominant player in that market was too risky, said the people, who spoke on the condition they not be identified because the discussions were confidential.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook has also begun internal changes that make itself harder to break up. The company has been knitting together the messaging systems of Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and has reorganized the departments so that Facebook is more clearly in charge, said two people briefed on the matter. Executives have also worked on rebranding Instagram and WhatsApp to more prominently associate them with Facebook.</p><p> The changes are now prompting a debate about whether a more knitted-together Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram is just smart business or helps strengthen potential anti-competitive practices. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said his company faces competition on all sides and is loath to accept a fragmented version of the social giant. He does not want to lose Instagram and WhatsApp, which are enormous and have the ability to continue fueling the Menlo Park company's $56 billion business.</p><p> \"The big question is, is this a logical business plan?\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in the Obama administration and senior adviser to Public Knowledge, a nonprofit think tank in Washington. \"For a social network with enormous growth in photos and messaging, there's probably significant business justification for combining the units.\"</p><p> But Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said Facebook's moves needed to be scrutinized.</p><p> \"The combination of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp into the single largest communications platform in history is a clear attempt to evade effective antitrust enforcement by making it harder for the company to be broken up,\" he said. \"We need to hit the pause button.\"</p><p>Facebook has pushed back on the idea that the company's moves \u2014 particularly in private messaging \u2014 are in anticipation of a potential breakup.</p><p> \"Building more ways for people to communicate through our messaging apps has always been about creating benefits for people \u2014 plain and simple,\" said Stan Chudnovsky, a vice president at Facebook overseeing messaging. \"People want to be able to reach as many people as they can with the messaging app they choose.\"</p><p> In Washington, Facebook has its eye particularly on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is now investigating it for anti-competitive practices, said two of the people with knowledge of the social network.</p><p> The FTC became interested in looking at Facebook and its power last year when the agency's investigators were separately examining the company for privacy violations, said two people close to the process. At the time, the FTC's investigators uncovered internal Facebook documents that prompted concerns around how the company was acquiring rivals, they said.</p><p>Facebook's long string of acquisitions \u2014 it bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, among many others \u2014 have been targeted by academics and policymakers for reducing competition. They have argued that the company engaged in \"serial defensive acquisitions\" to protect its dominant position in social networking.</p><p> This year, the FTC sought clearance from the Justice Department to open an antitrust investigation into potentially anti-competitive behavior at Facebook, the people close to the process said. The FTC was cleared to do so, and notified Facebook in June. By late July, the agency had contacted at least a half-dozen founders of companies that Facebook had bought over the past 15 years for information on its acquisition practices, said four people with knowledge of the outreach.</p><p> Around the time that the FTC activity on Facebook increased, the company also stepped back on at least one potential acquisition.</p><p> In December, Facebook executives were in advanced discussions to buy Houseparty, a social networking app that lets multiple people video chat on their mobile phones at once, said two people with knowledge of the talks. Houseparty, founded in 2016 by Ben Rubin, was especially popular with audiences under the age of 24. Facebook, whose members are getting older, has coveted younger users.</p><p> But weeks into the discussions, Facebook's corporate development team killed the talks with Houseparty, the people said. Houseparty's executives were told that a deal would draw unwelcome federal government scrutiny to Facebook, they said. Houseparty was later purchased by Epic Games, the makers of \"Fortnite.\"</p><p>Facebook's changes that appear to make a breakup of its apps more difficult began more than a year ago. Zuckerberg focused on combining the underlying infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger. The project, called \"interoperability,\" requires years of deeply technical and difficult engineering work.</p><p> The aim, in part, was to create less of a hodgepodge of companies and more of a unified network, said people briefed on the strategy. Publicly, Zuckerberg has said the initiative will help build a more \"private\" version of Facebook so customers can \"communicate across networks easily and securely,\" as users flock to messaging services en masse. People will also get a better and more streamlined user experience, he has said. Zuckerberg has added that a unified messaging system would better lend itself to moneymaking efforts on WhatsApp, which today brings in little revenue.</p><p> But the idea of \"interoperability\" was a departure for Facebook. Though Facebook and Instagram have long shared much of the same infrastructure, its different messaging products generally operated independently.</p><p> Though employees at Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are in separate physical buildings, executives have also pushed for them to share more internal resources and have reorganized their reporting lines. In one instance, Facebook executives ordered a change in the messaging teams, two of the people said, requiring the Instagram messenger division to report to the leaders at Facebook's Messenger app. Bloomberg earlier reported on the internal reorganization.</p><p> Last year, Facebook also began a rebranding project, tapping at least one outside agency for help, said three people familiar with the initiative. The agency, Prophet Brand Strategy, was asked to make Facebook into a \"branded house,\" where Facebook's moniker always preceded the names of WhatsApp and Instagram, they said. The mandate came from Zuckerberg and Antonio Lucio, Facebook's chief marketing officer, they said.</p><p> In March, Jane Manchun Wong, an independent security researcher, spotted the new branding \u2014 \"Instagram from Facebook\" \u2014 in some unreleased lines of code.</p><p> Employees at both Instagram and WhatsApp, who have been accustomed to greater autonomy, have chafed at the coming changes, said three people familiar with the divisions.</p><p> In hindsight, Facebook had quietly signaled that unification was afoot more than a year ago. In June 2018, the company introduced a combined metric that drew attention away from any individual product.

Regulators have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">opened investigations</url> into Facebook\u2019s power in social networking. Even one of Facebook\u2019s own founders has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">laid out a case</url> for why the company needs to be split up.</p><p>Now the world\u2019s biggest social network has started to modify its behavior \u2014 in both pre-emptive and defensive ways \u2014 to deal with those threats.</p><p>Late last year, Facebook halted acquisition talks with Houseparty, a video-focused social network in Silicon Valley, for fear of inciting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">antitrust</url> concerns, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Acquiring another social network after Facebook was already such a dominant player in that market was too risky, said the people, who spoke on the condition they not be identified because the discussions were confidential.</p><p>Facebook has also begun internal changes that make itself harder to break up. The company has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">knitting together the messaging systems</url> of Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and has reorganized the departments so that Facebook is more clearly in charge, said two people briefed on the matter. Executives have also worked on rebranding Instagram and WhatsApp to more prominently associate them with Facebook.</p><p>The social network\u2019s changes are now prompting a debate about whether a more knitted-together Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram is just smart business or helps strengthen potential anticompetitive practices. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has repeatedly said his company faces competition on all sides and is loath to accept a fragmented version of the social giant. He does not want to lose Instagram and WhatsApp, which are enormous and have the ability to continue fueling Facebook\u2019s $56 billion business.</p><p>\u201cThe big question is, is this a logical business plan?\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in the Obama administration and senior adviser to Public Knowledge, a nonprofit think tank in Washington. \u201cFor a social network with enormous growth in photos and messaging, there\u2019s probably significant business justification for combining the units.\u201d</p><p>But Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said Facebook\u2019s moves needed to be scrutinized.</p><p>\u201cThe combination of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp into the single largest communications platform in history is a clear attempt to evade effective antitrust enforcement by making it harder for the company to be broken up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to hit the pause button.\u201d</p><p>Facebook has pushed back on the idea that the company\u2019s moves \u2014 particularly in private messaging \u2014 are in anticipation of a potential breakup.</p><p>\u201cBuilding more ways for people to communicate through our messaging apps has always been about creating benefits for people \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d said Stan Chudnovsky, a vice president at Facebook overseeing messaging. \u201cPeople want to be able to reach as many people as they can with the messaging app they choose.\u201d</p><p>In Washington, Facebook has its eye particularly on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is now investigating it for anticompetitive practices, said two of the people with knowledge of the social network.</p><p>The F.T.C. became interested in looking at Facebook and its power last year when the agency\u2019s investigators were separately <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">examining the company for privacy violations</url>, said two people close to the process. At the time, the F.T.C.\u2019s investigators uncovered internal Facebook documents that prompted concerns around how the company was acquiring rivals, they said.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s long string of acquisitions \u2014 it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">bought Instagram</url> in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, among many others \u2014 have been targeted by academics and policymakers for reducing competition. They have argued that the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">engaged in \u201cserial defensive acquisitions\u201d</url> to protect its dominant position in social networking.</p><p>This year, the F.T.C. sought clearance from the Justice Department to open an antitrust investigation into potentially anticompetitive behavior at Facebook, the people close to the process said. The F.T.C. was cleared to do so, and notified Facebook in June. By late July, the agency had contacted at least a half-dozen founders of companies that Facebook had bought over the past 15 years for information on its acquisition practices, said four people with knowledge of the outreach.</p><p>Around the time that the F.T.C. activity on Facebook ramped up, the company also stepped back on at least one potential acquisition.</p><p>Last December, Facebook executives were in advanced discussions to buy Houseparty, a social networking app that lets multiple people video chat on their mobile phones at once, said two people with knowledge of the talks. Houseparty, co-founded in 2016 by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Ben Rubin and Sima Sistani, was especially popular with audiences <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">under the age of 24</url>. Facebook, whose members are getting older, has coveted younger users.</p><p>But weeks into the discussions, Facebook\u2019s corporate development team killed the talks with Houseparty, the people said. Houseparty\u2019s executives were told that a deal would draw unwelcome federal government scrutiny to Facebook, they said. Houseparty was later <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">purchased by Epic Games</url>, the makers of the video game Fortnite.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s changes that appear to make a breakup of its apps more difficult began more than a year ago. Mr. Zuckerberg focused on combining the underlying infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger. The project, called \u201cinteroperability,\u201d requires years of deeply technical and difficult engineering work.</p><p>The aim, in part, was to create less of a hodgepodge of companies and more of a unified network, said people briefed on the strategy. Publicly, Mr. Zuckerberg has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">said the initiative</url> will help build a more \u201cprivate\u201d version of Facebook so customers can \u201ccommunicate across networks easily and securely,\u201d as users flock to messaging services en masse. People will also get a better and more streamlined user experience, he has said. Mr. Zuckerberg has added that a unified messaging system would better lend itself to moneymaking efforts on WhatsApp, which today brings in little revenue.</p><p>But the idea of \u201cinteroperability\u201d was a departure for Facebook. While Facebook and Instagram have long shared much of the same infrastructure, its different messaging products generally operated independently.</p><p>Though employees at Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are in separate physical buildings, executives have also pushed for them to share more internal resources and have reorganized their reporting lines. In one instance, Facebook executives ordered a change in the messaging teams, two of the people said, requiring the Instagram messenger division to report to the leaders at Facebook\u2019s Messenger app. Bloomberg earlier <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">reported</url> on the internal reorganization.</p><p>Last year, Facebook also began a rebranding project, tapping at least one outside agency for help, said three people familiar with the initiative. The agency, Prophet Brand Strategy, was asked to make Facebook into a \u201cbranded house,\u201d where Facebook\u2019s moniker always preceded the names of WhatsApp and Instagram, they said. The rebranding mandate came from Mr. Zuckerberg and Antonio Lucio, Facebook\u2019s chief marketing officer, they said.</p><p>In March, Jane Manchun Wong, an independent security researcher, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">spotted the new branding</url> \u201cInstagram from Facebook\u201d \u2014 in some unreleased lines of code.</p><p>Employees at both Instagram and WhatsApp, who have been accustomed to greater autonomy, have chafed at the coming <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">changes</url>, said three people familiar with the divisions.</p><p>In hindsight, Facebook had quietly signaled that unification was afoot more than a year ago. In June 2018, the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html\">introduced a combined metric</url> that drew attention away from any individual product. It tallied the number of people who used one or more of any of Facebook\u2019s services, including WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>The name of the new metric? Facebook\u2019s Family of apps.</p><p>Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter: @MikeIsaac. </p><p>PHOTO: Late last year, Facebook out of fear halted acquisition talks with Houseparty, a video-focused social network founded in 2016 by Ben Rubin, above.

Regulators have opened investigations into Facebook's power in social networking. Even one of Facebook's own founders has laid out a case for why the company needs to be split up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the world's biggest social network has started to modify its behavior - in both pre-emptive and defensive ways - to deal with those threats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Late last year, Facebook halted acquisition talks with Houseparty, a video-focused social network in Silicon Valley, for fear of inciting antitrust concerns, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Acquiring another social network after Facebook was already such a dominant player in that market was too risky, said the people, who spoke on the condition they not be identified because the discussions were confidential.</p><p>Facebook has also begun internal changes that make itself harder to break up. The company has been knitting together the messaging systems of Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp and has reorganized the departments so that Facebook is more clearly in charge, said two people briefed on the matter. Executives have also worked on rebranding Instagram and WhatsApp to more prominently associate them with Facebook.</p><p>The social network's changes are now prompting a debate about whether a more knitted-together Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram is just smart business or helps strengthen potential anticompetitive practices. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has repeatedly said his company faces competition on all sides and is loath to accept a fragmented version of the social giant. He does not want to lose Instagram and WhatsApp, which are enormous and have the ability to continue fueling Facebook's $56 billion business.</p><p>\"The big question is, is this a logical business plan?\" said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in the Obama administration and senior adviser to Public Knowledge, a nonprofit think tank in Washington. \"For a social network with enormous growth in photos and messaging, there's probably significant business justification for combining the units.\"</p><p>But Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said Facebook's moves needed to be scrutinized.</p><p>\"The combination of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp into the single largest communications platform in history is a clear attempt to evade effective antitrust enforcement by making it harder for the company to be broken up,\" he said. \"We need to hit the pause button.\"</p><p>Facebook has pushed back on the idea that the company's moves - particularly in private messaging - are in anticipation of a potential breakup.</p><p>\"Building more ways for people to communicate through our messaging apps has always been about creating benefits for people - plain and simple,\" said Stan Chudnovsky, a vice president at Facebook overseeing messaging. \"People want to be able to reach as many people as they can with the messaging app they choose.\"</p><p>In Washington, Facebook has its eye particularly on the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is now investigating it for anticompetitive practices, said two of the people with knowledge of the social network.</p><p>The F.T.C. became interested in looking at Facebook and its power last year when the agency's investigators were separately examining the company for privacy violations, said two people close to the process. At the time, the F.T.C.'s investigators uncovered internal Facebook documents that prompted concerns around how the company was acquiring rivals, they said.</p><p>Facebook's long string of acquisitions - it bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, among many others - have been targeted by academics and policymakers for reducing competition. They have argued that the company engaged in \"serial defensive acquisitions\" to protect its dominant position in social networking.</p><p>This year, the F.T.C. sought clearance from the Justice Department to open an antitrust investigation into potentially anticompetitive behavior at Facebook, the people close to the process said. The F.T.C. was cleared to do so, and notified Facebook in June. By late July, the agency had contacted at least a half-dozen founders of companies that Facebook had bought over the past 15 years for information on its acquisition practices, said four people with knowledge of the outreach.</p><p>Around the time that the F.T.C. activity on Facebook ramped up, the company also stepped back on at least one potential acquisition.</p><p>Last December, Facebook executives were in advanced discussions to buy Houseparty, a social networking app that lets multiple people video chat on their mobile phones at once, said two people with knowledge of the talks. Houseparty, co-founded in 2016 by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Ben Rubin and Sima Sistani, was especially popular with audiences under the age of 24. Facebook, whose members are getting older, has coveted younger users.</p><p>But weeks into the discussions, Facebook's corporate development team killed the talks with Houseparty, the people said. Houseparty's executives were told that a deal would draw unwelcome federal government scrutiny to Facebook, they said. Houseparty was later purchased by Epic Games, the makers of the video game Fortnite.</p><p>Facebook's changes that appear to make a breakup of its apps more difficult began more than a year ago. Mr. Zuckerberg focused on combining the underlying infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger. The project, called \"interoperability,\" requires years of deeply technical and difficult engineering work.</p><p>The aim, in part, was to create less of a hodgepodge of companies and more of a unified network, said people briefed on the strategy. Publicly, Mr. Zuckerberg has said the initiative will help build a more \"private\" version of Facebook so customers can \"communicate across networks easily and securely,\" as users flock to messaging services en masse. People will also get a better and more streamlined user experience, he has said. Mr. Zuckerberg has added that a unified messaging system would better lend itself to moneymaking efforts on WhatsApp, which today brings in little revenue.</p><p>But the idea of \"interoperability\" was a departure for Facebook. While Facebook and Instagram have long shared much of the same infrastructure, its different messaging products generally operated independently.</p><p>Though employees at Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are in separate physical buildings, executives have also pushed for them to share more internal resources and have reorganized their reporting lines. In one instance, Facebook executives ordered a change in the messaging teams, two of the people said, requiring the Instagram messenger division to report to the leaders at Facebook's Messenger app. Bloomberg earlier reported on the internal reorganization.</p><p>Last year, Facebook also began a rebranding project, tapping at least one outside agency for help, said three people familiar with the initiative. The agency, Prophet Brand Strategy, was asked to make Facebook into a \"branded house,\" where Facebook's moniker always preceded the names of WhatsApp and Instagram, they said. The rebranding mandate came from Mr. Zuckerberg and Antonio Lucio, Facebook's chief marketing officer, they said.</p><p>In March, Jane Manchun Wong, an independent security researcher, spotted the new branding \"Instagram from Facebook\" - in some unreleased lines of code.</p><p>Employees at both Instagram and WhatsApp, who have been accustomed to greater autonomy, have chafed at the coming changes, said three people familiar with the divisions.</p><p>In hindsight, Facebook had quietly signaled that unification was afoot more than a year ago. In June 2018, the company introduced a combined metric that drew attention away from any individual product. It tallied the number of people who used one or more of any of Facebook's services, including WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>The name of the new metric? Facebook's Family of apps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter: @MikeIsaac. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006655566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT2-G7P1-DYR7-C0WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1370\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 13, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

After my Mum leaned down and gave me one final bear hug, I was off to start my education as I casually waved her away without looking at her \"\" clearly she was cramping my style.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't remember this seminal moment, but I happened to stumble upon the footage this week by complete happenstance.</p><p>The video is of a TV screen playing an old VHS tape and appears to be taken on a camera phone. My guess is my younger sister found the tape and filmed the video to send to me.</p><p>But maybe I should just ask Facebook, because that's where I found it \"\" in the huge file containing my extensive Facebookhistory the company keeps on me.</p><p>Since the moment I, and everyone else signed up, the social media service has been collecting and keeping everything \"\" I seriously mean everything \"\" we have ever done on the site. All the conversations, videos, pictures and documents we have shared or have had sent to us are all held on a server somewhere with space specially dedicated to each of us.</p><p>I downloaded the cache (it's very easy to do) to check out everything Mark Zuckerberg had on file about me from over the years.</p><p>It included scanned copies of lease forms from a previous rental property I must've sent to my buddies over Messenger, my current tenant ledger report, an old monthly billing statement for my home broadband, screen shots of banking transfers and seemingly endless web pages of all the banal conversations I have ever had on the platform.</p><p>It's one thing to know Facebookholds all this data (and much more) on you but it's another thing to trawl through it and find things even you'd forgotten about yourself.</p><p>It's an odd feeling to think that, in some ways, Facebookknows you better than you know yourself.</p><p>Looking through the 500MB zip file you can see your \"Ads History\" which stores what ads you've ever clicked on as well as all the advertisers who Facebookhas shared your contact information with.</p><p>It has facial recognition data (Facebookhas 105 examples of what I look like), exhaustive photo metadata including your location and the time the photo was taken and data about every time you logged onto the site such as the IP address, location, browser and device used.</p><p>My file also contained the names and numbers for everyone in my iPhone's contact list - and yours will too.</p><p>Facebooknot only knows everything you've ever done on its platform but via cookies it leaves in your web browser it also tracks you wherever you go on the internet \"\" even if you don't use Facebook.</p><p>I, like many others, opened my Facebookaccount just over a decade ago. Arguably it's the first time in history that 10 years of human behaviour has been meticulously gathered, stored and analysed by a company on this scale.</p><p>It's called surveillance capitalism and it's the reason why Mark Zuckerberg is worth $92 billion. But as the public and regulators become increasingly aware of just how deep Facebook's tentacles extend into our digital lives, the company is facing increasing political headwinds.</p><p>Earlier this month Belgium ordered Facebookto stop tracking internet users who have no accounts with the social network, or face fines of 250,000 euros a day.

My suspicion is Facebookand Google have much more personal information about people than people realise.\"</p><p>The inquiry will look at whether Facebook, Google or others have misused their power in commercial dealings.</p><p>HOW TO DOWNLOAD YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p><p>Facebookwas the first of the big social media companies to give users the ability to download a file containing their personal history on the service. Google followed in 2011 and Twitter in 2012.</p><p>It's undeniably a good thing and means you can partake in ACCC chairman Rod Sim's game of comparing if the amount of personal data Facebookhas on you is in line with your expectations.</p><p>To download it, click at the top right of any Facebookpage on the desktop version of the site and select Settings.</p><p>Click \"Download a copy of your Facebookdata\" below your General Account Settings and then click the green button.</p><p>It takes about 10 minutes for Facebookto retrieve the file and you'll get an email and notification when it's ready to download.</p><p>Even if you don't use Facebookvery much, you might be surprised by what you find.</p><p>I seldom use Facebookanymore and deleted the app on my phone some time ago.

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.    Of course, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/01/facebook-accc-news-code/\">it's not the first time</url> big tech has hit back at regulations costing it money. In 2014, Google announced it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-spain-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSKBN0JP0QM20141211\">close its news-linking service in Spain</url> in retaliation over a law which gave publishers power to charge Google for re-publishing headlines or news snippets. And in 2019 it said it would stop showing news snippets from <url normalizedValue=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9476993?hl=en\">European publishers in France,</url> to comply with a new European copyright law. </p><p> But there were mixed reactions online as to what exactly Tuesday's announcement from Facebook would mean for Australian users and media companies, with many questioning who the proposed regulation and Facebook's retaliation was protecting.\u00a0  In his statement Easton claimed:  </p><excerpt><bodyText><p>The ACCC presumes that Facebook benefits most in its relationship with publishers, when in fact the reverse is true. News represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">As Crikey also reported last week</url>, the proposed regulation to force Facebook and Google to hand an unlimited amount of revenue over to Australian media companies is justified by a fiction that those companies steal news content.  Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.  Social media companies including Facebook have long been subject to scrutiny over how they crack down on conspiracy and hate groups using their platform to spread misinformation.

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.    Of course, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/01/facebook-accc-news-code/\">it's not the first time</url> big tech has hit back at regulations costing it money.

Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.

News represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">As Crikey also reported last week</url>, the proposed regulation to force Facebook and Google to hand an unlimited amount of revenue over to Australian media companies is justified by a fiction that those companies steal news content.  Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.  Social media companies including Facebook have long been subject to scrutiny over how they crack down on conspiracy and hate groups using their platform to spread misinformation.  And, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/02/facebook-threat-to-australia/\">as some experts told Crikey on Wednesday</url>, there is genuine concern that if well-reported news is removed from the platform, the balance will tip towards disinformation and junk.  This is particularly relevant in the current global pandemic, after a recent report by the University of Canberra on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-06/apo-nid305057_0.pdf\">digital news trends in Australia</url> found that during the COVID-19 outbreak 49% of respondents used Facebook as a source of news about the coronavirus.\u00a0  The same study also found that more than half of Australians get their news from social media, making it clear that Tuesday's announcement from Facebook will have an impact not only on Australian media companies who will no longer be able to rely on its service to attract audience and readers, but on everyday Australians who rely on the platform for information.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RK-S9N1-F0NT-H0GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>15:51:52 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.    Of course, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/01/facebook-accc-news-code/\">it's not the first time</url> big tech has hit back at regulations costing it money. In 2014, Google announced it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-spain-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSKBN0JP0QM20141211\">close its news-linking service in Spain</url> in retaliation over a law which gave publishers power to charge Google for re-publishing headlines or news snippets.

News represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">As Crikey also reported last week</url>, the proposed regulation to force Facebook and Google to hand an unlimited amount of revenue over to Australian media companies is justified by a fiction that those companies steal news content.  Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.  Social media companies including Facebook have long been subject to scrutiny over how they crack down on conspiracy and hate groups using their platform to spread misinformation.  And, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/02/facebook-threat-to-australia/\">as some experts told Crikey on Wednesday</url>, there is genuine concern that if well-reported news is removed from the platform, the balance will tip towards disinformation and junk.  This is particularly relevant in the current global pandemic, after a recent report by the University of Canberra on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-06/apo-nid305057_0.pdf\">digital news trends in Australia</url> found that during the COVID-19 outbreak 49% of respondents used Facebook as a source of news about the coronavirus.\u00a0  The same study also found that more than half of Australians get their news from social media, making it clear that Tuesday's announcement from Facebook will have an impact not only on Australian media companies who will no longer be able to rely on its service to attract audience and readers, but on everyday Australians who rely on the platform for information.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RK-F3K1-F0NT-H539-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>15:51:52 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.

Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.

And, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/02/facebook-threat-to-australia/\">as some experts told Crikey on Wednesday</url>, there is genuine concern that if well-reported news is removed from the platform, the balance will tip towards disinformation and junk.  This is particularly relevant in the current global pandemic, after a recent report by the University of Canberra on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-06/apo-nid305057_0.pdf\">digital news trends in Australia</url> found that during the COVID-19 outbreak 49% of respondents used Facebook as a source of news about the coronavirus.\u00a0  The same study also found that more than half of Australians get their news from social media, making it clear that Tuesday's announcement from Facebook will have an impact not only on Australian media companies who will no longer be able to rely on its service to attract audience and readers, but on everyday Australians who rely on the platform for information.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-CGV1-JD6R-T4GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>15:51:52 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.    Of course, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/01/facebook-accc-news-code/\">it's not the first time</url> big tech has hit back at regulations costing it money.

Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.

Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.  Social media companies including Facebook have long been subject to scrutiny over how they crack down on conspiracy and hate groups using their platform to spread misinformation.  And, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/02/facebook-threat-to-australia/\">as some experts told Crikey on Wednesday</url>, there is genuine concern that if well-reported news is removed from the platform, the balance will tip towards disinformation and junk.  This is particularly relevant in the current global pandemic, after a recent report by the University of Canberra on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-06/apo-nid305057_0.pdf\">digital news trends in Australia</url> found that during the COVID-19 outbreak 49% of respondents used Facebook as a source of news about the coronavirus.\u00a0  The same study also found that more than half of Australians get their news from social media, making it clear that Tuesday's announcement from Facebook will have an impact not only on Australian media companies who will no longer be able to rely on its service to attract audience and readers, but on everyday Australians who rely on the platform for information.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RT-DB31-F0NT-H155-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>15:51:52 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world.

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.    Of course, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/01/facebook-accc-news-code/\">it's not the first time</url> big tech has hit back at regulations costing it money. In 2014, Google announced it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-spain-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSKBN0JP0QM20141211\">close its news-linking service in Spain</url> in retaliation over a law which gave publishers power to charge Google for re-publishing headlines or news snippets.

News represents a fraction of what people see in their News Feed and is not a significant source of revenue for us.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/28/google-facebook-accc-changes/\">As Crikey also reported last week</url>, the proposed regulation to force Facebook and Google to hand an unlimited amount of revenue over to Australian media companies is justified by a fiction that those companies steal news content.  Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.  Social media companies including Facebook have long been subject to scrutiny over how they crack down on conspiracy and hate groups using their platform to spread misinformation.  And, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/02/facebook-threat-to-australia/\">as some experts told Crikey on Wednesday</url>, there is genuine concern that if well-reported news is removed from the platform, the balance will tip towards disinformation and junk.  This is particularly relevant in the current global pandemic, after a recent report by the University of Canberra on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-06/apo-nid305057_0.pdf\">digital news trends in Australia</url> found that during the COVID-19 outbreak 49% of respondents used Facebook as a source of news about the coronavirus.\u00a0  The same study also found that more than half of Australians get their news from social media, making it clear that Tuesday's announcement from Facebook will have an impact not only on Australian media companies who will no longer be able to rely on its service to attract audience and readers, but on everyday Australians who rely on the platform for information.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SW-8721-JD6R-T0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>15:51:52 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was an if. Facebook wouldn't leave the news space if the government backed off plans to make it and Google pay news media publishers for journalism.   The company's move had the desired impact: it set the news alight.  By midday, the statement, a blog post by Facebook's local director Will Easton, had been picked up by most major news organisations in the country and by many others around the world. Notably, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1300606317011152899?s=20\">declined interviews</url> with any Australian media organisations.\u00a0  The announcement also trended highly on social media, jumping up the trending topics on Twitter and garnering thousands of Facebook comments on posts about the announcement.\u00a0  Overnight, the news was also picked up widely by news organisations around the world, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/facebook-sends-world-a-warning-with-threat-to-australian-news?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">some suggesting</url> the social media giant was sending a warning to any international regulators thinking of introducing similar codes.

Another dominant question on social media was what impact this ban would have on the spread of misinformation online.   With the threat to remove sharing of both Australian and international news content from the platform, some questioned how this would impact fact checking and the countering of potentially harmful misinformation, including those of conspiracy theorists ranging from sovereign citizens to anti-vaxxers and Qanon followers -- groups which have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/08/25/under-covid-19-sovereign-citizens-are-pulling-other-conspiracy-theorists-in/\">gained even more attention due to COVID-19</url>.  Social media companies including Facebook have long been subject to scrutiny over how they crack down on conspiracy and hate groups using their platform to spread misinformation.  And, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/02/facebook-threat-to-australia/\">as some experts told Crikey on Wednesday</url>, there is genuine concern that if well-reported news is removed from the platform, the balance will tip towards disinformation and junk.  This is particularly relevant in the current global pandemic, after a recent report by the University of Canberra on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2020-06/apo-nid305057_0.pdf\">digital news trends in Australia</url> found that during the COVID-19 outbreak 49% of respondents used Facebook as a source of news about the coronavirus.\u00a0  The same study also found that more than half of Australians get their news from social media, making it clear that Tuesday's announcement from Facebook will have an impact not only on Australian media companies who will no longer be able to rely on its service to attract audience and readers, but on everyday Australians who rely on the platform for information.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SW-KD11-F0NT-H02D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><timeReceived>15:51:52 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'll spare you the suspense. Just about everyone thought Zuckerberg was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters.The consensus went like this: Even if Zuckerberg \u2014 as Facebook's founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder \u2014 bore most of the responsibility for the company's cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it. </p><p>More than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject \u2014 that Zuckerberg's indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Zuckerberg's removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook's problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated \u2014 not the man who runs it. Most Read Business Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]'To be blunt, if we took Mark Zuckerberg out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don't think the corporation would change in any significant way,' Lynn said. That few can imagine a Facebook without Zuckerberg, 34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Zuckerberg, thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebook makes decisions that create huge consequences for society \u2014 and he has profited handsomely from the chaos. Yet because of Facebook's ownership structure \u2014 in which Zuckerberg's shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares \u2014 he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one.This fits a pattern. Over the past two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures \u2014 when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them. There's another way to put this: For better or worse, Zuckerberg has become too big to fail. In America, it's not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders' dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts.Even in Silicon Valley, where company founders are revered as money-laying rainbow unicorns, there is some limit to corporate patience. In the 1980s, Apple fired Steve Jobs. Last year, Uber ousted Travis Kalanick, who was as closely aligned with his company's culture as Zuckerberg is with his.Facebook's problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebook has been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Investigators for the United Nations have said Facebook was instrumental to genocide in Myanmar; it has also been tied to violence in India, South Sudan and Sri Lanka. There have been privacy scandals (Cambridge Analytica most recently), advertising scandals (discriminatory ads, fishy metrics), multiple current federal inquiries, and an admission that using Facebook can be detrimental to your mental health. Even though Zuckerberg has apologized and vowed again and again and again to fix Facebook, the company's fixes often need fixing. In the past week, reporters showed that the company's recent move to clamp down on political ads has not worked \u2014 Vice News bought Facebook ads falsely stating that they were 'paid for' by Vice President Mike Pence and ISIS. So given such failures, another question might be: Why haven't any heads rolled at Facebook? Although there have been some high-profile defections \u2014 the co-founders of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, all companies bought by Facebook, left in the past few months \u2014 Zuckerberg's most loyal executives have been with him through thick and thin, many for more than a decade. If Facebook admits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that's happening if most of the people who run Facebook remain the same?When I asked Facebook about this, the company argued that things were changing. It just hired Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of Britain, as head of global affairs \u2014 a move that the company said imbued it with a serious outsider's perspective. The social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Zuckerberg's leadership, but declined to do so on the record. The executive explained that fixing Facebook would involve deep costs. The company is hiring more people to review content, for example, and it might have to slow down some of its most ambitious projects to address its impact on the world. The executive argued that Zuckerberg's total domination of Facebook's equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader. Facebook's stock price plunged nearly 20 percent on a single day this summer after it reported slowing revenue growth and increased operational costs. This week, Facebook repeated its slower-growth warning. A 'professional CEO,' one without such a huge stake in the company, would be tempted to try the easy way out, the executive suggested. But Zuckerberg was free to do what's right. Zuckerberg's supporters argued that he has shown a deep capacity to understand and address Facebook's problems. After the company went public in 2012, its stock price languished for months because it had no plan to make money from consumers' shift to mobile devices.'Mark would tell you that he was too late in understanding the importance of mobile \u2014 but when that became apparent, Mark understood its gravity and he understood how to fix it,' said Don Graham, a former Facebook board member and former publisher of The Washington Post. 'He changed the direction of that company incredibly fast, in detail, not by one action but by 20 actions \u2014 and if you looked at the quarter-by-quarter numbers of what percentage of Facebook's revenue was coming from mobile, I couldn't believe how fast it changed.' The question at Facebook now is whether Zuckerberg has similarly seen the light on its current problems. He has said fixing Facebook was his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same.Consider its promise that a new home-hub device, Portal, which it unveiled last month, would not collect information on users that could be used in ads. It had to swiftly walk back that promise because Facebook's data-collection system is so pervasive that even some of its employees don't seem to understand it. 'I think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he's failed is because he's unaccountable,' said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. 'Given a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it's hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.' One fix for Facebook might be to give the board greater power over the company. Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm, recently put forward a shareholder resolution supported by several state funds that would require Zuckerberg to step down as Facebook's chairman, though he would still maintain majority voting control of the company. 'I think by taking the step to relinquish the position of the board chair, it's a very important structural change so that he would not have a completely free hand to muscle his way through decisions,' said Jonas Kron, a Trillium senior vice president.A Facebook spokesman said the company had not yet taken a position on the resolution. In the past, similar measures have been voted down by Zuckerberg and his allies. Which leaves us here: Either Zuckerberg fixes Facebook, or no one does. That's the choice we face, like it or not.

The announcements<br/>After months of deliberations, Facebook gave its answer to the critics who have called for it to put new restrictions on political advertising. The company said it would not accept new political ads in the seven days leading up to the Nov. 3rd US presidential election, but would allow those that had already been approved to continue running. The move was framed as a compromise: campaigns can continue to use Facebook for get-out-the-vote efforts through Election Day, but they'll lose the ability to test new messages. As a result, it might be harder for candidates to spread misinformation in the final days of the campaign.</p><p><br/>There's a lot to say about the limits and implications of this approach. But there's also much more to Facebook's announcement, which included a broad set of measures intended to limit the ability of, uh, someone to spread lies about election safety, voting procedures, and the legitimacy of the outcome.<br/>I covered the announcements at The Verge, and it's worth reading all of them. The other big highlights include limiting forwarding in Messenger to five people per message; promoting accurate voter information at the top of Facebook and Instagram through the election; providing live, official election results through a partnership with Reuters; and adding labels to posts that attempt to declare victory before the results are official, or try to cast doubt on the outcome.<br/>Another notable dimension about the announcements is the way they were announced. They came not from the corporate blog but from CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself, in a Facebook post. And he struck an unusually direct note of concern:<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"The US elections are just two months away, and with COVID-19 affecting communities across the country, I'm concerned about the challenges people could face when voting,\" he wrote. \"I'm also worried that with our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalized, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country.\"<br/>He continued:<br/>\"This election is not going to be business as usual. We all have a responsibility to protect our democracy.\"<br/>II. The reaction<br/>How far will Facebook's announcements this week go to, as Zuckerberg says, protect our democracy?<br/>I think the moves will go a long way toward promoting voter registration and turnout. The Reuters partnership will ensure that a huge number of Americans sees accurate, real-time information about the vote count. And the various policies announced to remove or label problematic posts could inject a welcome dose of reality into the more unhinged conspiracy theories about the election that are now swirling in the fever swamps.<br/>At the same time, as Steve Kovach notes at CNBC, the policies announced Thursday have some obvious limitations. Misinformation in political advertising can continue right up until Election Day, so long as it has been running for at least a week. By the time the new restrictions kick in, mail-in voting will have been underway for weeks. And no label will be able to stop Trump from declaring that he has won, loudly and repeatedly.<br/>Meanwhile, on Twitter, Zeynep Tufekci raises the larger point always lurking in the background of these discussions. \"There are the details,\" she wrote, \"and there is this: Mark Zuckerberg, alone, gets to set key rules - with significant consequences - for one of the most important elections in recent history. That should not be lost in the dust of who these changes will hurt or benefit.\"<br/>I think all of that is fair, and yet I've struggled to land on an overall point of view on Facebook's approach to regulating political speech. The question I keep coming back to is: what exactly is Facebook trying to solve for?<br/>III. The solve<br/>By now, almost everyone accepts that social platforms have a role to play in protecting our democracy - as do average citizens, journalists, and the government itself. In 2016, all four of those groups failed in various ways, and we've spent much of the intervening period litigating who was most at fault, and what ought to be done about it.<br/>One way to view Facebook's announcements on Thursday is as an acknowledgement that when it comes to protecting our democracy, in 2020 the US government cannot be counted upon. Just this week, the president effectively told voters in North Carolina to vote twice - sending in a mail-in ballot, then showing up at the polls to vote again. He has sought to sabotage the post office to make voting by mail more difficult. He won't commit to leaving office should he lose the election - and \"jokes\" about never leaving office, period.<br/>None of these are issues a tech platform can solve. But because of their perceived power, the platforms are under strong pressure to take decisive action in response. And they are taking it seriously, Axios reported today, structuring a serious of war-game exercises to prepare for various election disaster scenarios:<br/>Facebook, Google, Twitter and Reddit are holding regular meetings with one another, with federal law enforcement - and with intelligence agencies - to discuss potential threats to election integrity.<br/>Between March 1 and Aug. 1, Twitter practiced its response to scenarios including foreign interference, leaks of hacked materials and uncertainty following Election Day.<br/>Meanwhile, the president continues to use the platforms in transparently anti-democratic ways. On Thursday, while still under criticism for his remarks about North Carolina, he repeated his instructions to all voters that they should both mail in a ballot and show up to vote in person. The post appeared both on Twitter and on Facebook, and both companies left it up. Twitter placed it under a warning label after determining the post could lead people to vote twice, and also prevented people from retweeting it or replying. Facebook added a label underneath saying that mail-in voting has been historically trustworthy.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The basic idea here is to allow for a maximum of political speech, and to answer the most problematic speech with more speech, in the form of labels. The platforms have offered no positive conception of what political speech should be or do there. Instead, they police it as beat cops, running off the worst posts while writing speeding tickets for lesser offenses.<br/>The idea rests upon a foundational belief that both parties are good-faith actors when it comes to political speech, all available evidence to the contrary. And it's this, more than anything else, that has resulted in Facebook's strange contortions on the subject. As the press critic and New York University professor Jay Rosen put it:<br/>\"The media ecosystem around one of our two major parties runs on made up claims and conspiracy theories. Facebook has institutionally committed itself to denial of this fact. It also says it has rules against spreading misinformation. The two commitments are in conflict.\"<br/>It's in such a world that Facebook can make a host of changes to its policies in response to the actions, both actual and predicted, of President Trump, without ever saying the words \"President Trump\" at all. Company executives clearly feel a moral obligation to act against a grave threat to American democracy - but they cannot bring themselves to name the threat. This posture of impartiality, which Rosen calls \"the view from nowhere,\" has long been the default stance of the American media.<br/>But it has been in decline for some time now, and for good reason. When you commit yourself to the view from nowhere, you will find, over and over again, that you are being played.<br/>It's in this sense that the steps Facebook is taking today can be viewed as positive, and also in some larger sense as being beside the point. If you are working at a big social platform and find yourself concerned about the degree to which it is enabling fascism, it's not enough to simply adjust the boundaries of discourse.<br/>You have to do something about the fascism.<br/>IV. A parable<br/>A headline from Wednesday evening in The Daily Beast: \"Facebook's Internal Black Lives Matter Debate Got So Bad Zuckerberg Had to Step In.\"<br/>The story, by Maxwell Tani and Spencer Ackerman, recounts a controversy that broke out inside the company when one of its 50,000 employees posted a short essay to its internal Workplace forum titled \"In Support of Law Enforcement and Black Lives.\" The essay, which was posted on Monday, sought to defend police officers in the wake of Wisconsin cops shooting Jacob Blake seven times in the back and leaving him paralyzed. Tani and Ackerman write:<br/>The post called into question the notion of racially disparate outcomes in the criminal-justice system, argued that racism is not a serious motivation in police shootings, railed against \"critical race theory,\" and claimed narratives about police violence often \"conveniently leave out\" other factors, including whether the victim was under the influence of drugs or complied with officers' directives. [...]<br/>\"My heart goes out to the Blake family,\" the staffer wrote on Friday. \"It also goes out to the well-intentioned law enforcement officers who have been victimized by society's conformity to a lie.\" The staffer continued: \"What if racial, economic, crime, and incarceration gaps cannot close without addressing personal responsibility and adherence to the law?\"<br/>On enterprise Facebook, just as it might have on consumer Facebook, the controversial post generated much outrage and engagement. It bubbled to the top of the feeds, and inspired many anguished comments. Its polite, just-asking-questions tone, coupled with clear endorsement of a system that has terrorized Black Americans for centuries, put the company's commitment to free speech in the workplace to the test. If left unchecked, the post threatened to undermine faith in company leadership.<br/>\u00a0<br/>On consumer Facebook, the post would have stayed up even if it had been reported. But on enterprise Facebook, the post occasioned some reflection. Zuckerberg wrote a note affirming that \"systemic racism is real,\" and chided \"some\" employees for not considering the full weight of their words on their Black colleagues. (I obtained a copy.) In response, he said, Facebook would soon move \"charged topics\" to \"dedicated spaces\" within Workplace, and added that these forums would have \"clear rules and strong moderation.\"<br/>\"You won't be able to discuss highly charged content broadly in open groups,\" he said. \"As you know, we deeply value expression and open discussion, but I don't believe people working here should have to be confronted with divisive conversations while they're trying to work.\"<br/>This is a view from somewhere. It is a positive conception of how a discussion ought to take place. Not just what words or symbols are allowed or disallowed, but how it should be constructed. I have no doubt it will make Facebook a better place to work. And I wonder whether the version of Facebook the rest of us would not benefit from similarly decisive intervention.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending up: Google released a dataset of search trends for researchers to study the link between symptom-related searches and the spread of COVID-19. The goal is to help researchers understand where new outbreaks might occur. (Google)<br/>Trending up: Pinterest announced it will no longer show ads to users when they search for elections-related terms on the platform. The company also said employees will get paid time off to vote. (Megan Graham / CNBC)<br/>Governing\u2b50 The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month. Attorney General William Barr overruled lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against the tech giant, and underscored fears that the investigation has been tainted by politics. Katie Benner and Cecilia Kang at The New York Times have the story:<br/>A coalition of 50 states and territories support antitrust action against Google, a reflection of the broad bipartisan support that a Justice Department case might have. But state attorneys general conducting their own investigations into the company are split on how to move forward, with Democrats perceived by Republicans as slow-walking the work so that cases can be brought under a potential Biden administration, and Democrats accusing Republicans of rushing it out under Mr. Trump. That disagreement could limit the number of states that join a Justice Department lawsuit and imperil the bipartisan nature of the investigation.<br/>Some lawyers in the department worry that Mr. Barr's determination to bring a complaint this month could weaken their case and ultimately strengthen Google's hand, according to interviews with 15 lawyers who worked on the case or were briefed on the department's strategy. They asked not to be named for fear of retribution.<br/>Facebook removed a video of the president's remarks about North Carolina, citing its policies against voter fraud. The company said people can share it if they do so to correct the record. (Ashley Gold / Axios)<br/>As part of Facebook's study on how social media impacts democracy, the company is paying some users to log off of its products ahead of the 2020 US presidential election. The payments range between $10 and $20 per week, as some users would be asked to deactivate for one week while others could be asked to leave the platform up to six weeks total.

But in fact, the militia took down the event themselves the day after two people were killed.

They also called for a broad enhancement of Facebook's moderation against extremism, including more automated tools for proactive enforcement and better systems for detecting event pages that promote violence.

The move reversed an earlier decision, led by Facebook policy executive Ankhi Das, not to punish the politician. Das said it could hurt the company's business interests in the country.

Amazon has now ended the social media monitoring program. (Lauren Kaori Gurley / Vice)<br/>Industry\u2b50 Apple will delay the enforcement of a controversial change to its mobile operating system that would upend how ads are targeted on iPhones and iPads. The change in iOS 14, the next version of Apple's mobile software, will require developers to ask users to share their device's unique identifier for advertising purposes through a prompt. Here's Alex Heath at The Information:<br/>Apple has positioned the new prompt as a pro-privacy move that puts users in control of their data. But the proposed change has caused panic among marketers and developers that rely on targeted ads to reach consumers. Mobile developers and advertisers who spoke to The Information said they've had little time to prepare for the change, announced in June of this year, and that Apple hasn't provided a clear workaround that lets them target their ads without the IDFA.<br/>After this story was published Thursday, Apple confirmed that it would delay the enforcement of its IDFA prompt until 2021. Developers will still be able to ask users for permission to share their IDFA when iOS 14 is released this fall, though asking users through the prompt won't be mandatory.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1450706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60ST-2DT1-JBYT-H0CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last month, Facebook announced that they were going to be money, create money - cryptocurrency, a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. But first they had to destroy the competition. They took our freedom, mined, stole and sold our private data and messaging. </p><p>Given Facebook's repeated and ongoing violations of ethical obligations and user trust why in the world would anyone use this? Who would entrust those abusive fascists with our wallets? What benefit could it possibly the end user versus the risk of them doing something dodgy with that data or worse, giving them more power? Insatiable Power Quest: Facebook Launching Its Own Money, Unveils Cryptocurrency, Libra[1] Did Facebook Try to Destroy an Entire Industry?By Brian of London, Israelly Cool[2], July 1, 2019 If you hadn't heard of Bitcoin up until last week, or you knew nothing about it, that may well have changed last week with Facebook's announcement of their own rival cryptocurrency called 'Libra'. It is to be administered by a Swiss not-for-profit company (because Swiss holding companies always lend projects an air of sophistication) and 'governed as a public good'. I'm not joking, that is really in the 'White Paper' Facebook put out announcing their project. Now there's a little David of a law firm in Israel that's going to take Facebook and these other tech Goliaths to court to prove what they all did together was illegal! Almost a year and a half ago, Facebook (then Google and Twitter) almost simultaneously banned the advertising of an entire industry on all their platforms. Here's a short video.Do you want to understand just how dishonest Facebook has been with the entire cryptocurrency industry? Watch 2mins. Then join the class action and help us fight back. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/jbKrtCRL14\">https://t.co/jbKrtCRL14</url>[3] #CryptoClassAction[4] pic.twitter.com/xaAF5LzBRp[5] \u2014 Dr Brian of London (@brianoflondon) July 1, 2019[6]These were the terms and conditions Facebook put into effect in January 2018: Facebook classed all cryptocurrencies as 'associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices'. It was right around when these terms were published that the cryptocurrency markets started dropping fast and many businesses built on this technology suddenly found it impossible to raise new money or trade profitably. With each announcement from Facebook, then Google and Twitter, the cryptocurrency markets plunged: 53% for Facebook, 30% for Google and 23% for Twitter. The Crypto Winter had arrived, courtesy of a Big Tech cartel. In May of this year they changed those terms:acebook classed all cryptocurrencies as 'associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices'. It was right around when these terms were published that the cryptocurrency markets started dropping fast and many businesses built on this technology suddenly found it impossible to raise new money or trade profitably. With each announcement from Facebook, then Google and Twitter, the cryptocurrency markets plunged: 53% for Facebook, 30% for Google and 23% for Twitter. The Crypto Winter had arrived, courtesy of a Big Tech cartel. In May of this year they changed those terms:Can you see what they removed? They took out the sentence which says 'Click here to learn more about our no-risk cryptocurrency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world.' Guess how you could describe Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency. Yes, that's right, it's a no-risk cryptocurrency that enables instant payments to anyone in the world. And you can see that because almost those exact words appear in the Libra White Paper published last week!ust over a year ago a friend of mine, Andrew Hamilton, told me of his plan to sue Facebook, Google and Twitter for billions of dollars in Australia. I laughed a little but then I listened. This was long before we knew Facebook was working on their own massive global cryptocurrency. It turns out Andrew is a lawyer, originally from Australia, who was actively working in the cryptocurrency industry. He was personally affected by this advertising ban and he was in a position to know that Australia has laws against the exact actions these tech Goliaths took to destroy competition. He founded JPB Liberty to take on a massive Class Action lawsuit and has been signging up[7] people who have been affected. I joined him to help get the work out on the case. We've had many millions of dollars of claims signed up and are actively raising the money to bring the case to court. Warning letters have been sent to Facebook, Google and Twitter already. There's probably going to be more publicity on this as more people realize just how big this case could be, and you'll be able to say you heard it here first on Israellycool! The Truth Must be Told Your contribution supports independent journalism Please take a moment to consider this. Now, more than ever, people are reading Geller Report for news they won't get anywhere else. But advertising revenues have all but disappeared. Google Adsense is the online advertising monopoly and they have banned us. Social media giants like Facebook and Twitter have blocked and shadow-banned our accounts. But we won't put up a paywall. Because never has the free world needed independent journalism more. Everyone who reads our reporting knows the Geller Report covers the news the media won't. We cannot do our ground-breaking report without your support. We must continue to report on the global jihad and the left's war on freedom. Our readers' contributions make that possible. Geller Report's independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our work is critical in the fight for freedom and because it is your fight, too. Please contribute to our ground-breaking work here[8].   Make a monthly commitment to support The Geller Report - choose the option that suits you best.  Have a tip we should know? Your anonymity is NEVER compromised.

Hope you can stay with us for the next three hours.</p><p>I'm John Vause. And this is NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p>Five days of silence from FacebookCEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>have finally been broken with an apology for what he calls a major breach of trust.</p><p>We'll have CNN's exclusive interview with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in just a moment. But first here's Drew Griffin with more on this scandal involving Cambridge Analytica. The data firm with ties to the Trump campaign is accused of misusing the personal information from millions of Facebookusers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The reason Facebookis under fire is the ease with which a researcher was able to use Facebookto harvest the personal information of tens of millions of Americans then transfer all that personal information to a data analytics company that would eventually work for <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign. That firm, Cambridge Analytica, denies any of its work on the 2016 election used the Facebookdata to target voters.</p><p>But Christopher Wiley, the former U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower says at the core of the company's activities was the access Facebookprovided. CHRISTOPHER WILEY, FORMER CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA EMPLOYEE: So we went from no data to, you know, harvesting all of this data off of Facebookand then combining it with all the consumer data -- voter data sets.</p><p>So, you know, we had <person><nameText>Steve Bannon </nameText></person>and a billionaire breathing down our necks trying to, you know, go where's the data, where's the algorithms, where's our, you know, information weapons.</p><p>And that's where Kogan came along, Aleksandr Kogan, the professor at Cambridge.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Aleksandr Kogan is the Cambridge University researcher who in 2014 developed an app, a Facebook personality test called \"This is Your Digital Life\". 270,000 people voluntarily took the personality test.</p><p>But what no one who took the test knew is that Kogan's app opened the door to all their personal information and to all of those voluntary Facebookresponders' friends and their friends and so on -- tens of millions of people.</p><p>Facebooksays Kogan misled them. That he was supposed to only use the data for research. Instead he collected it and sold it. But Kogan doesn't believe he did anything wrong.</p><p>ALEKSANDR KOGAN, DATA-MINING RESEARCHER: Because the reality is that our app wasn't special. It was completely common place where there are thousands -- tens of thousands of apps doing the exact same thing.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Now the attorneys-general of at least three states are demanding answers. Congress demanding Facebook's CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>testify. Even government officials in the U.K. want executives from Facebookand Cambridge Analytica to explain how a research app led to the exploitation of the personal data of millions.</p><p>Drew Griffin, CNN -- Atlanta.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: One reaction to the scandal is the growing \"Delete FacebookMovement\". In her exclusive interview with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>CNN's Laurie Segall asked him about the damage done to users' trust.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Facebookhas asked us to share our data, to share our lives on this platform. And it wanted us to be transparent. And people don't feel like they've received that same amount of transparency. They're wondering what's happening to their data? Can they trust Facebook?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG, </nameText></person>CEO, FACEBOOK: Yes. So one of the most important things that I think we need to do here is make sure that we tell everyone whose data was affected by one of these rogue apps, right. And we're going to do that. We're going to build a tool where anyone can go and see if their data was a part of this but -- SEGALL: So the 50 million people that were impacted, they will be able to tell if they were impacted by this.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Yes, we're going to be even conservative on that. So, you know, we may not have all the data in our system today so anyone whose data might have been affected by this we're going to make sure that we tell.</p><p>[00:05:02] And going forward when we identify apps that are similarly doing sketchy things we're going to make sure that we tell people then too, right. That's definitely something that looking back on this -- you know, I regret that we didn't do it at the time. And I think we got that wrong and we're committed to getting that right going forward.</p><p>SEGALL: I want to ask about that because when this came to light, you guys knew this a long time ago that this data was out there. Why didn't you tell users? Don't you think users have the right to know that their data is being used for different purposes?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: So yes. And let me tell you what actions we took. So in 2015 some journalist from \"The Guardian\" told us that they had seen or had some evidence that data that this app developer Aleksandr Kogan who built this personality quiz app and a bunch of people used it and shared data with it had sold that data to Cambridge Analytica and a few other firms.</p><p>When we heard that, that's against the policies -- you can't share data in a way that people don't know or don't consent to. We immediately banned Kogan's app. And further we made it so that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and the other folks with whom he shared the data, we asked for a formal certification that they had none of the data from anyone in the Facebookcommunity, that they deleted it if they had it and that they weren't using it.</p><p>And they all provided that certification so as far as we understood around the time in that episode, there was no data out there.</p><p>SEGALL: So why didn't Facebookfollow-up? You know, you say that you certified it, I think. Why wasn't there more of a follow-up? Why wasn't there an audit then? Why does it take a big media report to get that pro-active approach?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well, I mean I don't know about you but I'm sued to when people legally certify that they're going to do something that they do it. But I think that this was clearly a mistake in retrospect.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Laurie Segall joins us now from San Francisco. So Laurie -- congratulations, a good exclusive to get.</p><p>And I guess the big headline out of all this Zuckerberg sort of all but admitting that Facebookmay have influenced the outcome of the U.S. election and then adding that maybe now is the time that regulations are needed. SEGALL: Yes, it's interesting to hear a tech leader say that. And you know, he said the right kind of regulation is important. But you know, normally you don't hear them come out and say that.</p><p>You have lawmakers calling for Facebookto be regulated, calling for the big tech companies to be regulated. You usually see a lot more push back. And, you know, I think Zuckerberg said we need a more thoughtful approach -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, I wonder how -- how will this go down with the other big tech companies? You know, Google and Twitter -- how will they react to this?</p><p>SEGALL: Look, I think it's a big moment. And I will say, you know, I think all tech companies are under a lot of pressure at this moment. We've had a year of unintended consequences. We've seen the weaponization of all of these platforms.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on Facebookbecause, you know, Facebookis very personal to us and we've seen Russian influence on Facebook. It's been a year for Facebookwhere we saw a lot of bad actors take advantage of the platform.</p><p>So I think the pressure is on. I'll tell you this -- John. You know, Mark doesn't like doing on-camera interviews. He gets very nervous. He would rather be kind of behind the scenes with the engineers working on the product.</p><p>But I think we've kind of reached this pivotal point where we also need our tech leaders to step up and talk about, you know, some of these unintended consequences, some of the nuance behind the challenges that they're facing that come along with this really powerful technology.</p><p>VAUSE: You know, it's only a guess but I'm guessing he also does not like testifying before Congress but he said he would. But then he added, if it's the right thing to do. It's hard to imagine how it would be the wrong thing to do.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes. You know, he said for various -- very specific. And he said maybe, you know, for the right thing. I wonder what that right thing is.</p><p>And what I said to him is, you know, you are the brand. You are the face of Facebookin a way that's bigger than other tech founders. You know you don't think -- when you think of Microsoft, sure some folks might know the CEO is Satya Nadella but when you think of Facebookmost people around the world know <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is the CEO.</p><p>So that's why when you see a tough year like Facebook's had, when you see a tough couple -- last couple of days that Facebookhas had when it comes to knowing that this data was used for nefarious purposes I really do think that people want to see Mark.</p><p>And it's interesting and newsy that he said he could potentially, would do for the right reason is he willing to testify. VAUSE: He also had this sort of narrative out there that yes Facebooktakes responsibility for everything that has happened but he also kind of played the victim role here as well. You know, essentially saying, you know, we're the victim here of Cambridge Analytica. And that doesn't really match up with all the facts.</p><p>[00:10:00] SEGALL: Yes. Look, I think there's also -- there's an interesting narrative because at one point he said, you know, we're in front of this. These are issues that we're still kind of paying the price for but we've fixed it.</p><p>This issue, years ago but this is kind of the after effect. He said we're getting in front of it. And I said to him, you know, Mark we're still sitting right here. You know, this has actually 50 million people years later, you know.</p><p>So I do think while there is that company line and while I do think they feel a responsibility I also think, you know, this could just be the beginning of it, you know.</p><p>We don't know back in 2014 what happened with Facebookactually changed their data policy to make it stricter for developers to share user data, you know. We don't know what happened back then and what data is still out there.</p><p>And I think that's a question for Mark. It's the question I asked him and he said they're going to do everything they can to find it.</p><p>You know, the skeptic in me says that's going to be really, really difficult. I think transparency is important which is good that they're coming forward but, you know, they are talking about the past and I think, you know, there are a lot of challenges that comes with the future, too -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Very, very quickly. You've interviewed Zuckerberg a number of times. This is to me different. During this interview was he rattled or worried about just how serious all of this could be?</p><p>SEGALL: I'm going to go out and say in both times I've interviewed him, you know, he is nervous in front of the camera. He doesn't love doing these TV interviews. But I will say the stakes are much higher this time.</p><p>I interviewed him back in June before a lot of this came to light. And I think, you know, where in the world is <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg? </nameText></person>We were all wondering when he was going to come publicly on this situation, on this story and on what happened that impacted 50 million users and he just remained silent.</p><p>And I think the pressure for him was very different. It was a very different tone today than it was in the past -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Many thanks to you -- Laurie Segall. And we'll have Laurie's entire interview with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>about two hours from now right here on NEWSROOM L.A. Well, if the special counsel investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election ever gets to interview the President CNN has learned that the focus will be on at least four topics. The circumstances surrounding <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>Jr.'s meeting with the Russians in Trump Tower in 2016; the President's role at crafting a misleading statement about said meeting; the firing of FBI director, James Comey; and the firing of national security advisor Michael Flynn.</p><p>Well, joining me now for more on this, CNN political commentators Democratic strategist Dave Jacobson and Republican consultant John Thomas.</p><p>Ok. So there will be at least four of these topics. They're not the only ones but that's the ones that we've learned of. It seems Flynn and Comey are also reportedly at the top of that list.</p><p>So just on the surface, you know, Flynn seems to be a direct line to Russia during the campaign and the firing of Comey seems to be a direct line to the obstruction of justice. So John, you know -- or Dave rather -- I'm going to you first, legal tracks seem to be of equal legal importance here.</p><p>DAVE JACOBSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think they're all tied together too, right. I think one of the biggest questions for me was <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>tweet on December second when he fired off that tweet saying that Michael Flynn, you know, had lied to the Vice President but in addition to that had lied to the FBI.</p><p>So essentially, he admitted he was attempting to obstruct justice, right, because he asked Comey the next day after the firing, hey can you let this go. And so I think that's going to be one of the most revealing elements of that interview if it happens.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. And the President began his day attacking Robert Mueller by name on Twitter. Special counsel was told to find crimes, whether crime exists or not.\" Then he seems to go on quote the Harvard Law professor, Alan Dershowitz but it's a little bit unclear.</p><p>This is what Dershowitz I think said. \"I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be special counsel. I'm still opposed to it. I think President Trump is right when he said there was no probably cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice,\" exclamation point.</p><p>Apart from the fact that no one can seem to find exactly where Dershowitz may have said that, John -- this is why the President cannot find good lawyers because he does that which is exactly the kind of thing he should not be doing at this point.</p><p>JOHN THOMAS, CNN COMMENTATOR: Yes, I think the Dershowitz quote, I think he was on Fox News last night or something.</p><p>VAUSE: No, it was in the transcripts. I could not find --</p><p>THOMAS: He didn't say that exact quote,</p><p>VAUSE: It was kind of -- it wasn't exactly that same.</p><p>THOMAS: I think he was on Fox.</p><p>VAUSE: He was, yes.</p><p>THOMAS: But regardless.</p><p>VAUSE: The presidential --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMAS: There are a couple of things that were interesting about the information CNN got.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>THOMAS: First of all it didn't appear that there were any financial crimes -- or financial questions in the Mueller questions.</p><p>VAUSE: In the four topics, yes.</p><p>THOMAS: In the four topics. And legal experts, at least on CNN today seemed to think that there probably will only be one interview; that Mueller probably wouldn't go back a second time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMAS: So it's interesting that the financial angle doesn't seem to be a focus by Mueller. And the other issues seem logical that that's what Mueller would want to question.</p><p>VAUSE: So you're not concerned about this?</p><p>THOMAS: Well look, I knew it would make its way to the President at some point. Just the question it still seems like there's really no -- that the public has no real hard evidence of collusion or obstruction -- hard evidence.</p><p>[00:15:02] So the question for me -- what I'm trying to figure out, is Mueller checking a box and just going up to the top to run leads down so that he can come right back down to Flynn? Or is there something there?</p><p>I don't know but I think if you're the President you have to be concerned, of course, because you can get yourself in trouble in that interview even if you didn't actually obstruct justice. So that is a huge risk in itself.</p><p>But I think the other part, he should be pleased in the sense of by the times he makes his way to this President hopefully Mueller's getting ready to wrap this thing up.</p><p>JACOBSON: That's now the biggest unknown, right. It's like, we know <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has a very difficult time with the truth, and so -- he loves those alternative facts --</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>JACOBSON: -- and so the question is like, is Bob Mueller going to catch the President in a lie and he's going to essentially be charged with something perhaps like what Michael Flynn was charged with --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMAS: Well -- and even, even a lawyer like Bill Clinton perjured himself in this kind of situation.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>JACOBSON: Precisely.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: -- <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>continues to -- he has this ongoing upheaval within his legal team. He can't get the lawyers to come and work for him because he doesn't follow their advice. He thinks he can, you know -- he's his own best lawyer.</p><p>JACOBSON: He doesn't follow anyone's advice. Today when it came to Putin --</p><p>THOMAS: This is the same challenge he has with communications directors.</p><p>JACOBSON: Right.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. So this is how the lawyer for Stormy Daniels has described dealing with the Trump legal team.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL AVENATTI, STORMY DANIELS' LAWYER: Right now, we're playing three-dimensional chess and these guys are playing tic-tac-toe quite honest and then not even playing tic-tac-toe that well, all right.</p><p>When we filed this case, there was one response that made sense and one response only. And that response should have been, you know what, you're right. I wasn't a party to the agreement. This is the President speaking. She's free to talk. She can tell her story and I'm going to tell mine.</p><p>And guess what, had that happened, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. And we wouldn't be talking about it. The fact of the matter is that's not what happened.</p><p>They have stepped into every trap we've laid in this case the last two weeks. It's remarkable. I've never seen anything like it. I've never had good fortune like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And you know, he may be overstating it -- he's a lawyer. You know, he's one of these slick New York lawyers. But the overwhelming opinion out there does seem to be at this point not just the lawyers for Stormy Daniels but the other two, you know, sex scandal-related lawsuits, you know, their legal counsel are playing rings around the Trump attorneys at the moment.</p><p>THOMAS: Well, they're certainly playing a better public relations game. And look, it's a sexy story, you know.</p><p>JACOBSON: Sexy.</p><p>THOMAS: Yes. You know, it has all the elements of tabloid fodder. And Stormy Daniels understands that if she wants a book deal or something else that she's going to keep pushing while the Trump team keeps trying to muzzle them. And it's just escalating and escalating. And I think Stormy and the gang is loving every minute of it.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. There's also this real risk to the President that these lawsuits, these private lawsuits could actually pose a bigger threat to him than Mueller.</p><p>JACOBSON: Well, I don't know necessarily that they'd be a bigger threat than Bob Mueller. But look what was once a storm brewing has not turned into a massive volcanic eruption --</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>JACOBSON: -- that is not going to go away.</p><p>VAUSE: Three volcanoes erupting there.</p><p>JACOBSON: Right, right -- three, a trio.</p><p>And the fact is we are continuing to get closer and closer to the 2018 election. Imagine what's going to happen if Democrats take control of Congress, you know. And this is a massive challenge. People are tired of the chaos. They are exhausted.</p><p>THOMAS: I just don't know if voters really care that they --</p><p>JACOBSON: Absolutely they do.</p><p>THOMAS: -- that they found out that the President was promiscuous in his past life. I think everybody kind of understands that going into this.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>JACOBSON: There is hard evidence -- there's hard evidence that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is losing support with white suburban women -- one of the core constituencies that helped propel him to the White House.</p><p>THOMAS: And they're shocked and outraged that had he affairs?</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Ok.</p><p>The President also defended his decision to congratulate Vladimir Putin on -- he did that on Tuesday. He defended the decision on Wednesday. This was that congratulations call, even though he was told not to do it.</p><p>So he tweeted this. \"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory. In the past, Obama called him also. The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong.</p><p>Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing, not a bad thing. They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming arms race.</p><p>But tried to get along but didn't have the smarts. Obama and Clinton tried but they didn't have the energy or chemistry. Remember reset? Peace through strength,\" in all caps like \"do not congratulate\".</p><p>You know, Dave -- it's not unreasonable to think that Moscow couldn't see how insulting some of these big global issues around the world except for the fact that Moscow created these big global problems around the world. It's like asking the arsonist to put out the fire that he started.</p><p>JACOBSON: Totally. And like look, facts are facts. Like yes, Barack Obama congratulated Vladimir Putin. He probably shouldn't, he did. Barack Obama also probably should have done more when it comes to taking on Russia with election meddling.</p><p>But at the end of the day <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>who skewers and eviscerates his own staff, his own supporters, refuses to criticize Vladimir Putin throughout the presidency, throughout the campaign and years before that. And it just begs the question, like what does Vladimir Putin have on <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Obama did congratulate Putin when he won the election but Putin hadn't just hacked into the U.S. election in 2012</p><p>JACOBSON: Right. And Obama also held Putin's feet to the fire when it was --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: -- talk of improving relations. So -- John.</p><p>[00:20:03] THOMAS: And I think Trump is thinking that he can improve relations, that he can sit down and talk with leaders like North Korea, maybe where others haven't, right.</p><p>So this is a guy who thinks he's a consummate negotiator. He wants to keep lines of communication open. And the fact that, you know -- besides the fact that it was leaked that he got advice otherwise, presidents don't always follow their national security team's advice.</p><p>VAUSE: Having said that, the former CIA director, John Brennan has an idea of why <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>never seems to confront Vladimir Putin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I think he's afraid of the President of Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why?</p><p>BRENNAN: Well, you know, I think one can speculate as to why. That the Russians may have something on him personally; that they could always roll out and they just like more difficult. The Russians I think have had long experience with Mr. Trump and may have things that they could expose.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Something personal perhaps?</p><p>BRENNAN: Perhaps. Perhaps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Dave?</p><p>JACOBSON: Yes. I mean like just what is he hinting at? But I think like the optics here make Vladimir Putin look like the puppet master. And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is clearly the puppet.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>And John -- in isolation, you can explain these things. You can rationalize each individual case. It gets a lot harder when you look at them in sort of the entirety of the last 14 months.</p><p>THOMAS: Brennan is losing so much credibility as a partisan now going into this fight with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And that's what I hate to see about this. He may be right.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, he was CIA director at the time when the Steele dossier was hander over to the agency.</p><p>THOMAS: Well, right. My issue is he's trying to fight -- he looks like he's on a one-man mission to torpedo <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And so now when he's speculating on these things, I doubt he would be leaking classified information on MSNBC.</p><p>VAUSE: Good point.</p><p>THOMAS: So he's just pontificating and that's not the role of somebody that should be a respected former intelligence officer.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. We will leave it there. John and Dave -- thank you.</p><p>JACOBSON: Thanks.</p><p>VAUSE: We appreciate it.</p><p>Still to come here, more than 100 school girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria have been freed. And now the government is facing questions of just how they managed to secure their release.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, almost all of the 110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria last month are free. The terror group returned the girls to their hometown on Wednesday. Five others reportedly died while being held hostage.</p><p>But now there are questions as to how the government secured their release.</p><p>Nima Elbagir reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It was the moment that for the parents of over 100 children abducted from their school in Dachi they had feared would never come. It was a moment of respite, of euphoria but also one with plenty of lingering questions.</p><p>Could have the government done more? Should have the government done more? And could all of this have been stopped in its tracks.</p><p>Amnesty International say they believe that there were warnings that this was going to happen and certainly there have been a lot of concerns about a resurgent Boko Haram in the north of Nigeria since Chad withdrew its troops in October of 2017 in response to its inclusion in President Trump's Muslim ban.</p><p>[00:25:05] The worry is what was given in exchange for those children? The Nigerian government insists that no money changed hands but they also insisted post the release of the first batch of Chibok girls that nothing was given in exchange. Incredible reports were issued in the days and months that followed contradicting that statement.</p><p>What does this mean for the region? Well, we'll certainly seeing Boko Haram walking away with a pretty substantial propaganda coup. What that will mean for the north of Nigeria remains to be seen.</p><p>Nima Elbagir, CNN -- Nairobi. &gt;</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, next here on NEWSROOM L.A. the terror in Texas is over but the mystery remains. What was the motive of this 23-year-old serial bomber?</p><p>VAUSE: Welcome back everybody. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with CNNFacebook's CEO has apologized for the reported misuse of users' data calling it a major breach of trust. <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he's open to the idea of social media regulation and will testify before Congress but adding \"if it's the right thing to do\". Special counsel Robert Mueller wants to ask <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>why he fired FBI director James Comey and national security advisor Michael Flynn. Sources say Mueller's team is also interested in that 2016 Trump Tower meeting between <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>Jr. and a Kremlin-linked lawyer.</p><p>Well, most of the 110 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria last month are back in their hometown. The terror group Boko Haram released them. Five other girls reportedly died in captivity. The Nigerian government says no ransom was paid. &gt;</p><p>Well, the man who put Austin, Texas on edge for more than two weeks is dead but police still don't know why he scattered explosive devices across the city. But there are a lot of clues including a 25-minute long video confession.</p><p>We have details now from CNN's Ed Lavandera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Five home-made pipe bombs killed and injured unsuspecting victims around Austin and San Antonio in the last three weeks. One last bomb blew up in the sender's hands blowing out the windows of this maroon SUV as a SWAT team closed in.</p><p>Authorities say 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt was the serial bomber who unleashed a deadly chill across the city.</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN, TEXAS POLICE CHIEF: The suspect is deceased and has significant injuries from a blast that occurred from detonating a bomb inside his vehicle.</p><p>[00:29:57] LAVANDERA: The surreal ending stunned relatives and neighbors in Conditt's hometown of Pflugerville just north of Austin. Family members say Conditt was a loving and peaceful man who was homeschooled and briefly attended community college, the oldest of four siblings who never showed signs of violence.</p><p>But sometimes even those who are closest don't see the darkness lurking under the surface.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know they're (INAUDIBLE) people. I know that they're extremely good neighbors. I like them a lot. It's extremely confusing and I don't make anything of it because it's just -- it's -- doesn't make sense. And I suppose this type of thing never does.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): Conditt lived in this house with two roommates. Those men are being questioned by authorities but have not been charged. Meanwhile, investigators searched Conditt's home, including sheds in the bomber's back yard. Investigators say they discovered a large amount of bomb making materials inside, much of it locked in one room.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's no (INAUDIBLE) devices in the house. There's poetry and a homemade school zoo. (INAUDIBLE) about it.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): The Texas governor said in an interview that investigators have discovered a treasure trove of information that could help explain a motive. (INAUDIBLE) 25-minute recording left by Conditt. which police described as a confession.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know everybody is interested in a motive and understanding why and we're never going to be able to put a ration behind these acts. But what I can tell you, having listened to that recording, he does not at all mention anything about terrorism nor does he mention anything about hate. But instead it is the outcry of a very challenged young man, talking about challenges in his personal life, that led him to this point.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): Law enforcement sources say one of the key breaks came when Conditt walked into this FedEx station in South Austin, wearing a hat, blond wig and gloves to drop off two packages.</p><p>Investigators began tracking his movements using surveillance cameras and cell phone towers, which led them to the violent ending along this interstate and perhaps a little closer to understanding why a 23-year old would unleash this kind of mayhem.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Here in Mark Conditt's neighborhood, the search continues inside his home. Investigators have cordoned off an area around it. The police chief says that that video recording was made by Conditt just hours before he was discovered.</p><p>Police chief says that he believes Conditt felt that investigators were getting closer to capturing him and that's why he made that recording -- Ed Lavandera, CNN, Pflugerville, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: CNN law enforcement contributor and retired FBI special agent Steve Moore is with us now for more on this.</p><p>Steve, let's (INAUDIBLE) reporting there about the motive. Investigators in this country are well experienced in trying to find out why young men do terrible things. Here is a little more about that recorded confession that Conditt made before he died.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have, at this point, located a recording that the suspect in this incident made. It is about a 25-minute recording, where he talks about what he has done. I would classify this as a confession.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: OK, so he knew the police were closing in. He took the time to make this confession. The police chief also described as an outcry from a challenged young man as well.</p><p>So put this together, what picture does this paint of the sort of person Conditt was and a motive?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: What it -- what the picture paints is somebody who came out of nowhere. I mean, I hate to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: -- violation.</p><p>MOORE: No, and if you look at his writings, going up through the year before the bombing, the guy was about as buttoned down and squared away as you can imagine. So I'm -- if I'm still in the bureau, I'm confused by this.</p><p>That the profilers think that they've got something here, even before they were saying, please call in, because we hear you, they believed that he had a message that he wanted to give out.</p><p>They may be wrong but they may know more about him than he did.</p><p>VAUSE: But if you wanted to give out a message, that explains the confession, doesn't it?</p><p>That may be where that message --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MOORE: It does. But if it -- the confession -- if he was putting out a message -- would have been much more of an accusation, would've been much more of a diatribe. It would've been a manifesto.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, so police are now looking and they're searching the house and they're looking at the Internet footprint, they will not say if there was a manifesto.</p><p>Would you be surprised if there was?</p><p>MOORE: I would not be surprised if there was a manifesto. But here's the other thing and this is -- this -- maybe this is just me but I've investigated before. I think it's possible that these were thrill killings.</p><p>[00:35:00]</p><p>MOORE: I have not seen bombings -- and I've investigated quite a few -- I have not seen anybody change their method of triggering the explosives, change their delivery method in the process of the whole series.</p><p>Never seen that done before. And to me, that risks your capture, that risks your detection. And so to me that's counter to a manifesto. That is putting interesting things and thrills ahead of any cause.</p><p>And I think maybe this kid woke up one day and realized, there's something wrong with me and -- I don't know. I'm putting my money on thrill killer.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. As you said, the house has been searched and this is what investigators say they found so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's primarily one room that has got a considerable amount of material. I wouldn't call it a bombmaking factory but there's definitely components consistent what we've seen in all these other devices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: OK, so we also know that his two housemates have been interviewed. They haven't been charged at this point.</p><p>But we get back to this question of how can someone be preparing with this material, admitted not a bombmaking factory but a significant amount of material in this one room of the house and yet the two housemates did not raise the alarm?</p><p>They see anything worthy or sufficiently alarming to go to the authorities?</p><p>MOORE: Well, what -- the room as they're seeing it now, as the police are seeing it now, was the way he left it after he knew he had been caught, after he knew police were onto him.</p><p>And the thing about bomb components is only one thing is usually going to look like a bomb. The rest is going to look like something like you're building a circuit board. It's going to be wires. It is going to be batteries. It is going to be a little tiny motherboard and maybe you have a pipe, maybe you have some type of device like that.</p><p>But nothing about a bomb looks like a bomb --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: What about change in behavior?</p><p>What about something in the last three weeks that would have maybe been a sign that something was up?</p><p>MOORE: I think that's very possible. But usually different people in your life have different quadrants of you. And so if the roommate saw a difference of behavior, they might not have brought it up because it might've had to do with his parents and vice versa the friends that he could have said, it's a problem with my friends.</p><p>VAUSE: Or something at work or whatever, yes.</p><p>MOORE: Right.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. His family released a statement to CNN.</p><p>It reads in part, \"We had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in. Our family is a normal family in every way. We love, we pray and we try to inspire and serve others.\"</p><p>VAUSE: Without (INAUDIBLE) and with the advantage of 20-20 hindsight, can you actually say that this is a normal family? MOORE: You can't with any kind of authority at this moment because, you know, there's one of two things here. It's either learned behavior or genetic behavior. He either has something wrong from his DNA or he has something wrong that happened as a result of growing up in that house.</p><p>And most of the time it's something that they've learned, it's learned behavior. But at this point we don't know enough about his growing up to understand which it is.</p><p>But you're absolutely right, it is hard to say that that is a normal family but they -- I give them the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>VAUSE: And clearly --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: -- but this is all part of the investigation.</p><p>MOORE: Yes, sir.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, Steve, thank you.</p><p>MOORE: Thank you.</p><p>VAUSE: Next on NEWSROOM L.A., President Trump, he's got the best words but does he actually know how to spell them?</p><p>We'll check in on the latest typos from the tweeter in chief.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[00:40:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: Keeping in mind that the president's tweets are in fact official White House statements, so maybe now's the time the president cut himself a spellcheck because right now he has taken misspelled words in all of those tweets to a whole new level. Here's Jeanne Moos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump knows we're watching his tweets with eagle eyes...</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If I do a typo, it's like death. They just go, they go wild.</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): But it was the president who went wild misspelling. Trump sets new record for most typos in one tweet. There was \"wether,\" missing an H. There was the \"the\" and three mistakes with the same word.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: He meant c-o-u-n-s-e-l.</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): Twitter helpfully pointed out the difference between special counsel, a lawyer, and a special council, as in a meeting of, say, white dogs. All those mistakes got graded and marked.</p><p>\"Hees a ideot.\"</p><p>MOOS: We welcome you to the Donald J. Trump Presidential Typos and Misspellings Hall of Fame.</p><p>Is that all spelled correctly?</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): The president got off to a fast start, the day after his inauguration, tweeting, \"I am honered to serve you.\"</p><p>\"Saving this for postority,\" joked one reporter.</p><p>But the president was so honored he later did it again.</p><p>He's misspelled everything from \"hearby\" to \"tapp\" my phones, even tapping out this unforgettable non-word, perhaps while falling asleep.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Covfefe, huh?</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): He once called something China did an \"unpresidented\" act.</p><p>TRUMP: I'm like a very smart person.</p><p>MOOS: Smart enough to misspell on purpose...</p><p>TRUMP: L-y-e-n, lyen.</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): Sure, President Trump's predecessor blew a word or two now and then --</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: When Aretha first told us what R-S-P- E-C-T.</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): But you've to respect that we can learn from President Trump's mistakes.</p><p>CUOMO: \"Wether,\" another typo.</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): \"Whether\" is no mere typo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wether.</p><p>MOOS: \"Wether\" is an actual word that means castrated ram, a male sheep. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's not a happy lamb.</p><p>MOOS (voice-over): The president may be castrating the English language, but he sure doesn't seem sheepish about it -- Jeanne Moos, CNN...</p><p>TRUMP: Trust me, I'm like a smart person.</p><p>MOOS: -- New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: It's hard to spell.

Facial recognition is being adopted rapidly, particularly in commercial settings. And I must confess I didn't know that Bernie Sanders is the only Presidential candidate to call for a ban on its use by police.  By Freddie Stuart, the producer of ourEconomy's ourVoices podcast. </p><p>He is also the co-founder of The Junction and part of the media team at The World Transformed. He tweets at @freddiestuart12. Originally published at openDemocracy[1] Last month it was revealed by the Financial Times[2] that facial recognition cameras had been used to identify pedestrians in the Granary Square area of the new Kings Cross complex in London between 2016 and 2018. Argent, the developer and asset manager charged with the design and delivery of the site, admitted[3] to the use of two CCTV cameras equipped with biometric technology to map facial features. These cameras then ran this information through a database supplied by the Metropolitan Police Service[4] to check for matches. The estate at Kings Cross is a privately owned complex, but one that is used by thousands of members of the public every day. In addition to over 2,000 homes, the area hosts a variety of shops, hotels and music venues, as well as the world-renowned Central Saint Martins School of Art. Rightly, there has been a public outcry over the covert use of this technology. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched a subsequent investigation[5], whilst London Mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the development's CEO seeking an explanation. Although it has garnered significant press attention, Kings Cross is just one example of how facial recognition technology is being rolled out across 'public' spaces in London. Last month the Evening Standard[6] revealed that planning permission has been granted by the City of London Corporation for the implementation of advanced surveillance cameras in The Barbican Centre, where 16 of the new 65 cameras will be capable of recognising faces, and possess an invasive two-way audio feature - 'potentially allowing controllers to listen in'. Meanwhile similar projects have been approved at Liberty's department store in Soho, and Hay's Galleria on the South Bank. The Financial Times[7] also exposed proposals for the installation of privately owned facial recognition cameras across the 92 acre estate at Canary Wharf. The same piece noted: 'convenience stores such as Budgens, and supermarkets - including Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer - all have cameras that are already, or soon will be, capable of facial recognition'. Just as we have been normalised to the 500,000 CCTV cameras operating across London today, facial recognition may soon become a ubiquitous norm of everyday life in the 21st century.So What's the Logic?Despite the claims of private companies that this technology is introduced solely 'to help ensure public safety[8]', research from the independent not-for-profit activist group Big Brother Watch shows that, on average, the current biometric cameras identify individuals incorrectly over 90% of the time. In its research[9], Big Brother Watch found that the Metropolitan Police's facial recognition matches were 98% inaccurate, whilst the same technology used by South Wales Police failed to find a correct match on 91% of occasions. So if the current technology isn't useful for identifying criminals, why are companies rolling it out across the capital? Do private companies currently have such insurgent security issues that the testing of facial recognition technology is a necessary breach of individual privacy? Another explanation for this insistence is the potential monetisation of valuable data inherent in surveillance technology. In our modern economy, data has become a prized economic resource. Once aggregated and refined, collections of data can create powerful predictive models of human behaviour, which provide valuable information to instruct business decisions. In her recent book, 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism', Shoshana Zubouff has popularised discussions of how this plays out in our modern digital economy. She explains how the value of this new resource has led to a race to extract data, with tech companies utilising digital platforms as a medium of user engagement, and thus a mechanism of data generation. This has led to covert surveillance techniques in the online marketplace, where sites used by members of the public are owned and surveyed by private companies. It has now become commonplace to hear of Google using your individual searches to sell targeted ads, Twitter promoting content on your feed based on who you follow, or Facebook data being scraped to enhance political campaigns. But while the centrality of data to the business models of tech companies is well-documented, the collection of data in privately owned physical space is a relatively unexplored phenomenon. Just as tech firms control much of the publicly-used internet, ownership of open space is increasingly being taken on by private corporations. In 2017 The Guardian published a map[10] of what it called the growth of 'pseudo-public' spaces in London - 'open and publicly accessible locations that are owned and maintained by private developers or other private companies'. In the same way that the ownership of online platforms is used as space to collect personal information, these physical spaces could soon become the real-world data mines of private firms. Here, visual surveillance plays a leading role. If a company is able to identify even the rough demographic of pedestrians in areas such as Kings Cross, it can sell this as valuable information to businesses, enabling informed decisions on issues such as location, opening hours or advertisements. More advanced facial recognition technology may be able to identify the individual, and advise companies looking to tailor their products in real-time. Once perfected, the ultimate potential here is for facial recognition to match an individual to their digital online profile, connecting the physical data with its digital counterpart. This would enable fine-grain control for firms, altering displays such as digital advertisements in response to detailed information on their particular audience. In short, just as big tech companies utilise data to tailor our interaction with the digital world, facial recognition technology presupposes a panoptic physical world of administered perception.Sounding Like a Far-Fetched Dystopian Nightmare? It Isn't.A recent report[11] from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that 'AI surveillance technology is spreading at a faster rate to a wider range of countries than experts have commonly understood'. According to the report's executive summary 'at least seventy-five out of 176 countries globally are actively using AI technologies for surveillance purposes. This includes: smart city/safe city platforms (fifty-six countries), facial recognition systems (sixty-four countries), and smart policing (fifty-two countries)' The most prominent distribution of this technology is by Chinese companies, which supply AI surveillance technology in sixty-three countries. Thirty-two countries are supplied with similar technology by companies based in the US. There are many leading examples of how this surveillance technology is used for datafication. In the US, a company called Cooler Screens[12] has embedded products with sensors and digital screens to individually target advertisements at customers. Walgreens is now rolling out this technology[13], which seeks to analyse a customer's age, gender, time spent browsing, and even emotional responses. Similar technologies were discovered in malls in Canada in 2018, when the media outlet CBC reported[14] that facial recognition had been used to predict the approximate age and gender of customers. The technology was only discovered when 'a visitor to Chinook Centre in south Calgary spotted a browser window that had seemingly accidentally been left open on one of the mall's directories'. Perhaps most relevant for exploring the datafication of facial recognition is the app FindFace[15]. FindFace, which launched in Russia in 2016, made it possible to find an individual's social media profile simply by capturing an image of their face. In 2016, the Independent[16] reported that 'FindFace's creators are working with Moscow police to integrate their software into the city's CCTV camera network, so authorities will be able to detect wanted suspects as they walk down the street'. FindFace is no longer open for public use, but a similar company SearchFace is now operating in Russia. Each of these cases demonstrates the capability of surveillance cameras to advance mechanisms of datafication into the real world, analysing, contextualising and commodifying our physical data. The threat this poses to our right to privacy is obvious, but it also undermines the agency of the individual by denying the notion of truly public space. At its heart, this marketisation threatens to dispossess humans of their independence in the name of 'convenience', and by doing so challenges the very notion of individual freedom.So What Is To Be Done?In the UK, the use of facial recognition technology to monitor members of the public for commercial purposes is illegal without prior notice. This is in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation from the EU, which attempts to roll back on the datafication of the social commons by mandating private companies to obtain explicit consent from individuals prior to the collection of sensitive personal data. In cases such as Kings Cross however, the quoted intention is not commodification but securitisation: 'to help the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police prevent and detect crime in the neighbourhood'[17]. According to a current high court ruling[18] issued in Cardiff earlier this month, the use of facial recognition by the police is permissible, despite judges acknowledging that this technology interferes with fundamental privacy rights. As it stands, there are no checks and balances on the use of facial recognition by private firms, if they are issued as part of a security strategy. Yet as the prevalence and sophistication of surveillance technology becomes unearthed, many are beginning to challenge this reality. In July, the Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology published a report[19] by the Biometrics Commissioner and the Forensic Science Regulator which called for 'a moratorium on the current use of facial recognition technology' and noted that 'no further trials should take place until a legislative framework has been introduced and guidance on trial protocols, and an oversight and evaluation system, has been established'. In a similar vein, the human rights group Liberty has launched a petition[20] for the Home Secretary to ban the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. They also intend to appeal the high court ruling against the lawful use of biometric surveillance by the police. In the United States, Bernie Sanders is the first 2020 Democratic nominee to promise a ban[21] on all facial recognition technology by the police, putting pressure on others to take a tougher stance against covert surveillance. These responses are the start of a much-needed backlash against invasive technology, and the potential datafication of the public sphere. Just as a fierce struggle has retrospectively begun over the human right to autonomy in the digital commons, a battle must now begin over our individual rights in physical space. We must draw definitive red lines when it comes to the extraction and use of all kinds of personal data, whilst fundamentally reimagining the use and control of privately owned public spaces. To democratically channel the power of modern technology, we need new models of data and land ownership fit for our age. Failing this, our valuable open spaces like Kings Cross may yet become the real-world data mines of 21st century surveillance capitalists.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/09/how-facial-recognition-technology-is-bringing-surveillance-capitalism-to-our-streets.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/09/how-facial-recognition-technology-is-bringing-surveillance-capitalism-to-our-streets.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> ;This entry was posted in Guest Post[22], Politics[23], Surveillance state[24], Technology and innovation[25] on September 28, 2019[26] by Yves Smith[27].

Despite low expectations for corporate earnings the sharemarket eked out yet another record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Expectations are very low. Consensus forecasts for the June quarter earnings are for a decline of 2.8 per cent. Of those companies that have previously provided specific guidance, nearly 80 per cent have lowered their forecast earnings per share.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that were to transpire it would mean the second successive quarter of negative earnings growth or, as some have dubbed it, an \"earnings recession\".</p><p>The recession may not eventuate, given the propensity of companies to talk down expectations to create a low bar for performance and a capacity to surprise modestly on the upside.</p><p>The contrast between what's already occurred and is now expected and the record levels of the US sharemarket, however, underscores how little that the underlying condition of US companies has had to do with the market's near 20 per cent surge since the start of the year.</p><p>That push back to record levels after a brutal final quarter of 2018 reflects the evolution of the US Federal Reserve Board's members from hawks last year, to a more passive \"patient\" mindset at the start of this year and, more recently, to doves foreshadowing an imminent rate cut. It is the Fed, and the expectation that US rates will start falling again, that is underpinning the market, rather than the fundamentals of corporate performance.</p><p>If that rate cut doesn't eventuate at the next Fed Open Market Committee meeting at the end of the month - and recent positive employment and inflation data might still give the Fed pause for thought - it won't matter how good, or poor, the earnings season might be.</p><p>There would almost certainly be a sell-off with flow-on effects to other equity markets.</p><p>While the US market did edge up on Monday, there was a cautious tone to the trading. That's despite a respectable result, slightly ahead of expectations, from the first of the big US banks to report.</p><p>Citigroup comfortably beat analysts' forecasts with a 7 per cent gain in earnings but the result did include a gain from an investment in a trading platform and the market appeared more focused on weak trading revenues and pressure on its net interest margins than on the bottom line.</p><p>A better picture of the key big bank performance will come on Tuesday (US time), with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs to report. By the end of the week nearly 840 companies will have released their earnings, with nearly 2400 scheduled for next week.</p><p>There will be a particular focus on those companies directly or indirectly exposed to the US trade war with China.</p><p>With the US raising the rate of the tariffs on $US250 billion of China's exports in May, those companies would now be starting to feel the effects of the higher prices from the tariffs and the disruptions to global supply chains as they, or their suppliers, try to absorb them or pass the costs on to customers.</p><p>The performance of the technology companies will also be closely scrutinised. It is a sector expected to perform particularly poorly. Higher labour costs in a tight and competitive employment market and exposures to the trade war and a slowing global economy could unravel what are very ambitious price-earnings multiples.</p><p>The really big tech companies that have helped power the market to record levels - giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - are also facing higher regulatory costs and ad hoc tax increases around the world. Apple is also being impacted by the tensions between the US and China.</p><p>The awkward juxtaposition of weak corporate earnings amid a weak and fragile global environment and a record sharemarket looks even stranger when one considers that, around the world, about 25 per cent of the global bonds on issue - including billions of dollars of high-yield, or \"junk\" bonds - have negative yields.</p><p>That's a sign that (a) bond investors are a lot more pessimistic about the outlook than equity investors and (b) they expect central banks to push interest rates a lot lower, or in the case of Europe even deeper into negative territory.</p><p>Rationalising record or near-record levels for sharemarkets on the basis that there's no alternative that produces a semi-reasonable return - the major influence on equity markets since the financial crisis caused the major central banks to embrace unconventional monetary policies - is ultimately an unsustainable proposition, even though it has already been sustained for more than a decade.</p><p>If US corporate earnings outperform expectations; if the trade stand-off with China is resolved without further friction; if Donald Trump can restrain himself and his trade hawks from expanding their trade war to the Eurozone and elsewhere; and if the Fed remains dovish even as the threats to US growth diminish, the fundamentals of US corporate performance might catch up with the valuations.</p><p>If none of those things eventuate the global economy, already slowing, will again be on the verge of recession and the big central banks will again push deep into unconventional policies, giving investors everywhere few options but, perversely, to continue holding equities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc768sy5wtvmvoi9a2842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK8-C6J1-JD34-V4N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Despite low expectations for corporate earnings the sharemarket eked out yet another record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Expectations are very low. Consensus forecasts for the June quarter earnings are for a decline of 2.8 per cent. Of those companies that have previously provided specific guidance, nearly 80 per cent have lowered their forecast earnings per share.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that were to transpire it would mean the second successive quarter of negative earnings growth or, as some have dubbed it, an \"earnings recession\".</p><p>The recession may not eventuate, given the propensity of companies to talk down expectations to create a low bar for performance and a capacity to surprise modestly on the upside.</p><p>The contrast between what's already occurred and is now expected and the record levels of the US sharemarket, however, underscores how little that the underlying condition of US companies has had to do with the market's near 20 per cent surge since the start of the year.</p><p>That push back to record levels after a brutal final quarter of 2018 reflects the evolution of the US Federal Reserve Board's members from hawks last year, to a more passive \"patient\" mindset at the start of this year and, more recently, to doves foreshadowing an imminent rate cut. It is the Fed, and the expectation that US rates will start falling again, that is underpinning the market, rather than the fundamentals of corporate performance.</p><p>If that rate cut doesn't eventuate at the next Fed Open Market Committee meeting at the end of the month - and recent positive employment and inflation data might still give the Fed pause for thought - it won't matter how good, or poor, the earnings season might be.</p><p>There would almost certainly be a sell-off with flow-on effects to other equity markets.</p><p>While the US market did edge up on Monday, there was a cautious tone to the trading. That's despite a respectable result, slightly ahead of expectations, from the first of the big US banks to report.</p><p>Citigroup comfortably beat analysts' forecasts with a 7 per cent gain in earnings but the result did include a gain from an investment in a trading platform and the market appeared more focused on weak trading revenues and pressure on its net interest margins than on the bottom line.</p><p>A better picture of the key big bank performance will come on Tuesday (US time), with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs to report. By the end of the week nearly 840 companies will have released their earnings, with nearly 2400 scheduled for next week.</p><p>There will be a particular focus on those companies directly or indirectly exposed to the US trade war with China.</p><p>With the US raising the rate of the tariffs on $US250 billion of China's exports in May, those companies would now be starting to feel the effects of the higher prices from the tariffs and the disruptions to global supply chains as they, or their suppliers, try to absorb them or pass the costs on to customers.</p><p>The performance of the technology companies will also be closely scrutinised. It is a sector expected to perform particularly poorly. Higher labour costs in a tight and competitive employment market and exposures to the trade war and a slowing global economy could unravel what are very ambitious price-earnings multiples.</p><p>The really big tech companies that have helped power the market to record levels - giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - are also facing higher regulatory costs and ad hoc tax increases around the world. Apple is also being impacted by the tensions between the US and China.</p><p>The awkward juxtaposition of weak corporate earnings amid a weak and fragile global environment and a record sharemarket looks even stranger when one considers that, around the world, about 25 per cent of the global bonds on issue - including billions of dollars of high-yield, or \"junk\" bonds - have negative yields.</p><p>That's a sign that (a) bond investors are a lot more pessimistic about the outlook than equity investors and (b) they expect central banks to push interest rates a lot lower, or in the case of Europe even deeper into negative territory.</p><p>Rationalising record or near-record levels for sharemarkets on the basis that there's no alternative that produces a semi-reasonable return - the major influence on equity markets since the financial crisis caused the major central banks to embrace unconventional monetary policies - is ultimately an unsustainable proposition, even though it has already been sustained for more than a decade.</p><p>If US corporate earnings outperform expectations; if the trade stand-off with China is resolved without further friction; if Donald Trump can restrain himself and his trade hawks from expanding their trade war to the Eurozone and elsewhere; and if the Fed remains dovish even as the threats to US growth diminish, the fundamentals of US corporate performance might catch up with the valuations.</p><p>If none of those things eventuate the global economy, already slowing, will again be on the verge of recession and the big central banks will again push deep into unconventional policies, giving investors everywhere few options but, perversely, to continue holding equities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc768spxdi71x8wrk0842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK8-C6J1-JD34-V4FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Shares are now down 20% from their highs about five weeks ago. The move has some investors thinking it's time to buy the dip.

Resistance in that $1,290 to $1,300 range is evident, with shares recently failing in this area after reporting earnings in April. Since then, it's been a tough ride for investors.</p><p>The 20-day and 50-day moving averages immediately began acting as resistance and even the 200-day couldn't buoy GOOGL stock. Like the 200-day, $1,120 offered temporary reprieve, but was no match for the selling pressure. And that was <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">before</emphasis> the DoJ news.</p><p>So where are we now?</p><p>Alphabet stock is sort of in no man's land here. Some could argue that $1,040 attracted buyers during the fourth-quarter meltdown, but there were irrational spikes lower. Ultimately the $1,010 level is a more attractive level to nibble Alphabet stock for a longer term hold. If we get further selling pressure later this month -- both in Alphabet and the broader market -- we could see sub-$1,000 on GOOGL stock.

Although there's a set of updated standards, these new regulations are challenging the way the payments industry operates and have brought on a stream of opportunities for fintech companies. Sushil Kuner from Gowling WLG[1] says: 'With PSD2 the banks' unique control over customers' data has disappeared. Now, with open banking, bank customers are able to give third party providers permission to retrieve their account data from the banks. </p><p>'This could pave the way for Big Tech to engage in the provision of payment services on a large scale.'The power of dataFintech companies recognise the power of data and how it can increase customer loyalty, revenue and brand value. However, these businesses need to ensure that they have the right capabilities in place to adhere with new regulations around customer data protection and security. UK workers place greater importance on their mental health than physical health[2] Consumers have typically put their trust behind traditional banks, however in the last few years we've seen a switch from traditional financial services[3] institutions to challenger fintech companies. Traditional financial services firms may have an established customer base on their side, but fintechs offer a more customised solution, are faster, more agile, and multichannel. New regulations have created more opportunity to innovate and for fintechs to partner with larger organisations to leverage their agility and technological edge and keep the industry competitive. Kuner adds: 'Equally, banks are increasingly eager to collaborate with fintech startups/ entrepreneurs to harness new technology and the power of data to help them remain competitive.'A report published by Oracle has revealed that less than 40% of companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are confident they can 'master their data' - this means the way they manage, secure and gain insight from their datasets and use it responsibly. DPR and ClearBank announce integrated partnership[4] Data is key for fintech companies as they launch new products based on analysing customer interaction, spending habits, and even insight into their bank balance. Traditional financial services still have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to harnessing the power of data.The Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) has been met with a series of challenges from merchants and acquirers. New rules under PSD2 mean that transactions above \u20ac30 (based on certain merchants) will require SCA and Two-Factor Authentication to place more security and scrutiny on a business' capability to detect and prevent fraud. 'Two-Factor Authentication is essentially a double layer authentication process that is based on the use of two or more elements categorised as knowledge, possession and inherence,' says Sushi Kuner. 'Knowledge means something only the user knows, the typical example being a password. Possession means something that only the user possesses and this can include a smartwatch, for example, or a security device issued by a bank to enable an individual to access online banking services. Finally, Inherence relates to something the user is, for example biometric data such as a fingerprint or facial recognition.' KPMG report shows VC investments up 19% on previous quarter[5] Jeremy King, international director of PCI Security Standards Council says that in order to face the challenges, as an industry we are 'trying to find a way for our standards to simply find a process for anybody in this room to be able to undertake payments in whatever sector in a frictionless way.'However it's clear that while PSD2 puts a series of limitations on spending for merchants and perhaps slows down the consumer journey, it also fosters greater innovation. Fintech companies have started to work with larger ecommerce businesses and cybersecurity experts to ensure they have the processes in place to comply with the regulation. This can also lead to new products, services and platforms being built from analysing how consumers are transacting with the new limitations.GDPR pushes for greater transparency The General Data Protection Act encourages stricter guidelines around data and considerations to be taken early on by business across Europe.More regulated fintechs in the UK will impact the way international companies handle their business, as they must consider that each new market must navigate the varying legal regimes and requirements and make costly infrastructural investments - with high potential costs (fines, operating restrictions, even criminal culpability for business owners) for getting it wrong.In order for fintechs to stay ahead of innovation and avoid any complications with data protection, it's important to have transparency on data strategies.Most businesses work with third-party businesses and these companies can provide a lot of data back into the business, so it's important to have a concrete strategy on how marketers and publishers implement a strategy around the security of data, that they know the source and trust the reliability.A recent EY report[6] revealed that consumers still worry about the security implications of their data and privacy, and that four in ten households don't believe their personal data will ever be fully secure, and it comes as no surprise.Firms need to have appropriate systems and controls in place, including robust stress testing, and should ensure that data is protected and that systems cannot be hacked or penetrated by external parties.Fintech companies operating within the EU, especially those handling large data sets and aggregating data to create personalised experiences need to bolster their security to ensure that they are following the guidelines associated with any security breaches, costs of processing data and protecting data privacy. Sushil Kuner[7] adds: 'Combating financial crime (including fraud) and promoting cyber resilience are two of the highest priorities for regulators around the world. While GDPR and PSD2 offer enhanced protections for consumers and financial services firms, they also bring opportunities to enhance competition in the interests of consumers and the economy as a whole.'Regulation will only get tougher in the UK, and it's important for fintech companies to stay ahead of the curve, collaborate with businesses to leverage their technology and build their brand as a reputable and trustworthy entity that fosters innovation.For more information, insight and advise on regulation in technology click here[8].

This week:\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          The biggest story: How France wants to \"reform\" Islam       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2015, more than 230 people in France have been killed in terrorist attacks, most of them perpetrated by French or other European nationals affiliated with or inspired by the Islamic State. Meanwhile, as many as\u00a01,910 French nationals\u00a0have gone to wage jihad in Iraq and Syria, according to the Soufan Center, which studies radicalization.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">France has agonized over how to intervene: what might work and what the government's proper role should be. Already, there have been missteps. Now, <person><nameText>President Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>has embarked on a controversial quest to restructure Islam in France - with the goal of integration but also prevention of radicalization.</p><p>                       Read the full story by James McAuley in Paris.                 </p><p>          Six\u00a0other important stories       </p><p>          1.\u00a0For Europe's criminals and terrorists, buying a gun is getting easier       </p><p>There was a time in Europe when it was easier for terrorists to buy chemicals\u00a0and build bombs than to\u00a0obtain a military-style firearm. Then came the November 2015 Paris attacks that served as a devastating wake-up call for how much the threat posed by terrorists, and their weapons, had changed. Now, an international group of researchers is warning that the firearms trade that enabled\u00a0militants to obtain those assault rifles is in fact still expanding.</p><p>                       Read the full story.                 </p><p>          2.\u00a0Were the Syria strikes by Britain, France and the U.S. a success?       </p><p>The leaders of France and Britain used phrases such as \"red line\" and \"horrific suffering\" on Saturday to defend their decisions to join the\u00a0U.S.-led strike against Syria\u00a0for its suspected chemical attack. France and Britain stressed that their military response was limited, successful and not designed to topple the regime of President Bashar al-Assad,              write\u00a0Karla Adam, James McAuley and William Booth.                 </p><p>But Washington Post foreign affairs writer Ishaan Tharoor argues that the Trump-led mission failed on a number of fronts.\u00a0\"The president's dilemma is that strength and resolve do not necessarily equal a well-thought-out Syria strategy,\"\u00a0Tharoor quotes his\u00a0colleague Greg Jaffe.</p><p>                       You can read the full analysis here.                 </p><p>          3.\u00a0South Korea says it will lay the groundwork for Trump to talk to Kim about nuclear weapons       </p><p>South Korea and the United States are looking for a way to guarantee \"a bright future\" for North Korea if its leader, Kim Jong Un, will give up his nuclear weapons program, the national security adviser in Seoul said this week, as preparations for next week's inter-Korean summit gather pace,              writes Anna Fifield.                 </p><p>The comments came as The Washington Post revealed that\u00a0CIA Director <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo </nameText></person>had made a top-secret visit to North Korea over Easter weekend where he met with Kim Jong Un to\u00a0lay the groundwork for direct talks\u00a0with President Trump.</p><p>                       Here are three of the key issues they likely discussed.                 </p><p>          4.\u00a0Scientists can't explain why diplomats in Cuba are suffering from 'traumatic brain injury'       </p><p>While U.S. diplomacy with North Korea\u00a0has raised hopes for a permanent peace deal, relations with Cuba are deteriorating.\u00a0For two years, U.S. diplomats posted to Cuba have been suffering a mysterious illness. They say they have heard painful, high-pitched noises and lost their hearing, and scientists still can't explain why the victims are suffering from \"traumatic brain injury,\"              writes Amanda Erickson.                 </p><p>          The end of\u00a0Cuba's Castro era       </p><p>Could a change in leadership\u00a0help to shed light\u00a0on the mysterious injuries?

Then there is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f629ead0-d40f-43ba-b104-95b1e02fe174\"> corporate credit</url>, a crucial area of fixed income that has been backstopped by several central banks and for good reason.</p><p>No one wants the current pandemic recession to become a financial crisis via a surge in credit market volatility. The ultimate backstop has not just reversed the pandemic-inspired rout of credit \u2014 with the Moody\u2019s Baa credit index now yielding less than its February level \u2014 it also triggered an avalanche of corporate debt sales. This has bought companies breathing room and allowed them to amass reserves that hopefully tide them over until the economy recovers. </p><p>Bond fund managers have lapped up the record pace of new debt sales since March. By the end of June US investment grade debt sales totalled $1,225bn for the year to date versus $597.4bn over the same period in 2019, according to Sifma. In contrast, sales of high-yield debt have lagged, reflecting the greater risk of a default wave rippling through this riskier slice of the credit market. Sifma shows high-yield sales running at $200bn so far this year to the end of June, versus a figure of $137.4bn for the same period in 2019. </p><p>So far this month new issuance activity has dwindled as shown here from Bank of America: </p><p>Betting on investment grade has clearly been a big and rewarding trade as highlighted by this link to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/bloomberg-barclays-indices\"> Bloomberg Barclays credit indices</url>. Cash has poured into bond funds and is still running at a near record pace of inflows. That needs to find a home and for asset managers, nothing looks so attractive as an asset class taking up space on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. The ensuing strong performance of credit has duly compelled managers to buy into the asset class and not lag their bond benchmarks. </p><p>Now comes the hard part, or namely, what next? The bullish case for credit from here rests on a default cycle that shows a lot less teeth \u2014 although that leaves a bigger legacy of zombie companies \u2014 setting the stage for high yield outperforming. A critical ingredient for this scenario is a stronger than anticipated global and US recovery from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\"> Covid-19</url> which is very much a point of conjecture at the moment. </p><p>Within investment grade, an improving macro picture suggests squeezing more out of the triple B-rated segment given that higher quality paper \u2014 double B and A-rated debt \u2014 have outperformed up to now. But the impressive recovery in credit leaves some sweating. </p><p>Analysts at Unigestion note risk premiums for both investment grade and high yield on both sides of the Atlantic look rich and suggest modest returns from here:</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cCurrent spread levels in investment grade (sub 70 basis points in both US and Europe credit default swap indices) and high yield (450bp in the US and 340bp in Europe) have historically returned 0.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent in the three months that followed. This measure rises to 0.4 per cent and 3 per cent over a 12-month horizon.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>One credit market development in recent years has been the growing role of tourist money, whereby investors with broad mandates hunt for returns across a wide range of asset classes. This aspect was well-established before the pandemic erupted and was one catalyst for the dramatic surge in credit risk premiums during March. It also explains the substantial rescue efforts from the US Fed. Clearly, this is a central bank that appreciates an acute point of vulnerability within the financial system and why it is now buying specific corporate bonds.</p><p>Contain credit stress and you appease the equity market is the current policy approach. Hence the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200728a.htm\"> Fed\u2019s announcement today</url> that its little used credit lending programmes will be extended after September until the end of the year.</p><p>This leaves investors gauging whether the economy and companies muddle through the pandemic versus alternative outcomes that up the ante in terms of market turmoil. </p><p>A nasty downgrade and default cycle, distinguished by mediocre recovery rates, will test investors and bond funds. A sharper rebound for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/global-economy\"> economy</url> along with a dash of inflationary pressure will also prompt quite an exit trade from credit, led by the tourist money crowd. </p><p>In both scenarios, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/central-banks\"> central banks</url> will have their work cut out to stem credit angst, particularly given how companies have sought to extend the average maturity of their debt in recent months. </p><p>Over at Bank of America, its analysts highlight how duration in US investment grade credit extends \u201cto a record 8.38\u00a0years, which means other types of investors that are more sensitive to mark-to-market risk have more yield-risk than at any time in the past\u201d.</p><p>This means that a change in yields triggers a bigger response in debt prices. That works great in price terms when yields are falling and explains why some credit bulls anticipate there remains scope for more capital gains in the near term. But once yields start rising, prices fall a lot harder for bonds with a greater duration. That\u2019s where the recent rush into credit \u2014 and with companies selling longer-dated debt \u2014 may have sown a bitter harvest. </p><p>\u201cLow reward, high risk\u201d says BofA and that\u2019s easy to appreciate at this stage for much of the credit market. </p><p>Quick Hits \u2014 What\u2019s on the markets radar?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One way of looking at the US companies</emphasis> set to testify before the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday is that collectively Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google combine for a 16 per cent weighting of the S&amp;P 500 index. That\u2019s a bigger slice than all major S&amp;P 500 sectors, apart from technology (at 26 per cent). </p><p>Tomorrow\u2019s hearing is a reminder for investors that regulatory risk stalks big tech and why a sweep in November by Democrats might shake the foundations of the US market. But in the Washington swamp, don\u2019t forget lobbying is a company\u2019s best friend. Just ask big banks about their post-financial crisis efforts. </p><p>DataTrek highlights another list of impressive numbers that suggest Amazon and Facebook are feeling a little more heat than Apple and Google of late: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cAmazon spent a quarterly record on lobbying last quarter ($4.66m in Q2 2020, up from Q1\u2019s $4.51m), while Facebook spent even more than AMZN after hitting a quarterly record in Q1 ($4.83m in Q2 after a record $5.26m in Q1).\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>The takeaway for investors says DataTrek: </p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\u201cLobby spending is a productive way to assess single stock regulatory risk since it reflects how much pressure the companies themselves feel.\u201d</p></bodyText></excerpt></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-767e6fadb9b741ab9102837648cae4ba</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-H2D1-JB77-K0GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1111\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>BAC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>BAC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>8648 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Asset and Liability Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRBNTJEQ0ZBMzU4NDJENEE3MzQ1MDgyNTYxQjU3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYwNzU1MEY2MzcyNDc1QUEzMjIyMkVGNDdBRTkxOUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Credit Risk Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njc1MDJDMkI2RENCNDBBQ0JGQkNFNkYxN0I4QTdBOTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0YzM0JGNzQ2OEE2NDk3OUFCMzM3MUU4QTYxNTEwNTY</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

(NYSE: FB) and Mark Zuckerberg. In the wake of revelations that <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dmnews.com/social-media/7-things-facebook-needs-to-do-to-survive-the-cambridge-analytica-scandal/article/752199/\">data from 50 million users was acquired by political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica</url> without their permission, the company's stock plummeted, with ~100 billion shed off the market cap by the time the bell closed late last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 33-year-old CEO has also been called on and agreed to testify before Congress, putting pressure on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to join him in front of Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley's data privacy hearing on April 10 - a hearing that has the potential to radically change the way American citizens and lawmakers view big tech.</p><p>News also surfaced last week that FB would cut off third-party data access, meaning that businesses advertising on Facebook will lose the ability to use data from Acxiom, Experian and other such services to narrow the group of people who might see their ads.</p><p>As the GDPR enactment date in the EU bloc draws near, raising the profile on data regulation worldwide, Silicon Valley giants are scrambling to notify users of impending changes to data protection policies. And with the knowledge of GDPR hitting more mainstream discussion, people are wondering if GDPR would have stopped the FB data leak from happening.</p><h> FTC Agreement </h><p>In 2011, Facebook entered settlement agreements with the FTC after charges that it \"deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowed it to be shared and made public\" an FTC press release said at the time. The settlement required Facebook to take several steps to make sure it maintained promises in the future, including giving consumers clear and prominent notice and obtaining consumers' express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2011/11/111129facebookagree.pdf\">According to the consent order</url> , Facebook was:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Barred from making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers' personal information;  Required to obtain consumers' affirmative express consent before enacting changes that override their privacy preferences;  Required to prevent anyone from accessing a user's material more than 30 days after the user has deleted his or her account;  Required to establish and maintain a comprehensive privacy program designed to address privacy risks associated with the development and management of new and existing products and services, and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of consumers' information; and  Required, within 180 days, and every two years after that for the next 20 years, to obtain independent, third-party audits certifying that it has a privacy program in place that meets or exceeds the requirements of the FTC order, and to ensure that the privacy of consumers' information is protected.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>To reiterate, this was in 2011 - or, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">seven years ago</emphasis>. Chalk it up to bureaucratic inefficiency or big corporate entitlement, but the \"promise\" to the FTC was a broken promise, which begs the question: If GDPR had been in place, would it have stopped the Cambridge Analytica breach from happening? The short answer is yes, but why?</p><h> GDPR and Facebook </h><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dmnews.com/marketing-strategy/what-gdpr-means-for-us-brands/article/738619/\">As we've covered numerous times before at DMN</url> , at a base level, GDPR gives consumers ownership control over their personal data, including the right to decide whether to share it or not, and to delete it. While both the EU and the US have strands of data protection laws and programs in place, GDPR has a wider scope, more prescriptive standards, and substantial fines. For example, it requires a higher standard of consent for using some types of data, and broadens individuals' rights with respect to accessing and porting their data. It also establishes significant enforcement powers, allowing a company's supervisory authority to seek fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue for certain violations.</p><p>According to a corporate statement, \"[Facebook] will comply with current EU data protection law, and will comply with the GDPR. Our GDPR preparations are well underway, supported by the largest cross-functional team in Facebook's history. We're also expanding our Dublin-led data protection team which is leading on these efforts.\"</p><p>Key points of GDPR that would have prevented the Cambridge Analytica scandal include:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Contractual Necessity  Data processed must be necessary for the Service and defined in the contract with the individual  Consent </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Requires a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent by clear affirmative action </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> People have a right to withdraw consent, which must be brought to their attention </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Must be from a person over the age of consent specified in that Member State, otherwise given by or authorized by a parent / guardian </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Explicit consent is required for some processing (e.g., special categories of personal data)  Legitimate Interests </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> If a business or a third party has legitimate interests which are not overridden by individuals' rights or interests. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Processing must be paused if objection is raised by an individual </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>It will be interesting to see how Facebook continues to evolve under GDPR and under whatever data protections the US puts in place following the April 10 hearing. Compliance (and strict compliance) will be the key ingredient to rebuilding lost consumer trust with the social media platform -- even if it is a bit too late.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DMNWSH-755194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DMNWSH2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S41-XHH1-JDRS-7091-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Haymarket Media.

Parked on the sixth floor of a drab, anonymous government building in Hamburg, it is a far cry from the sweet dispensers and mini golf course of Google's HQ nearby. Yet this office, with its small budget and 20 staff, has issued orders and fines that have made American tech giants sit up and take notice. In Britain, we often hear that regulating social media is impossible or prohibitively difficult, and that any attempt would risk driving companies abroad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Germany, however, has already implemented protection against online abuse and under age access - and tech companies, far from fleeing, are staying and complying. So as MPs mull the impact of fake news and The Daily Telegraph campaigns to make the internet safer for young people, what can Britain learn?</p><p>\"We have different cultural habits on enforcing the law in Germany,\" says Dr Caspar, Hamburg's data protection commissioner. \"When you look at colleagues outside continental Europe, we are more regulating and enforcing laws and they are more negotiating and trying to get answers by communication.\" A former law professor, Dr Caspar has repeatedly taken on the big tech companies with headquarters in his jurisdiction. In 2013, he fined Google for illegally collecting data from open Wi-Fi networks with its Street View camera vans; in 2017 he ordered Facebook not to transfer user data from Whatsapp.</p><p>Ulrich K\u00fchn, his deputy, says: \"My impression is that [tech firms] don't care about privacy. If you compare privacy to the business models of these companies, they are diametrically opposed. I don't know any of them that didn't grow by breaching privacy principles.\"</p><p>Therefore, says Dr Caspar, financial pressure is required: \"If they don't have the threat of higher fines, they won't do anything.\" Until recently, neither Britain nor Germany had this power: Google's fine in 2013 was around \u00a3120million, while Facebook paid only \u00a3500,000 in Britain - less than 0.01 per cent of its revenue - for the Cambridge Analytica data breach. Now the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives states the power to levy fines of up to 4 per cent of revenue, and the British government plans to keep that after Brexit. Still, Dr Caspar believes this will be purely theoretical unless regulators wield it.</p><p>An example of Germany's ferocity is the Network Enforcement Act, or NETZDG. Passed in a hurry last year amid fears that the 2017 federal election would be flooded with fake news, after two years of fruitless discussions with tech companies, it aimed to enforce Germany's laws against hate speech, threats and incitement to crime online. Under it, social networks must block illegal content within a week and \"obviously illegal\" content within 24 hours; failure to do so can result in a fine of 50million euros. \"Facebook had said to German legislators that for them German law is basically irrelevant, and it's only EU standards that apply,\" says Tankred Schipanski, digital spokesman for the ruling CDU party. \"A newspaper is liable and responsible for when it violates someone's rights. The same should be applied to social media companies.\"</p><p>The law is controversial: far-Right populists call it an establishment stitch-up, proclaiming \"the end of free speech\", while human rights groups warn it will turn private companies into risk-averse censors that \"overblock\" to avoid fines.</p><p>Judith Steinbrecher, of Bitkom, representing German tech firms including Facebook, says it \"infringes freedom of expression\" and might even \"intensify populism\" by suppressing debate. High-profile early deletions include two joke tweets from the satirical magazine Titanic. But the evidence six months in shows little sign of \"overblocking\". Statistics released by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube did indeed show that hundreds of thousands of posts and videos were reported. Only a small amount, however - between 11 and 27 per cent - led to action. The vast majority were closed within 24 hours, indicating the companies themselves regarded them as clear-cut. In murkier cases, they consulted lawyers.</p><p>Mr Schipanski admits there is more work to be done. Facebook has been criticised for making its NETZDG reporting system too complicated, and Germany is considering changing the law so users can challenge wrongful deletions. But, he said, the principle can be extended to other countries.</p><p>The EU is considering legislation on similar principles, while France, Israel, Italy and Canada have all contacted the German government for guidance.</p><p>Less controversial are Germany's systems for protecting children. In Britain, plans to make all pornographic websites verify their users' age or be blocked by internet service providers have been pushed back due to privacy fears and technical issues. But in Germany, age verification has been widely used and accepted since 2003.</p><p>Users can register themselves at the post office, to a postman on their doorstep, at the bank or to call centre staff on a webcam, and subsequently log in with a pin number, an ID code or SIM card. Ironically, Germany lacks the power to enforce regulations on foreign firms due to opposition from civil libertarians. But Britain has been blocking child porn and pirated music since 2013 - something Mr Schipanski thinks Germany could adopt.</p><p>Germany also has stricter protections for children's data. GDPR allows member states to set an \"age of consent\" below which companies may not process someone's personal data without permission from parents. By default, this age is 16 - but Britain has it set at 13, the age cited in most US tech firms' terms of service.</p><p>Germany has kept it at 16, with the result that social media companies have had to change the system for users below that age. On Facebook, for example, you cannot display \"sensitive\" personal data, such as religious views and sexual orientation, on your profile without parental consent. Advertising is only targeted based on age, location and gender, never on anything \"liked\" or posted. The problem with all such systems is the lack of serious age verification. Most social networks simply ask users to enter a birth date when they sign up, and accept what is declared. Facebook's parental consent system can be easily fooled.</p><p>According to Dr Caspar, this may be unavoidable: asking children to verify their age would paradoxically require asking for even more personal data.</p><p>But Mr K\u00fchn also believes there are other options. \"It's interesting that the tech industry, with all its imagination and financial resources, has never come up with anything else,\" he says. \"I'm not sure why the industry is so reluctant.\"</p><p>Jan Albrecht, a German MEP who helped guide GDPR through the European Parliament, agrees, saying a system that automatically scanned ID cards and only checked name and birth date could avoid collecting more data than is already taken. In response to an undercover investigation, which found moderators deliberately ignoring clear signs of under age use, Facebook pledged to proactively ban users who seemed under age. Can Britain really copy all this? And more to the point, should we? Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, wrote in this newspaper that Britain must find a similar way of making tech firms liable, while Norman Lamb, chairman of the science and technology committee, said Britain risks being \"behind the curve\" and should be looking at Germany \"very closely\".</p><p>Characteristically, most Germans believe that only Europe-wide rules can tame the tech titans. \"This is not amenable to national solutions,\" says Mr Schipanski. Dr Caspar is likewise keen to stress the EU's role. But German laws such as NETZDG go beyond what the EU requires, and he thinks it would be \"too pessimistic\" to say tech cannot be regulated.</p><p>\"They are not aliens,\" he says. \"They are companies offering services for people living in Europe, and if they are in this playground, they have to play by our rules.\"</p><p>American firms could have deserted Hamburg for one of Germany's 15 other states, but they have not.</p><p>Mr K\u00fchn puts it more bluntly: \"The idea of a company moving out of a country because the data privacy regulator pushes too hard is farfetched.\" How closely Britain should actually follow Germany's example is a question for voters and MPs. Some ideas would be fiercely debated.</p><p>What is clear is that social media does not exist in some other dimension unreachable by judges and politicians.</p><p>We have the power to change it, if we wish to.</p><p>'They are offering services for people living in Europe, and if they are in this playground, they have to play by our rules'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An 11-year-old German girl playing with her mobile phone.

That followed  that it would review past mergers and acquisitions by tech companies via a newly established task force charged with determining if there's anti-competitive behavior. And on Aug. 1, The Wall Street Journal  that the FTC is in particular looking at Facebook's past deals, such as its purchase of communications startup WhatsApp, citing multiple unnamed sources.</p><p>Although Facebook has gotten the most bad press, it's generally perceived that Alphabet, Amazon and Apple are also vulnerable.  , Microsoft  , despite its heft in software and consumer products and cloud computing, has somehow escaped scrutiny. </p><p>Given that there have been hundreds of acquisitions by the giants, the companies have become a hodgepodge of businesses that could be reorganized in a number of ways. </p><p><br/>Alphabet and Facebook<br/></p><p>Among the four, Alphabet and Facebook in some ways have the simplest structure, since the vast majority of each company's revenue is from advertising. For that reason, there are pressure points within those advertising operations that could be a source of scrutiny. </p><p>Google's control of both advertising and the Android software that runs most of the world's smartphones is the most obvious target. The European Union last year fined Google (EURO)4.3 billion after concluding the company placed illegal restrictions on other companies' access to the platform. Google  to be installed by users as the default on Android, a kind of weak nod to ongoing scrutiny. It would behoove Google to move Android into the status of a subsidiary of the company, perhaps eventually even a spin-off. </p><p>The YouTube and cloud computing parts of Google are also conspicuous. YouTube is a media empire growing in importance in the media landscape. And Google Cloud has hooks into many enterprise businesses. It's conceivable both could prosper while pursuing new lines of revenue if each was made a separate subsidiary. It might even allow Google CEO Sundar Pichai to have a finer focus on Google's core advertising business if these giant, trapped businesses were set free. </p><p><br/>Facebook<br/></p><p>Facebook's challenge looks more difficult, as its Instagram photo-sharing property is arguably the preferred part of the company among investors precisely because it has been free of the scandals over privacy that have enveloped the main Facebook social property. Facebook could therefore create new value for shareholders by spinning off the unit as a separate company and stock. </p><p>Of course, the opposite could happen, too, with Facebook pulling its various product groups in more closely to create a sense of cohesiveness and avoid a breakup. There's already some indication of that in  stating that Facebook is planning to re-brand its WhatsApp and Instagram services to make them seem more tightly coupled with the main Facebook property. </p><p><br/>Amazon and Apple<br/></p><p>Amazon, the king of cloud computing services, seems well-positioned to carve a separate company out of its AWS cloud unit, given that AWS already reports standalone financials every quarter. Amazon could continue to have a constructive relationship with the unit even if it were to do so. </p><p>A more ambitious move for Amazon would be to make its logistics operations a distinct unit within the company with clearly independent leadership. That could address concerns that fulfillment of product deliveries is a mysterious source of leverage that Amazon possesses over other retailers. </p><p>As for Apple, the only obvious structural move for the company is to distinguish its services business, which is now at meaningful scale, at $11.5 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, roughly a fifth of total revenue. Spinning off the business is out of the question, given that services is supposed to be the growth engine to offset slowing iPhone sales. But Apple could clearly set the unit apart by distinguishing it as a separate subsidiary, which would remove some of the concern that Apple's own offerings are given preferential treatment on the iOS platform. </p><p>All these possibilities could form a game plan for regulators, but a forced break-up of any of these companies faces challenging odds because anti-trust law doesn't presently support such radical moves. Whether or not any of the tech giants pursue these moves detailed above, the firms will surely be hounded by investigations for some time to come, raising the urgency of performing at least cosmetic changes to show good faith efforts to allay the concerns of regulators and the larger public. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

As reported by Wired[1] Google is doing this in a variety of different ways whilst having a major impact on federal policy. Over the past few years, Google's approach to influencing federal policy has kicked into overdrive. </p><p>As calls for regulation on big tech companies have grown so has Google's attempts at Washington influence. Some have claimed Google now has a blacklist[2] of conservative news outlets. The company has also been called, amongst other big tech firms, to testify in an antitrust[3] hearing this month. Google adopts a range of tactics to try and influence federal policy and here we will try to unpick just how the company does it.Google sponsors antitrust researchIndirectly, Google has been part of a group that sponsors research into big tech antitrust. Back in 2012, the company part-funded a research project which criticized the scrutiny of Google in this area. As the antitrust debate continues to rage an increase in intensity it is worrying to see Google having its hand in the policy decision. However, indirectly this is. Additionally, Google spent $21 million on lobbying to influence Washington federal policy in 2019. In 2017, it was the largest spending corporate lobbyist out there. Some estimates suggest the number of organisations that receive funding from google is around 350. This has led to a range of important organizations coming to Google's defence at key moments over the years. These include academics, think tanks, trade organizations, and advocacy groups. All of which are directly or indirectly funded by the company.Google supported in news outletsA number of right-wing news outlets have also leapt to the defence of Google over the years. This is in part due to their extensive lobbying programs. Op-eds by antitrust and privacy experts tend to appear on sites or cable news outlets where they are sympathetic towards the company. It is not always the case the individuals express these views due to financial incentives caused by funding from Google. However, in many cases, regulators and the public are not informed about potential conflicts of interest. Take Larry Downes, for example, who is project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. He co-authored an op-ed in The Washington Post[4]in January about the tech backlash 'going askew.' After 10 days Google donation to the Georgetown centre was made public on its transparency page. Apparently, the company only updates this twice a year.Plans to break up big tech monopolies being blockedElizabeth Warren, has released big plans to break up dominant tech platforms. However, just as she did this, she was met with reliable Google defenders thwarting the debate. Geoffrey Manne, head of the International Center for Law &amp;#38; Economics, a nonprofit research group that receives money from Google was one of these. Manne has co-authored a number of papers defending Google. His conflicts of interest have come to light in 2015 but this has not stopped him from continuing to defend the company. His rebuttal to Warren argued that Google may stop investing in improving its products if it is more regulated. This piece was shared positively but more individuals who are part of Google-backed institutions.Google stepped up Washington strategy almost a decade agoBack in 2011 Google decided to put more of a focus on lobbying in Washington. The FTC investigated the company over exploiting its dominance in search. However, failed to bring charges as Google made some voluntary changes. Google also began courting conservatives in 2013 to mitigate concerns over its close ties to the Obama administration. As mentioned, Google also invests in donating to think tanks, academics and op-ed amongst other groups. This allows Google to steer the debate on certain issues towards policy positions that benefit the company. This is not an attempt to change the way the experts think or what they believe in. Instead, they invest in their time to research topics that will be of benefit to the company. This strategy does not always work and has backfired on the company in the past. Its employees revolted against the company's sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference. Google then stopped sponsoring the conference in the future. However, it did sponsor eight think tanks at that were present at the conference. Google's approach to lobbying and federal policy is a complex one.

As reported by Wired Google is doing this in a variety of different ways whilst having a major impact on federal policy.   Over the past few years, Google's approach to influencing federal policy has kicked into overdrive. As calls for regulation on big tech companies have grown so has Google's attempts at Washington influence.   Some have claimed Google now has a blacklist of conservative news outlets. The company has also been called, amongst other big tech firms, to testify in an antitrust hearing this month. Google adopts a range of tactics to try and influence federal policy and here we will try to unpick just how the company does it. Google sponsors antitrust research  Indirectly, Google has been part of a group that sponsors research into big tech antitrust. Back in 2012, the company part-funded a research project which criticized the scrutiny of Google in this area.   As the antitrust debate continues to rage an increase in intensity it is worrying to see Google having its hand in the policy decision. However, indirectly this is.   Additionally, Google spent $21 million on lobbying to influence Washington federal policy in 2019. In 2017, it was the largest spending corporate lobbyist out there. Some estimates suggest the number of organisations that receive funding from google is around 350.  This has led to a range of important organizations coming to Google's defence at key moments over the years. These include academics, think tanks, trade organizations, and advocacy groups. All of which are directly or indirectly funded by the company.  Google supported in news outlets  A number of right-wing news outlets have also leapt to the defence of Google over the years. This is in part due to their extensive lobbying programs.   Op-eds by antitrust and privacy experts tend to appear on sites or cable news outlets where they are sympathetic towards the company. It is not always the case the individuals express these views due to financial incentives caused by funding from Google.  However, in many cases, regulators and the public are not informed about potential conflicts of interest. Take Larry Downes, for example, who is project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy. He co-authored an op-ed in The Washington Post  in January about the tech backlash \u201cgoing askew.\u201d   After 10 days Google donation to the Georgetown centre was made public on its transparency page. Apparently, the company only updates this twice a year.  Plans to break up big tech monopolies being blocked  Elizabeth Warren, has released big plans to break up dominant tech platforms. However, just as she did this, she was met with reliable Google defenders thwarting the debate.  Geoffrey Manne, head of the International Center for Law &amp; Economics, a nonprofit research group that receives money from Google was one of these.   Manne has co-authored a number of papers defending Google. His conflicts of interest have come to light in 2015 but this has not stopped him from continuing to defend the company.   His rebuttal to Warren argued that Google may stop investing in improving its products if it is more regulated. This piece was shared positively but more individuals who are part of Google-backed institutions. Google stepped up Washington strategy almost a decade ago  Back in 2011 Google decided to put more of a focus on lobbying in Washington. The FTC investigated the company over exploiting its dominance in search. However, failed to bring charges as Google made some voluntary changes.   Google also began courting conservatives in 2013 to mitigate concerns over its close ties to the Obama administration.   As mentioned, Google also invests in donating to think tanks, academics and op-ed amongst other groups. This allows Google to steer the debate on certain issues towards policy positions that benefit the company.  This is not an attempt to change the way the experts think or what they believe in. Instead, they invest in their time to research topics that will be of benefit to the company.   This strategy does not always work and has backfired on the company in the past. Its employees revolted against the company\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.   Google then stopped sponsoring the conference in the future. However, it did sponsor eight think tanks at that were present at the conference.  Google's approach to lobbying and federal policy is a complex one. It lies in subtle social capture which allows it to make seemingly minor impacts. However, when multiplied out and combined together have a wide-ranging impact.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42696081855</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-28F1-JCSC-J186-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>AndroidHeadlines</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A particular area of concern, sources told Adweek, is Google\u2019s suite of advertising tools (see chart) and whether or not it constitutes a monopoly.</p><p>Google owns and operates some of the most recognizable online brands, from its eponymous search engine to its mobile operating system Android and YouTube. Although, it is how it bundles these services with its suite of online ad tools\u2014the vast majority of which are invisible to the public and primarily affect advertisers, media owners and ad-tech middlemen with rival offerings\u2014that is at the center of the DoJ\u2019s inquiries, according to sources.</p><p>How the tools function and how they ultimately impact consumers is the main concern. (Watch the video below for more on that.)</p><p>Critics of Google\u2019s effect on ad-tech\u2019s competitive landscape are not hard to find and in recent months, academic studies have added to the chorus.</p><p>U.S. nonprofit bodies, such as Omidyar Network and Public Knowledge, and academics from Yale School of Management have grown vocal on the matter.</p><p>Their studies are based on market analysis by the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority\u2014a regulator widely perceived as more stringent than its U.S. counterparts\u2014which recently called for a \u201cnew regime\u201d to take on tech giants.</p><p>In a report published in early July, the CMA announced the formation of a task force to address its competitive concerns.</p><p>\u201cWhilst [sic] this recommendation is U.K.-focused, many of the problems that the CMA has identified are international in nature,\u201d the department said. \u201cIt will, therefore, continue to take a leading role globally in relation to these issues as part of the CMA\u2019s wider digital strategy.\u201d</p><p>Three main laws govern U.S.\u00a0federal antitrust power\u2014the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2014each covering various threats to competition. They require prosecutors to prove a company\u2019s actions result in a situation that negatively impacts market competition and ultimately harms consumers.</p><p>Speaking with Adweek prior to the CMA\u2019s latest report, Charlotte Slaiman, competition policy director at Public Knowledge, explained how the body, which works alongside economists, lawyers and former public servants, has been looking into Google\u2019s dominance of the market for two years.</p><p>\u201cBased on what we can see from the U.K. [interim] report, it does look like an anticompetitive situation that would be illegal under the [U.S.] antitrust laws,\u201d Slaiman said.</p><p>David Dinielli, senior advisor, beneficial technology at Omidyar Network, co-authored the report \u201cRoadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google,\u201d which drew parallels between the CMA\u2019s findings and U.S. antitrust law.</p><p>\u201cA big-picture narrative is that Google has used the power it acquired through search\u2014whether legally or illegally\u2014to try and construct its own walled garden whereby anyone that enters the Google-sphere has to use their services,\u201d Dinielli said.</p><p>Multiple sources familiar with regulatory bodies\u2019 inquiries told Adweek there are two specific areas of concern when it comes to the operations of Google\u2019s suite of online advertising tools.</p><p>One concern is \u201cinteroperability,\u201d or the difficulties advertisers face if they seek to use rival services to audit the performance of ad campaigns on Google\u2019s owned and operated media properties.</p><p>The concept of \u201ctying\u201d is also deemed problematic. For instance, advertisers seeking to use automated ad targeting on YouTube have had to use Google\u2019s ad-buying tool DV360 since 2015.</p><p>\u201cThe narrative here is that Google gained power in search and then used that power to build a bridge between advertisers and publishers,\u201d Dinielli said. \u201cThen, through exclusive operability and exclusive arrangements and refusal to share data, made it the one-stop shop that nobody can avoid.\u201d</p><p>Google often cites consumer privacy as its rationale for restricting data access to third parties and in recent weeks has made several PR overtures, such as disclosures over how it splits profits from its ad stack with publishers.</p><p>Earlier this year, in a filing with regulatory bodies in Australia, Daniel Bitton, partner in the antitrust practice of Axinn Veltrop &amp; Harkrider, and Stephen Lewis, partner at RBB Economics\u2014both of whom have represented and advised Google in its dealings with regulators in the U.K. and U.S.\u2014claimed Google\u2019s historic reliance on paid-for search ads meant it was in its interest to operate in a competitive ecosystem.</p><p>They also point to recent surveys of media buyers suggesting Google competes in a healthy marketplace whereby advertisers can choose from a number of options for ad tech, including Amazon\u2019s DSP.</p><p>\u201cGoogle faces stiff competition for all of its ad-tech products from players of all shapes and sizes, from well-known names like Adobe, Amazon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Facebook, Twitter and Verizon to highly successful industry specialists like MediaMath, OpenX, Rubicon Project and The Trade Desk,\u201d the filing read.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Google\u2019s services are crucial components at multiple tiers of the online media ecosystem, but remedies to the current status quo are required, according to multiple sources. While the prospect of a wholesale breakup of the online behemoth is unlikely, the divestiture of certain aspects of the business could be on the table, according to Slaiman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a really high bar to try and win divestitures at court and even harder to try and get a settlement where the company will agree to divestitures, but I think that could be appropriate,\u201d Slaiman said.</p><p>Dina Srinivasan, a fellow with the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale, pointed to the potential for antitrust authorities to require Google to construct \u201cfirewalls\u201d so that data gleaned from one side of its operation cannot be used to bias the decision-making of another.</p><p>\u201cThere could also be data-sharing requirements so that Google has to make some data available to advertisers or publishers or competitors,\u201d Slaiman said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1180878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-0CH1-JC8H-T36G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

ASingapore bank this week announced a similar integrationwith Google Pay following the same model.</p><p>What Google is aiming toward with its checking account offering is extending a streamlined, contextual approach to shopping and payments via Google Pay with methodical connections it's building to merchants and banks, said Bryce VanDiver, a partner with the consulting firm Capco.</p><p>\"The whole movement toward frictionless, contactless commerce is not just about banking but it's woven into the fabric of everyday life and Google sees that,\" VanDiver said.</p><p>Google and Citi are natural partners for the venture because of their history in co-developing Google Wallet. Citi also is making aggressive moves in the broader consumer banking war for deposits. Citi has relatively few branches, but it's leveraging its strength in consumer payments to attract funds.</p><p>Earlier this month Citi announced new programs to give its customers with its cobranded AAdvantage credit card rewards mile bonuses foropening bank accounts. Citi noted that through the first 10 months of this year, it's gathered more than $4 billion in digital deposit sales, and roughly half of that total came from credit card customers who previously had no retail relationship with the bank.</p><p>Google's interest in working with a credit union could have other advantages, suggested Richard Crone, a principal with Crone Consulting LLC.</p><p>\"Part of Google's offering here could be using the credit union to define and expand the field of membership to include anyone who's been KYC'd and validated for banking services, and that's significant because the field of membership could be extended to consumers using Google's services,\" Crone said.</p><p>Working with a credit union also could provide regulatory cover for Google, Crone suggested.</p><p>\"We've seen what happens when the forces of congressional and regulatory scrutiny come down on fintech operators, but beating up on a nonprofit credit union is a different story. It may be harder to pick on a lowly credit union that just wants to expand its field of membership,\" Crone said.</p><p>Credit unions also are an untapped resource for fintechs, because they have the infrastructure for supporting banking and payments, and broad flexibility for adapting to new models, he said.</p><p>\"If you look at what Amazon and Facebook have signaled this year with payments, Google was the last one standing to make a move capitalizing on the momentum of digital wallets, and this is going to be a very interesting one to watch,\" Crone said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-0000016e-6b24-d3d8-ab6f-6bb45a4a0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH4-1NM1-JCRW-50D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

He sported a tan suit and shifted in his seat as he introduced himself and noted (incorrectly) that his company was probably the youngest in the room. 'Really glad to be here,' said Page, who did not look glad to be there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the time he was again summoned in 2018 - this time to testify to Congress on tech's various problems - Page had all but abandoned the roles typically associated with leading one of the world's richest and most powerful companies. He didn't show, and senators placed an empty chair and his placard alongside the other speakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last Tuesday, Page and Sergey Brin, his Google co-founder, said they were stepping down from day-to-day executive roles at Alphabet, Google's parent company. While the move seemed sudden, it was the culmination of a years-long separation between two of Silicon Valley's most prominent founders and the company they began 21 years ago.</p><p>For some time, Page and Brin have drawn down their daily involvement in the company, ceding managerial tasks to deputies so they could focus on a variety of projects, including self-driving cars, robotics and life-extension technology. They left the often messy business of running Google itself to Sundar Pichai, a trusted deputy who became Google's chief executive in 2015.</p><p>Last Tuesday was the capstone of that split. The founders named Pichai as the chief of both Google and Alphabet, while they will remain on Alphabet's board of directors. Page and Brin still hold 51% of Alphabet's voting shares, giving them effective control over the company - and Pichai, if they wish.</p><p>In a letter announcing the change, Page and Brin compared their 21 years at Google to raising a child, saying now was the 'time to assume the role of proud parents.'</p><p>Page and Brin helped unleash the modern internet and Silicon Valley as cultural and business phenomena. Over the past two decades, they oversaw a company that was central to one of the most consequential periods in the history of business.</p><p>Now, as society and government begin to reckon with the fallout of changes wrought by the internet, the two men are walking away, most likely to pursue other projects, funded by the billions of dollars they made at Google and driven by a belief that technology can solve the planet's problems.</p><p>Google faces legal and regulatory challenges on several continents. It is fighting with its own employees. And it is trying to reverse sinking public opinion of its brand. But Pichai, not the founders, will be tasked with leading Google through the most difficult period in its history.</p><p>'It's an impossible job now,' said Shane Greenstein, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied Google and its founders. Page and Brin are cerebral, technical thinkers, and the issues facing the company 'are not merely technical problems or scientific problems,' he said. The problems 'are very much corporate lawyerly types of policy issues, for which historically they have not been enthusiastic.'</p><p>Page and Brin met as graduate students at Stanford University, and in 1996, they came up with a better way of ranking internet search results. It was, at the time, a school project. After they developed their internet search engine, they tried to sell it, but couldn't find any takers. So they started a company.</p><p>That singular innovation gave rise to a company and product that functions as an effective tax on the internet. Billions of people navigate the web through Google's search box, and it charges a toll in the form of tracked and targeted advertising.</p><p>Google has grown to be dominant in several markets. Its search engine handles nine out of 10 internet searches, and the company's Android software powers roughly three-quarters of the world's smartphones. And for a generation of young people, YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006, has all but supplanted television.</p><p>But to some observers, the more powerful Google became, the less interested its founders appeared to be in running it.</p><p>'They're accidental entrepreneurs,' Greenstein said. 'Given their origins, it's not surprising. They probably still harbor a desire to be a professor with a lab.'</p><p>After Page and Brin formally founded Google in September 1998, they turned out to be skilled businessmen. Still, investors worried that they were not ready to run what many rightly believed could become one of Silicon Valley's biggest companies.</p><p>By 2001, Google's board pushed the founders to bring on an experienced executive to lead the company. Page and Brin picked Eric Schmidt, a former chief executive of the software company Novell, as Google's new chief executive, in part because the three had bonded at Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert.</p><p>While the founders were initially wary of having a boss, they quickly warmed to Schmidt. One of the benefits of no longer being chief executive, colleagues told Page, was that he would no longer have to perform tasks like talking to advertisers and investors, according to 'In the Plex,' a book about Google's beginnings by Steve Levy.</p><p>Instead, the founders sought out new efforts, such as mapping the world, digitizing books, developing artificial intelligence and creating new smartphone software to rival Apple's iPhone.</p><p>In 2005, Page attended the DARPA Grand Challenge, a race for self-driving cars in the California desert. There he met Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford professor and leading developer of autonomous vehicles, which were then in their infancy.</p><p>'I was flabbergasted that a founder of a search engine company would attend a robot race,' Thrun said in an interview Tuesday. 'It wasn't long before Larry pushed me to start the Chauffeur team.'</p><p>Chauffeur was Google's secret self-driving car project, which Thrun began in 2009 under close coordination with Page and Brin. Today, a number of big tech companies are experimenting in transportation, but when news of the project broke in 2010, it was unprecedented for an internet company to be building a car.</p><p>'I didn't think of Google as a transportation company,' Thrun said. 'But Larry thought of Google as a company that pushed innovation in any area.'</p><p>Thrun led Chauffeur under Google X, the so-called moonshot lab where engineers were encouraged to build science-fiction projects they thought might never work. Many of their projects did fail, like space elevators, jet packs and teleportation, but others are still in development, like delivery drones, energy-producing kites and internet-beaming balloons.</p><p>Like most of the futuristic projects at Google, the lab was the brainchild of the founders. Brin particularly wanted something to work on because he was getting bored in management, said Michael Jones, a co-founder of Google Earth, who spent 11 years at the company.</p><p>'He was always frustrated in what to do; you can't engineer from the top,' Jones said. 'He wanted to go build things.'</p><p>Brin moved his desk to Google X and began experimenting with computer-embedded glasses, delivery drones and barges in San Francisco Bay that could possibly house data centers.</p><p>In 2011, Page retook the chief executive job atop Google, getting something of a hero's welcome. Yet the pattern - wanting to be in charge but not wanting to deal with the day-to-day job - would quickly repeat itself.</p><p>He seemed no more interested in the menial aspects of the job. He was frustrated by having to deal with things like executive infighting and turf wars that are an unavoidable part of corporate life, according to three former executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Even then, well before the recent employee uprisings, he had grown disillusioned with what he saw as entitled behavior from Google engineers, said two other executives who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. He also started to experience health problems, most notably paralysis of his vocal cords. Executives who met with Page, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he sometimes used an electronic speaker to amplify his strained voice.</p><p>'Larry is like a professor who's a business star. I don't think he has any appreciation or love or desire to run a company actually,' said Jones, the former Google executive. 'The thing he cares about is pushing toward innovation.'</p><p>In 2013, when stock analysts asked Page how much money the company was spending on far-off research projects that might never generate revenue, he chided them for short-term thinking and said they should be asking him to spend more. It was the last earnings call for Page.</p><p>'I know you would all love to have me on, but you're also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business,' he told analysts.</p><p>Page did have time for side projects. For years, Page and Thrun had been discussing a new kind of vehicle: electric personal aircraft. But rather than try to build one at Google, they pursued a project independently, funded by Page's personal wealth.</p><p>'We felt flying was too far out for Google and for their shareholders,' Thrun said.</p><p>Thrun now runs Kitty Hawk, which makes three kinds of electric aircraft. Page is the primary funder, and he has been visiting a few times a month, Thrun said. (Page has had three flying-car startups.)</p><p>Page has also invested in an asteroid-mining company. Brin bankrolled space-travel and synthetic-beef companies. Both helped fund Tesla. And Brin is building an airship in a hangar near Google's headquarters.</p><p>Some Google employees say the founders have been ceding the spotlight to other executives for years. At a Fortune conference in 2015, in one of Page's last public interviews, he was asked about Google's interest in China, a country the company had mostly exited years earlier.</p><p>'I've also delegated this question to Sundar,' Page responded.

But toward the end, they appeared happy to let someone else run it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 About a month after Donald J. Trump was elected president in 2016, Larry Page, the Google co-founder, was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">summoned along with other prominent tech executives</url> to a meeting at Trump Tower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a rare public appearance for Mr. Page. He sported a tan suit and shifted in his seat as he introduced himself and noted (incorrectly) that his company was probably the youngest in the room. \u201cReally glad to be here,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">said Mr. Page</url>, who did not look glad to be there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the time he was again summoned in 2018 \u2014 this time to testify to Congress on tech\u2019s various problems \u2014 Mr. Page had all but abandoned the roles typically associated with leading one of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful companies. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">He didn\u2019t show</url>, and senators placed an empty chair and his placard alongside the other speakers.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin, his Google co-founder, said they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">stepping down from day-to-day executive roles</url>at Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. While the move seemed sudden, it was the culmination of a yearslong separation between two of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent founders and the company they began 21 years ago.</p><p>For some time, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have drawn down their daily involvement in the company, ceding managerial tasks to deputies so they could focus on a variety of projects, including self-driving cars, robotics and life-extension technology. They left the often messy business of running Google itself to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">Sundar Pichai, a trusted deputy</url> who became Google\u2019s chief executive in 2015.</p><p>Tuesday was the capstone of that split. The founders named Mr. Pichai as the chief of both Google and Alphabet, while they will remain on Alphabet\u2019s board of directors. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin still hold 51 percent of Alphabet\u2019s voting shares, giving them effective control over the company \u2014 and Mr. Pichai, if they wish.</p><p>In a letter announcing the change, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin compared their 21 years at Google to raising a child, saying now was the \u201ctime to assume the role of proud parents.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Page and Mr. Brin helped unleash the modern internet and Silicon Valley as cultural and business phenomena. Over the past two decades, they oversaw a company that was central to one of the most consequential periods in the history of business. </p><p>Now, as society and government begin to reckon with the fallout of changes wrought by the internet, the two men are walking away, most likely to pursue other projects, funded by the billions of dollars they made at Google and driven by a belief that technology can solve the planet\u2019s problems.</p><p>Google faces <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">legal and regulatory challenges</url> on several continents. It is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">fighting with its own employees</url>. And it is trying to reverse       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">sinking public opinion of its brand</url>. But Mr. Pichai, not the founders, will be tasked with leading Google through the most difficult period in its history.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an impossible job now,\u201d said Shane Greenstein, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied Google and its founders. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin are cerebral, technical thinkers, and the issues facing the company \u201care not merely technical problems or scientific problems,\u201d he said. The problems \u201care very much corporate lawyerly types of policy issues, for which historically they have not been enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Page and Mr. Brin met as graduate students at Stanford University, and in 1996, they came up with a better way of ranking internet search results. It was, at the time, a school project. After they developed their internet search engine, they tried to sell it, but couldn\u2019t find any takers. So they started a company.</p><p>That singular innovation gave rise to a company and product that functions as an effective tax on the internet. Billions of people navigate the web through Google\u2019s search box, and it charges a toll in the form of tracked and targeted advertising. </p><p>Google has grown to be dominant in several markets. Its search engine handles nine out of 10 internet searches, and the company\u2019s Android software powers roughly three-quarters of the world\u2019s smartphones. And for a generation of young people, YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006, has all but supplanted television.</p><p>But to some observers, the more powerful Google became, the less interested its founders appeared to be in running it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re accidental entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said. \u201cGiven their origins, it\u2019s not surprising. They probably still harbor a desire to be a professor with a lab.\u201d</p><p>After Mr. Page and Mr. Brin formally founded Google in September 1998, they turned out to be skilled businessmen. Still, investors worried that they were not ready to run what many rightly believed could become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies. </p><p>By 2001, Google\u2019s board pushed the founders to bring on an experienced executive to lead the company. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin picked Eric <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">Schmidt, a former chief executive of the software company Novell,</url> as Google\u2019s new chief executive, in part because the three had bonded at Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert.</p><p>While the founders were initially wary of having a boss, they quickly warmed to Mr. Schmidt. One of the benefits of no longer being chief executive, colleagues told Mr. Page, was that he would no longer have to perform tasks like talking to advertisers and investors, according to \u201cIn the Plex,\u201d a book about Google\u2019s beginnings by Steve Levy. </p><p>Instead, the founders sought out new efforts, such as mapping the world, digitizing books, developing artificial intelligence and creating new smartphone software to rival Apple\u2019s iPhone.</p><p>In 2005, Mr. Page attended the Darpa Grand Challenge, a race for self-driving cars in the California desert. There he met Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford professor and leading developer of autonomous vehicles, which were then in their infancy.</p><p>\u201cI was flabbergasted that a founder of a search engine company would attend a robot race,\u201d Mr. Thrun said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long before Larry pushed me to start the Chauffeur team.\u201d</p><p>Chauffeur was Google\u2019s secret self-driving car project, which Mr. Thrun began in 2009 under close coordination with Mr. Page and Mr. Brin. Today, a number of big tech companies are experimenting in transportation, but when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">news of the project broke in 2010</url>, it was unprecedented for an internet company to be building a car.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of Google as a transportation company,\u201d Mr. Thrun said. \u201cBut Larry thought of Google as a company that pushed innovation in any area.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thrun led Chauffeur under Google X, the so-called moonshot lab where engineers were encouraged to build science-fiction projects they thought might never work. Many of their projects did fail, like space elevators, jet packs and teleportation, but others are still in development, like delivery drones, energy-producing kites and internet-beaming balloons.</p><p>Like most of the futuristic projects at Google, the lab was the brainchild of the founders. Mr. Brin particularly wanted something to work on because he was getting bored in management, said Michael Jones, a co-founder of Google Earth, who spent 11 years at the company.</p><p>\u201cHe was always frustrated in what to do; you can\u2019t engineer from the top,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cHe wanted to go build things.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Brin moved his desk to Google X and began experimenting with computer-embedded glasses, delivery drones and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">barges in San Francisco Bay</url> that could possibly house data centers.</p><p>In 2011, Mr. Page retook the chief executive job atop Google, getting something of a hero\u2019s welcome. Yet the pattern \u2014 wanting to be in charge but not wanting to deal with the day-to-day job \u2014 would quickly repeat itself. </p><p>He seemed no more interested in the menial aspects of the job. He was frustrated by having to deal with things like executive infighting and turf wars that are an unavoidable part of corporate life, according to three former executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Even then, well before the recent employee uprisings, he had grown disillusioned with what he saw as entitled behavior from Google engineers, said two other executives who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. He also started to experience health problems, most notably paralysis of his vocal cords. Executives who met with Mr. Page, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he sometimes used an electronic speaker to amplify his strained voice.</p><p>\u201cLarry is like a professor who\u2019s a business star. I don\u2019t think he has any appreciation or love or desire to run a company actually,\u201d said Mr. Jones, the former Google executive. \u201cThe thing he cares about is pushing toward innovation.\u201d</p><p>In 2013, when stock analysts asked Mr. Page about how much money the company was spending on far-off research projects that might never generate revenue, he chided them for short-term thinking and said they should be asking him to spend more. It was the last earnings call for Mr. Page. </p><p>\u201cI know you would all love to have me on, but you\u2019re also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business,\u201d he told analysts.</p><p>Mr. Page did have time for side projects. For years, Mr. Page and Mr. Thrun had been discussing a new kind of vehicle: electric personal aircraft. But rather than try to build one at Google, they pursued a project independently, funded by Mr. Page\u2019s personal wealth. </p><p>\u201cWe felt flying was too far out for Google and for their shareholders,\u201d Mr. Thrun said.</p><p>Mr. Thrun now runs Kitty Hawk, which makes three kinds of electric aircraft. Mr. Page is the primary funder, and he has been visiting a few times a month, Mr. Thrun said. (Mr. Page has had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">three flying-car start-ups</url>.)</p><p>Mr. Page has also invested in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">asteroid-mining company</url>. Mr. Brin bankrolled       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">space-travel</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">synthetic-beef</url> companies. Both helped fund Tesla. And Mr. Brin is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">building an airship</url> in a hangar near Google\u2019s headquarters.</p><p>Some Google employees say the founders have been ceding the spotlight to other executives for years. At a Fortune conference in 2015, in one of Mr. Page\u2019s last public interviews, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/trump-tech-summit.html\">he was asked</url> about Google\u2019s interest in China, a country the company had mostly exited years earlier. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also delegated this question to Sundar,\u201d Mr. Page responded. \u201cI help him think about it. But I don\u2019t have to answer this question now.\u201d He smiled, and the crowd laughed.</p><p>PHOTOS: Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page in 2003 at Google\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.

But toward the end, they appeared happy to let someone else run it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAN FRANCISCO - About a month after Donald J. Trump was elected president in 2016, Larry Page, the Google co-founder, was summoned along with other prominent tech executives to a meeting at Trump Tower.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a rare public appearance for Mr. Page. He sported a tan suit and shifted in his seat as he introduced himself and noted (incorrectly) that his company was probably the youngest in the room. \"Really glad to be here,\" said Mr. Page, who did not look glad to be there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the time he was again summoned in 2018 - this time to testify to Congress on tech's various problems - Mr. Page had all but abandoned the roles typically associated with leading one of the world's richest and most powerful companies. He didn't show, and senators placed an empty chair and his placard alongside the other speakers.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin, his Google co-founder, said they were stepping down from day-to-day executive roles at Alphabet, Google's parent company. While the move seemed sudden, it was the culmination of a yearslong separation between two of Silicon Valley's most prominent founders and the company they began 21 years ago.</p><p>For some time, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have drawn down their daily involvement in the company, ceding managerial tasks to deputies so they could focus on a variety of projects, including self-driving cars, robotics and life-extension technology. They left the often messy business of running Google itself to Sundar Pichai, a trusted deputy who became Google's chief executive in 2015.</p><p>Tuesday was the capstone of that split. The founders named Mr. Pichai as the chief of both Google and Alphabet, while they will remain on Alphabet's board of directors. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin still hold 51 percent of Alphabet's voting shares, giving them effective control over the company - and Mr. Pichai, if they wish.</p><p>In a letter announcing the change, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin compared their 21 years at Google to raising a child, saying now was the \"time to assume the role of proud parents.\"</p><p>Mr. Page and Mr. Brin helped unleash the modern internet and Silicon Valley as cultural and business phenomena. Over the past two decades, they oversaw a company that was central to one of the most consequential periods in the history of business. </p><p>Now, as society and government begin to reckon with the fallout of changes wrought by the internet, the two men are walking away, most likely to pursue other projects, funded by the billions of dollars they made at Google and driven by a belief that technology can solve the planet's problems.</p><p>Google faces legal and regulatory challenges on several continents. It is fighting with its own employees. And it is trying to reverse sinking public opinion of its brand. But Mr. Pichai, not the founders, will be tasked with leading Google through the most difficult period in its history.</p><p>\"It's an impossible job now,\" said Shane Greenstein, a professor at Harvard Business School who has studied Google and its founders. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin are cerebral, technical thinkers, and the issues facing the company \"are not merely technical problems or scientific problems,\" he said. The problems \"are very much corporate lawyerly types of policy issues, for which historically they have not been enthusiastic.\"</p><p>Mr. Page and Mr. Brin met as graduate students at Stanford University, and in 1996, they came up with a better way of ranking internet search results. It was, at the time, a school project. After they developed their internet search engine, they tried to sell it, but couldn't find any takers. So they started a company.</p><p>That singular innovation gave rise to a company and product that functions as an effective tax on the internet. Billions of people navigate the web through Google's search box, and it charges a toll in the form of tracked and targeted advertising. </p><p>Google has grown to be dominant in several markets. Its search engine handles nine out of 10 internet searches, and the company's Android software powers roughly three-quarters of the world's smartphones. And for a generation of young people, YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006, has all but supplanted television.</p><p>But to some observers, the more powerful Google became, the less interested its founders appeared to be in running it.</p><p>\"They're accidental entrepreneurs,\" Mr. Greenstein said. \"Given their origins, it's not surprising. They probably still harbor a desire to be a professor with a lab.\"</p><p>After Mr. Page and Mr. Brin formally founded Google in September 1998, they turned out to be skilled businessmen. Still, investors worried that they were not ready to run what many rightly believed could become one of Silicon Valley's biggest companies. </p><p>By 2001, Google's board pushed the founders to bring on an experienced executive to lead the company. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin picked Eric Schmidt, a former chief executive of the software company Novell, as Google's new chief executive, in part because the three had bonded at Burning Man, the arts festival in the Nevada desert.</p><p>While the founders were initially wary of having a boss, they quickly warmed to Mr. Schmidt. One of the benefits of no longer being chief executive, colleagues told Mr. Page, was that he would no longer have to perform tasks like talking to advertisers and investors, according to \"In the Plex,\" a book about Google's beginnings by Steve Levy. </p><p>Instead, the founders sought out new efforts, such as mapping the world, digitizing books, developing artificial intelligence and creating new smartphone software to rival Apple's iPhone.</p><p>In 2005, Mr. Page attended the Darpa Grand Challenge, a race for self-driving cars in the California desert. There he met Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford professor and leading developer of autonomous vehicles, which were then in their infancy.</p><p>\"I was flabbergasted that a founder of a search engine company would attend a robot race,\" Mr. Thrun said in an interview on Tuesday. \"It wasn't long before Larry pushed me to start the Chauffeur team.\"</p><p>Chauffeur was Google's secret self-driving car project, which Mr. Thrun began in 2009 under close coordination with Mr. Page and Mr. Brin. Today, a number of big tech companies are experimenting in transportation, but when news of the project broke in 2010, it was unprecedented for an internet company to be building a car.</p><p>\"I didn't think of Google as a transportation company,\" Mr. Thrun said. \"But Larry thought of Google as a company that pushed innovation in any area.\"</p><p>Mr. Thrun led Chauffeur under Google X, the so-called moonshot lab where engineers were encouraged to build science-fiction projects they thought might never work. Many of their projects did fail, like space elevators, jet packs and teleportation, but others are still in development, like delivery drones, energy-producing kites and internet-beaming balloons.</p><p>Like most of the futuristic projects at Google, the lab was the brainchild of the founders. Mr. Brin particularly wanted something to work on because he was getting bored in management, said Michael Jones, a co-founder of Google Earth, who spent 11 years at the company.</p><p>\"He was always frustrated in what to do; you can't engineer from the top,\" Mr. Jones said. \"He wanted to go build things.\"</p><p>Mr. Brin moved his desk to Google X and began experimenting with computer-embedded glasses, delivery drones and barges in San Francisco Bay that could possibly house data centers.</p><p>In 2011, Mr. Page retook the chief executive job atop Google, getting something of a hero's welcome. Yet the pattern - wanting to be in charge but not wanting to deal with the day-to-day job - would quickly repeat itself. </p><p>He seemed no more interested in the menial aspects of the job. He was frustrated by having to deal with things like executive infighting and turf wars that are an unavoidable part of corporate life, according to three former executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Even then, well before the recent employee uprisings, he had grown disillusioned with what he saw as entitled behavior from Google engineers, said two other executives who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. He also started to experience health problems, most notably paralysis of his vocal cords. Executives who met with Mr. Page, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he sometimes used an electronic speaker to amplify his strained voice.</p><p>\"Larry is like a professor who's a business star. I don't think he has any appreciation or love or desire to run a company actually,\" said Mr. Jones, the former Google executive. \"The thing he cares about is pushing toward innovation.\"</p><p>In 2013, when stock analysts asked Mr. Page about how much money the company was spending on far-off research projects that might never generate revenue, he chided them for short-term thinking and said they should be asking him to spend more. It was the last earnings call for Mr. Page. </p><p>\"I know you would all love to have me on, but you're also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business,\" he told analysts.</p><p>Mr. Page did have time for side projects. For years, Mr. Page and Mr. Thrun had been discussing a new kind of vehicle: electric personal aircraft. But rather than try to build one at Google, they pursued a project independently, funded by Mr. Page's personal wealth. </p><p>\"We felt flying was too far out for Google and for their shareholders,\" Mr. Thrun said.</p><p>Mr. Thrun now runs Kitty Hawk, which makes three kinds of electric aircraft. Mr. Page is the primary funder, and he has been visiting a few times a month, Mr. Thrun said. (Mr. Page has had three flying-car start-ups.)</p><p>Mr. Page has also invested in an asteroid-mining company. Mr. Brin bankrolled space-travel and synthetic-beef companies. Both helped fund Tesla. And Mr. Brin is building an airship in a hangar near Google's headquarters.</p><p>Some Google employees say the founders have been ceding the spotlight to other executives for years. At a Fortune conference in 2015, in one of Mr. Page's last public interviews, he was asked about Google's interest in China, a country the company had mostly exited years earlier. </p><p>\"I've also delegated this question to Sundar,\" Mr. Page responded. \"I help him think about it. But I don't have to answer this question now.\" He smiled, and the crowd laughed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006858700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNT-87G1-DYR7-C1HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 7, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The culprit: Redpath sugar factory, surrounded by signs of decay.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, has big plans to turn the waterfront into a hi-tech community embedded with sensors, with the first homes appearing in 2023. Building on former Google boss Eric Schmidt's dream of creating a town \"built from the internet up\" Sidewalk Labs promises to \"reimagine cities to improve the quality of life\". As idyllic as that sounds, it has caused a rift.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It starts here,\" says Block Sidewalk campaign advocate\u00a0Thorben Wieditz, pointing toward a flattened plot of land that pokes out from under a flyover. \"But we found out that they are buying up all the land over there too\" - he turns, gesturing to a peninsula littered with industrial buildings. The scene is unremarkable. But within Mr Wieditz's gaze is one of the most controversial plots of land in the western world and the latest example of an anti-Silicon Valley \"techlash\".</p><p>Opposition to Sidewalk Labs could be compared to this year's assault on Amazon, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/14/amazon-cancels-plans-25bn-new-york-headquarters/\">which forced it to pull out of a $5bn (\u00a33.9bn) New York development</url> that could have brought 25,000 jobs to the city.\u00a0</p><p>Sidewalk Labs, however, is not just another operational hub into which Google will move employees. It is a lab experiment to see what happens when it measures the exact movement, whims and desires of its population to shape services around them, in the hope that it could recreate the effect in different cities around the world.\u00a0</p><p>                   Everything will be monitored                   </p><p>Under Google, East Bayfront will take on four different layers. The first is an underground network with foliage hydration and automated replenishment for supplies, plus traffic sensors. On the surface level are smart roads that can tell cars to automatically yield to pedestrians and cyclists. Then there are smart buildings, health services, parks and shops. On top is a virtual layer of connectivity, data pulled from sensors connecting to residents' phones, wearables, vehicles and, of course, Google itself.</p><p>Everything will be measured for maximum efficiency, even a \"digitally enabled smart chute system\" that offers pay-as-you-throw services that can sort recyclable materials in homes shared by several families. Google will own this data, but city officials can access it through an app - removing them from the town planning equation.\u00a0</p><p>The transport system will, of course, be super smart: filled with driverless cars ferrying happy inhabitants to and from the shops to their homes. Or so Sidewalk Labs states. While it is hard to argue that cash-strapped public services would not benefit from the help of a company with annual\u00a0revenues of $137bn, there are concerns that it will transform the role of public and private companies in a way that might ultimately harm the population.\u00a0</p><p>As Dr Julie Powles\u00a0of New York University School of Law <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/14/amazon-cancels-plans-25bn-new-york-headquarters/\">argues in her paper \"Urbanism under Google\"</url> : \"If there is more demand (measured by those placing the most orders) for instant drone delivery than for a walk to the corner shop, retail will succumb.\"</p><p>\"This is the continuous planning process that currently favors cheap ride-shares over public transportation. A brutally efficient demand-driven city-as-platform model might perhaps be able to accommodate public interests by accounting for negative and positive externalities in the model (like congestion pricing).\"</p><p>But ambiguity around Sidewalk's agency in this \"digital layer\" has undermined confidence that it will be in the public interest.\u00a0</p><p>                   Turmoil in Toronto                   </p><p>How did we get to this stage? Alphabet's rich property portfolio puts it in a good position to find the perfect plot. It needed the right space, adequate transport links and absent regulation so it can forge ahead with its plans. A stretch of derelict land just a short walk from financial and \"entertainment\" district in Toronto, not restricted by data privacy laws like those in Europe or California, was just the ticket.\u00a0</p><p>It partnered with Waterfront Toronto, exchanging a reported $50m to work with and submit a proposal for a 12 acre plot, which was announced in 2017. Then a curious thing happened:\u00a0Waterfront Toronto, the group in charge of\u00a0the redevelopment of the area, began to fall apart.</p><p>First came the leaks, one of which claimed that Google was actually eyeing up the surrounding 350 acres. Then <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/14/amazon-cancels-plans-25bn-new-york-headquarters/\">internationally acclaimed privacy expert Ann Cavoukian threw the towel</url> in \"to send a strong statement\" after Google said it could not commit to anonymising every bit of data it collected on Quayside.</p><p>Three further board members have been replaced, including Julie Di Lorenzo, a Toronto developer who questioned how Waterfront Toronto, \"a corporation established by three levels of democratically elected government, [has] shared values with a limited, for-profit company whose premise is embedded data collection\".</p><p>In the two years that have followed, a number of groups have organised to oppose Google's presence. Their grumbles fall into two camps. One is privacy; the other is the act of selling off public land.\u00a0</p><p>The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) this month filed a lawsuit, hoping they will be able to stop the proposal from going through. But as nobody other than Sidewalk Labs knows what they plan to do, given that there has been no public consultation on the matter, it is quite difficult to poke holes in their plans.</p><p>\"Citizens and commentators and the Canadian civil liberties association are forced to speculate what data will be collected and for what purpose,\" says former Ontario attorney general and CCLA chief Michael Bryant says. \"Canada has never installed sensors in the ground or on telephone poles or had satellites following our every move, nor affordable housing units that collect information.</p><p>\"If the choice is being a lab rat for Google or being homeless, then you are accepting it under duress.\"</p><p>With Google's history, it is easy to see why people draw assumptions. No company has been more invested in harvesting data and digital land grabbing than Google. Most will have experienced a Google car driving around the roads, photographing residential and urban areas to pad out its maps service.\u00a0</p><p>Promises Google has made in the past about acquiring companies with powerful technology - like keeping British artificial intelligence company DeepMind independent - have fallen by the wayside. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/14/amazon-cancels-plans-25bn-new-york-headquarters/\">DeepMind's health efforts were this year absorbed into Google Health</url>, which does not have the same terms, conditions or principles that DeepMind's founders said they would always adhere to.</p><p>And, while the CCLA says it would be happy for Google to continue its work if there is data protection in place, there are others who believe Google has no place in Canada at all.\u00a0</p><p>                   'Nobody wants to be a guinea pig'                   </p><p>When he is not wearing his \"Block Sidewalk\" campaign hat, Mr Wieditz, who has a strong German accent, is working on cracking down on \"misbehaving\" Airbnb and Uber. His concern is the lack of public consultation on handing public land to the private sector and the distrust of Google \"who avoids taxation in the countries it operates in\" along with the hypocrisy of Dan Doctoroff - the chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, and a former deputy mayor of New York City - \"telling the public what is good for them\". \u00a0</p><p>\"Torontonians are afraid to fall behind,\" Mr Wieditz says. \"They think we need to catch up, but there are global cities that have said no to big tech. Politicians and citizens shouldn't be afraid to say 'no' and slow things down because we are joining really progressive cities in the world. Nobody wants to be a guinea pig and we also don't want to develop without the infrastructure to govern it that can be applied to other communities around the world.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/14/amazon-cancels-plans-25bn-new-york-headquarters/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>He might have a point. Sidewalk Labs offered to pay for trains on the waterfront in return for a cut of property tax revenues on all the land, suggesting that the project was not simply an altruistic experiment.\u00a0</p><p>\"They want access to development fees and future tax revenues on the land. That is when people became enraged,\" he says.</p><p>However, it is not black and white. When I ask Mr Wiedtiz who is funding his campaign, he brushes it off as donations from the community and labour groups. But later when I Google his email address, I find it is linked to Metal Strategies, a steel think tank. Sidewalk Labs is proposing timber frame.\u00a0</p><p>In coming weeks, if not days, the finer details of the proposal shall be revealed, including the cost Google is willing to pay. But it is far from a done deal. Waterfront Toronto can still reject the proposal and is not financially bound. Once agreed, it will need to be signed off by federal and state government too.\u00a0</p><p>What does the average Torontonian think? A recent poll by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, one circulated by Sidewalk Labs, suggests 54 percent of the 1,246 people survey back it.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps international fascination is born of concern that Sidewalk Labs might pop up in their back gardens. Indeed, if it is successful, it will be the perfect blueprint for cities in the UK, Europe and the US.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-53239168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6S-D1T1-F021-608R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1560\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 28, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;
