In the background, the increased use of technology is bringing about profound political, economic, and social change, especially visible in the gig economy and the issues it raises, the debate around greater automation, and the increased mobilisation of tech workers.  Listed below are the key regulatory trends impacting the future of work, as identified by GlobalData.  Antitrust and data privacy   Technological change and globalisation have given rise to big companies with a huge concentration of market power that systematically collect and use personal data, often without the user\u2019s knowledge or express permission. As Big Tech companies, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, are leaders in many of the technologies enabling the future of work, regulatory oversight has the potential to influence their position in this theme.   Competition laws have historically targeted companies whose anti-competitive behaviour undermines consumer\u2019s rights. In today\u2019s digital economy, internet services are provided for free, but customers are required to hand over personal data and suffer other non-material costs, such as reduced security and privacy violations. As such, antitrust regulators are shifting their focus from investigating monopolistic practices in product markets to investigating abuses relating to customer data. This approach has already resulted in increased oversight and fines for antitrust as well as data privacy violations.  Regulating the gig economy   The gig economy has been shaping work in the absence of traditional forms of trade unionism, like collective bargaining. In addition, regulatory structures around the world were not written with phone-based apps and platform work in mind. This has hindered the ability for gig workers to improve their conditions and wages. However, over the last year we have seen the first attempts by legislators to reign in the gig economy. In 2019, California passed a landmark workers\u2019 rights bill, which paves the way for workers in the gig economy to earn the minimum wage, take parental leave, and receive unemployment insurance.   Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have tried to push back, as their entire business model is at stake, but to no avail. In May 2020, California sued Uber and Lyft, alleging that their classification of drivers as independent contractors was in violation of the new law. However, approaches to regulating the gig economy vary across jurisdictions, and there is a general lack of clarity in arbitration rulings.  Robot tax   Advocates of a robot tax, including Microsoft\u2019s co-founder Bill Gates, support the introduction of taxes to slow the adoption of robots in workplaces and suggest the money raised could be used to retrain people put out of work by automation. However, there are issues that could make a robot tax difficult to implement. Firstly, it\u2019s hard to define what a robot is, as autonomy is present in almost all technologies. This poses challenges when it comes to agreeing when a job has been replaced by a robot. Also, it\u2019s not clear whether a robot tax should include things like open-source code, which can significantly speed up the development of software with reduced number of engineers.   In addition some commentators point to the risk of slowing down capital investment and ultimately, harming the economy. If companies are less willing to invest in new tech because they fear an extortionate robot tax, those in the tech sector will be less willing or able to develop it.

It promises to shake up the crypto-world and drag it into the financial mainstream.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some see a welcome escape from the hegemonic grip of the banks, others see a threat to central government's role in currency regulation and still others see it as a liberatory opportunity for the large \"unbanked\" masses of the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Partnering with MasterCard, Paypal, Visa, Spotify and others, Facebook intends to peg its new blockchain-based cryptocurrency to a basket of government of fiat currencies (e.g., U.S. dollar and Euro) in order to avoid the unsettling volatility of its rivals, especially bitcoin. Mindful of the huge global reach of Facebook, the potential effect of such a successful crypto-scheme is truly staggering. Whatever occurs with Facebook, many agree that some kind of regulation of cryptocurrency is now more urgent than ever. As things presently stand, the lack of any sensible regulation is no longer tolerable.</p><p>But regulatory efforts are moving ahead. Almost simultaneously with the Facebook announcement, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has issued some initial \"Guidelines on Cryptocurrency.\" This is a global institution that has the backing of the G7 countries. Although its primary mandate is combat money laundering and terrorist funding, it has brought its policy-making focus to bear on the wider effects of the $300-billion (U.S.) cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Its central idea is to license or register service providers and make them subject to supervision and monitoring by competent national authorities. Notably, this means member countries will not be permitted to rely on a self-regulatory approach to fulfil such functions.</p><p>FATF recommends stern sanctions - confiscation, asset-freezing and criminal penalties - for failure to comply with anti-money laundering and terrorist funding provisions.</p><p>The basic thrust of these recommendations is that \"virtual asset service providers\" (not only issuers of cryptocurrencies, but also those agencies or platforms that facilitate exchanges) be treated like any other nonvirtual service provider (like banks and similar financial bodies).</p><p>This will require such providers to become licensed, maintain customer due diligence, keep extensive records, report suspicious transactions, ensure data protection, respect privacy rules and screen all transactions for compliance with targeted financial sanctions.</p><p>The bottom-line is that the regulation framework presently imposed on traditional institutions of financing should be shifted over, with only technologically necessary amendments, to the cryptocurrency sector. Indeed, even higher standards of supervision and monitoring for crypto-players might be imposed.</p><p>None of this is welcome news to the crypto-enthusiast. Rather than be an alternative to the existing banking and financial sector, cryptocurrencies will be lumped in with them. As importantly, they will be subject to the long and muscular arm of the law. For critics, such regulation is long overdue.</p><p>However, apart from the high cost of implementing such measures, such regulation is not entirely feasible. The blockchain technology of cryptocurrencies is specifically designed to be used in a pseudo-anonymous way; it is not compatible with the identity-driven demands of ordinary banking and finance.</p><p>Some go so far as to insist that the implementation of the FATF regulations will be counterproductive - crypto-players and enablers will go off platform and further underground to elude regulatory compliance.</p><p>Much of the responsibility for this turn of events lies with the cryptocurrency market itself. It has resisted any regulation at all rather than implement its own security measures. If this had been done, the type of draconian and possibly crypto-killing FATF measures might not have been contemplated.</p><p>Facebook (and others) may discover that, despite their half-hearted efforts to head off more centralized government control, the wealth-making days of cryptocurrency are behind us. But, then again, looking how far and how fast Big Tech actors have come in the past decade, the dawn of a new and more expansive cryptocurrency era may be just around the corner.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019070754985034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHB-7SX1-JBTY-W2FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 7, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It promises to shake up the crypto-world and drag it into the financial mainstream.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some see a welcome escape from the hegemonic grip of the banks, others see a threat to central government's role in currency regulation and still others see it as a liberatory opportunity for the large \"unbanked\" masses of the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Partnering with MasterCard, Paypal, Visa, Spotify and others, Facebook intends to peg its new blockchain-based cryptocurrency to a basket of government of fiat currencies (e.g., U.S. dollar and Euro) in order to avoid the unsettling volatility of its rivals, especially bitcoin. Mindful of the huge global reach of Facebook, the potential effect of such a successful crypto-scheme is truly staggering. Whatever occurs with Facebook, many agree that some kind of regulation of cryptocurrency is now more urgent than ever. As things presently stand, the lack of any sensible regulation is no longer tolerable.</p><p>But regulatory efforts are moving ahead. Almost simultaneously with the Facebook announcement, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has issued some initial \"Guidelines on Cryptocurrency.\" This is a global institution that has the backing of the G7 countries. Although its primary mandate is combat money laundering and terrorist funding, it has brought its policy-making focus to bear on the wider effects of the $300-billion (U.S.) cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Its central idea is to license or register service providers and make them subject to supervision and monitoring by competent national authorities. Notably, this means member countries will not be permitted to rely on a self-regulatory approach to fulfil such functions.</p><p>FATF recommends stern sanctions - confiscation, asset-freezing and criminal penalties - for failure to comply with anti-money laundering and terrorist funding provisions.</p><p>The basic thrust of these recommendations is that \"virtual asset service providers\" (not only issuers of cryptocurrencies, but also those agencies or platforms that facilitate exchanges) be treated like any other non-virtual service provider (like banks and similar financial bodies).</p><p>This will require such providers to become licensed, maintain customer due diligence, keep extensive records, report suspicious transactions, ensure data protection, respect privacy rules and screen all transactions for compliance with targeted financial sanctions.</p><p>The bottom-line is that the regulation framework presently imposed on traditional institutions of financing should be shifted over, with only technologically necessary amendments, to the cryptocurrency sector. Indeed, even higher standards of supervision and monitoring for crypto-players might be imposed.</p><p>None of this is welcome news to the crypto-enthusiast. Rather than be an alternative to the existing banking and financial sector, cryptocurrencies will be lumped in with them. As importantly, they will be subject to the long and muscular arm of the law. For critics, such regulation is long overdue.</p><p>However, apart from the high cost of implementing such measures, such regulation is not entirely feasible. The blockchain technology of cryptocurrencies is specifically designed to be used in a pseudo-anonymous way; it is not compatible with the identity-driven demands of ordinary banking and finance.</p><p>Some go so far as to insist that the implementation of the FATF regulations will be counterproductive - crypto-players and enablers will go off platform and further underground to elude regulatory compliance.</p><p>Much of the responsibility for this turn of events lies with the cryptocurrency market itself. It has resisted any regulation at all rather than implement its own security measures. If this had been done, the type of draconian and possibly crypto-killing FATF measures might not have been contemplated.</p><p>Facebook (and others) may discover that, despite their half-hearted efforts to head off more centralized government control, the wealth-making days of cryptocurrency are behind us. But, then again, looking how far and how fast Big Tech actors have come in the past decade, the dawn of a new and more expansive cryptocurrency era may be just around the corner.</p><p>Allan Hutchinson is a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2019071055010035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHY-RFF1-JDH1-C4Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Following the Christchurch massacre, Facebook is asking for multilateral regulation, in stark contrast to the previous stance of the FANGs.</p><p>In Australia, those same big tech companies are stepping up the fight against the federal government's de-encryption laws that give enforcement authorities new powers to access encrypted communications on devices and through apps.</p><p>In the meantime, the AI evolution marches on. Computer vision systems that can spot shoplifters, machine learning algo-rithms that can identify the best fertilised embryos to transplant, and machine translation software that can effortlessly turn English into German at a touch of button are just three recent develop-ments.</p><p>The introduction of AI into more of our lives is creating a range of challenges. Chief among these is how to increase the public's trust in the use of AI, given many recent examples where that trust has been misplaced.</p><p>Take, for instance, the emergence of \"deep fakes\", where AI is used to make audio and video of real people saying things they never said and doing things they never did. What are the political, legal and ethical implications of such a capability?</p><p>A convincing deep fake YouTube video of former US president Barack Obama delivering a speech he never made about, you guessed it, fake news shows there is much to be concerned about. My colleagues are betting on how many months before an important political election is swung by such a deep fake video being released at the last moment.</p><p>So how do we harness and regulate AI capability to help us evolve our economy and lead the world with our tech smarts?</p><p>With the May 18 federal election almost upon us, the Labor Party has outlined a policy to establish a national AI centre of excellence to help guide a broader application of AI in the community and business. Labor wants to ensure Australia becomes a leading force in the development of ethical AI.</p><p>The Australian Human Rights Commission has called for creating an AI policy council to guide companies and regulators as AI evolves and expectations grow for more transparency on how algorithms make decisions. And CSIRO's Data61 agency has launched its AI ethics framework for public feedback.</p><p>As governments across the world introduce more rigorous data regulations, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation regime, which came into force in May last year, regulators including the Australian Com-petition &amp; Consumer Commission are increasingly interested in how data is being used by tech firms.</p><p>And it's not only fake video and audio that can be synthesised via a computer that causes concerns. Recently the Elon Musk-backed non-profit company OpenAI declined to release an AI program called GPT2 that could create real-istic but fake news stories just from a few opening words. Contrary to normal scientific practice, OpenAI declined to make this software available to other scientists to test because of concerns about the risk of its mali-cious use to generate fake news. The company is still working through the ramifications of its development.</p><p>The tech companies are starting to wake up to their responsibilities in unleashing AI on a largely unsuspecting public. Commercial aspirations will need to be tempered. Important questions on ethics and regulation are being contemplated more seriously as tech reputations take a deserved battering.</p><p>Ultimately, such deep fake capability could become so advanced and pervasive that people will stop believing things unless they see them with their own eyes.</p><p>We are therefore entering another period of technology-driven turbulence. There was the first industrial revolution in the 19th century following the introduction of the steam engine; the second revolution in the 20th century with the introduction of mass production (think the Ford motor car); and then the third revolution with the emergence of computers during the past 50 years.</p><p>Early forms of automation led to many advances in products and had profound effects on labour markets as well as on domestic and social life. This led to diversification of jobs and responsibilities, a reduction in manual labour and an increase in cognitive tasks. Unions, industrial practices and laws developed, and after a period behaviours adapted to the various \"revolutions\" of industry.</p><p>Are we now similarly placed with respect to AI and human society at the start of our fourth industrial revolution? And is there a case for some sort of global regulation? No and yes.</p><p>The main area where I can see a pressing need for global regulation of AI is in the use of autonomous weapons. Killer robots, as the media likes to call autonomous weapons, would create a revolution in the way war is fought. We urgently need control here before the world gets locked into another unwanted arms race.</p><p>Synthetic voice manipulation and fake social media accounts are other areas likely to need regulation, given the profound impact misuse of this technology can have on political discourse. However, such regulation is perhaps more likely - and desirable - at the national rather than the international level.</p><p>Besides, pioneers in AI need to take responsibility and build confidence in their products and services so AI can continue to develop for humanity's benefit.</p><p>My new book, 2062: The World that AI Made, talks about the different futures AI could give us: some good, some bad.</p><p>By 2062, all our devices will be online and interconnected. Most won't have a keyboard or a screen but will be voice activated. You'll just walk into a room, speak and one of these interconnected dev-ices will obey your commands.</p><p>But the rest of 2062 isn't yet fixed. We don't have to worry about technological determinism. How the world looks in 2062 will be a product of the choices we make today.</p><p>However, we are, I believe, at one of those critical junctures in history where there's a lot to play for. As a result, we all need to start making choices so that everyone can benefit from how this industrial revolution turns out.</p><p>Ultimately, AI will help deliver solutions to some of the wicked problems challenging us, such as climate change and increasing inequality. If we make the right decisions now, we can build a future where the machines take the sweat and we can focus on the more important things in life.Toby Walsh is Scientia professor of artificial intelligence at the University of NSW.

At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission, Justice Department and a group of 47 state attorneys general have opened inquiries into Facebook, looking at antitrust behavior as well as possible privacy law violations. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's about time. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For 23 years, I held a front-row seat to the advent and evolution of digital marketing, witnessing its inevitable rise and twisted consequences. I specialized in helping companies adapt to the digital revolution but abandoned the field when I realized that the capabilities we marketers supported, like harvesting data, profiling consumers and personalizing content, were damaging society and our democracy. This is why I no longer help brands, including several who made their mark bringing people together, tear our communities apart.</p><p>I also left because I realized the game is rigged. The field is tilted, in favor of the two dominant players - Google and Facebook - who set the rules. This is the story of how we got here and what we can do about it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advertising abandons context for eyeballs</emphasis>: In the 1990s, advertisers negotiated directly with online publishers to place ads on websites in context that was relevant to their products, just as they had with traditional publishers. This was generally a real negotiation on an even playing field. But as we gained more data about our customers' behavior, we started placing ads wherever we could reach their eyeball<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">s</emphasis> - regardless of the content or location. </p><p>As the number of websites exploded, including thousands of small sites reaching niche audiences, we had to automate the process. By the early 2010s, a \"negotiation\" had transformed into a blind bidding war facilitated by layers of software programs - and every software provider levied a fee. These layers of advertising technology often meant advertisers did not even know where their ads were running or who was actually seeing them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ad costs rise while ad value and consumer benefits plummet</emphasis>: In 2017, a scathing book about digital advertising called \"Bad Men\" explained how \"the amazing world of 'ad tech' magically turns a dollar of online advertising into three cents of value.\" Fraud provided one explanation for this value loss. Ads could end up on any of thousands upon thousands of small, unknown sites. We were told we were gaining \"reach\" and finding new audiences. Then we discovered that many of these sites were gaining traffic from bots - software programs designed to repeatedly load webpages - and not actually people. To combat this, we added \"verification services\" to our ad-tech stack - for another fee.</p><p>We also learned that these unknown sites could be toxic. We coined a new phrase, \"brand safety,\" to refer to managing the risk of advertising on sites that spread conspiracy theories, hate speech and propaganda. Now we needed \"white lists\" and \"black lists\" of content and sites where our advertising could or couldn't appear. And thanks to the opacity and complexity of the supply chain of ad inventory, these lists didn't always work. </p><p>They still don't. Recently, we've seen reports of how Google's ad tech continues to place advertisements of major, unwitting consumer brands on websites with content pushing coronavirus (and other) conspiracy theories. Advertising also lost value as consumers embraced ad blockers to prevent websites from loading advertisements. Ironically, Google launched its own ad blocker for its Chrome browser, essentially enabling the tech giant to set advertising standards, charge advertisers to place ads in content that may violate those standards and then block those same ads from view.</p><p>These issues in the supply chain became so egregious that some of the most prominent marketing executives in the world began calling them out. In 2017, Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer of Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's largest advertiser with a $7.5 billion annual advertising budget, described the digital display advertising supply chain as \"murky at best, fraudulent at worst.\" A year later, Keith Weed, the chief marketing officer of Unilever, at the time the world's second largest advertiser, referred to the digital media supply chain as the \"digital swamp.\"</p><p>Advertising technology had become so complex and fragmented that Luma Partners, a consulting firm, invented the LumaScape chart to help marketers figure out all the companies that sold trading services, social media monitoring, verification services and more. This iconic chart was used by other clients to determine which service markets had the greatest opportunities for profitable acquisition or consolidation. </p><p>And that happened: Google went on a buying spree, and today their share of the key services in a marketer's ad tech stack ranges from 40% to 90%. The company also holds a significant portion of the supply of all display ad space (20% is held by their YouTube unit alone). Despite the consolidation - or maybe because of it - things haven't changed much since \"Bad Men.\" A recent report from the U.K. found that publishers receive only 51% of the money spent by advertisers to reach readers - leaving ad tech fees to swallow up most of the rest (and about 15% seems to just ... disappear). Additionally, each of the 15 advertisers in the study appeared on an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">average</emphasis> of 40,524 websites, most of them classified as being \"non-premium\" ad inventory. </p><p>In other words, now Google is doing what it used to take thousands of ad tech companies to do: take premium ad dollars and somehow magically drain them of most of their value. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook forces marketers to play its game while invading your privacy</emphasis>: That brings me to Facebook, another advertising-fueled business model and one unrivaled in its ability to target consumers at scale. Combined with its holdings Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook has a 75% share of the social network market, and mostly thanks to Facebook's 2 billion users, a 50% share of the total display ad supply. For any marketer that needs scale in social media, Facebook is the only game that matters. And since it has 100% control of access and pricing, marketers have to play by Facebook's rules. </p><p>Some of the ways Facebook plays are deeply troubling. For example, due to its reliance on advertising for its business model, the company has perfected user experience design intended to increase \"engagement\" - that is, keep people scrolling because Facebook's \"inventory\" consists of users' time and attention. People are more likely to \"engage\" - like, comment on and share - information that creates a visceral emotional response. So highly partisan content, hate speech and conspiracy theories get upranked by Facebook's algorithms, spreading far more quickly than dry but authoritative information. Ultimately, the ability to microtarget content - including ads - to more precise slices of the user base means the most inflammatory ideas - some designed to foment divisions in society - are virtually invisible to those who might counter them with the usual antidote to false or inflammatory speech: more speech.</p><p>Over time, Facebook even took on the creation of our ads: We would provide their ad sales team with hundreds of individual images, headlines and lines of copy, and the algorithm would optimize combinations that made consumers share, click or buy. Since advertisers pay more when a user takes some sort of action, Facebook has strong incentives to predict and then control users' behavior. Frustratingly, we often had no idea what our \"ads\" even looked like or who saw them until a campaign was over. </p><p>In fact, advertisers have little visibility into or understanding of any of Facebook's algorithms. We could communicate with our own customers (a \"custom audience\"), find customers like them (a \"look-alike audience\") or describe what kind of customers we wanted to show our ads. Then the algorithm took over, compounding what we had described. Sometimes, the algorithm predicted what kind of customer you were from your activities on (or off) Facebook, even things about you that you might have thought were private. </p><p>We came to realize that the optimization combined with the predictive capability created the potential - and the reality - of bias, discrimination and exploitation. (Recently, a list of more than 500 advertisers, including Unilever, Coca-Cola, Levi's, Starbucks and Ford, announced they would withdraw their advertising from Facebook - some included other social media platforms - for the month of July or longer, responding to a boycott campaign organized by civil rights groups. I see this is a welcome sign that advertisers are finally beginning to apply their leverage. And a series of civil rights audits - the final one published this past week - showed that the company still has a long way to go to address discrimination.)</p><p>Facebook's voracious data collection practices - not only on its own platform but across many platforms and devices - and how it analyzed, packaged and sold access to that data earned them billions of dollars in government penalties for violating users' privacy rights. Eventually, thanks to Cambridge Analytica and other scandals, consumers came to understand how their privacy was being violated, and how they were losing autonomy and freedom. It took a while, because Facebook's terms of service - which <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">theoretically</emphasis> spelled all this out - were so hard to find, to read and to understand that it wasn't really clear. They certainly weren't clear enough to make you leave Facebook for another big social network that might have treated your privacy with more respect. And soon, there really weren't any other big social networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To compete, advertisers must play by Google and Facebook's rules</emphasis>: Today, Google and Facebook combined get just over 60% of every U.S. digital marketing dollar. As you might imagine, that kind of power and dominance in a market makes it difficult for advertisers of any size to negotiate.</p><p>To be fair, the ad community was complicit in some of this. We chased our customers in their inexorable migration to the internet for information, entertainment and socializing. We loved and needed the cost efficiency of highly targeted digital media and craved more reach. We wanted to influence our customers at every step of their \"purchase journey\" (a framework we invented to feel good about tracking consumers across devices and platforms). </p><p>So it's been painful to realize that the very same capabilities we helped create - extracting information about users and their online behaviors; segmenting and profiling users for precision targeting; using algorithms to customize content to individual users; and designing user interfaces to increase time and engagement - are being used to distribute and amplify hate speech and propaganda, negate privacy and autonomy, manipulate and exploit behavior, and contribute to social isolation and addiction. No wonder consumers are losing trust in brands. </p><p>Regardless of how antitrust law deals with Google and Facebook, there's one thing that's crystal clear. Both companies have accrued so much power that they've had a lasting negative impact on advertisers, their relationships with their customers and consumers themselves.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We need a strong referee to change the advertising game and protect consumers</emphasis>: How do we solve the problems perpetuated by the dominance of Facebook and Google in the advertising market? It will probably take a system of solutions. The answer to many market problems is more competition and more choice, and I'm hopeful that antitrust enforcement will bring that about. A dedicated U.S. regulatory agency with specialized expertise and the agility it requires could also set and enforce new rules as a referee. Consumers also seem to be waking up to the harms of the digital platforms and may change some of their social behaviors. And given that 98% or more of these companies' revenues come from advertising, I hope more of my advertising colleagues wake up to their power, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-12896462</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B6-GT81-DY69-W001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2029\"/><timeReceived>03:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Seattle Times Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The final member of tech\u2019s Big Five, Facebook, which is a little more than halfway to a $1 trillion valuation, also reported strong earnings.</p><p>With each passing quarter, tech\u2019s wealthiest companies are building on their power, making it harder for smaller outfits to compete and for entrepreneurs to build the next Google or Facebook.</p><p>Amazon and Microsoft are profiting from the shift to cloud computing. Apple continues to own the premium market for apps, smartphones and wearable devices, while Google and Facebook are maintaining their grip on digital advertising.</p><p>This gravitational pull toward a handful of companies could have far-reaching implications for the global economy. Few tech outfits can afford to make the investments necessary to keep pace with the giants. The rest? They often have to pay up for access to the giants\u2019 many, many customers and technology.</p><p>\u201cThe strong are getting stronger, and the weak are getting weaker. It\u2019s a market of haves and have-nots,\u201d said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIn 20 years covering tech, it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Despite saber-rattling in Washington and elsewhere, it is clear that regulatory and legal scrutiny of the tech industry\u2019s most valuable companies so far has done little to hurt the bottom line. Last year\u2019s financial results could lend more weight to arguments that a handful of companies, with dominant market shares and outgunned competition, are unfairly cashing in on their control.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook made a combined $55.2 billion in net profit in the most recent quarter. The next five most valuable tech companies made roughly $45.5 billion in their four most recent quarters. While Facebook is lagging behind the rest of the Big Five, it is still worth twice as much as the next most valuable company, Intel.</p><p>The picture is darker the further down tech\u2019s food chain you go. A growing number of start-ups are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">cutting jobs</url> to get their expenses under control. And older tech companies, still profitable but slowly losing influence, are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">struggling to adapt</url> to the changing landscape.</p><p>As the rich get richer, they are also branching out. They are muscling aside or buying out rivals. And they are locking in the industry\u2019s best engineers with paydays smaller companies could never match.</p><p>Amazon said last week that it had invested in the infrastructure needed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">to speed up shipping times for its Prime members</url> to one day from two, raising the bar even higher for retail competitors. But Monday\u2019s trading on Wall Street showed just how hard it is to stay in the trillion-dollar club. Despite its e-commerce and cloud-computing dominance, Amazon\u2019s value dipped just a bit below $1 trillion.</p><p>Apple recently earmarked <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">billions of dollars to create shows and movies</url> for its video subscription service in a challenge to Netflix, while Alphabet agreed to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">buy the activity tracker Fitbit for $2.1 billion</url> in November and the analytics software firm Looker for $2.6 billion in June.</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s dominant companies have so much power across such a broad array of markets and continue to leverage that power to expand into new markets,\u201d said Patrick Spence, chief executive of the speaker maker Sonos, at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">a congressional antitrust hearing</url> last month in Boulder, Colo.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">Sonos has sued Google</url>, accusing Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.</p><p>Tech\u2019s richest companies seem to be defying a Wall Street assumption that as a company gets bigger, it becomes difficult to find new ways to make money and maintain rapid growth. Alphabet said profits in the last quarter of 2019 were 19 percent more than a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent to $46.1 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company\u2019s stock fell 4 percent in after-hours trading</p><p>To assuage some concern about sluggishness in its main search ad business, Alphabet disclosed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/technology/apple-iphone-sales-earnings.html\">for the first time</url> detailed revenue figures for its YouTube and cloud computing units, which are growing faster than the rest of the company. YouTube sold $15.1 billion worth of ads in 2019, up 36 percent, while its cloud unit grew more than 50 percent to $8.9 billion. Ad revenue from search increased 15 percent to $98.1 billion.</p><p>Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm in Minneapolis, said it was harder than ever for new challengers because the top incumbents were so effective at \u201cincremental evolution,\u201d like Apple\u2019s building subscription offerings to go with its hardware or Google\u2019s branching out into cloud computing. The big tech companies skillfully move into new markets with lower prices and more money for marketing than their new competitors. In time, they take over.</p><p>The outsize nature of the profits at some of these companies has driven an explosion of wealth on the stock market.</p><p>The total value of Microsoft shares has risen nearly 70 percent over the last year, adding more than half a trillion dollars to the company\u2019s market cap. Apple tacked on more than $550 billion in an 85 percent surge.</p><p>Alphabet\u2019s rise of more than 30 percent has added more than $200 billion to its market cap. Amazon, which had a 20 percent jump, has been something of a laggard but still added roughly $200 billion to its market cap.</p><p>The large technology firms that dominate the public stock markets are at the extreme edge of a broader trend in American corporate life.

The final member of tech's Big Five, Facebook, which is a little more than halfway to a $1 trillion valuation, also reported strong earnings.</p><p>With each passing quarter, tech's wealthiest companies are building on their power, making it harder for smaller outfits to compete and for entrepreneurs to build the next Google or Facebook.</p><p>Amazon and Microsoft are profiting from the shift to cloud computing. Apple continues to own the premium market for apps, smartphones and wearable devices, while Google and Facebook are maintaining their grip on digital advertising.</p><p>This gravitational pull toward a handful of companies could have far-reaching implications for the global economy. Few tech outfits can afford to make the investments necessary to keep pace with the giants. The rest? They often have to pay up for access to the giants' many, many customers and technology.</p><p>\"The strong are getting stronger, and the weak are getting weaker. It's a market of haves and have-nots,\" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \"In 20 years covering tech, it's unlike anything I've ever seen.\"</p><p>Despite saber-rattling in Washington and elsewhere, it is clear that regulatory and legal scrutiny of the tech industry's most valuable companies so far has done little to hurt the bottom line. Last year's financial results could lend more weight to arguments that a handful of companies, with dominant market shares and outgunned competition, are unfairly cashing in on their control.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook made a combined $55.2 billion in net profit in the most recent quarter. The next five most valuable tech companies made roughly $45.5 billion in their four most recent quarters. While Facebook is lagging behind the rest of the Big Five, it is still worth twice as much as the next most valuable company, Intel.</p><p>The picture is darker the further down tech's food chain you go. A growing number of start-ups are cutting jobs to get their expenses under control. And older tech companies, still profitable but slowly losing influence, are struggling to adapt to the changing landscape.</p><p>As the rich get richer, they are also branching out. They are muscling aside or buying out rivals. And they are locking in the industry's best engineers with paydays smaller companies could never match.</p><p>Amazon said last week that it had invested in the infrastructure needed to speed up shipping times for its Prime members to one day from two, raising the bar even higher for retail competitors. But Monday's trading on Wall Street showed just how hard it is to stay in the trillion-dollar club. Despite its e-commerce and cloud-computing dominance, Amazon's value dipped just a bit below $1 trillion.</p><p>Apple recently earmarked billions of dollars to create shows and movies for its video subscription service in a challenge to Netflix, while Alphabet agreed to buy the activity tracker Fitbit for $2.1 billion in November and the analytics software firm Looker for $2.6 billion in June.</p><p>\"Today's dominant companies have so much power across such a broad array of markets and continue to leverage that power to expand into new markets,\" said Patrick Spence, chief executive of the speaker maker Sonos, at a congressional antitrust hearing last month in Boulder, Colo.</p><p>Sonos has sued Google, accusing Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.</p><p>Tech's richest companies seem to be defying a Wall Street assumption that as a company gets bigger, it becomes difficult to find new ways to make money and maintain rapid growth. Alphabet said profits in the last quarter of 2019 were 19 percent more than a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent to $46.1 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's stock fell 4 percent in after-hours trading</p><p>To assuage some concern about sluggishness in its main search ad business, Alphabet disclosed for the first time detailed revenue figures for its YouTube and cloud computing units, which are growing faster than the rest of the company. YouTube sold $15.1 billion worth of ads in 2019, up 36 percent, while its cloud unit grew more than 50 percent to $8.9 billion. Ad revenue from search increased 15 percent to $98.1 billion.</p><p>Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm in Minneapolis, said it was harder than ever for new challengers because the top incumbents were so effective at \"incremental evolution,\" like Apple's building subscription offerings to go with its hardware or Google's branching out into cloud computing. The big tech companies skillfully move into new markets with lower prices and more money for marketing than their new competitors. In time, they take over.</p><p>The outsize nature of the profits at some of these companies has driven an explosion of wealth on the stock market.</p><p>The total value of Microsoft shares has risen nearly 70 percent over the last year, adding more than half a trillion dollars to the company's market cap. Apple tacked on more than $550 billion in an 85 percent surge.</p><p>Alphabet's rise of more than 30 percent has added more than $200 billion to its market cap. Amazon, which had a 20 percent jump, has been something of a laggard but still added roughly $200 billion to its market cap.</p><p>The large technology firms that dominate the public stock markets are at the extreme edge of a broader trend in American corporate life. Over the last half-century, the biggest American companies have captured a fatter share of profits produced by public companies, according to research from Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.</p><p>In 1975, the top 100 public companies snared about 49 percent of the earnings of all public companies.

Since the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect on May 25, companies have been ramping up those opt-in boxes, website banners, and emails updating you on the additional permissions needed to track your activity and process your data. And the user experience isn't the only thing that's changed.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the impact of the GDPR continues to be felt around the globe by both companies and consumers, it's crucial to analyze how these laws impact U.S. businesses along with ad tech and marketing automation as we have come to know it.\u00a0 How they contribute to the ongoing conversation on data privacy and what the future holds for targeted online marketing.</p><p>What's GDPR?</p><p>To briefly sum up what the EU's GDPR entails, it's comprised of the modernized laws that protect consumer's personal information which are now the strongest data protection rules in the world. The core update, among many, is that these rules now apply to any company that holds or uses data on people inside the EU, regardless of the size or physical location of the company.</p><p>Translation: These new rules have impacted almost every ad tech company, many of which are U.S.-based, and the clients they partner with. The maximum consequence of failing to comply with this new legislation is either 4 percent of the company's annual revenue or (EURO)20 million, whichever is greater.</p><p>The US-based response: winners and losers</p><p>Given the severe penalty for failing to comply with GDPR, it's no surprise that major, U.S.-based ad and cloud service providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have spent the past two years prepping to ensure compliance. Amazon, in a possible effort to extract itself from fellow data-privacy-plagued competitors Facebook and Google, has welcomed the GDPR by creating a new data processing agreement, providing additional resources to ensure customers comply with new requirements, and updating the terms and conditions for AdWords.</p><p>With billion-dollar revenue streams, it's no surprise the most popular online ad producers - Googleand Facebook - have done everything possible to ensure compliance but it also proves the clear winners of this legislation, outside of consumers, are the online ad giants. Smaller ad tech producers or ad-based companies in the US have released statements about their inability to comply and resulting move to block all ads from EU users, while Googleand Facebook were able to actually expand their online ad footprint. Despite this success, the extra precautions taken by online ad giants doesn't guarantee them safety as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Google's mobile OS Android have already received complaints filed against them.</p><p>But what is most surprising is that even some major U.S. publishers like the Los Angeles Times have been unable to ensure GDPR compliance and have thus blocked EU users from their content entirely. Originally thought to be a short-term solution, it's looking like blocking content and ads from the European market might be the indefinite solution for many U.S. companies in an effort to avoid penalties that would force them to close for good.</p><p>What about marketing automation?</p><p>While ad producers are facing the most scrutiny at the moment, the advent of the GDPR also means major changes to the current state of marketing automation tools. More and more it's looking like the period of time we are just now leaving will be looked back on as the good old days of targeted online marketing when everything from automated data management campaigns, reverse IP tracking, lead scoring, and reactivation programs were, for the most part, fair game and relied heavily on data acquired with much less detailed and tangible user consent requirements. However, those days are now over, at least for global brands with consumers located in the EU.</p><p>The solution for today's digital marketers? Developing clear processes to secure the necessary user consent compliance for all components of data-driven, automated campaigns. Yes, that also means creating a clear process for record disposal for those users who revoke consent. But the solution to these GDPR-related issues will surprisingly be found within the marketing automation platforms and solutions themselves. Marketers will need to leverage these platforms to drive enhanced personalization through automated preference management, a functionality that will now become crucial to email marketing in the post-GDPR era.</p><p>The big data-driven picture</p><p>The larger points the GDPR makes is regarding various complex arguments on online privacy, who owns our personal data, the rising tide against Big Tech, and the future of targeted marketing, ad tech, and marketing automation. It's much more extensive than current U.S. laws on data privacy and begs the question if the EU is leading the legislative wave against the data collection practices today's marketers have become intensely reliant on. It has also proved just how dominant Googleand Facebook have become in the online advertising market, and that updates to current data privacy regulations will do little to change this fact.</p><p>For now, it seems a majority of major advertising players based out of the U.S. show no signs of expanding compliance past the borders of Europe. On the flipside, U.S.-based companies that can't afford or ensure GDPR compliance are simply choosing to neglect the EU audience altogether. However, for global brands compliance driven through marketing automation functionality will be critical for continued targeted and email marketing success and the avoidance of major fines. It will be interesting to see what new marketing strategies and campaigns emerge from forward-thinking U.S.-based companies and global brands set on dominating today's post-GDPR online world despite the compliance obstacles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3285667</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNR-43D1-DY58-D3R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><timeReceived>09:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

Certain countries, notably the US and Canada do not regulate Internet services. In a competitive market this might no be necessary, however, in North America, as in most places, there is no competition. As a consequence, carriers use their monopoly/duopoly position to maximize returns, which means higher costs and lower service. It is not coincidence that Internet service providers in Canada and the US are unusually profitable despite offering substandard service along with high prices relative to areas where regulation is in effect. A loss of Net Neutrality further restricts competition by establishing barriers against competition for Internet services since new entrants would lack the funds to pay off the carriers to carry their offering. I believe Internet services should be fully regulated as a utility such as electricity is. Unfortunately, this is not done yet: no doubt well funded lobbyists will make a sincere effort to reverse the move.&lt;nl/&gt; 'The Federal Communications Commission today voted to enforce net neutrality rules that prevent Internet providers\u2014including cellular carriers\u2014from blocking or throttling traffic or giving priority to Web services in exchange for payment. The most controversial part of the FCC's decision reclassifies fixed and mobile broadband as a telecommunications service, with providers to be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. This decision brings Internet service under the same type of regulatory regime faced by wireline telephone service and mobile voice, though the FCC is forbearing from stricter utility-style rules that it could also apply under Title II.'&lt;nl/&gt; Android Captures Tiny 11% Share of Global Smartphone Profit in Q4 2014[2]&lt;nl/&gt; The way to make money in technology is to establish a closed, proprietary, standard. This explains the success of Apple, Microsoft, and Intel. It is not surprising that Apple earns most of the money from the smartphone market as they are the only company with significant market share to have established such a position. It is worthwhile noting that Apple's position was gained when it was perceived as a technological leader, rather than the follower it currently is. Consumers will eventually get wise to the situation and prices (and thereby profits) will plunge. Needless to say, none of this will motivate vendors to move to Firefox, Microsoft, or some other OS vendor because those will neither be profitable nor have measurable market share.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Global smartphone operating profit grew 31 percent annually from US$16.2 billion in Q4 2013 to US$21.2 billion in Q4 2014. Android hardware vendors combined took a record-low 11 percent global smartphone profit share, down from 29 percent one year ago. In contrast, Apple iOS captured a record-high 89 percent profit share, up from 71 percent in Q4 2013. Apple iOS continues to tighten its grip on the smartphone industry. Apple's strategy of premium products and lean logistics is proving hugely profitable. Android's weak profitability for its hardware partners will worry Google. If major smartphone manufacturers, like Samsung or Huawei, cannot make decent profits from the Android ecosystem, they may be tempted in the future to look at alternative platforms such as Microsoft, Tizen or Firefox.'&lt;nl/&gt; ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;This article is an excerpt.

Buy Your Own Phone[4]&lt;nl/&gt; I admit to being perplexed that so many consumers preferred to remain indentured to a mobile carrier rather than buying an unlocked phone. Most carriers will offer a discount if you 'bring your own device' and you end up with significant bargaining power once you have the option of switching carriers at any time. Do not, however, pay the full shot for a phone from carrier: in Canada, for example, Rogers was charging 20% more for a 'locked' Nexus 5 than what you would pay for an unlocked version directly from Google.&lt;nl/&gt; 'I am an idiot. I signed a two-year contract to get my iPhone 6. Without much thought, I did what most Americans do every two years: I agreed to be locked in by a multibillion-dollar wireless company. With pricey contracts and confusing add-ons, they make it incredibly hard to leave, let alone take our phones with us. I deserve to walk around with 'Property of Verizon' stamped on my forehead. We sign on the dotted line because we presume it will save us money on that new shiny phone and our monthly service. But here's the thing they don't want us to know: Neither is necessarily true anymore.'&lt;nl/&gt; Rogues Falsely Claim Copyright on YouTube Videos to Hijack Ad Dollars[5]&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;Can there be no more vile crime than asserting copyright over another person's cat video? Well, not so much crime because it is not clear they are doing anything illegal. After all, Google has no interest as to whether you or the Russian mob owns your cat video, so long as the advertising dollars keep spending. They set up an automated process for 'take down' notices which essentially transfer the burden off proof to the original owner rather than the guy making the allegation. Nevertheless, this may be civil fraud and not criminal. I am surprised there hasn't been a class action suit on the matter.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Cat videos are all the rage on YouTube, so much so that a Russian company hijacked a recent cute clip of a feline named 'Pepper' in order to steal the ad revenue. Kidnapping YouTube videos, which anecdotal evidence suggests has happened thousands of times, is as easy as it gets. A Russian company called Netcom Partners and others are taking advantage of YouTube's copyright-control filters, known as Content ID. It's not clear how much money the scammers are stealing from YouTube videomakers. But if you judge by the volume of complaints about the hijacking on Google's forums, it's likely Netcom and others are doing pretty well making money for nothing.'&lt;nl/&gt; The post The Geek's Reading List: Week of February 27, 2015[6] appeared first on Cantech Letter[7].&lt;nl/&gt;

This was a slow week for tech news - Probably the most significant development was the decision by the US FCC to regulate Internet services in a limited sense as a utility and to enforce net neutrality. Ultimately this is a political decision which will pit the well monied carriers and large Internet companies (some of whom gain if there is no net neutrality) against lowly consumers and businesses.</p><p> FCC votes for net neutrality, a ban on paid fast lanes, and Title II[1] This was, no doubt, the big tech story of the week. Certain countries, notably the US and Canada do not regulate Internet services. In a competitive market this might no be necessary, however, in North America, as in most places, there is no competition. As a consequence, carriers use their monopoly/duopoly position to maximize returns, which means higher costs and lower service. It is not coincidence that Internet service providers in Canada and the US are unusually profitable despite offering substandard service along with high prices relative to areas where regulation is in effect. A loss of Net Neutrality further restricts competition by establishing barriers against competition for Internet services since new entrants would lack the funds to pay off the carriers to carry their offering. I believe Internet services should be fully regulated as a utility such as electricity is. Unfortunately, this is not done yet: no doubt well funded lobbyists will make a sincere effort to reverse the move. 'The Federal Communications Commission today voted to enforce net neutrality rules that prevent Internet providers including cellular carriers from blocking or throttling traffic or giving priority to Web services in exchange for payment. The most controversial part of the FCC's decision reclassifies fixed and mobile broadband as a telecommunications service, with providers to be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. This decision brings Internet service under the same type of regulatory regime faced by wireline telephone service and mobile voice, though the FCC is forbearing from stricter utility-style rules that it could also apply under Title II.' Android Captures Tiny 11% Share of Global Smartphone Profit in Q4 2014[2] The way to make money in technology is to establish a closed, proprietary, standard. This explains the success of Apple, Microsoft, and Intel. It is not surprising that Apple earns most of the money from the smartphone market as they are the only company with significant market share to have established such a position. It is worthwhile noting that Apple's position was gained when it was perceived as a technological leader, rather than the follower it currently is. Consumers will eventually get wise to the situation and prices (and thereby profits) will plunge. Needless to say, none of this will motivate vendors to move to Firefox, Microsoft, or some other OS vendor because those will neither be profitable nor have measurable market share. 'Global smartphone operating profit grew 31 percent annually from US$16.2 billion in Q4 2013 to US$21.2 billion in Q4 2014. Android hardware vendors combined took a record-low 11 percent global smartphone profit share, down from 29 percent one year ago. In contrast, Apple iOS captured a record-high 89 percent profit share, up from 71 percent in Q4 2013. Apple iOS continues to tighten its grip on the smartphone industry. Apple's strategy of premium products and lean logistics is proving hugely profitable. Android's weak profitability for its hardware partners will worry Google. If major smartphone manufacturers, like Samsung or Huawei, cannot make decent profits from the Android ecosystem, they may be tempted in the future to look at alternative platforms such as Microsoft, Tizen or Firefox.' ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________This article is an excerpt.

Buy Your Own Phone[4] I admit to being perplexed that so many consumers preferred to remain indentured to a mobile carrier rather than buying an unlocked phone. Most carriers will offer a discount if you 'bring your own device' and you end up with significant bargaining power once you have the option of switching carriers at any time. Do not, however, pay the full shot for a phone from carrier: in Canada, for example, Rogers was charging 20% more for a 'locked' Nexus 5 than what you would pay for an unlocked version directly from Google. 'I am an idiot. I signed a two-year contract to get my iPhone 6. Without much thought, I did what most Americans do every two years: I agreed to be locked in by a multibillion-dollar wireless company. With pricey contracts and confusing add-ons, they make it incredibly hard to leave, let alone take our phones with us. I deserve to walk around with 'Property of Verizon' stamped on my forehead. We sign on the dotted line because we presume it will save us money on that new shiny phone and our monthly service. But here's the thing they don't want us to know: Neither is necessarily true anymore.' Rogues Falsely Claim Copyright on YouTube Videos to Hijack Ad Dollars[5]Can there be no more vile crime than asserting copyright over another person's cat video? Well, not so much crime because it is not clear they are doing anything illegal. After all, Google has no interest as to whether you or the Russian mob owns your cat video, so long as the advertising dollars keep spending. They set up an automated process for 'take down' notices which essentially transfer the burden off proof to the original owner rather than the guy making the allegation. Nevertheless, this may be civil fraud and not criminal. I am surprised there hasn't been a class action suit on the matter. 'Cat videos are all the rage on YouTube, so much so that a Russian company hijacked a recent cute clip of a feline named 'Pepper' in order to steal the ad revenue. Kidnapping YouTube videos, which anecdotal evidence suggests has happened thousands of times, is as easy as it gets. A Russian company called Netcom Partners and others are taking advantage of YouTube's copyright-control filters, known as Content ID. It's not clear how much money the scammers are stealing from YouTube videomakers. But if you judge by the volume of complaints about the hijacking on Google's forums, it's likely Netcom and others are doing pretty well making money for nothing.'

Two years earlier, with her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier, now director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, Doudna had achieved one of the most stunning breakthroughs in the history of biology, becoming the first to use a process called CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the genetic makeup of living organisms. Their \"gene-editing\" tool would allow scientists to efficiently insert or delete specific bits of DNA with unprecedented precision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as applications related to modifying human genes were soon reported in the scientific literature, Doudna began to worry. In the dream, a colleague asked if she would help teach someone how to use CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats). She followed him into a room to be greeted by Adolph Hitler wearing a pig face. The nightmare reinforced her belief that public discussion of the technology was far behind the breakneck pace of its emerging applications. She feared a public backlash that would prevent beneficial forms of gene-editing research from moving forward.</p><p>Doudna organized a workshop among scientists, ethicists, and other experts; they published a 2015 paper in Science urging an international summit on the ethics of gene-editing and a voluntary pause in scientific research that would alter the genetic makeup of humans. In a TED talk that year, she called for a global conversation about gene editing so scientists and the public could consider the full range of social and ethical implications. Her 2017 book, A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, coauthored with her former student Samuel Sternberg, follows up on these efforts.</p><p>In their book, Doudna and Sternberg systematically review the vast number of applications across the life sciences that CRISPR-Cas9 may enable. With livestock, gene editing can be used to produce leaner meat, to make livestock more resistant to infection, to remove allergens from eggs and milk, to reduce the use of antibiotics, and to achieve other outcomes that benefit human nutrition and animal welfare. In medicine, gene editing is being used to engineer mosquitoes so they no longer spread viruses such as malaria or Zika, and mice so they no longer transmit Lyme disease to ticks, thereby reducing infection rates among humans. In other applications, the gene editing of goats, chickens, and rabbits may allow pharmaceuticals to be manufactured more quickly, at higher yields, and at lower cost than by way of traditional laboratory methods. In the future, gene-edited pigs may even be a major source for lifesaving organ transplants, providing tissues that are less likely to be rejected by human patients.</p><p>In a process called somatic gene editing, scientists are exploring ways to treat diseases caused by a single mutated gene such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's, and sickle cell disease. The patient's cells in the affected tissues would be either edited within the body or edited outside and returned to the patient. In both cases, the corrections would not be passed on to offspring. But in terms of human applications, the most widely debated research involves so-called germline gene editing. This process would alter sperm, eggs, and early stage embryos to protect a child against inheritable diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and forms of cancer. But such techniques could also potentially be used to select for specific physical traits or to boost human performance by way of denser bones and greater endurance, creating so-called designer babies. In each application, as a human matured, the altered DNA would be copied into every cell, and passed on to their progeny.</p><p>Not surprisingly, public opinion surveys reveal widespread public reservations about the technology and a firm belief that scientists should consult the public before applying gene-editing techniques to humans. Given the many important considerations that gene editing raises, in 2017 the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that scientists invest in ongoing input from the public regarding the benefits and risks of human genome editing, and that more research be conducted to better understand how to facilitate such a process.</p><p>But to lead a national and global conversation about gene editing, scientists will need help not only from their colleagues in the humanities, social sciences, and creative arts, but also from journalists and philanthropists. Informed public discussion about gene editing is not possible without high-quality, sustained reporting from journalists with deep knowledge of the subject. And new initiatives designed to understand public attitudes, to facilitate public dialogue, and to report on the complexities of gene editing will not be possible without financial support from philanthropists and their foundations.</p><p>A Skeptical Public</p><p>Given that discussion of human gene editing still remains primarily confined to scientific meetings and to elite gatherings such as TED conferences, it is not surprising that a 2016 Pew Research Center survey showed that 42 percent of Americans have heard \"nothing at all\" about the topic, compared with 48 percent \"a little\" and 9 percent \"a lot.\" But polls also show that Americans hold fairly consistent opinions and judgments about gene editing, even as they possess very little information about the complex subject. To do so, individuals actively draw on their religious and cultural values, familiar narratives from popular culture, and similarities to past debates.</p><p>For example, in the same Pew survey, when asked about the moral acceptability of gene-editing techniques intended to give healthy babies a reduced risk of disease, only 28 percent of Americans consider the application acceptable, compared with 30 percent who say it is unacceptable and 40 percent who are not sure. Notably, among the onethird of Americans who can be classified as highly religious, only 15 percent consider such applications morally acceptable (see the figure at left). When asked separately if such an application meddled with nature and crossed a line that should not be crossed, 64 percent of highly religious Americans agreed with the statement.</p><p>For many religious Americans, gene editing is likely dosely assodated with past debates over embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research. In these controversies, Christian leaders mobilized opposition to government funding by framing research as a violation of religious teachings. From a traditional Christian perspective, human life begins at conception and is created in God's image. Embryos are considered to be divinely created human beings. When sdentists destroy or alter human embryos, they take on the role of God, violating divine will. Therefore, traditional Christians believe that embryo research is morally wrong and that if it is funded by the government using tax revenues, such funding makes all Americans complidt in destroying human life. In the Pew survey, for example, among those who said gene editing was morally unacceptable, more than one-third of responses made reference to changing God's plan or violating his wifi.</p><p>But as various survey findings indicate, it is not just strongly religious Americans who have moral reservations about gene editing. Even among nonreligious Americans, 17 percent say that gene editing to give babies a much reduced risk of disease is morally unacceptable, and 37 percent say they are unsure. In a follow-up question, more than one-quarter of nonreligious respondents say they oppose gene editing to improve the health of a baby because it would be meddling with nature and cross a line that should not be crossed. When asked more specifically if saving a baby's life required testing on human embryos or altering the genetic makeup of the whole population, about half of all Americans say that such scenarios would make the application less acceptable to them (see the figure on page 15). A 2016 survey conducted by Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health finds even stron- ger levels of reservations. In this case, when asked.about changing the genes of unborn babies to reduce their risk of developing certain serious diseases, 65 percent of Americans said that such an application should be illegal. More than 80 percent said the same when asked about gene editing to improve intelligence or physical traits.</p><p>What explains the reservations voiced by both religious and nonreligious Americans? Bioethicists have used the term Yuck Factor to describe a \"visceral repugnance\" and \"emotional opposition\" felt by the public when they first hear about human genetic engineering. This repugnance, wrote University of Chicago ethicist Leon Kass in an oft-cited 1997 article in the New Republic, is an \"emotional feeling of deep wisdom,\" that leads an individual to \"intuit and feel, immediately without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear.\" The Yuck Factor likely has its origins in Kantian and Christian philosophies of human dignity that permeate Western culture. These traditions, as political theorist Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University described in his 2002 book Our Post Human Future, emphasize that human life has a higher moral place than the rest of the natural world. Therefore, according to these philosophies, even at its earliest stages of development, human life should always be treated with a sacred respect.</p><p>Such teachings have shaped Western culture to the extent that their principles are passed on even to those who have never set foot in a church. The Yuck Factor is therefore a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation on the part of an individual, often in the absence of substantive information. When asked about emerging gene-editing techniques that would involve altering human embryos or engineering desired traits, most individuals probably have difficulty articulating why they might believe it to be morally questionable; they just know it when they feel it.</p><p>Why Journalism Matters</p><p>Although scientists hold a responsibility to engage the public about the social implications of gene editing, informed public dialogue ultimately depends heavily on journalists and their news organizations. Quality science reporting is essential to understanding how and why gene-editing research is being conducted, including the connections between new advances and ongoing debates over funding, governance, regulation, ethics, accessibility, uncertainty, and patent rights. Even in today's dramatically altered media landscape, coverage in print and online, at both traditional and new media outlets, still drives discussion of complex issues such as gene editing. These news organizations provide the information, frames of reference, and narratives that scientists, journalists, funders, policy makers, and societal leaders frequently draw upon to set policy, make decisions, or communicate with various segments of the public who trust their advice.</p><p>Yet for the past two decades, the news media have faced crippling economic and technological disruptions that have forced cutbacks in the amount of reporting on complex science topics such as gene editing. As University of Wisconsin-Madison communication scholar Dietram Scheufele has documented, due to layoffs there are also far fewer veteran journalists on staff who can draw on decades of experience to provide their readers critical context. Industry practices within journalism have also changed. In a business model dependent on Facebook and Google to generate traffic and advertising revenue, former New Republic editor Franklin Foer warns that journalists are being told by their editors to actively seek out trending topics that are likely to catch on or go viral, rather than to rely on their news judgment to decide what are the most important stories to tell readers. As a consequence, coverage of gene editing loses out to the latest sensational cultural event or breaking political scandal. When gene editing is covered, headlines and story angles may exaggerate the technology's promise and peril in an effort to win scarce reader attention.</p><p>Now is the time, therefore, for scientists and philanthropists to help journalists and news organizations to correct for these pressures and biases. They can do so by sponsoring workshops where a diversity of experts and stakeholders gather to discuss with journalists and editors the scientific, ethical, and legal implications of gene editing, making it easier for journalists to cover gene editing accurately and on a regular basis. Philanthropists, universities, and research institutions can also provide fellowships and other sources of financial support that enable journalists to spend the weeks and months required to substantively report on the subject.</p><p>But journalists are not the only professionals who are needed to write compellingly about the scientific and social implications of gene editing. Scientists, ethicists, and social scientists can also contribute commentaries and articles to the popular press, offering independent insights and context. In one initiative to help facilitate such articles, the Kavli Foundation is partnering with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and a number of science magazines and online publications (including American Scientist) to train scientists to apply the techniques and standards of journalism in writing about complex topics such as gene editing.</p><p>Investing in Public Dialogue</p><p>Yet even as quality journalism provides the main architecture around which informed debate about gene editing will take place, the scientific community, along with universities, philanthropies, and research institutions, must also help create opportunities for direct public participation in dialogue and deliberation. Such an effort starts with the sponsorship of carefully conducted social-science research that assesses public discourse about gene editing, the sources of information and arguments that are shaping debate, and the factors that are influencing public attitudes. In turn, this research should inform the design and evaluation of a variety of dialogue-based communication initiatives organized by scientific organizations, government agencies, and universities.</p><p>Over the past decades, across Europe and North America, efforts to promote dialogue-based science communication have taken various forms, but as the University of Calgary's Edna Einsiedel notes, each format shares a few common principles. First, in these initiatives, communication is defined as an iterative back-and-forth process between various segments of the public, experts, and decisionmakers. Such approaches assume that there is no single \"correct\" way to talk about and understand the social implications of a complex subject such as gene editing. Second, rather than being top-down and controlled by scientists and their partners, societal leaders and the public are invited to be active participants in defining what is discussed, sharing their own knowledge and perspectives. Third, there is no single \"public\" with which to communicate or engage, but rather multiple \"publics\" exist. These include but are not limited to church leaders and congregations, racial or ethnic groups, parents and patient advocates, and political identity groups such as liberals or conservatives.</p><p>Among the most important types of organized dialogue initiatives are smaller, more intimate events that bring together scientists with other societal leaders to facilitate the sharing of perspectives, and the forging of relationships. In one leading example, the Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion (DoSER) at the American Association for the Advancement of Science has organized workshops that convene scientists and clergy to discuss topics of mutual concern and possible disagreement such as embryonic stem cell research. To inform the discussion, focus groups were conducted in advance of the events, and the meetings were professionally facilitated. Scientists and clergy participating in the meetings indicated that the sessions helped break down stereotypes about each other, facilitating learning and mutual respect. In a related initiative, DoSER has worked with seminary schools and synagogues to develop curricula and resources that aid clergy in leading more constructive conversations about complex scientific topics with their congregations.</p><p>As these examples suggest, it is important to remember that religion is more than just a belief system that shapes how people understand gene editing. Churches are communication contexts where discussions can at times be framed in strongly moral terms by congregational leaders, reinforced by conversations that churchgoers have with others, and shaped by information provided directly when at church. For these reasons, on a topic such as gene editing, churches often serve as powerful networks of civic recruitment where congregants receive requests to voice their opinion to elected officials. During the debate over embryonic stem cell research, for example, among the strongest predictors of whether individuals had become involved politically on the issue was whether they had discussed or received information about the topic at church. In sum, when it comes to public dialogue about gene editing, scientists can either cede communication at churches to religious leaders or become active partners in facilitating and enriching church-based discussions.</p><p>Yet to promote broader public engagement across both religious and nonreligious segments of the public, the scientific community can also benefit by partnering with experts specializing in the humanities, philosophy, and the creative arts. Scholars in the humanities and philosophy draw on literature, religious traditions, and ethical frameworks to help the public consider what is good, what is right, and what is of value about a complex topic such as gene editing. Writers, artists, filmmakers, and other creative professionals are among society's most inspiring storytellers about complex issues, and they are able to communicate about gene editing in imaginative, compelling, and novel ways. Integrated into public dialogue initiatives, their work can motivate different forms of learning, sponsor critical reflection and deliberation, and produce thought-provoking visions of the future.</p><p>In a past example that serves as a prototype for such initiatives, faculty at the University of Alberta in Canada hosted workshops in 2008 that facilitated discussions about the social implications of human genetic engineering among visual artists, scientists, bioethicists, and social scientists. Informed by their conversations together, the artists were commissioned to produce visual works reflecting on the themes discussed, while the other participants were asked to write short essays. The project culminated in the exhibit \"Perceptions of Promise: Biotechnology, Society, and Art,\" which toured North America. As part of the exhibit tour, forums were held at museum venues, generating local news coverage of the themes expressed. The essays along with the artistic works were published as part of a book and catalog sold at art museums, bookstores, and online.</p><p>Apart from artistic exhibits, classic works of literature and films can also serve a similar function in stimulating public dialogue. For example, the 1997 film Gattaca is often used in college classrooms to stimulate student discussion of the social implications of human engineering. Research suggests that rather than alarming audiences, science fiction TV and film portrayals may help familiarize viewers with the moral dimensions of human genetic engineering, thereby helping them overcome their intuitive Yuck Factor reservations. This year, in recognition of the 200-year anniversary of the publication of Frankenstein, faculty at Arizona State University have published an annotated version of the novel that also features essays from scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. With support from the National Science Foundation, the university is also coordinating nationwide events and activities at science museums and centers, which include exhibits, an online multimedia game, and at-home activities for use by parents. Each is carefully designed to foster discussion about the social and ethical dimensions of gene editing and other technological innovations.</p><p>For many, such broad-based initiatives may be beyond their ability to organize or to fund. Major investments in public dialogue and in supporting high-quality journalism about gene editing will take coordinated action from leaders of the scientific community and their peers across fields including the news media and philanthropy. But scientists and others should not overlook the contributions to public dialogue they can make starting right now. University scientists, by way of their classrooms and new degree programs, can partner with their peers in the social sciences and humanities to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about the future of gene editing and similar advances. At Cornell University, for example, one model to emulate is the undergraduate major in Biology and Society. Among the most popular on campus, the major enables students to group foundational training in the biological sciences with coursework in science communication, the social sciences, and the humanities.</p><p>Within their local communities, individual scientists can also actively encourage discussions about gene editing by way of informal conversations and by volunteering to give presentations to community groups, connecting with others by way of shared interests, values, and identities. Ultimately, for Jennifer Doudna, her goal is to motivate the next generation of scientists to engage much more actively and directly with the public, applying the principle of \"discussion without dictation\" on how gene editing should be used. All scientists, regardless of discipline, she argues in her recent book, must be prepared to participate in conversations with the public about the far-reaching consequences of gene editing and similarly powerful technologies.</p><p>The Yuck Factor is a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation, often in the absence of substantive information.</p><p>A strong predictor of individuals becoming involved politically on embryonic stem cell research was whether they had discussed the topic at church.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Caulfield, S., C.

Two years earlier, with her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier, now director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, Doudna had achieved one of the most stunning breakthroughs in the history of biology, becoming the first to use a process called CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the genetic makeup of living organisms. Their \"gene-editing\" tool would allow scientists to efficiently insert or delete specific bits of DNA with unprecedented precision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as applications related to modifying human genes were soon reported in the scientific literature, Doudna began to worry. In the dream, a colleague asked if she would help teach someone how to use CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats). She followed him into a room to be greeted by Adolph Hitler wearing a pig face. The nightmare reinforced her belief that public discussion of the technology was far behind the breakneck pace of its emerging applications. She feared a public backlash that would prevent beneficial forms of gene-editing research from moving forward.</p><p>Doudna organized a workshop among scientists, ethicists, and other experts; they published a 2015 paper in Science urging an international summit on the ethics of gene-editing and a voluntary pause in scientific research that would alter the genetic makeup of humans. In a TED talk that year, she called for a global conversation about gene editing so scientists and the public could consider the full range of social and ethical implications. Her 2017 book, A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, coauthored with her former student Samuel Sternberg, follows up on these efforts.</p><p>In their book, Doudna and Sternberg systematically review the vast number of applications across the life sciences that CRISPR-Cas9 may enable. With livestock, gene editing can be used to produce leaner meat, to make livestock more resistant to infection, to remove allergens from eggs and milk, to reduce the use of antibiotics, and to achieve other outcomes that benefit human nutrition and animal welfare. In medicine, gene editing is being used to engineer mosquitoes so they no longer spread viruses such as malaria or Zika, and mice so they no longer transmit Lyme disease to ticks, thereby reducing infection rates among humans. In other applications, the gene editing of goats, chickens, and rabbits may allow pharmaceuticals to be manufactured more quickly, at higher yields, and at lower cost than by way of traditional laboratory methods. In the future, gene-edited pigs may even be a major source for lifesaving organ transplants, providing tissues that are less likely to be rejected by human patients.</p><p>In a process called somatic gene editing, scientists are exploring ways to treat diseases caused by a single mutated gene such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's, and sickle cell disease. The patient's cells in the affected tissues would be either edited within the body or edited outside and returned to the patient. In both cases, the corrections would not be passed on to offspring. But in terms of human applications, the most widely debated research involves so-called germline gene editing. This process would alter sperm, eggs, and early stage embryos to protect a child against inheritable diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and forms of cancer. But such techniques could also potentially be used to select for specific physical traits or to boost human performance by way of denser bones and greater endurance, creating so-called designer babies. In each application, as a human matured, the altered DNA would be copied into every cell, and passed on to their progeny.</p><p>Not surprisingly, public opinion surveys reveal widespread public reservations about the technology and a firm belief that scientists should consult the public before applying gene-editing techniques to humans. Given the many important considerations that gene editing raises, in 2017 the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that scientists invest in ongoing input from the public regarding the benefits and risks of human genome editing, and that more research be conducted to better understand how to facilitate such a process.</p><p>But to lead a national and global conversation about gene editing, scientists will need help not only from their colleagues in the humanities, social sciences, and creative arts, but also from journalists and philanthropists. Informed public discussion about gene editing is not possible without high-quality, sustained reporting from journalists with deep knowledge of the subject. And new initiatives designed to understand public attitudes, to facilitate public dialogue, and to report on the complexities of gene editing will not be possible without financial support from philanthropists and their foundations.</p><p>A Skeptical Public</p><p>Given that discussion of human gene editing still remains primarily confined to scientific meetings and to elite gatherings such as TED conferences, it is not surprising that a 2016 Pew Research Center survey showed that 42 percent of Americans have heard \"nothing at all\" about the topic, compared with 48 percent \"a little\" and 9 percent \"a lot.\" But polls also show that Americans hold fairly consistent opinions and judgments about gene editing, even as they possess very little information about the complex subject. To do so, individuals actively draw on their religious and cultural values, familiar narratives from popular culture, and similarities to past debates.</p><p>For example, in the same Pew survey, when asked about the moral acceptability of gene-editing techniques intended to give healthy babies a reduced risk of disease, only 28 percent of Americans consider the application acceptable, compared with 30 percent who say it is unacceptable and 40 percent who are not sure. Notably, among the onethird of Americans who can be classified as highly religious, only 15 percent consider such applications morally acceptable (see the figure at left). When asked separately if such an application meddled with nature and crossed a line that should not be crossed, 64 percent of highly religious Americans agreed with the statement.</p><p>For many religious Americans, gene editing is likely dosely assodated with past debates over embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research. In these controversies, Christian leaders mobilized opposition to government funding by framing research as a violation of religious teachings. From a traditional Christian perspective, human life begins at conception and is created in God's image. Embryos are considered to be divinely created human beings. When sdentists destroy or alter human embryos, they take on the role of God, violating divine will. Therefore, traditional Christians believe that embryo research is morally wrong and that if it is funded by the government using tax revenues, such funding makes all Americans complidt in destroying human life. In the Pew survey, for example, among those who said gene editing was morally unacceptable, more than one-third of responses made reference to changing God's plan or violating his wifi.</p><p>But as various survey findings indicate, it is not just strongly religious Americans who have moral reservations about gene editing. Even among nonreligious Americans, 17 percent say that gene editing to give babies a much reduced risk of disease is morally unacceptable, and 37 percent say they are unsure. In a follow-up question, more than one-quarter of nonreligious respondents say they oppose gene editing to improve the health of a baby because it would be meddling with nature and cross a line that should not be crossed. When asked more specifically if saving a baby's life required testing on human embryos or altering the genetic makeup of the whole population, about half of all Americans say that such scenarios would make the application less acceptable to them (see the figure on page 15). A 2016 survey conducted by Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health finds even stron- ger levels of reservations. In this case, when asked.about changing the genes of unborn babies to reduce their risk of developing certain serious diseases, 65 percent of Americans said that such an application should be illegal. More than 80 percent said the same when asked about gene editing to improve intelligence or physical traits.</p><p>What explains the reservations voiced by both religious and nonreligious Americans? Bioethicists have used the term Yuck Factor to describe a \"visceral repugnance\" and \"emotional opposition\" felt by the public when they first hear about human genetic engineering. This repugnance, wrote University of Chicago ethicist Leon Kass in an oft-cited 1997 article in the New Republic, is an \"emotional feeling of deep wisdom,\" that leads an individual to \"intuit and feel, immediately without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear.\" The Yuck Factor likely has its origins in Kantian and Christian philosophies of human dignity that permeate Western culture. These traditions, as political theorist Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University described in his 2002 book Our Post Human Future, emphasize that human life has a higher moral place than the rest of the natural world. Therefore, according to these philosophies, even at its earliest stages of development, human life should always be treated with a sacred respect.</p><p>Such teachings have shaped Western culture to the extent that their principles are passed on even to those who have never set foot in a church. The Yuck Factor is therefore a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation on the part of an individual, often in the absence of substantive information. When asked about emerging gene-editing techniques that would involve altering human embryos or engineering desired traits, most individuals probably have difficulty articulating why they might believe it to be morally questionable; they just know it when they feel it.</p><p>Why Journalism Matters</p><p>Although scientists hold a responsibility to engage the public about the social implications of gene editing, informed public dialogue ultimately depends heavily on journalists and their news organizations. Quality science reporting is essential to understanding how and why gene-editing research is being conducted, including the connections between new advances and ongoing debates over funding, governance, regulation, ethics, accessibility, uncertainty, and patent rights. Even in today's dramatically altered media landscape, coverage in print and online, at both traditional and new media outlets, still drives discussion of complex issues such as gene editing. These news organizations provide the information, frames of reference, and narratives that scientists, journalists, funders, policy makers, and societal leaders frequently draw upon to set policy, make decisions, or communicate with various segments of the public who trust their advice.</p><p>Yet for the past two decades, the news media have faced crippling economic and technological disruptions that have forced cutbacks in the amount of reporting on complex science topics such as gene editing. As University of Wisconsin-Madison communication scholar Dietram Scheufele has documented, due to layoffs there are also far fewer veteran journalists on staff who can draw on decades of experience to provide their readers critical context. Industry practices within journalism have also changed. In a business model dependent on Facebook and Google to generate traffic and advertising revenue, former New Republic editor Franklin Foer warns that journalists are being told by their editors to actively seek out trending topics that are likely to catch on or go viral, rather than to rely on their news judgment to decide what are the most important stories to tell readers. As a consequence, coverage of gene editing loses out to the latest sensational cultural event or breaking political scandal. When gene editing is covered, headlines and story angles may exaggerate the technology's promise and peril in an effort to win scarce reader attention.</p><p>Now is the time, therefore, for scientists and philanthropists to help journalists and news organizations to correct for these pressures and biases. They can do so by sponsoring workshops where a diversity of experts and stakeholders gather to discuss with journalists and editors the scientific, ethical, and legal implications of gene editing, making it easier for journalists to cover gene editing accurately and on a regular basis. Philanthropists, universities, and research institutions can also provide fellowships and other sources of financial support that enable journalists to spend the weeks and months required to substantively report on the subject.</p><p>But journalists are not the only professionals who are needed to write compellingly about the scientific and social implications of gene editing. Scientists, ethicists, and social scientists can also contribute commentaries and articles to the popular press, offering independent insights and context. In one initiative to help facilitate such articles, the Kavli Foundation is partnering with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and a number of science magazines and online publications (including American Scientist) to train scientists to apply the techniques and standards of journalism in writing about complex topics such as gene editing.</p><p>Investing in Public Dialogue</p><p>Yet even as quality journalism provides the main architecture around which informed debate about gene editing will take place, the scientific community, along with universities, philanthropies, and research institutions, must also help create opportunities for direct public participation in dialogue and deliberation. Such an effort starts with the sponsorship of carefully conducted social-science research that assesses public discourse about gene editing, the sources of information and arguments that are shaping debate, and the factors that are influencing public attitudes. In turn, this research should inform the design and evaluation of a variety of dialogue-based communication initiatives organized by scientific organizations, government agencies, and universities.</p><p>Over the past decades, across Europe and North America, efforts to promote dialogue-based science communication have taken various forms, but as the University of Calgary's Edna Einsiedel notes, each format shares a few common principles. First, in these initiatives, communication is defined as an iterative back-and-forth process between various segments of the public, experts, and decisionmakers. Such approaches assume that there is no single \"correct\" way to talk about and understand the social implications of a complex subject such as gene editing. Second, rather than being top-down and controlled by scientists and their partners, societal leaders and the public are invited to be active participants in defining what is discussed, sharing their own knowledge and perspectives. Third, there is no single \"public\" with which to communicate or engage, but rather multiple \"publics\" exist. These include but are not limited to church leaders and congregations, racial or ethnic groups, parents and patient advocates, and political identity groups such as liberals or conservatives.</p><p>Among the most important types of organized dialogue initiatives are smaller, more intimate events that bring together scientists with other societal leaders to facilitate the sharing of perspectives, and the forging of relationships. In one leading example, the Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion (DoSER) at the American Association for the Advancement of Science has organized workshops that convene scientists and clergy to discuss topics of mutual concern and possible disagreement such as embryonic stem cell research. To inform the discussion, focus groups were conducted in advance of the events, and the meetings were professionally facilitated. Scientists and clergy participating in the meetings indicated that the sessions helped break down stereotypes about each other, facilitating learning and mutual respect. In a related initiative, DoSER has worked with seminary schools and synagogues to develop curricula and resources that aid clergy in leading more constructive conversations about complex scientific topics with their congregations.</p><p>As these examples suggest, it is important to remember that religion is more than just a belief system that shapes how people understand gene editing. Churches are communication contexts where discussions can at times be framed in strongly moral terms by congregational leaders, reinforced by conversations that churchgoers have with others, and shaped by information provided directly when at church. For these reasons, on a topic such as gene editing, churches often serve as powerful networks of civic recruitment where congregants receive requests to voice their opinion to elected officials. During the debate over embryonic stem cell research, for example, among the strongest predictors of whether individuals had become involved politically on the issue was whether they had discussed or received information about the topic at church. In sum, when it comes to public dialogue about gene editing, scientists can either cede communication at churches to religious leaders or become active partners in facilitating and enriching church-based discussions.</p><p>Yet to promote broader public engagement across both religious and nonreligious segments of the public, the scientific community can also benefit by partnering with experts specializing in the humanities, philosophy, and the creative arts. Scholars in the humanities and philosophy draw on literature, religious traditions, and ethical frameworks to help the public consider what is good, what is right, and what is of value about a complex topic such as gene editing. Writers, artists, filmmakers, and other creative professionals are among society's most inspiring storytellers about complex issues, and they are able to communicate about gene editing in imaginative, compelling, and novel ways. Integrated into public dialogue initiatives, their work can motivate different forms of learning, sponsor critical reflection and deliberation, and produce thought-provoking visions of the future.</p><p>In a past example that serves as a prototype for such initiatives, faculty at the University of Alberta in Canada hosted workshops in 2008 that facilitated discussions about the social implications of human genetic engineering among visual artists, scientists, bioethicists, and social scientists. Informed by their conversations together, the artists were commissioned to produce visual works reflecting on the themes discussed, while the other participants were asked to write short essays. The project culminated in the exhibit \"Perceptions of Promise: Biotechnology, Society, and Art,\" which toured North America. As part of the exhibit tour, forums were held at museum venues, generating local news coverage of the themes expressed. The essays along with the artistic works were published as part of a book and catalog sold at art museums, bookstores, and online.</p><p>Apart from artistic exhibits, classic works of literature and films can also serve a similar function in stimulating public dialogue. For example, the 1997 film Gattaca is often used in college classrooms to stimulate student discussion of the social implications of human engineering. Research suggests that rather than alarming audiences, science fiction TV and film portrayals may help familiarize viewers with the moral dimensions of human genetic engineering, thereby helping them overcome their intuitive Yuck Factor reservations. This year, in recognition of the 200-year anniversary of the publication of Frankenstein, faculty at Arizona State University have published an annotated version of the novel that also features essays from scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. With support from the National Science Foundation, the university is also coordinating nationwide events and activities at science museums and centers, which include exhibits, an online multimedia game, and at-home activities for use by parents. Each is carefully designed to foster discussion about the social and ethical dimensions of gene editing and other technological innovations.</p><p>For many, such broad-based initiatives may be beyond their ability to organize or to fund. Major investments in public dialogue and in supporting high-quality journalism about gene editing will take coordinated action from leaders of the scientific community and their peers across fields including the news media and philanthropy. But scientists and others should not overlook the contributions to public dialogue they can make starting right now. University scientists, by way of their classrooms and new degree programs, can partner with their peers in the social sciences and humanities to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about the future of gene editing and similar advances. At Cornell University, for example, one model to emulate is the undergraduate major in Biology and Society. Among the most popular on campus, the major enables students to group foundational training in the biological sciences with coursework in science communication, the social sciences, and the humanities.</p><p>Within their local communities, individual scientists can also actively encourage discussions about gene editing by way of informal conversations and by volunteering to give presentations to community groups, connecting with others by way of shared interests, values, and identities. Ultimately, for Jennifer Doudna, her goal is to motivate the next generation of scientists to engage much more actively and directly with the public, applying the principle of \"discussion without dictation\" on how gene editing should be used. All scientists, regardless of discipline, she argues in her recent book, must be prepared to participate in conversations with the public about the far-reaching consequences of gene editing and similarly powerful technologies.</p><p>The Yuck Factor is a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation, often in the absence of substantive information.</p><p>A strong predictor of individuals becoming involved politically on embryonic stem cell research was whether they had discussed the topic at church.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Caulfield, S., C.

Two years earlier, with her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier, now director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, Doudna had achieved one of the most stunning breakthroughs in the history of biology, becoming the first to use a process called CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the genetic makeup of living organisms. Their \"gene-editing\" tool would allow scientists to efficiently insert or delete specific bits of DNA with unprecedented precision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as applications related to modifying human genes were soon reported in the scientific literature, Doudna began to worry. In the dream, a colleague asked if she would help teach someone how to use CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats). She followed him into a room to be greeted by Adolph Hitler wearing a pig face. The nightmare reinforced her belief that public discussion of the technology was far behind the breakneck pace of its emerging applications. She feared a public backlash that would prevent beneficial forms of gene-editing research from moving forward.</p><p>Doudna organized a workshop among scientists, ethicists, and other experts; they published a 2015 paper in Science urging an international summit on the ethics of gene-editing and a voluntary pause in scientific research that would alter the genetic makeup of humans. In a TED talk that year, she called for a global conversation about gene editing so scientists and the public could consider the full range of social and ethical implications. Her 2017 book, A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, coauthored with her former student Samuel Sternberg, follows up on these efforts.</p><p>In their book, Doudna and Sternberg systematically review the vast number of applications across the life sciences that CRISPR-Cas9 may enable. With livestock, gene editing can be used to produce leaner meat, to make livestock more resistant to infection, to remove allergens from eggs and milk, to reduce the use of antibiotics, and to achieve other outcomes that benefit human nutrition and animal welfare. In medicine, gene editing is being used to engineer mosquitoes so they no longer spread viruses such as malaria or Zika, and mice so they no longer transmit Lyme disease to ticks, thereby reducing infection rates among humans. In other applications, the gene editing of goats, chickens, and rabbits may allow pharmaceuticals to be manufactured more quickly, at higher yields, and at lower cost than by way of traditional laboratory methods. In the future, gene-edited pigs may even be a major source for lifesaving organ transplants, providing tissues that are less likely to be rejected by human patients.</p><p>In a process called somatic gene editing, scientists are exploring ways to treat diseases caused by a single mutated gene such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's, and sickle cell disease. The patient's cells in the affected tissues would be either edited within the body or edited outside and returned to the patient. In both cases, the corrections would not be passed on to offspring. But in terms of human applications, the most widely debated research involves so-called germline gene editing. This process would alter sperm, eggs, and early stage embryos to protect a child against inheritable diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and forms of cancer. But such techniques could also potentially be used to select for specific physical traits or to boost human performance by way of denser bones and greater endurance, creating so-called designer babies. In each application, as a human matured, the altered DNA would be copied into every cell, and passed on to their progeny.</p><p>Not surprisingly, public opinion surveys reveal widespread public reservations about the technology and a firm belief that scientists should consult the public before applying gene-editing techniques to humans. Given the many important considerations that gene editing raises, in 2017 the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that scientists invest in ongoing input from the public regarding the benefits and risks of human genome editing, and that more research be conducted to better understand how to facilitate such a process.</p><p>But to lead a national and global conversation about gene editing, scientists will need help not only from their colleagues in the humanities, social sciences, and creative arts, but also from journalists and philanthropists. Informed public discussion about gene editing is not possible without high-quality, sustained reporting from journalists with deep knowledge of the subject. And new initiatives designed to understand public attitudes, to facilitate public dialogue, and to report on the complexities of gene editing will not be possible without financial support from philanthropists and their foundations.</p><p>A Skeptical Public</p><p>Given that discussion of human gene editing still remains primarily confined to scientific meetings and to elite gatherings such as TED conferences, it is not surprising that a 2016 Pew Research Center survey showed that 42 percent of Americans have heard \"nothing at all\" about the topic, compared with 48 percent \"a little\" and 9 percent \"a lot.\" But polls also show that Americans hold fairly consistent opinions and judgments about gene editing, even as they possess very little information about the complex subject. To do so, individuals actively draw on their religious and cultural values, familiar narratives from popular culture, and similarities to past debates.</p><p>For example, in the same Pew survey, when asked about the moral acceptability of gene-editing techniques intended to give healthy babies a reduced risk of disease, only 28 percent of Americans consider the application acceptable, compared with 30 percent who say it is unacceptable and 40 percent who are not sure. Notably, among the onethird of Americans who can be classified as highly religious, only 15 percent consider such applications morally acceptable (see the figure at left). When asked separately if such an application meddled with nature and crossed a line that should not be crossed, 64 percent of highly religious Americans agreed with the statement.</p><p>For many religious Americans, gene editing is likely dosely assodated with past debates over embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research. In these controversies, Christian leaders mobilized opposition to government funding by framing research as a violation of religious teachings. From a traditional Christian perspective, human life begins at conception and is created in God's image. Embryos are considered to be divinely created human beings. When sdentists destroy or alter human embryos, they take on the role of God, violating divine will. Therefore, traditional Christians believe that embryo research is morally wrong and that if it is funded by the government using tax revenues, such funding makes all Americans complidt in destroying human life. In the Pew survey, for example, among those who said gene editing was morally unacceptable, more than one-third of responses made reference to changing God's plan or violating his wifi.</p><p>But as various survey findings indicate, it is not just strongly religious Americans who have moral reservations about gene editing. Even among nonreligious Americans, 17 percent say that gene editing to give babies a much reduced risk of disease is morally unacceptable, and 37 percent say they are unsure. In a follow-up question, more than one-quarter of nonreligious respondents say they oppose gene editing to improve the health of a baby because it would be meddling with nature and cross a line that should not be crossed. When asked more specifically if saving a baby's life required testing on human embryos or altering the genetic makeup of the whole population, about half of all Americans say that such scenarios would make the application less acceptable to them (see the figure on page 15). A 2016 survey conducted by Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health finds even stron- ger levels of reservations. In this case, when asked.about changing the genes of unborn babies to reduce their risk of developing certain serious diseases, 65 percent of Americans said that such an application should be illegal. More than 80 percent said the same when asked about gene editing to improve intelligence or physical traits.</p><p>What explains the reservations voiced by both religious and nonreligious Americans? Bioethicists have used the term Yuck Factor to describe a \"visceral repugnance\" and \"emotional opposition\" felt by the public when they first hear about human genetic engineering. This repugnance, wrote University of Chicago ethicist Leon Kass in an oft-cited 1997 article in the New Republic, is an \"emotional feeling of deep wisdom,\" that leads an individual to \"intuit and feel, immediately without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear.\" The Yuck Factor likely has its origins in Kantian and Christian philosophies of human dignity that permeate Western culture. These traditions, as political theorist Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University described in his 2002 book Our Post Human Future, emphasize that human life has a higher moral place than the rest of the natural world. Therefore, according to these philosophies, even at its earliest stages of development, human life should always be treated with a sacred respect.</p><p>Such teachings have shaped Western culture to the extent that their principles are passed on even to those who have never set foot in a church. The Yuck Factor is therefore a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation on the part of an individual, often in the absence of substantive information. When asked about emerging gene-editing techniques that would involve altering human embryos or engineering desired traits, most individuals probably have difficulty articulating why they might believe it to be morally questionable; they just know it when they feel it.</p><p>Why Journalism Matters</p><p>Although scientists hold a responsibility to engage the public about the social implications of gene editing, informed public dialogue ultimately depends heavily on journalists and their news organizations. Quality science reporting is essential to understanding how and why gene-editing research is being conducted, including the connections between new advances and ongoing debates over funding, governance, regulation, ethics, accessibility, uncertainty, and patent rights. Even in today's dramatically altered media landscape, coverage in print and online, at both traditional and new media outlets, still drives discussion of complex issues such as gene editing. These news organizations provide the information, frames of reference, and narratives that scientists, journalists, funders, policy makers, and societal leaders frequently draw upon to set policy, make decisions, or communicate with various segments of the public who trust their advice.</p><p>Yet for the past two decades, the news media have faced crippling economic and technological disruptions that have forced cutbacks in the amount of reporting on complex science topics such as gene editing. As University of Wisconsin-Madison communication scholar Dietram Scheufele has documented, due to layoffs there are also far fewer veteran journalists on staff who can draw on decades of experience to provide their readers critical context. Industry practices within journalism have also changed. In a business model dependent on Facebook and Google to generate traffic and advertising revenue, former New Republic editor Franklin Foer warns that journalists are being told by their editors to actively seek out trending topics that are likely to catch on or go viral, rather than to rely on their news judgment to decide what are the most important stories to tell readers. As a consequence, coverage of gene editing loses out to the latest sensational cultural event or breaking political scandal. When gene editing is covered, headlines and story angles may exaggerate the technology's promise and peril in an effort to win scarce reader attention.</p><p>Now is the time, therefore, for scientists and philanthropists to help journalists and news organizations to correct for these pressures and biases. They can do so by sponsoring workshops where a diversity of experts and stakeholders gather to discuss with journalists and editors the scientific, ethical, and legal implications of gene editing, making it easier for journalists to cover gene editing accurately and on a regular basis. Philanthropists, universities, and research institutions can also provide fellowships and other sources of financial support that enable journalists to spend the weeks and months required to substantively report on the subject.</p><p>But journalists are not the only professionals who are needed to write compellingly about the scientific and social implications of gene editing. Scientists, ethicists, and social scientists can also contribute commentaries and articles to the popular press, offering independent insights and context. In one initiative to help facilitate such articles, the Kavli Foundation is partnering with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and a number of science magazines and online publications (including American Scientist) to train scientists to apply the techniques and standards of journalism in writing about complex topics such as gene editing.</p><p>Investing in Public Dialogue</p><p>Yet even as quality journalism provides the main architecture around which informed debate about gene editing will take place, the scientific community, along with universities, philanthropies, and research institutions, must also help create opportunities for direct public participation in dialogue and deliberation. Such an effort starts with the sponsorship of carefully conducted social-science research that assesses public discourse about gene editing, the sources of information and arguments that are shaping debate, and the factors that are influencing public attitudes. In turn, this research should inform the design and evaluation of a variety of dialogue-based communication initiatives organized by scientific organizations, government agencies, and universities.</p><p>Over the past decades, across Europe and North America, efforts to promote dialogue-based science communication have taken various forms, but as the University of Calgary's Edna Einsiedel notes, each format shares a few common principles. First, in these initiatives, communication is defined as an iterative back-and-forth process between various segments of the public, experts, and decisionmakers. Such approaches assume that there is no single \"correct\" way to talk about and understand the social implications of a complex subject such as gene editing. Second, rather than being top-down and controlled by scientists and their partners, societal leaders and the public are invited to be active participants in defining what is discussed, sharing their own knowledge and perspectives. Third, there is no single \"public\" with which to communicate or engage, but rather multiple \"publics\" exist. These include but are not limited to church leaders and congregations, racial or ethnic groups, parents and patient advocates, and political identity groups such as liberals or conservatives.</p><p>Among the most important types of organized dialogue initiatives are smaller, more intimate events that bring together scientists with other societal leaders to facilitate the sharing of perspectives, and the forging of relationships. In one leading example, the Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion (DoSER) at the American Association for the Advancement of Science has organized workshops that convene scientists and clergy to discuss topics of mutual concern and possible disagreement such as embryonic stem cell research. To inform the discussion, focus groups were conducted in advance of the events, and the meetings were professionally facilitated. Scientists and clergy participating in the meetings indicated that the sessions helped break down stereotypes about each other, facilitating learning and mutual respect. In a related initiative, DoSER has worked with seminary schools and synagogues to develop curricula and resources that aid clergy in leading more constructive conversations about complex scientific topics with their congregations.</p><p>As these examples suggest, it is important to remember that religion is more than just a belief system that shapes how people understand gene editing. Churches are communication contexts where discussions can at times be framed in strongly moral terms by congregational leaders, reinforced by conversations that churchgoers have with others, and shaped by information provided directly when at church. For these reasons, on a topic such as gene editing, churches often serve as powerful networks of civic recruitment where congregants receive requests to voice their opinion to elected officials. During the debate over embryonic stem cell research, for example, among the strongest predictors of whether individuals had become involved politically on the issue was whether they had discussed or received information about the topic at church. In sum, when it comes to public dialogue about gene editing, scientists can either cede communication at churches to religious leaders or become active partners in facilitating and enriching church-based discussions.</p><p>Yet to promote broader public engagement across both religious and nonreligious segments of the public, the scientific community can also benefit by partnering with experts specializing in the humanities, philosophy, and the creative arts. Scholars in the humanities and philosophy draw on literature, religious traditions, and ethical frameworks to help the public consider what is good, what is right, and what is of value about a complex topic such as gene editing. Writers, artists, filmmakers, and other creative professionals are among society's most inspiring storytellers about complex issues, and they are able to communicate about gene editing in imaginative, compelling, and novel ways. Integrated into public dialogue initiatives, their work can motivate different forms of learning, sponsor critical reflection and deliberation, and produce thought-provoking visions of the future.</p><p>In a past example that serves as a prototype for such initiatives, faculty at the University of Alberta in Canada hosted workshops in 2008 that facilitated discussions about the social implications of human genetic engineering among visual artists, scientists, bioethicists, and social scientists. Informed by their conversations together, the artists were commissioned to produce visual works reflecting on the themes discussed, while the other participants were asked to write short essays. The project culminated in the exhibit \"Perceptions of Promise: Biotechnology, Society, and Art,\" which toured North America. As part of the exhibit tour, forums were held at museum venues, generating local news coverage of the themes expressed. The essays along with the artistic works were published as part of a book and catalog sold at art museums, bookstores, and online.</p><p>Apart from artistic exhibits, classic works of literature and films can also serve a similar function in stimulating public dialogue. For example, the 1997 film Gattaca is often used in college classrooms to stimulate student discussion of the social implications of human engineering. Research suggests that rather than alarming audiences, science fiction TV and film portrayals may help familiarize viewers with the moral dimensions of human genetic engineering, thereby helping them overcome their intuitive Yuck Factor reservations. This year, in recognition of the 200-year anniversary of the publication of Frankenstein, faculty at Arizona State University have published an annotated version of the novel that also features essays from scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. With support from the National Science Foundation, the university is also coordinating nationwide events and activities at science museums and centers, which include exhibits, an online multimedia game, and at-home activities for use by parents. Each is carefully designed to foster discussion about the social and ethical dimensions of gene editing and other technological innovations.</p><p>For many, such broad-based initiatives may be beyond their ability to organize or to fund. Major investments in public dialogue and in supporting high-quality journalism about gene editing will take coordinated action from leaders of the scientific community and their peers across fields including the news media and philanthropy. But scientists and others should not overlook the contributions to public dialogue they can make starting right now. University scientists, by way of their classrooms and new degree programs, can partner with their peers in the social sciences and humanities to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about the future of gene editing and similar advances. At Cornell University, for example, one model to emulate is the undergraduate major in Biology and Society. Among the most popular on campus, the major enables students to group foundational training in the biological sciences with coursework in science communication, the social sciences, and the humanities.</p><p>Within their local communities, individual scientists can also actively encourage discussions about gene editing by way of informal conversations and by volunteering to give presentations to community groups, connecting with others by way of shared interests, values, and identities. Ultimately, for Jennifer Doudna, her goal is to motivate the next generation of scientists to engage much more actively and directly with the public, applying the principle of \"discussion without dictation\" on how gene editing should be used. All scientists, regardless of discipline, she argues in her recent book, must be prepared to participate in conversations with the public about the far-reaching consequences of gene editing and similarly powerful technologies.</p><p>The Yuck Factor is a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation, often in the absence of substantive information.</p><p>A strong predictor of individuals becoming involved politically on embryonic stem cell research was whether they had discussed the topic at church.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Caulfield, S., C.

Two years earlier, with her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier, now director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, Doudna had achieved one of the most stunning breakthroughs in the history of biology, becoming the first to use a process called CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the genetic makeup of living organisms. Their \"gene-editing\" tool would allow scientists to efficiently insert or delete specific bits of DNA with unprecedented precision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as applications related to modifying human genes were soon reported in the scientific literature, Doudna began to worry. In the dream, a colleague asked if she would help teach someone how to use CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats). She followed him into a room to be greeted by Adolph Hitler wearing a pig face. The nightmare reinforced her belief that public discussion of the technology was far behind the breakneck pace of its emerging applications. She feared a public backlash that would prevent beneficial forms of gene-editing research from moving forward.</p><p>Doudna organized a workshop among scientists, ethicists, and other experts; they published a 2015 paper in Science urging an international summit on the ethics of gene-editing and a voluntary pause in scientific research that would alter the genetic makeup of humans. In a TED talk that year, she called for a global conversation about gene editing so scientists and the public could consider the full range of social and ethical implications. Her 2017 book, A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, coauthored with her former student Samuel Sternberg, follows up on these efforts.</p><p>In their book, Doudna and Sternberg systematically review the vast number of applications across the life sciences that CRISPR-Cas9 may enable. With livestock, gene editing can be used to produce leaner meat, to make livestock more resistant to infection, to remove allergens from eggs and milk, to reduce the use of antibiotics, and to achieve other outcomes that benefit human nutrition and animal welfare. In medicine, gene editing is being used to engineer mosquitoes so they no longer spread viruses such as malaria or Zika, and mice so they no longer transmit Lyme disease to ticks, thereby reducing infection rates among humans. In other applications, the gene editing of goats, chickens, and rabbits may allow pharmaceuticals to be manufactured more quickly, at higher yields, and at lower cost than by way of traditional laboratory methods. In the future, gene-edited pigs may even be a major source for lifesaving organ transplants, providing tissues that are less likely to be rejected by human patients.</p><p>In a process called somatic gene editing, scientists are exploring ways to treat diseases caused by a single mutated gene such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's, and sickle cell disease. The patient's cells in the affected tissues would be either edited within the body or edited outside and returned to the patient. In both cases, the corrections would not be passed on to offspring. But in terms of human applications, the most widely debated research involves so-called germline gene editing. This process would alter sperm, eggs, and early stage embryos to protect a child against inheritable diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and forms of cancer. But such techniques could also potentially be used to select for specific physical traits or to boost human performance by way of denser bones and greater endurance, creating so-called designer babies. In each application, as a human matured, the altered DNA would be copied into every cell, and passed on to their progeny.</p><p>Not surprisingly, public opinion surveys reveal widespread public reservations about the technology and a firm belief that scientists should consult the public before applying gene-editing techniques to humans. Given the many important considerations that gene editing raises, in 2017 the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that scientists invest in ongoing input from the public regarding the benefits and risks of human genome editing, and that more research be conducted to better understand how to facilitate such a process.</p><p>But to lead a national and global conversation about gene editing, scientists will need help not only from their colleagues in the humanities, social sciences, and creative arts, but also from journalists and philanthropists. Informed public discussion about gene editing is not possible without high-quality, sustained reporting from journalists with deep knowledge of the subject. And new initiatives designed to understand public attitudes, to facilitate public dialogue, and to report on the complexities of gene editing will not be possible without financial support from philanthropists and their foundations.</p><p>A Skeptical Public</p><p>Given that discussion of human gene editing still remains primarily confined to scientific meetings and to elite gatherings such as TED conferences, it is not surprising that a 2016 Pew Research Center survey showed that 42 percent of Americans have heard \"nothing at all\" about the topic, compared with 48 percent \"a little\" and 9 percent \"a lot.\" But polls also show that Americans hold fairly consistent opinions and judgments about gene editing, even as they possess very little information about the complex subject. To do so, individuals actively draw on their religious and cultural values, familiar narratives from popular culture, and similarities to past debates.</p><p>For example, in the same Pew survey, when asked about the moral acceptability of gene-editing techniques intended to give healthy babies a reduced risk of disease, only 28 percent of Americans consider the application acceptable, compared with 30 percent who say it is unacceptable and 40 percent who are not sure. Notably, among the onethird of Americans who can be classified as highly religious, only 15 percent consider such applications morally acceptable (see the figure at left). When asked separately if such an application meddled with nature and crossed a line that should not be crossed, 64 percent of highly religious Americans agreed with the statement.</p><p>For many religious Americans, gene editing is likely dosely assodated with past debates over embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research. In these controversies, Christian leaders mobilized opposition to government funding by framing research as a violation of religious teachings. From a traditional Christian perspective, human life begins at conception and is created in God's image. Embryos are considered to be divinely created human beings. When sdentists destroy or alter human embryos, they take on the role of God, violating divine will. Therefore, traditional Christians believe that embryo research is morally wrong and that if it is funded by the government using tax revenues, such funding makes all Americans complidt in destroying human life. In the Pew survey, for example, among those who said gene editing was morally unacceptable, more than one-third of responses made reference to changing God's plan or violating his wifi.</p><p>But as various survey findings indicate, it is not just strongly religious Americans who have moral reservations about gene editing. Even among nonreligious Americans, 17 percent say that gene editing to give babies a much reduced risk of disease is morally unacceptable, and 37 percent say they are unsure. In a follow-up question, more than one-quarter of nonreligious respondents say they oppose gene editing to improve the health of a baby because it would be meddling with nature and cross a line that should not be crossed. When asked more specifically if saving a baby's life required testing on human embryos or altering the genetic makeup of the whole population, about half of all Americans say that such scenarios would make the application less acceptable to them (see the figure on page 15). A 2016 survey conducted by Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health finds even stron- ger levels of reservations. In this case, when asked.about changing the genes of unborn babies to reduce their risk of developing certain serious diseases, 65 percent of Americans said that such an application should be illegal. More than 80 percent said the same when asked about gene editing to improve intelligence or physical traits.</p><p>What explains the reservations voiced by both religious and nonreligious Americans? Bioethicists have used the term Yuck Factor to describe a \"visceral repugnance\" and \"emotional opposition\" felt by the public when they first hear about human genetic engineering. This repugnance, wrote University of Chicago ethicist Leon Kass in an oft-cited 1997 article in the New Republic, is an \"emotional feeling of deep wisdom,\" that leads an individual to \"intuit and feel, immediately without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear.\" The Yuck Factor likely has its origins in Kantian and Christian philosophies of human dignity that permeate Western culture. These traditions, as political theorist Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University described in his 2002 book Our Post Human Future, emphasize that human life has a higher moral place than the rest of the natural world. Therefore, according to these philosophies, even at its earliest stages of development, human life should always be treated with a sacred respect.</p><p>Such teachings have shaped Western culture to the extent that their principles are passed on even to those who have never set foot in a church. The Yuck Factor is therefore a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation on the part of an individual, often in the absence of substantive information. When asked about emerging gene-editing techniques that would involve altering human embryos or engineering desired traits, most individuals probably have difficulty articulating why they might believe it to be morally questionable; they just know it when they feel it.</p><p>Why Journalism Matters</p><p>Although scientists hold a responsibility to engage the public about the social implications of gene editing, informed public dialogue ultimately depends heavily on journalists and their news organizations. Quality science reporting is essential to understanding how and why gene-editing research is being conducted, including the connections between new advances and ongoing debates over funding, governance, regulation, ethics, accessibility, uncertainty, and patent rights. Even in today's dramatically altered media landscape, coverage in print and online, at both traditional and new media outlets, still drives discussion of complex issues such as gene editing. These news organizations provide the information, frames of reference, and narratives that scientists, journalists, funders, policy makers, and societal leaders frequently draw upon to set policy, make decisions, or communicate with various segments of the public who trust their advice.</p><p>Yet for the past two decades, the news media have faced crippling economic and technological disruptions that have forced cutbacks in the amount of reporting on complex science topics such as gene editing. As University of Wisconsin-Madison communication scholar Dietram Scheufele has documented, due to layoffs there are also far fewer veteran journalists on staff who can draw on decades of experience to provide their readers critical context. Industry practices within journalism have also changed. In a business model dependent on Facebook and Google to generate traffic and advertising revenue, former New Republic editor Franklin Foer warns that journalists are being told by their editors to actively seek out trending topics that are likely to catch on or go viral, rather than to rely on their news judgment to decide what are the most important stories to tell readers. As a consequence, coverage of gene editing loses out to the latest sensational cultural event or breaking political scandal. When gene editing is covered, headlines and story angles may exaggerate the technology's promise and peril in an effort to win scarce reader attention.</p><p>Now is the time, therefore, for scientists and philanthropists to help journalists and news organizations to correct for these pressures and biases. They can do so by sponsoring workshops where a diversity of experts and stakeholders gather to discuss with journalists and editors the scientific, ethical, and legal implications of gene editing, making it easier for journalists to cover gene editing accurately and on a regular basis. Philanthropists, universities, and research institutions can also provide fellowships and other sources of financial support that enable journalists to spend the weeks and months required to substantively report on the subject.</p><p>But journalists are not the only professionals who are needed to write compellingly about the scientific and social implications of gene editing. Scientists, ethicists, and social scientists can also contribute commentaries and articles to the popular press, offering independent insights and context. In one initiative to help facilitate such articles, the Kavli Foundation is partnering with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and a number of science magazines and online publications (including American Scientist) to train scientists to apply the techniques and standards of journalism in writing about complex topics such as gene editing.</p><p>Investing in Public Dialogue</p><p>Yet even as quality journalism provides the main architecture around which informed debate about gene editing will take place, the scientific community, along with universities, philanthropies, and research institutions, must also help create opportunities for direct public participation in dialogue and deliberation. Such an effort starts with the sponsorship of carefully conducted social-science research that assesses public discourse about gene editing, the sources of information and arguments that are shaping debate, and the factors that are influencing public attitudes. In turn, this research should inform the design and evaluation of a variety of dialogue-based communication initiatives organized by scientific organizations, government agencies, and universities.</p><p>Over the past decades, across Europe and North America, efforts to promote dialogue-based science communication have taken various forms, but as the University of Calgary's Edna Einsiedel notes, each format shares a few common principles. First, in these initiatives, communication is defined as an iterative back-and-forth process between various segments of the public, experts, and decisionmakers. Such approaches assume that there is no single \"correct\" way to talk about and understand the social implications of a complex subject such as gene editing. Second, rather than being top-down and controlled by scientists and their partners, societal leaders and the public are invited to be active participants in defining what is discussed, sharing their own knowledge and perspectives. Third, there is no single \"public\" with which to communicate or engage, but rather multiple \"publics\" exist. These include but are not limited to church leaders and congregations, racial or ethnic groups, parents and patient advocates, and political identity groups such as liberals or conservatives.</p><p>Among the most important types of organized dialogue initiatives are smaller, more intimate events that bring together scientists with other societal leaders to facilitate the sharing of perspectives, and the forging of relationships. In one leading example, the Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion (DoSER) at the American Association for the Advancement of Science has organized workshops that convene scientists and clergy to discuss topics of mutual concern and possible disagreement such as embryonic stem cell research. To inform the discussion, focus groups were conducted in advance of the events, and the meetings were professionally facilitated. Scientists and clergy participating in the meetings indicated that the sessions helped break down stereotypes about each other, facilitating learning and mutual respect. In a related initiative, DoSER has worked with seminary schools and synagogues to develop curricula and resources that aid clergy in leading more constructive conversations about complex scientific topics with their congregations.</p><p>As these examples suggest, it is important to remember that religion is more than just a belief system that shapes how people understand gene editing. Churches are communication contexts where discussions can at times be framed in strongly moral terms by congregational leaders, reinforced by conversations that churchgoers have with others, and shaped by information provided directly when at church. For these reasons, on a topic such as gene editing, churches often serve as powerful networks of civic recruitment where congregants receive requests to voice their opinion to elected officials. During the debate over embryonic stem cell research, for example, among the strongest predictors of whether individuals had become involved politically on the issue was whether they had discussed or received information about the topic at church. In sum, when it comes to public dialogue about gene editing, scientists can either cede communication at churches to religious leaders or become active partners in facilitating and enriching church-based discussions.</p><p>Yet to promote broader public engagement across both religious and nonreligious segments of the public, the scientific community can also benefit by partnering with experts specializing in the humanities, philosophy, and the creative arts. Scholars in the humanities and philosophy draw on literature, religious traditions, and ethical frameworks to help the public consider what is good, what is right, and what is of value about a complex topic such as gene editing. Writers, artists, filmmakers, and other creative professionals are among society's most inspiring storytellers about complex issues, and they are able to communicate about gene editing in imaginative, compelling, and novel ways. Integrated into public dialogue initiatives, their work can motivate different forms of learning, sponsor critical reflection and deliberation, and produce thought-provoking visions of the future.</p><p>In a past example that serves as a prototype for such initiatives, faculty at the University of Alberta in Canada hosted workshops in 2008 that facilitated discussions about the social implications of human genetic engineering among visual artists, scientists, bioethicists, and social scientists. Informed by their conversations together, the artists were commissioned to produce visual works reflecting on the themes discussed, while the other participants were asked to write short essays. The project culminated in the exhibit \"Perceptions of Promise: Biotechnology, Society, and Art,\" which toured North America. As part of the exhibit tour, forums were held at museum venues, generating local news coverage of the themes expressed. The essays along with the artistic works were published as part of a book and catalog sold at art museums, bookstores, and online.</p><p>Apart from artistic exhibits, classic works of literature and films can also serve a similar function in stimulating public dialogue. For example, the 1997 film Gattaca is often used in college classrooms to stimulate student discussion of the social implications of human engineering. Research suggests that rather than alarming audiences, science fiction TV and film portrayals may help familiarize viewers with the moral dimensions of human genetic engineering, thereby helping them overcome their intuitive Yuck Factor reservations. This year, in recognition of the 200-year anniversary of the publication of Frankenstein, faculty at Arizona State University have published an annotated version of the novel that also features essays from scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. With support from the National Science Foundation, the university is also coordinating nationwide events and activities at science museums and centers, which include exhibits, an online multimedia game, and at-home activities for use by parents. Each is carefully designed to foster discussion about the social and ethical dimensions of gene editing and other technological innovations.</p><p>For many, such broad-based initiatives may be beyond their ability to organize or to fund. Major investments in public dialogue and in supporting high-quality journalism about gene editing will take coordinated action from leaders of the scientific community and their peers across fields including the news media and philanthropy. But scientists and others should not overlook the contributions to public dialogue they can make starting right now. University scientists, by way of their classrooms and new degree programs, can partner with their peers in the social sciences and humanities to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about the future of gene editing and similar advances. At Cornell University, for example, one model to emulate is the undergraduate major in Biology and Society. Among the most popular on campus, the major enables students to group foundational training in the biological sciences with coursework in science communication, the social sciences, and the humanities.</p><p>Within their local communities, individual scientists can also actively encourage discussions about gene editing by way of informal conversations and by volunteering to give presentations to community groups, connecting with others by way of shared interests, values, and identities. Ultimately, for Jennifer Doudna, her goal is to motivate the next generation of scientists to engage much more actively and directly with the public, applying the principle of \"discussion without dictation\" on how gene editing should be used. All scientists, regardless of discipline, she argues in her recent book, must be prepared to participate in conversations with the public about the far-reaching consequences of gene editing and similarly powerful technologies.</p><p>The Yuck Factor is a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation, often in the absence of substantive information.</p><p>A strong predictor of individuals becoming involved politically on embryonic stem cell research was whether they had discussed the topic at church.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Caulfield, S., C.

Two years earlier, with her colleague Emmanuelle Charpentier, now director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, Doudna had achieved one of the most stunning breakthroughs in the history of biology, becoming the first to use a process called CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the genetic makeup of living organisms. Their \"gene-editing\" tool would allow scientists to efficiently insert or delete specific bits of DNA with unprecedented precision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as applications related to modifying human genes were soon reported in the scientific literature, Doudna began to worry. In the dream, a colleague asked if she would help teach someone how to use CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindrome Repeats). She followed him into a room to be greeted by Adolph Hitler wearing a pig face. The nightmare reinforced her belief that public discussion of the technology was far behind the breakneck pace of its emerging applications. She feared a public backlash that would prevent beneficial forms of gene-editing research from moving forward.</p><p>Doudna organized a workshop among scientists, ethicists, and other experts; they published a 2015 paper in Science urging an international summit on the ethics of gene-editing and a voluntary pause in scientific research that would alter the genetic makeup of humans. In a TED talk that year, she called for a global conversation about gene editing so scientists and the public could consider the full range of social and ethical implications. Her 2017 book, A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution, coauthored with her former student Samuel Sternberg, follows up on these efforts.</p><p>In their book, Doudna and Sternberg systematically review the vast number of applications across the life sciences that CRISPR-Cas9 may enable. With livestock, gene editing can be used to produce leaner meat, to make livestock more resistant to infection, to remove allergens from eggs and milk, to reduce the use of antibiotics, and to achieve other outcomes that benefit human nutrition and animal welfare. In medicine, gene editing is being used to engineer mosquitoes so they no longer spread viruses such as malaria or Zika, and mice so they no longer transmit Lyme disease to ticks, thereby reducing infection rates among humans. In other applications, the gene editing of goats, chickens, and rabbits may allow pharmaceuticals to be manufactured more quickly, at higher yields, and at lower cost than by way of traditional laboratory methods. In the future, gene-edited pigs may even be a major source for lifesaving organ transplants, providing tissues that are less likely to be rejected by human patients.</p><p>In a process called somatic gene editing, scientists are exploring ways to treat diseases caused by a single mutated gene such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's, and sickle cell disease. The patient's cells in the affected tissues would be either edited within the body or edited outside and returned to the patient. In both cases, the corrections would not be passed on to offspring. But in terms of human applications, the most widely debated research involves so-called germline gene editing. This process would alter sperm, eggs, and early stage embryos to protect a child against inheritable diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's, and forms of cancer. But such techniques could also potentially be used to select for specific physical traits or to boost human performance by way of denser bones and greater endurance, creating so-called designer babies. In each application, as a human matured, the altered DNA would be copied into every cell, and passed on to their progeny.</p><p>Not surprisingly, public opinion surveys reveal widespread public reservations about the technology and a firm belief that scientists should consult the public before applying gene-editing techniques to humans. Given the many important considerations that gene editing raises, in 2017 the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that scientists invest in ongoing input from the public regarding the benefits and risks of human genome editing, and that more research be conducted to better understand how to facilitate such a process.</p><p>But to lead a national and global conversation about gene editing, scientists will need help not only from their colleagues in the humanities, social sciences, and creative arts, but also from journalists and philanthropists. Informed public discussion about gene editing is not possible without high-quality, sustained reporting from journalists with deep knowledge of the subject. And new initiatives designed to understand public attitudes, to facilitate public dialogue, and to report on the complexities of gene editing will not be possible without financial support from philanthropists and their foundations.</p><p>A Skeptical Public</p><p>Given that discussion of human gene editing still remains primarily confined to scientific meetings and to elite gatherings such as TED conferences, it is not surprising that a 2016 Pew Research Center survey showed that 42 percent of Americans have heard \"nothing at all\" about the topic, compared with 48 percent \"a little\" and 9 percent \"a lot.\" But polls also show that Americans hold fairly consistent opinions and judgments about gene editing, even as they possess very little information about the complex subject. To do so, individuals actively draw on their religious and cultural values, familiar narratives from popular culture, and similarities to past debates.</p><p>For example, in the same Pew survey, when asked about the moral acceptability of gene-editing techniques intended to give healthy babies a reduced risk of disease, only 28 percent of Americans consider the application acceptable, compared with 30 percent who say it is unacceptable and 40 percent who are not sure. Notably, among the onethird of Americans who can be classified as highly religious, only 15 percent consider such applications morally acceptable (see the figure at left). When asked separately if such an application meddled with nature and crossed a line that should not be crossed, 64 percent of highly religious Americans agreed with the statement.</p><p>For many religious Americans, gene editing is likely dosely assodated with past debates over embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research. In these controversies, Christian leaders mobilized opposition to government funding by framing research as a violation of religious teachings. From a traditional Christian perspective, human life begins at conception and is created in God's image. Embryos are considered to be divinely created human beings. When sdentists destroy or alter human embryos, they take on the role of God, violating divine will. Therefore, traditional Christians believe that embryo research is morally wrong and that if it is funded by the government using tax revenues, such funding makes all Americans complidt in destroying human life. In the Pew survey, for example, among those who said gene editing was morally unacceptable, more than one-third of responses made reference to changing God's plan or violating his wifi.</p><p>But as various survey findings indicate, it is not just strongly religious Americans who have moral reservations about gene editing. Even among nonreligious Americans, 17 percent say that gene editing to give babies a much reduced risk of disease is morally unacceptable, and 37 percent say they are unsure. In a follow-up question, more than one-quarter of nonreligious respondents say they oppose gene editing to improve the health of a baby because it would be meddling with nature and cross a line that should not be crossed. When asked more specifically if saving a baby's life required testing on human embryos or altering the genetic makeup of the whole population, about half of all Americans say that such scenarios would make the application less acceptable to them (see the figure on page 15). A 2016 survey conducted by Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health finds even stron- ger levels of reservations. In this case, when asked.about changing the genes of unborn babies to reduce their risk of developing certain serious diseases, 65 percent of Americans said that such an application should be illegal. More than 80 percent said the same when asked about gene editing to improve intelligence or physical traits.</p><p>What explains the reservations voiced by both religious and nonreligious Americans? Bioethicists have used the term Yuck Factor to describe a \"visceral repugnance\" and \"emotional opposition\" felt by the public when they first hear about human genetic engineering. This repugnance, wrote University of Chicago ethicist Leon Kass in an oft-cited 1997 article in the New Republic, is an \"emotional feeling of deep wisdom,\" that leads an individual to \"intuit and feel, immediately without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear.\" The Yuck Factor likely has its origins in Kantian and Christian philosophies of human dignity that permeate Western culture. These traditions, as political theorist Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University described in his 2002 book Our Post Human Future, emphasize that human life has a higher moral place than the rest of the natural world. Therefore, according to these philosophies, even at its earliest stages of development, human life should always be treated with a sacred respect.</p><p>Such teachings have shaped Western culture to the extent that their principles are passed on even to those who have never set foot in a church. The Yuck Factor is therefore a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation on the part of an individual, often in the absence of substantive information. When asked about emerging gene-editing techniques that would involve altering human embryos or engineering desired traits, most individuals probably have difficulty articulating why they might believe it to be morally questionable; they just know it when they feel it.</p><p>Why Journalism Matters</p><p>Although scientists hold a responsibility to engage the public about the social implications of gene editing, informed public dialogue ultimately depends heavily on journalists and their news organizations. Quality science reporting is essential to understanding how and why gene-editing research is being conducted, including the connections between new advances and ongoing debates over funding, governance, regulation, ethics, accessibility, uncertainty, and patent rights. Even in today's dramatically altered media landscape, coverage in print and online, at both traditional and new media outlets, still drives discussion of complex issues such as gene editing. These news organizations provide the information, frames of reference, and narratives that scientists, journalists, funders, policy makers, and societal leaders frequently draw upon to set policy, make decisions, or communicate with various segments of the public who trust their advice.</p><p>Yet for the past two decades, the news media have faced crippling economic and technological disruptions that have forced cutbacks in the amount of reporting on complex science topics such as gene editing. As University of Wisconsin-Madison communication scholar Dietram Scheufele has documented, due to layoffs there are also far fewer veteran journalists on staff who can draw on decades of experience to provide their readers critical context. Industry practices within journalism have also changed. In a business model dependent on Facebook and Google to generate traffic and advertising revenue, former New Republic editor Franklin Foer warns that journalists are being told by their editors to actively seek out trending topics that are likely to catch on or go viral, rather than to rely on their news judgment to decide what are the most important stories to tell readers. As a consequence, coverage of gene editing loses out to the latest sensational cultural event or breaking political scandal. When gene editing is covered, headlines and story angles may exaggerate the technology's promise and peril in an effort to win scarce reader attention.</p><p>Now is the time, therefore, for scientists and philanthropists to help journalists and news organizations to correct for these pressures and biases. They can do so by sponsoring workshops where a diversity of experts and stakeholders gather to discuss with journalists and editors the scientific, ethical, and legal implications of gene editing, making it easier for journalists to cover gene editing accurately and on a regular basis. Philanthropists, universities, and research institutions can also provide fellowships and other sources of financial support that enable journalists to spend the weeks and months required to substantively report on the subject.</p><p>But journalists are not the only professionals who are needed to write compellingly about the scientific and social implications of gene editing. Scientists, ethicists, and social scientists can also contribute commentaries and articles to the popular press, offering independent insights and context. In one initiative to help facilitate such articles, the Kavli Foundation is partnering with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and a number of science magazines and online publications (including American Scientist) to train scientists to apply the techniques and standards of journalism in writing about complex topics such as gene editing.</p><p>Investing in Public Dialogue</p><p>Yet even as quality journalism provides the main architecture around which informed debate about gene editing will take place, the scientific community, along with universities, philanthropies, and research institutions, must also help create opportunities for direct public participation in dialogue and deliberation. Such an effort starts with the sponsorship of carefully conducted social-science research that assesses public discourse about gene editing, the sources of information and arguments that are shaping debate, and the factors that are influencing public attitudes. In turn, this research should inform the design and evaluation of a variety of dialogue-based communication initiatives organized by scientific organizations, government agencies, and universities.</p><p>Over the past decades, across Europe and North America, efforts to promote dialogue-based science communication have taken various forms, but as the University of Calgary's Edna Einsiedel notes, each format shares a few common principles. First, in these initiatives, communication is defined as an iterative back-and-forth process between various segments of the public, experts, and decisionmakers. Such approaches assume that there is no single \"correct\" way to talk about and understand the social implications of a complex subject such as gene editing. Second, rather than being top-down and controlled by scientists and their partners, societal leaders and the public are invited to be active participants in defining what is discussed, sharing their own knowledge and perspectives. Third, there is no single \"public\" with which to communicate or engage, but rather multiple \"publics\" exist. These include but are not limited to church leaders and congregations, racial or ethnic groups, parents and patient advocates, and political identity groups such as liberals or conservatives.</p><p>Among the most important types of organized dialogue initiatives are smaller, more intimate events that bring together scientists with other societal leaders to facilitate the sharing of perspectives, and the forging of relationships. In one leading example, the Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion (DoSER) at the American Association for the Advancement of Science has organized workshops that convene scientists and clergy to discuss topics of mutual concern and possible disagreement such as embryonic stem cell research. To inform the discussion, focus groups were conducted in advance of the events, and the meetings were professionally facilitated. Scientists and clergy participating in the meetings indicated that the sessions helped break down stereotypes about each other, facilitating learning and mutual respect. In a related initiative, DoSER has worked with seminary schools and synagogues to develop curricula and resources that aid clergy in leading more constructive conversations about complex scientific topics with their congregations.</p><p>As these examples suggest, it is important to remember that religion is more than just a belief system that shapes how people understand gene editing. Churches are communication contexts where discussions can at times be framed in strongly moral terms by congregational leaders, reinforced by conversations that churchgoers have with others, and shaped by information provided directly when at church. For these reasons, on a topic such as gene editing, churches often serve as powerful networks of civic recruitment where congregants receive requests to voice their opinion to elected officials. During the debate over embryonic stem cell research, for example, among the strongest predictors of whether individuals had become involved politically on the issue was whether they had discussed or received information about the topic at church. In sum, when it comes to public dialogue about gene editing, scientists can either cede communication at churches to religious leaders or become active partners in facilitating and enriching church-based discussions.</p><p>Yet to promote broader public engagement across both religious and nonreligious segments of the public, the scientific community can also benefit by partnering with experts specializing in the humanities, philosophy, and the creative arts. Scholars in the humanities and philosophy draw on literature, religious traditions, and ethical frameworks to help the public consider what is good, what is right, and what is of value about a complex topic such as gene editing. Writers, artists, filmmakers, and other creative professionals are among society's most inspiring storytellers about complex issues, and they are able to communicate about gene editing in imaginative, compelling, and novel ways. Integrated into public dialogue initiatives, their work can motivate different forms of learning, sponsor critical reflection and deliberation, and produce thought-provoking visions of the future.</p><p>In a past example that serves as a prototype for such initiatives, faculty at the University of Alberta in Canada hosted workshops in 2008 that facilitated discussions about the social implications of human genetic engineering among visual artists, scientists, bioethicists, and social scientists. Informed by their conversations together, the artists were commissioned to produce visual works reflecting on the themes discussed, while the other participants were asked to write short essays. The project culminated in the exhibit \"Perceptions of Promise: Biotechnology, Society, and Art,\" which toured North America. As part of the exhibit tour, forums were held at museum venues, generating local news coverage of the themes expressed. The essays along with the artistic works were published as part of a book and catalog sold at art museums, bookstores, and online.</p><p>Apart from artistic exhibits, classic works of literature and films can also serve a similar function in stimulating public dialogue. For example, the 1997 film Gattaca is often used in college classrooms to stimulate student discussion of the social implications of human engineering. Research suggests that rather than alarming audiences, science fiction TV and film portrayals may help familiarize viewers with the moral dimensions of human genetic engineering, thereby helping them overcome their intuitive Yuck Factor reservations. This year, in recognition of the 200-year anniversary of the publication of Frankenstein, faculty at Arizona State University have published an annotated version of the novel that also features essays from scientists and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. With support from the National Science Foundation, the university is also coordinating nationwide events and activities at science museums and centers, which include exhibits, an online multimedia game, and at-home activities for use by parents. Each is carefully designed to foster discussion about the social and ethical dimensions of gene editing and other technological innovations.</p><p>For many, such broad-based initiatives may be beyond their ability to organize or to fund. Major investments in public dialogue and in supporting high-quality journalism about gene editing will take coordinated action from leaders of the scientific community and their peers across fields including the news media and philanthropy. But scientists and others should not overlook the contributions to public dialogue they can make starting right now. University scientists, by way of their classrooms and new degree programs, can partner with their peers in the social sciences and humanities to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about the future of gene editing and similar advances. At Cornell University, for example, one model to emulate is the undergraduate major in Biology and Society. Among the most popular on campus, the major enables students to group foundational training in the biological sciences with coursework in science communication, the social sciences, and the humanities.</p><p>Within their local communities, individual scientists can also actively encourage discussions about gene editing by way of informal conversations and by volunteering to give presentations to community groups, connecting with others by way of shared interests, values, and identities. Ultimately, for Jennifer Doudna, her goal is to motivate the next generation of scientists to engage much more actively and directly with the public, applying the principle of \"discussion without dictation\" on how gene editing should be used. All scientists, regardless of discipline, she argues in her recent book, must be prepared to participate in conversations with the public about the far-reaching consequences of gene editing and similarly powerful technologies.</p><p>The Yuck Factor is a relatively intuitive response, a reaction formed below the level of conscious deliberation, often in the absence of substantive information.</p><p>A strong predictor of individuals becoming involved politically on embryonic stem cell research was whether they had discussed the topic at church.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Caulfield, S., C.

It doesn't matter as much as the punditry assumes whether they are turning Left or Right; the important thing is that the powerless have finally started challenging their privileged overlords.Though the Powers That Be will attempt to placate or suppress the Revolt of the Powerless, the genies of political disunity and social disorder cannot be put back in the bottle. It took a generation of rising inequality, corruption and the erosion of opportunity to create a society of theprotected(the haves) and theunprotected(the have-nots), and rubber-stamping more regulations and distributing Universal Basic Income (UBI) will not rebalance a system that is irrevocably out of balance.But the rise of resistance, as yet nascent, is only half the story: economictrends andcyclesare turning as well, and even if the worms remain passively underground, these reversals will disrupt the status quo. </p><p>The dominant narrative--the rightness, goodness and sustainability of endless growth of consumption and debt--will unravel, and the internal contradictions of this New Gilded Age (widening wealth/income/power inequality) will finally burst through the thin faade of stability that's been patched together over the past nine years of 'recovery.'Eight Key Trends/Cycles Are TurningHere's the thing about trends and cycles: when they inevitably lose altitude or reverse, we rush around trying to identify the cause. All sorts of theories are put forth, but as a general rule, it rarely boils down to one dynamic.Consider the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire. Efforts to identify the cause go back hundreds of years, and include everything from barbarian invasions to the use of lead pipes to deliver water.A new book,The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire[1], pins a significant part of the responsibility on climate change and pandemic diseases\u2014system-wide dynamics that slowly sapped Rome's vigor, food supplies, capital and labor force. Not only that, but cooling weather patterns in Eurasia may have been behind the westward movement of the mobile tribes (the Huns and Mongolians) that pushed existing tribes on Rome's borders into Roman territories\u2014the so-called Barbarian Invasions.The point here is that systemic trends and cycles are often causally connected and tend to reinforce each other. This is how a stable, wealthy and resilient society gets hollowed out: trends end and cycles reverse, and forces that added stability, capital and resilience when they were working together are slowly replaced by forces that erode the foundations of wealth and stability.In the current era, eight interconnected trends/cycles are either reaching the end of their run or reversing:-- Central bank distortion/manipulation of markets.-- The business cycle of credit/debt expansion and contraction.-- The yield/interest rate cycle.-- The commodity cycle.-- The stock market cycle.-- Regulation.-- Globalization.-- Demographics.Each of these would need a short book to do the topic even partial justice, but let's summarize each trend/cycle.Let's stipulate thattechnology isn't a cycle or a trend; its disruptions of existing sectors and institutions accelerate and decelerate over time, but it is woven inseparably into all the trends and cycles listed above. That said, the emergence of some new technology doesn't mean the business cycle will be repealed for all time; cycles and trends are influenced by Human Wetware V1.0, an OS developed between 100,000 and 160,000 years ago and still in Version One.Resource depletion is another background to these trends and cycles: robots and drones will not restore depleted ground water or bring back ocean fisheries.Central Bank Distortion / Manipulation of MarketsMinus the $21 trillion in central bank asset purchases and trillions more in liquidity/credit programs, would the global economy be growing and global markets be at nosebleed heights? We all know the answer is \"no.\"Central banks have engineered a \"recovery\" that looks real enough on the surface, but what are its foundations? Gamed statistics and manipulated markets\u2014in other words, controlling not just the narrative but the information available to market participants. To achieve the desired outcome\u2014rising equity markets, near-zero bond yields and incentivizing the purchase of risk-on assets\u2014central banks have distorted market information and mechanisms.The returns on this coordinated distortion are diminishing. The 'buzz' from the initial injections has faded, and now that the monetary authorities are trying to wean the markets off of their drug, the markets have lost the ability to discover the price of assets, risk and capital on their own.No wonder volatility is rising.Flooding the economy with trillions in new stimulus worked wonders in the initial stage, but after 9 years, the unintended consequences are metastasizing.Goosing asset valuations higher in service of 'the wealth effect' has widened wealth/ income inequality, creating a New Gilded Age of a few haves and many have-nots. The benefits of the central bank punch bowl\u2014near-zero interest rates, leverage and access to unlimited credit--are reserved for those few at the top of the wealth-power pyramid; very little of the stupendous wealth created out of thin air has trickled down to the bottom 95%.The relentless rise in asset valuations has pushed homes out of reach of those living in desirable urban/suburban markets, and exposed buyers to the risks of an inevitablereversion to the mean, i.e. a collapse of bubble prices back to historical norms.Capital is not incentivized to invest in productivity or communities for the long haul; the incentives are for stock buybacks and short-term leveraged speculative bets, forms of mal-investment that hollow out the productive real economy is favor of a momentum-driven financialization boom.Much of the political resistance troubling the status quo can be traced directly to central bank policies that have exacerbated the New Gilded Age inequalities and excesses. If the central banks can't find the will to reduce their distortions in service of the few, the political will of the many will do it for them.The Business Cycle of Credit Expansion ...ntractionThe business cycle is a basic structure of any economy based on credit and flows of capital seeking the highest available returns at the lowest available risk. In the expansion stage, households and enterprises borrow more money to boost production and satisfy unmet demand. Speculators find opportunities in new enterprises and new markets.In the contraction phase, all the inevitable excesses of freely available credit come home to roost. Marginal investments in new production fail to become profitable and go bust. Marginal household borrowers default, and speculators who bet the farm on momentum plays watch their capital evaporate like mist in Death Valley.When too much income is being devoted to servicing existing debt, there's no more net income available to support additional borrowing. Lenders facing losses due to defaults tighten lending standards, and credit\u2014and thus the economy\u2014contracts.This cycle is an essential dynamic of capitalism. Central banks have attempted to eliminate the contraction phase that acts as the immune system, washing out bad debt and marginal borrowers. This has left the economy saddled with 'zombie' corporations and debtors that would be liquidated if monetary policies weren't enabling their feeble survival.But even the most powerful central banks can't force firms and individuals to borrow more money when it no longer makes sense to do so. And keeping zombie banks, corporations and households on life support weakens the financial system by piling up the equivalent of dead wood in the forest. When the inevitable conflagration of bad debt catches fire, many of the healthy trees will also be consumed in the flames.The Yield / Interest Rate CycleMany observers are confident interest rates cannot rise due to the deflationary forces in play. Indeed, they predict a future decline in rates back to zero. Perhaps, but history suggests interest rates typically move in long cycles of roughly two or three decades. The current downtrend in rates dates back to 1981, which means the current trend is pushing 40 years. That's stretching the historical boundaries.As noted earlier, trends change and then we seek the causes. Interest rates are rising, and perhaps we need no explanation other thanreversion to the mean.The Commodity CycleCompared to the stock market (the S...00), commodities are at their cyclical lows. As to what happens next, we need only look at a single chart, courtesy of Incrementum AG:The Stock Market CycleWe're implicitly being told that stock markets can loft higher forever, as long as central banks are pumping out the financial stimulus. But nothing goes up forever; valuations get stretched, marginal buyers disappear and doubts about the continuing efficacy of central bank distortions creep in.The typical Bull Market has a leading sector. Starting with the mass-market Industrial Revolution in the 19thcentury, leaders tend to be new industries: railroads, radio, computers, the Internet, etc., or existing industries that have been revolutionized by some innovation: for example, banks freed from regulatory oversight discovered subprime mortgages in the 2000s.The current leaders\u2014the so-called FAANG stocks\u2014are getting tired. The tech leaders have reached a scale where growth must slow; the expansion of Facebook from 100 million users to 1 billion was a 10-fold increase; the expansion from 1 billion to 2 billion, a double. Are there even another billion potential users with the bandwidth, devices and interest to join? How much additional revenue can be extracted by selling the data of increasingly marginal users?The same issues of scale are sapping the growth of Apple, Google, et al. What happens when Apple has already sold an iPhone to everyone with the means and interest to own one?There is now political pushback against the quasi-monopolies of big tech. Politicians are being forced to 'do something,' i.e. increase regulations, whether they accomplish the intended goal or not.Valuations and profits are at the top of their respective cycles, the leaders are faltering, victims of their own dominance, and central banks are feeling pressured to reduce the punch bowlof free money for financiers.RegulationDemocracy is no longer about solving real problems and being held accountable; it's all about persuading the public that all is well, or distracting them with ginned up controversies. Incumbents get re-elected because they vacuum up enough campaign contributions to buy influence via the mass (corporate) media. They have little incentive to respond to voters, so they don't.What they can do is look like they're doing something other than protecting the cartels and financiers that fund their permanent re-election campaigns. So they propose more regulations, most of which fail to achieve the desired results but succeed in burdening legitimate enterprises to the point of failure. Small enterprises simply fold up when the exhausted owners can no longer bear the burdens and corporations offshore everything that's over-regulated.The neoliberal ideology held that the many would benefit if regulations limiting enterprise were eased, and when done judiciously and with common sense, this has functioned as designed. But in the corrupt form of governance that dominates the global economy,regulatory capturemeans regulations protect cartels and insiders from competition. Insiders have rigged the system so they can punish competitors and let their cronies off the hook.The useful regulations protecting the many from the exploitation of the few are being buried by counter-productive 'do something' regulations andregulatory moatsthat protect cartels and insiders.GlobalizationGlobal trade has a long history, stretching back to the Bronze Age (1500 B.C.). Like every other market, it expands and contracts as conditions change. The emergence of China (and other nations) since the mid-1980s greatly expanded global trade and capital flows. This distributed new income and prosperity to hundreds of millions of people, and yet it also concentrated much of the newfound wealth in the hands of the few and left many behind.Nothing goes up forever, not even globalization. Those left behind are starting to wonder if the good of globalization outweighs the costs.DemographicsIf high-population-growth Africa is set aside, the world's working age populace is perched on the precipice of decline while the populace of retirees is exploding, not just in the developed world but in the developing world.Although many put their hopes on robots generating unlimited wealth that will support the elderly and free the working age populace from labor, the more likely prospect is an economy that cannot fulfill the promises made to retirees back when the worker-retiree ratio was 10-to-1 and not the present-day 2-to-1.Chris Hamilton has written three excellent explorations of demographics that cover the basics.

Recently, state media applauded parents in Shandong province for their fertility; there were more children born in the province last year than in any other. There have also been policy measures in the ether since last year aimed at encouraging people to have more children. This is a stark turnaround from over three decades of a heavy-handed one-child policy that began to be phased out only in 2015. With good reason. China is poised to face a problem a number of developed economies have been grappling with for years now: the fiscal and labour market implications of an ageing population. Can technology, seen as the harbinger of painful labour market disruption, ease the shift? Enter, the gig economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China's working age population has been declining since 2012 and is projected to shrink by almost a quarter by 2050. This is not a slope, it is a cliff edge. The government's about-face is unlikely to help much. The causal links between rising prosperity and declining fertility have been conclusively established. For a preview of what awaits China further down this path, look to Europe.</p><p>According to the European Union's (EU's) statistical office, Eurostat, the union's median age as on 1 January 2016 was 42.6 years, with an old-age dependency ratio that clocks in at a hefty 29.3%. This has two major consequences. First, it strains social safety nets and pension systems. It's no coincidence that the EU countries with among the highest old-age dependency ratios-Italy with 34.3% and Greece with 33.1%-faced some of the toughest social spending reforms in the EU to deal with the North Atlantic financial crisis. The second consequence is a drop in labour productivity, exacerbating the fiscal strain. Productivity tends to peak in the 40s with experience accumulation and decline thereafter as skills and knowledge become dated.</p><p>Last week, Google chief economist Hal Varian pushed the idea that technology could provide the solution to these problems caused by shrinking birth rates. Big tech is big on promises right now given its annus horribilis, but he has a point here. The Artificial Intelligence advances he was referring to are one aspect, but the gig economy is another.</p><p>It's supposed to be a young man's game. Perception, however, might not match fact: A quarter of Uber's drivers are over 50, for instance. Medical advances and quality of life improvements mean that the deterioration of physical and mental faculties that lowered the productivity of older workers is increasingly less of an issue. The financial crisis, on the other hand, boosted their incentive to keep working past traditional retirement age. Conventional labour markets and institutions have not yet caught up with the fact that a cliff-edge retirement is increasingly unviable. A gig economy that has evolved from low skill jobs to encompass a range of employment-including high skill services such as legal aid, finance and insurance where lack of experience with the latest technology is less of a handicap-is a different matter entirely. It offers both post-retirement flexibility and the ability to supplement and lighten the burden of strained social safety nets.</p><p>The first Europe-wide study of the gig economy carried out by the University of Hertfordshire, the Federation for European Progressive Studies, UNI Europa and Ipsos Mori, released last year, points to the potential. While there is considerable variance across countries, the number of gig economy workers in EU countries is generally substantial, going as high as 22% in Italy, with 17% of them over 55-again, not coincidentally, a country compelled to bite the bullet on pension reforms in recent years.</p><p>Admittedly, viability, in terms of remuneration, is currently somewhat muddled. In general, full-time gig work pays less than the offline labour market. But this obscures important distinctions. For one, in some markets, gig work actually pays more. In a Centre for European Studies report, The Impact Of The Collaborative Economy On The Labour Market, Willem Pieter De Groen and Ilaria Maselli find that in some European markets, payment for certain services sourced via online platforms is actually more than for similar offline jobs. Second, post-retirement gig work is intended to supplement savings or social benefits, not replace them. Third, EU countries are taking the lead in formalizing gig work and linking it to social benefits. This could scupper such jobs if it results in over-regulation-but if handled right, it could make gig work more viable.</p><p>Dealing with greying populations will require a host of other responses as well, from social spending reform to an evolution in investment models. And the gig economy's evolution will come with its own share of pain. But that is, in many ways, a walk in the park compared to the political difficulties of changing pension or healthcare models. Gig employment might not be able to defuse that bomb-but it can certainly slow down the timer.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

This is a 21st-century story, but it will ring bells with people old enough to remember the cold war: how people understand their own experience and events in the wider world is increasingly decided by the version of the internet they use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On one side sits the system used in China, which produces <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">vast amounts of personal data</url> and blurs into a huge apparatus of state surveillance and censorship. This model is centred on two online behemoths, whose dominance partly comes down to the fact that Chinese consumerism is all about paying via your smartphone, rather than an old-fashioned plastic card. There's the e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba, and Tencent, which owns WeChat, the platform used by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">more than 1 billion people</url> every day. It       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">does so many things</url> - payments, social networking, messaging, travel booking, gaming - that participating in society without it seems all but impossible.</p><p>On the other side of the modern digital divide is the version of the internet pioneered in the west and now spreading around the planet, which revolves around Google and Facebook. These giants also feast on a mountain of personal information, but present themselves as a contrasting embodiment of personal freedom and liberal values, even as they embed the social model now known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">surveillance capitalism</url>.</p><p>One of the central questions of our age is which model will become pre-eminent, not least among the half of humanity who are not yet online. With Donald Trump's trade war providing a crude kind of mood music, the battle so far is not quite as simple as Chinese platforms duking it out with their US counterparts: the tech clash has been more visible in tensions over nuts-and-bolts infrastructure, particularly when it comes to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">activities of the IT giant Huawei</url>.</p><p>But look at high levels of tech investment by China <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">in India and Africa</url>, the prospect of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">Alibaba butting heads with Amazon</url>, or the international competition between Uber and its Chinese equivalent Didi, and you get a flavour of the future - particularly when it comes to China's mastery of mobile payment systems, which leaves most western countries standing. Across the world, geopolitics is fast boiling down to whether China or the US is the most influential tech player.</p><p>Meanwhile, the dominance of life in the west by corporations based in the US is being contested as never before. The Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren says she wants Facebook, Google and Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">to be broken up</url>. The same sentiments are rising among more switched-on elements in Congress. As evidenced by the so-called right to be forgotten, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and such actions as the (EURO)1.5bn fine the European commission imposed last week on Google (for forcing customers to agree not to accept adverts from other search engines), the EU is much further ahead. If our current stereotype of legislators and regulators boils down to grey-haired men who barely understand how to switch their phones on, that is clearly changing fast.</p><p>The new cold war and the race to regulate are the contexts in which we have to understand everything that western big tech now does - something that applies particularly to the Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Ten years ago, he professed to believe in an ideal he called \"radical transparency\", and \"the concept that the world will be better if you share more\".</p><p>Now, panicked by his company's seemingly endless fall from grace, he says he is pursuing \"a privacy-based vision for social networking\". Logically, the two ideas cancel each other out, revealing something much more prosaic: the sense that he is desperately trying to escape the clutches of his potential regulators, so that Facebook remains at the core of the western internet, ready to be endlessly pushed into new global markets.</p><p>Just over two weeks ago <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">Zuckerberg put up a long post</url> that announced his intention to develop a \"privacy-focused communications platform [that] will become even more important than today's open platforms\", based on message encryption, and the idea - copied from Snapchat - of content deleting itself, so as not to come back to haunt the people who post it. But what actually matters is that he wants to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">combine the messaging services</url> offered by Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, which will surely make any attempt to break these entities up all the more difficult.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, old-style Facebook will carry on. Meanwhile, on their new platform, Zuckerberg and his colleagues are likely to still amass huge amounts of metadata (who we talk to and for how long, and where we are), while encryption takes the heat off their company's absurdly overburdened moderators: as and when its users foment unrest and abuse, Facebook's high-ups will be able to deny any agency, and stand well back. But most eye-watering of all is the sheer reach of Zuckerberg's new creation: his plan is to \"make it as secure as possible, and then build more ways for people to interact on top of that, including calls, video chats ... businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private services\".</p><p>This is precisely the WeChat model of an app that does just about everything, including handling everyday personal finance, thereby ensuring an endless avalanche of data. What that highlights is not just the scale of Facebook's undimmed ambitions and Zuckerberg's questionable new embrace of \"privacy\", but something that attracts surprisingly little attention: the sense that even as the eastern and western models of the internet compete for global influence, they are converging.</p><p>Perhaps we should not be that surprised. At the height of the cold war, for all their mutual animosity, it was fashionable to talk about the US and Soviet Union as increasingly similar societies, subject to what the social theorist <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/china-steps-up-internet-surveillance-by-recording-user-activities/\">Herbert Marcuse</url> called \"common requirements of industrialisation\", and both in thrall to bureaucracy and centralised planning. In the wake of the revolutions of 1989 the basic idea flipped, so that east and west were said to be heading into a shared future of liberal democracy and free markets, a vision also projected on to an increasingly prosperous China, until the arrival of President Xi Jinping heralded something much more problematic.</p><p>Now convergence is here again, but this time it is all about surveillance, behavioural nudging, and companies so huge that they intrude on every part of our lives. The danger is the world falling between two visions that are too close for comfort: on the one hand, surveillance and censorship perpetrated by companies in brazen cahoots with authoritarian states; on the other, all-seeing tech corporations whose ties to government remain shadowy and opaque, which is part of what Edward Snowden came forward to tell us.</p><p>Legislators, regulators, developers and entrepreneurs should take note: if 21st-century democracy and the most basic ideas of citizenship are to mean anything, the western internet ought not to be converging with China's, but pulling in the opposite direction.</p><p> John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52695711</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR4-DWD1-JCJY-G2Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1222\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Indeed, the fact that the internet has remained relatively global and open has enabled the growth of the digital economy. App stores on our phones, email accessible around the world, overnight shipping on our favorite goods, the sharing of news and medical research and stock information-they're all part of this global connectivity. Underneath it lie data, 1s and 0s that form everything from bank ledgers to social-media posts. Exchanges of data between organizations (companies, universities, governments, etc.) across borders are what contribute to companies offering services around the world in near real time, or to allied countries sharing law enforcement and intelligence information.</p><p><br/>At issue is how countries view data. Do companies own the information? Does an individual own it? Does a government have access to it? The problem is that governments across China, India, the European Union, Japan, and the United States have philosophical differences on how they view these issues. These are not merely technical problems, but deep divides that may not be possible to bridge. Add to this the fact that this conversation is taking place as the United States and China are locked in a rivalry focused on technology-and, by extension, data. Taken together, this means that the rules for who controls data-and therefore harnesses their value-are part of a bigger geopolitical competition that will shape the 21st century.<br/>Read: [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/zte-huawei-china-trump-trade-cyber/563033/?utm_source=feed\">Beijing wants to rewrite the rules of the internet</url>]<br/>The Internet of Things and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/what-is-5g/588511/?utm_source=feed\">5G communications</url> will create an exponential increase in data, but from a geopolitical perspective, the greatest strategic impact arguably lies with machine-learning and artificial-intelligence (AI) systems. That's because researchers need data to train AI systems, and AI development has the capacity to improve everything from transportation safety to disease diagnostics to lethal-weapon accuracy.<br/>It's not just the volume of data that's important. In part, it's also the kind of data and where they originate; data on, say, Spanish speech patterns will not make a system robust at identifying Mandarin characters. This is where data governance comes into play.<br/>In a world increasingly underpinned and powered by AI, those looking to develop globally competitive AI systems-algorithms that will be precise and accurate in many parts of the world, across many demographics-will need access to data on those different demographics, from those different regions. The rules that governments put into place regarding such access will therefore influence AI competition, because not getting these data could limit how well tailored products are to different people. These rules will also determine the access that states have to data when it comes to law enforcement and domestic surveillance, making data an increasingly important element of national security as well as economic growth.<br/>It is no surprise, then, that governments are clashing over setting the rules for who has access to certain kinds of data. Two countries-India and China-and their approach to data have particular significance, because together they account for more than one-third of humanity.<br/>Indian draft rules would       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/resources/the-localisation-gambit.pdf\">require</url> companies that operate in the country or collect data on Indian citizens to process certain kinds of personal data on servers in India-even if the companies aren't based in the country. Defenders of this approach see it as a pushback against so-called       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/resources/the-localisation-gambit.pdf\">data colonialism</url>. Critics, however, are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/three-problems-indias-draft-data-protection-bill\">concerned</url> that this approach would give the Indian government unchecked power to surveil its own citizens.

U.S., European, and Japanese policy makers and industry groups have lobbied Beijing for years to change these provisions, because they could mean steep costs for foreign companies that would be required to build local data centers to store and analyze all company data.

As a result, EU officials       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/european-union-eyes-privacy-clampdown-on-china-surveillance-huawei/\">have indicated</url> that China may never be eligible for a legal arrangement under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) called an \"adequacy agreement,\" which would allow for data exchange with the EU. (The GDPR, which went into effect last year, set up strict privacy rules for those handling EU citizens' data.) Chinese companies may find that it's impossible to comply with GDPR and China's cybersecurity law at once. The irony is that those who drafted China's data-privacy rules       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-emerging-data-privacy-system-and-gdpr\">looked to GDPR as a model</url>. But the version of GDPR they created for China's political system-where the government has expansive surveillance authorities-makes it hard to imagine how the two systems could ever be reconciled.<br/>Read: [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/europes-gdpr-elevated-privacy-over-press-freedom/590845/%20%20Even%20the?utm_source=feed\">Online-privacy laws come with a downside</url>]<br/>The Indian government has concerns about Chinese firms misusing Indian data, despite some similarities in how both countries store data locally. For example, Indian military personnel aren't allowed to install WeChat, the Chinese social-messaging app, on their phones, but can use Facebook's WhatsApp. The historically tense relations between the two countries are likely driving India's caution.<br/>Trying to find consensus on global data governance may look like an elaborate game of Twister. And some of these divides at hand may simply be insurmountable-perhaps splintering the data economy as we know it.<br/>Against this backdrop, Abe's government has floated \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2019/03/05/commentary/japan-commentary/global-battle-big-data/#.XQwyL9NKjq0\">data free flow with trust</url>.\" We may learn more from Abe at the G20 meeting, but one interpretation is that if the United States, Japan, and the EU perceive that Chinese access to their citizens' data presents some degree of risk, they could build agreements to share data only with one another (or even a subset of that group), but restrict access for Chinese firms. This could make it much more difficult for Chinese internet platforms to develop AI platforms for places and demographics outside Chinese borders by cutting off access to necessary data. But such an arrangement would likely meet resistance in the U.S. if it looks too similar to GDPR in restricting U.S. companies.<br/>The United States, for its part, is already pushing for new restrictions that would prevent Chinese companies and the government from getting access to sensitive data on U.S. citizens. For example, in March, the U.S. government       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-grindr-m-a-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-pushes-chinese-owner-of-grindr-to-divest-the-dating-app-sources-idUSKCN1R809L\">told</url> a Chinese gaming company called Beijing Kunlun Tech that it would need to sell Grindr, the U.S. gay dating app, because of the potential for blackmail if the app's data fell into the hands of Chinese intelligence.<br/>Read: [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/how-bad-is-facebooks-new-china-problem/562172/?utm_source=feed\">How bad is Facebook's new China problem?</url>]<br/>Privacy legislation being debated in the United States also plays a role in brewing geopolitical competition. India, Europe, and other places will increasingly use data to constrain market access for foreign-incorporated tech firms-for instance, requiring them to store citizens' data within the country, or to not collect it at all-if the U.S. does nothing to dispel the notion that Big Tech cannot be trusted to handle individuals' data in ways that are not exploitative. That means the United States will need to place privacy checks on companies such as Google and Facebook if these companies are to continue to have global reach and access to data. Creating policy that understands there is not necessarily a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/data-not-new-oil-kai-fu-lee-china-artificial-intelligence.html\">trade-off between privacy and innovation</url> will go a long way toward restoring trust in U.S. Big Tech at home and around the world while also helping fuel advances in AI. Rather than a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/14/the-data-arms-race-is-no-excuse-for-abandoning-privacy/\">race to the bottom</url> when it comes to privacy, this may be the better way to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Big-Nine-Thinking-Machines-Humanity/dp/1541773756\">compete</url> against Chinese internet companies for AI leadership.<br/>The stakes are therefore quite high in the competition to set the rules for global data governance. Abe's ambition to find consensus on these issues may seem ludicrous, but starting a conversation that gets at the conflicting perspectives on data at the center of geopolitics could be among his most important legacies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-g20data592606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF6-GXG1-DYY9-J32C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

The Allen &amp; Overy partner traces his fascination with all things tech back to his childhood. A time long before the ubiquitous tech we now enjoy, he recalls how any new technology which appeared at home \u2014 from Psions, to pagers to PCs \u2014 sparked his curiosity.    Such curiosity has served Samengo-Turner well. Since joining the magic circle firm in 2007, the corporate and M&amp;A lawyer has ridden high on the waves of the tech boom, born out of the global financial crisis well over a decade ago.    A mixture of Allen &amp; Overy\u2019s reputation and international reach \u2014 the firm boasts over 40 offices in 29 countries \u2014 has provided Samengo-Turner access to cross-border deals for global tech giants, including Facebook, HP, eBay and PayPal. \u201cWe get some of the best deals in the market,\u201d he says. \u201cClients trust us with some of the most important things they do.\u201d     Allen &amp; Overy UK Graduate Recruitment     But it was a year-long secondment in Silicon Valley during 2015 that really deepened Samengo-Turner\u2019s understanding of the sector. Joining Fenwick &amp; West, one of America\u2019s leading technology firms, the-then senior associate recalls the sense of awe he felt the moment he landed in California.    \u201cYou get off the plane and you suddenly realise that you really are in the hub where all of these big companies, businesses that you interact with every day and who often have a couple of square centimetres footprint on your phone, are based,\u201d he reflects.    At the time, Silicon Valley was experiencing a profound and exciting period of expansion. \u201cThere was a huge buzz about the place \u2014 everyone you talked to was talking about the latest start-up or the latest product release\u201d, recalls Samengo-Turner, who studied modern history at the University of Oxford.    Facebook, having bought Instagram just three years earlier, was beginning to monetise the photo-sharing platform through targeted advertisements. Outside you could often see Google\u2019s prototype self-driving cars trundling around Mountain View, California \u2014 home to the internet giant\u2019s corporate HQ, Googleplex. Further along the west coast, Los Angeles-based Netflix debuted its first feature film, presenting an existential threat to the traditional movie-making business.    Also striking that year was investment bank Goldman Sachs\u2019 decision to hold their annual shareholders meeting in San Francisco for the first time \u2014 sending a clear message to Wall Street that serious money was to be made in tech. \u201cThere was a realisation that Silicon Valley was now really powerful not just in terms of the products and technology it developed but in the wider marketplace too,\u201d says Samengo-Turner.    Five years and one global pandemic later, the tech industry continues to grow at a seemingly unstoppable rate, with the largest players pulling in trillion-dollar valuations. Meanwhile, with nations under lockdown, companies like online retailing behemoth Amazon and streaming service Netflix have thrived during the coronavirus crisis. At the same time, Zoom and other video-conferencing platforms quickly became integral to the great working from home experiment.   Applications for Allen &amp; Overy's Winter Vacation Scheme close on Sunday 18 October 2020   Despite concerns that such unprecedented growth could see a repeat of the 2000 dot-com crash, Samengo-Turner doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019re in a similar tech bubble. \u201cThe large established tech companies have a significant balance sheet strength and real heft to them. The idea that Amazon\u2019s success constitutes a bubble, for example, just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he says.    As the tech sector continues to expand, Allen &amp; Overy has evolved to meet the changing demands of clients. \u201cThese clients have often grown out of nothing in the space of two to three years and suddenly are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. A lot of CEOs I advise are younger than me! It\u2019s an important shift for us \u2014 so we have retooled and reformed our products to work for them,\u201d says Samengo-Turner.    He points to Allen &amp; Overy\u2019s 2017 launch of Fuse , its London-based innovation hub which provides a place for its lawyers, clients and start-ups to develop tech-based solutions to legal, regulatory and deal-related problems. The firm\u2019s \u2018lawtech training contract\u2019 also highlights the importance of tech-fluency among the next generation of lawyers.    Evolving can sometimes be as simple as relaxing your dress code. \u201cI have some clients who actually say to me before I start working for them, \u2018I don\u2019t want any of your lawyers coming round in suits. We find it off-putting to have people wearing corporate wear,\u2019\u201d he adds.    But there are challenges ahead which lawyers must also adapt to. Mounting concerns around data privacy and anti-competitive behaviour within the sector, as well as calls for governments to break up Big Tech, have led to increased market regulation. Meanwhile, the ongoing geopolitical battle over TikTok, a Chinese-owned app known for its viral lip-syncing videos, reflects the difficulty with regulating tech companies that don\u2019t necessarily operate within borders.    As tech companies explore new territory through their products and services, they must also establish under what rules their offering is governed. From the gig economy\u2019s self-employment debate to regulating artificial intelligence \u2014 lawyers must keep up with developments around tech and frame advice accordingly, says Samengo-Turner.    What the video-conferencing revolution means for Silicon Valley is also unclear. Much of the city\u2019s allure stems from the key institutionalised ingredients essential for a vibrant tech scene: a young population of tech engineers, good universities in the local area and, importantly, plenty of investment capital. But amid San Francisco\u2019s rising living costs and the call among Big Tech employees for permanent remote-working following COVID-19, innovation is unlikely to remain exclusive to the Californian tech centre. \u201cThe idea that you have to be in Silicon Valley in order to be successful just isn\u2019t true anymore,\u201d says Samengo-Turner.    The same question applies to the legal profession which, despite being typically risk averse, remarkably embraced agile working during the pandemic.    As someone who usually splits their time between London and San Francisco, Samengo-Turner is no stranger to remote-working. In fact, it\u2019s Allen &amp; Overy\u2019s existing systems, designed to facilitate interaction between its geographically dispersed lawyers, that enabled a \u201cremarkably smooth\u201d transition to an entirely virtual approach during the lockdown.    As lawyers gradually return to their City offices , Samengo-Turner hopes a balanced approach eventually becomes the norm: upholding the advantages of being together in an office environment while protecting the flexibility and perks of working from home.    And while it may be possible to advise international clients from your bedroom, Samengo-Turner suspects that eventually we\u2019ll respond to \u201ca very human urge to meet in-person, to break bread together, and to celebrate triumphs and commiserate when set backs occur\u201d. Perhaps an upside from the lockdown, he continues, will be that when lawyers travel across the globe to secure a deal, negotiate a contract or meet with clients to strategise, they will now better appreciate the \u201cgenuine joy\u201d in being able to do so.    William Samengo-Turner will be speaking alongside other Allen &amp; Overy lawyers at \u2018Re-imagining global law firms in the age of remote-working\u2019 , a virtual student event taking place tomorrow (Tuesday 15 September).

Without more qualified professionals, everyone's sensitive information could fall vulnerable to corporate ignorance, mismanagement and whim.While companies like IBM, AT...Microsoft and Pfizer have had chief privacy officers for years, others \u2014 like Facebook and Uber \u2014 have hired them more recently after learning the pitfalls of data problems the hard way. There's a lot of demand. </p><p>\"Companies around the globe are having trouble finding people,\" Dominique Shelton Leipzig, a privacy specialist at the law firm Perkins Coie, tells Axios. \"I just got a note from somebody in Saudi Arabia who was looking for people in this area.\"What's important, she added, \"is to realize that every company is a data company \u2014it's not just big tech.' The big picture: The tests that are considered the global gold standard to be certified for privacy jobs are written by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), based in Portsmouth, N.H. The tests vary by geography. Some cover the requirements of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR[1]), which took effect last year, or the California Consumer Privacy Act[2], which kicks in Jan. 1. Interest in taking the tests has risen 'supersonically,' Douglas Forman, who oversees the IAPP's certification exams, tells Axios, and 2018 was 'our biggest year for certification ever.' Even so, a lot of Fortune 500 companies 'don't have strong teams around data privacy,' Anneka Gupta, president and head of products and platforms at LiveRamp, a data management company, tells Axios. On LinkedIn, the number of jobs postings with the title 'chief privacy officer,' 'privacy officer' or 'data protection officer' increased 77% from 2016-2019, according to an analysis that LinkedIn conducted for Axios.More than 20,000 people globally have passed the IAPP's certification exams[3] \u2014 but that's not enough to meet the demand.One in three Americans has been exposed to a data compromise, and 47% feel they have \"little to no control of their personal data,\" according to a Deloitte survey[4]. 'You can't just throw 500 bodies at the problem,' Kabir Barday, CEO of OneTrust, which helps companies comply with privacy laws, tells Axios.The privacy movement is galvanizing: Alastair Mactaggart \u2014 the California businessman who was the driving force behind the state's new privacy law \u2014 is redoubling[5] his efforts, aiming to strengthen the law through a 2020 ballot initiative. \"This is a new human right,\" Mactaggart \u2014 the founder of Californians for Consumer Privacy[6] \u2014 tells Axios. In enforcement actions, the Federal Trade Commission has been instructing companies to hire chief privacy officers. Examples include Facebook, which named a CPO [7]in July after its $5 billion settlement, and Uber[8].Between the lines: More law schools are introducing privacy as a course of study \u2014 and the American Bar Association recently recognized it as a dedicated specialty[9] \u2014 but the privacy profession is very much an evolving discipline. It's helpful to have a legal background, an understanding of computer architecture (to know where myriad consumer databases could be housed), and a liberal arts sensibility \u2014 to \"get\" why privacy matters so much to consumers.About 50% of data privacy professionals are women, in contrast to the male-dominated tech world. Then and now: Kalinda Raina, head of global privacy at LinkedIn, said that when she began her career in privacy law two decades ago, a senior lawyer \"told me I was wasting my time.\" \"When I would first go to IAPP events, there were maybe 200 people, and the excitement was that there were other people thinking about the issue\" of consumer privacy. Today she has a staff of 11 people, who regularly train colleagues across LinkedIn and help them prepare for IAPP certification exams. \"One of the things you need is an ethical compass,\" Raina told Axios.The bottom line: The privacy field is still in its early days, and laws and best practices are changing at warp speed. 'Every day is different,' says Forman of the IAPP. On the plus side: 'You feel like you're doing something good by helping companies protect something that's actually important.' Go deeper: The future of privacy starts in California[10] [ 1]: <url

All over the world, citizens, bureaucrats and politicians are now pushing back against that power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most often, the backlash is directed at America's tech giants, such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., and how their ubiquity affects individuals and businesses. But resistance to Big Tech also includes China curbing the power of its own technology companies, and India rejecting foreign monopolists in favor of homegrown players.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The largest tech businesses reach more people than any other companies have in history, and by many metrics they have also grown at unprecedented speeds. The companies themselves argue tech is bringing great benefits to people and improving their lives, yet when they enter industries, they consolidate power and make competitors miserable in ways not seen since the Gilded Age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As people around the world become more familiar with the internet, their views tend to change from enthusiasm to caution. A survey by the Centre for International Governance Innovation reveal that in Kenya, for example, people are singularly positive about the impact of tech, whereas in North America and Europe, people are more concerned about Big Tech's overreach.</p><p>\"Familiarity breeds contempt,\" says Fen Hampson, director of global security and politics at CIGI, who conducted the survey.</p><p>As the backlash plays out, it has the potential to subdivide the internet, forcing the biggest players to create separate products and procedures for different regions. The results-following a costly, complicated and protracted transition-will be better for consumers in some cases, and significantly worse in others. Europe and the U.S. The global tech backlash starts in the West, where countries have been feeling the results of Big Tech's growing power the longest.</p><p>In the European Union, efforts to rein in firms that abuse their monopoly power have resulted in a record $5 billion fine against Google. Amazon might be next, as the EU Competition Commission probes whether the giant unfairly uses data from retailers that sell on its platform.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sweeping General Data Protection Regulation is having a profound effect on the advertising and data-gathering ecosystem there. The law has yet to be tested in court, but under these regulations, Facebook could face a record $1.63 billion fine for its recently disclosed personal-data breach.</p><p>In the U.S., creating an \"internet bill of rights\" has become a signature issue of a handful of congressional Democrats. Meanwhile, some of their Republican colleagues are beginning to join in, threatening to rein in Big Tech in the wake of recent scandals.</p><p>It's not yet clear whether legislation will ever reach the president's desk, but the companies see the writing on the wall. California has already passed a sweeping data-privacy law, set to go into effect in 2020. In a Senate hearing in September, executives from Alphabet and Amazon said they agree on the need for privacy regulation; Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberghas said the same. Lobbying groups supported by both companies just proposed their own set of privacy regulations. China and the 'Two Internets' The tech backlash looks different in China, where the attitude to privacy is different and foreign tech firms face prohibitive hurdles. Just as a few American companies gained dominance over the past decade, so have a handful of Chinese firms, including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com. Once content to champion these companies as long as they cooperated with censorship decrees, the Chinese government is now taking a more heavy-handed role in their everyday business. For example, it's forcing Alibaba's affiliated payment company, Ant Financial, to use the government's credit-scoring system instead of its own.</p><p>The worst-case scenario in China, says Paul Triolo, a technology analyst at the Eurasia Group think tank, is if Beijing were to nationalize some of its tech giants. If a U.S.-China trade war deepens and China's leaders feel they need to turn tech companies into instruments of the state, it's possible, he says.</p><p>China's so-called Great Firewall has effectively created two internets. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said recently he thinks that divide will only deepen.</p><p>Because they can't move freely into China, U.S. companies must make their businesses work uniformly anywhere else they can, says Paul Twomey, former CEO of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which manages the world-wide internet domain-name system.</p><p>Some tech giants are already doing this. Microsoft Corp. said it will apply GDPR rules across all its services throughout the world. Apple Inc. has for years positioned itself as the data-protection and privacy company, with CEO Tim Cook this week calling for a U.S. privacy law in line with Europe's.</p><p>More data-dependent companies aren't so eager. Google is fighting efforts to export those rules to other countries. Google's official wishlist on \"responsible\" data-protection regulation includes a \"flexible\" definition of personal data and no restrictions on the geographical location of data storage.</p><p>Facebook has tried to make an end run around EU rules by giving users a stark choice: give up some rights or delete their accounts. Facebook didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Ultimately, that's counterproductive, says Mr. Twomey, who after stepping down as Icann CEO co-founded data-security firm Stash. In part, this is because data-protection laws also apply to other businesses, such as banks, which are likely to push for globally harmonized regulations. India and the Rest of the World To see where the global tech backlash is going next, pay attention to India, says Mr. Twomey. When Facebook tried in 2016 to let users browse Facebook and some other services without paying for mobile data, a coalition of activists in India, and eventually India's government itself, rallied together to ban the program. What Facebook saw as beneficence, Indians saw as neocolonialism.</p><p>In the biggest countries, that kind of pushback could benefit domestic actors-think of China's enormous tech industry or India's burgeoning e-commerce giant Flipkart. In such a world, the internet remains mostly interconnected but, as with automobile manufacturers, a handful of companies, many domestic, dominate each market, says Mr. Twomey.</p><p>Such reactions augur a future in which some countries-too small to match the services of American and Chinese tech giants-instead negotiate with them however they can. At times, the leverage to do so only comes after tragedy strikes.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, Facebook failed to heed warnings from the government and activists about its platforms serving to incite violence against the country's Muslim minority. After the country shut off access to Facebook services, the company pledged to start taking down problematic content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2018102548323411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK1-0H01-JDH1-C3XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1169\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Free Daily News Group Inc.

Beto O\u2019Rourke shed his nice-guy approach in Tuesday night\u2019s Senate debate as Sen. Ted Cruz kept up the pressure to paint him as far too liberal for Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The incumbent tarred him with angry Democratic \u201cmobs\u201d seen during the recent Supreme Court confirmation fight and warned of \u201cutter chaos\u201d if O\u2019Rourke has his way and President Donald Trump is impeached.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWashington would be consumed by partisan investigations. That\u2019s not civility,\u201d he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">O\u2019Rourke went on the attack early, in a way he hadn\u2019t done in the first debate and even more directly than he has on the stump in recent days \u2014 calling Cruz a liar, ineffective and self-serving.</p><p>\u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz,\u201d he said at one point. When Cruz asserted that he backs a $10 per barrel tax on oil, O\u2019Rourke bristled and shot back, \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest. It\u2019s why the president called him \u2018Lying Ted\u2019 and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck, because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Cruz quipped that \u201cit\u2019s clear that Congressman\u2019s O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters\u201d must have advised him to go on the attack.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke has long boasted that he has no strategists or pollsters. But Democrats have prodded him to take a more aggressive tack with Cruz, a seasoned and unyielding debater.</p><p>Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said afterward that O\u2019Rourke is flailing because he\u2019s fallen behind.</p><p>\u201cWhen an unconventional candidate becomes conventional, that\u2019s typically when they get split like a cantaloupe, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole campaign, Beto O\u2019Rourke has been making a liberal bed for himself, and tonight he tucked himself in.\u201d</p><p>Said Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa: \u201cAfter spending so much time in Iowa, it\u2019s no surprise that Cruz is painfully out of touch with Texas voters. ... He doubled down on more of his lies and divisive tactics. Texans know Ted Cruz, and they just don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>The sharp retorts bordered at times on caustic. For O\u2019Rourke, that risked undermining the post-partisan, open-minded brand he\u2019s sought to project for 18 months even as he promoted unabashedly progressive policies.</p><p>But in recent days, with Cruz gaining ground and pummeling him on TV with attack ads, O\u2019Rourke has shifted to a more pugilistic stance.</p><p>He tarred Cruz for his alliance with Trump \u2014 and his use of a now-defunct data mining firm that wrongfully used the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that Ted Cruz invested more than $5 million in Cambridge Analytica,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. As for Trump, he said, \u201cThe Russian government sought to undermine our democracy\u201d and foreign adversaries have sought to manipulate public opinion in the United States, and \u201cour junior senator\u201d\u2014 a phrase he invoked over and over \u2014 \u201cwill not stand up to President Trump\u201d despite Trump being an apologist for Vladimir Putin.</p><p>\u201cThis is beyond party politics,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cruz complained about political bias by \u201cbig tech\u201d companies, such as Facebook, but let slide the allegation about Cambridge Analytica. He has previously denied knowing the firm acted unethically during his campaign\u2019s affiliation in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>When the conversation turned to trade, Cruz insisted that \u201cI\u2019m against tariffs. I\u2019m against a trade war. I\u2019ve made the case repeatedly to President Trump\u201d that \u201cif we\u2019re erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Rourke, by contrast, is the only Senate nominee in the country who supports impeachment.</p><p>\u201cThat is extreme,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cYou want to talk about a shutdown? With Congressman O\u2019Rourke leading the way \u2014 two years of a partisan witch hunt and a circus\u201d that brings Washington to a halt.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke shot back.</p><p>\u201cReally interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the Senate,\u201d he said.</p><p>As for the boast that Cruz has Trump\u2019s ear, O\u2019Rourke argued that it hasn\u2019t done much good, given that the president went ahead with tariffs that hurt farmers and manufacturers.</p><p>\u201cYou are all talk and no action,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhen have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without any allies? ... We are going it alone with China, and it is not working.\u201d</p><p>On abortion, Cruz said O\u2019Rourke wants \u201ctaxpayer funding for abortions, late term, even for illegal aliens.\u201d Cruz added, \u201cHe\u2019s voted for that \u2014 an extreme position. Fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with that.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Rourke responded by noting the Supreme Court has a new conservative majority that he said threatens women, minorities and gays.</p><p>Cruz\u2019s closing argument: \u201cAre you better off today than you were two years ago? Is Texas?\u201d And, co-opting the Democrat\u2019s critique of him, he added, \u201cElections are about who we are. Do we choose fear, or do we choose hope?\u201d</p><p>Trump will headline a rally Monday night in Houston\u2019s NRG Arena in an effort to shore up support for Cruz.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke has tweaked the senator for failing to stand up to the president \u2014 especially given Trump\u2019s abuse of Cruz during the 2016 GOP primaries. But Trump voters are Cruz voters and whatever enthusiasm the president can add can only help. And Cruz has already made peace with that phase of their relationship, setting aside the rancor to deliver on mutual goals such as cutting taxes and stocking the courts with conservative judges.</p><p>No more debates are scheduled, so this was probably the last face-to-face moment before Election Day, three weeks away.</p><p>The first debate, in Dallas on Sept. 21, exposed sharp distinctions over immigration, border security, police brutality, gun violence and the best way to deal with the president. Cruz called O\u2019Rourke a socialist. The challenger depicted him as disturbingly cozy with an out-of-control president.</p><p>The San Antonio encounter covered some of the same ground.</p><p>Cruz pushed O\u2019Rourke for opposing a border wall as envisioned by Trump, and trying to shift the conversation over border security into one about trade.</p><p>\u201cEl Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world\u201d with 3,000 murders last year alone. \u201cThere\u2019s a wall there,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>Both insisted the other is out of touch with Texas. And to some degree, each had a point. Texas, reliably Republican in federal and state elections for decades, has seen rapid population growth in recent years that is transforming the landscape.</p><p>The huge crowds turning out for O\u2019Rourke reflect the pent-up aspirations of Democrats who have gone a generation without seeing such a viable statewide candidate. The enthusiasm among Cruz supporters is also intense, as conservatives dig in, wary of a shift in political control and cultural norms.</p><p>The stakes were high for both sides in Tuesday night\u2019s debate, at KENS-TV in San Antonio.</p><p>Cruz seems to hold a solid single-digit lead \u2014 8 or 9 percentage points in the most recent polls. But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fundraising has left Cruz in the dust, and with $62 million \u2014 most from small dollar donors \u2014 he now holds the record for any Senate candidate in history.</p><p>On abortion, Cruz sought to portray O\u2019Rourke as taking \u201can extreme position,\u201d favoring Medicaid coverage of abortions, late-term abortions and even taxpayer-funded abortions \u201cfor illegal aliens.\u201d</p><p>But Cruz wouldn\u2019t answer a question about what Texas abortion law should be if the Supreme Court overturns its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that struck down state prohibitions on the procedure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>\u201cThe people of Texas and especially the Hispanic community, we don\u2019t want to see taxpayer-funded \u2014 Medicaid funding abortions and late-term abortions. That\u2019s extreme,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s striking that Congressman O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t dispute his extreme record on abortions, ... supporting taxpayer funding for abortions, late term, even for illegal aliens,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s voted for that. That is an extreme position. Fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with that.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Rourke, ignoring the incumbent\u2019s swipe, said the recent elevation of Brett Kavanaugh as a justice on the Supreme Court raises the stakes on voting rights, civil rights for gays and women\u2019s reproductive freedom.</p><p>\u201cI will only vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice who believes in a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her own body,\u201d he said.</p><p>On climate change, Cruz maintained skepticism that scientific findings warrant government intervention in the economy, while O\u2019Rourke cast the GOP senator as heedless of the welfare of future generations.</p><p>\u201cOf course, the climate is changing,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe climate has been changing from the dawn of time.\u201d</p><p>It will continue to do so, but that\u2019s no reason to let liberals seize command of the economy, he said.</p><p>He hammered O\u2019Rourke for voting against a nonbinding resolution that would have put a $10 a barrel oil tax off limits in a discussion of how to pay for infrastructure improvements.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke said wind and solar energy generate more jobs than any other part of the economy. Even Texans who work for fracking operations want predictable regulation, and are concerned about climate change, he said.</p><p>Cruz denied he\u2019s been hypocritical to rail about deficits and then support Trump\u2019s tax cut bill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing record growth\u201d of the economy, he said. A Congressional Budget Office prediction the tax cuts would add more than $1 trillion to the national debt \u201cis wrong,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spurred the economy,\u201d Cruz said, citing tax cuts pushed by former Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Only term limits for members of Congress and other structural changes will bring down overspending, he said.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke noted only he has started a business and met a payroll \u2014 not Cruz, who has been a government employee for most of his career. Tax cuts for corporations were indefensible \u201cin a country that is riven with income inequality last seen in the Gilded Age,\u201d the congressman said.</p><p>When O\u2019Rourke accused Cruz of voting for tax cuts and then harvesting political action committee donations, Cruz struck back.

Beto O\u2019Rourke shed his nice-guy approach in Tuesday night\u2019s Senate debate as Sen. Ted Cruz kept up the pressure to paint him as far too liberal for Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The incumbent tarred him with angry Democratic \u201cmobs\u201d seen during the recent Supreme Court confirmation fight and warned of \u201cutter chaos\u201d if O\u2019Rourke has his way and President Donald Trump is impeached.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWashington would be consumed by partisan investigations. That\u2019s not civility,\u201d he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">O\u2019Rourke went on the attack early, in a way he hadn\u2019t done in the first debate and even more directly than he has on the stump in recent days \u2014 calling Cruz a liar, ineffective and self-serving.</p><p>\u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz,\u201d he said at one point. When Cruz asserted that he backs a $10 per barrel tax on oil, O\u2019Rourke bristled and shot back, \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest. It\u2019s why the president called him \u2018Lying Ted\u2019 and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck, because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Cruz quipped that \u201cit\u2019s clear that Congressman\u2019s O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters\u201d must have advised him to go on the attack.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke has long boasted that he has no strategists or pollsters. But Democrats have prodded him to take a more aggressive tack with Cruz, a seasoned and unyielding debater.</p><p>Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said afterward that O\u2019Rourke is flailing because he\u2019s fallen behind.</p><p>\u201cWhen an unconventional candidate becomes conventional, that\u2019s typically when they get split like a cantaloupe, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole campaign, Beto O\u2019Rourke has been making a liberal bed for himself, and tonight he tucked himself in.\u201d</p><p>The sharp retorts bordered at times on caustic. For O\u2019Rourke, that risked undermining the post-partisan, open-minded brand he\u2019s sought to project for 18 months even as he promoted unabashedly progressive policies.</p><p>But in recent days, with Cruz gaining ground and pummeling him on TV with attack ads, O\u2019Rourke has shifted to a more pugilistic stance.</p><p>He tarred Cruz for his alliance with Trump \u2014 and his use of a now-defunct data mining firm that wrongfully used the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that Ted Cruz invested more than $5 million in Cambridge Analytica,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. As for Trump, he said, \u201cThe Russian government sought to undermine our democracy\u201d and foreign adversaries have sought to manipulate public opinion in the United States, and \u201cour junior senator\u201d\u2014 a phrase he invoked over and over \u2014 \u201cwill not stand up to President Trump\u201d despite Trump being an apologist for Vladimir Putin.</p><p>\u201cThis is beyond party politics,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cruz complained about political bias by \u201cbig tech\u201d companies, such as Facebook, but let slide the allegation about Cambridge Analytica. He has previously denied knowing the firm acted unethically during his campaign\u2019s affiliation in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>When the conversation turned to trade, Cruz insisted that \u201cI\u2019m against tariffs. I\u2019m against a trade war. I\u2019ve made the case repeatedly to President Trump\u201d that \u201cif we\u2019re erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Rourke, by contrast, is the only Senate nominee in the country who supports impeachment.</p><p>\u201cThat is extreme,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cYou want to talk about a shutdown? With Congressman O\u2019Rourke leading the way \u2014 two years of a partisan witch hunt and a circus\u201d that brings Washington to a halt.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke shot back.</p><p>\u201cReally interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the Senate,\u201d he said, a comment that elicited some giggles in the small studio audience.</p><p>As for the boast that Cruz has Trump\u2019s ear, O\u2019Rourke argued that it hasn\u2019t done much good, given that the president went ahead with tariffs that hurt Texas farmers and manufacturers.</p><p>\u201cYou are all talk and no action,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhen have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without any allies? ... We are going it alone with China, and it is not working.\u201d</p><p>On abortion, Cruz said O\u2019Rourke wants \u201ctaxpayer funding for abortions, late term, even for illegal aliens.\u201d</p><p>Cruz added, \u201cHe\u2019s voted for that \u2014 an extreme position. Fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with that.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Rourke responded by noting the Supreme Court has a new conservative majority that he said threatens women, minorities and gays.</p><p>\u201cI will only vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice who believes in a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her own body,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cruz\u2019s closing argument: \u201cAre you better off today than you were two years ago? Is Texas?\u201d And, co-opting the Democrat\u2019s critique of him, he added, \u201cElections are about who we are. Do we choose fear, or do we choose hope?\u201d</p><p>Trump will headline a rally Monday night in Houston\u2019s NRG Arena in an effort to shore up support for Cruz.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke has tweaked the senator for failing to stand up to the president \u2014 especially given Trump\u2019s abuse of Cruz during the 2016 GOP primaries.</p><p>But Trump voters are Cruz voters and whatever enthusiasm the president can add can only help. And Cruz has already made peace with that phase of their relationship, setting aside the rancor to deliver on mutual goals such as cutting taxes and stocking the courts with conservative judges.</p><p>No more debates are scheduled, so this was probably the last face-to-face moment before Election Day, three weeks away.</p><p>The first debate, in Dallas on Sept. 21, exposed sharp distinctions over immigration, border security, police brutality, gun violence and the best way to deal with the president. Cruz called O\u2019Rourke a socialist. The challenger depicted him as disturbingly cozy with an out-of-control president.</p><p>The San Antonio encounter covered some of the same ground.</p><p>Cruz pushed O\u2019Rourke for opposing a border wall as envisioned by Trump, and trying to shift the conversation over border security into one about trade.</p><p>\u201cEl Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world\u201d with 3,000 murders last year alone. \u201cThere\u2019s a wall there,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>Both insisted the other is out of touch with Texas. And to some degree, each had a point. Texas, reliably Republican in federal and state elections for decades, has seen rapid population growth in recent years that is transforming the landscape.</p><p>The huge crowds turning out for O\u2019Rourke reflect the pent-up aspirations of Democrats who have gone a generation without seeing such a viable statewide candidate. The enthusiasm among Cruz supporters is also intense, as conservatives dig in, wary of a shift in political control and cultural norms.</p><p>The stakes were high for both sides in Tuesday night\u2019s debate, at KENS-TV in San Antonio.</p><p>Cruz seems to hold a solid single-digit lead \u2014 8 or 9 percentage points in the most recent polls.</p><p>But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fundraising has left Cruz in the dust, and with $62 million \u2014 most from small dollar donors \u2014 he now holds the record for any Senate candidate in history. By one key measure, he\u2019s better positioned for the final push: He still had $22.9 million in the bank as of Oct. 1, more than twice Cruz\u2019s stash.</p><p>On abortion, Cruz sought to portray O\u2019Rourke as taking \u201can extreme position,\u201d favoring Medicaid coverage of abortions, late-term abortions and even taxpayer-funded abortions \u201cfor illegal aliens.\u201d</p><p>But Cruz wouldn\u2019t answer a question about what Texas abortion law should be if the Supreme Court overturns its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that struck down state prohibitions on the procedure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>\u201cThe people of Texas and especially the Hispanic community, we don\u2019t want to see taxpayer-funded \u2014 Medicaid funding abortions and late-term abortions. That\u2019s extreme,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s striking that congressman O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t dispute his extreme record on abortions, ... supporting taxpayer funding for abortions, late term, even for illegal aliens,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s voted for that. That is an extreme position. Fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with that.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019Rourke, ignoring the incumbent\u2019s swipe, said the recent elevation of Brett Kavanaugh as a justice on the Supreme Court raises the stakes on voting rights, civil rights for gays and women\u2019s reproductive freedom.</p><p>\u201cI will only vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice who believes in a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her own body,\u201d he said.</p><p>On climate change, Cruz maintained skepticism that scientific findings warrant government intervention in the economy, while O\u2019Rourke cast the GOP senator as heedless of the welfare of future generations.</p><p>\u201cOf course, the climate is changing,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe climate has been changing from the dawn of time.\u201d</p><p>It will continue to do so, but that\u2019s no reason to let liberals seize command of the economy, he said.</p><p>He hammered O\u2019Rourke for voting against a nonbinding resolution that would have put a $10 a barrel oil tax off limits in a discussion of how to pay for infrastructure improvements.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke said wind and solar energy generate more jobs than any other part of the economy. Even Texans who work for fracking operations want predictable regulation, and are concerned about climate change, he said.</p><p>Cruz tweaked his rival for supporting former President Barack Obama\u2019s Paris climate accord and other environmental policies that threaten jobs in the Oil Patch.</p><p>\u201cCongressman O\u2019Rourke sides with liberal extremists,\u201d Cruz said.</p><p>Cruz denied he\u2019s been hypocritical to rail about deficits and then support Trump\u2019s tax cut bill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing record growth\u201d of the economy, he said. A Congressional Budget Office prediction the tax cuts would add more than $1 trillion to the national debt \u201cis wrong,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spurred the economy,\u201d Cruz said, citing tax cuts pushed by former Presidents John F.

California has the ideas of Athens and the power of Sparta,'declared[1]then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007. 'Not only can we lead California into the future . . . we can show the nation and the world how to get there.' When a movie star who once played Hercules says so who's to disagree? The idea of California as a model, of course, precedes the former governor's tenure. </p><p>Now the state's anti-Trump resistance in its zeal on matters concerningclimate[2], technology, gender, or race believes that it knows how to create a just, affluent, and enlightened society. 'The future depends on us,' Governor Gavin Newsomsaid[3]at his inauguration. 'And we will seize this moment.' In truth, the Golden State is becoming a semi-feudal kingdom, withthe nation's widest gap[4]between middle and upper incomes 72 percent, compared with the U.S. average of 57 percent and its highest poverty rate. Roughly half of America's homeless live in Los Angeles orSan Francisco[5], which now has the highest property crime rate among major cities. California hasn't yet become a full-scale dystopia, of course, but it's heading in a troubling direction. This didn't have to happen. No place on earth has more going for it than the Golden State. Unlike the East Coast and Midwest, California benefited from comparatively late industrialization, with an economy based less on auto manufacturing and steel than on science-based fields like aerospace, software, and semiconductors. In the mid-twentieth century, the state also gained from the best aspects of progressive rule, culminating in an elite public university system, a massive water system reminiscent of the Roman Empire, and a vast infrastructure network of highways, ports, and bridges. The state was fortunate, too, in drawing people from around the U.S. and the world. The eighteenth-century Frenchtraveler J. Hector St. John de Crvec ur[6]described the American as 'this new man,' and California innovative, independent, and less bound by tradition or old prejudice reflected that insight. Though remnants of this California still exist, its population is aging, less mobile, and more pessimistic, and its roads, schools, and universities are in decline. In the second half of the twentieth century, California's remarkably diverse economy spread prosperity from the coast into the state's inland regions. Though pockets of severe poverty existed urban barrios, south Los Angeles, the rural Central Valley they were limited in scope. In fact,growth[7]often favored suburban and exurban communities, where middle-class families, including minorities, settled after World War II. In the last two decades, the state has adopted policies that undermine the basis for middle-class growth. State energy policies, for example, have made California's gas and electricity prices among the steepest in the country. Since 2011, electricity prices have risenfive times faster[8]than the national average. Meantime, strict land-use controls have raised housing costs to the nation's highest, while taxes once average, considering California'surban[9]scale nowexceed those of virtually every state[10]. At the same time, California's economy has shed industrial diversity in favor of dependence on one industry: Big Tech. Just a decade before, the state's largest firms included those in the aerospace, finance, energy, and service industries. Today's 11 largest companies hail from the tech sector, while energy firms excluding Chevron, which has moved much of its operations toHouston[11] have disappeared. Not a single top aerospace firm the iconic industry of twentieth-century California retains its headquarters here. Though lionized in the press, this tech-oriented economy hasn't resulted in that many middle- and high-paying job opportunities for Californians, particularly outside the Bay Area. Since 2008, notes Chapman University's Marshall Toplansky, the state has created five times the number of low-paying, as opposed to high-wage, jobs. A remarkable 86 percent of new jobs paid below the median income, while almost half paid under $40,000. Moreover, California, including Silicon Valley, created fewer high-paying positions than the national average, and far less than prime competitors like Salt Lake City, Seattle, or Austin. Los Angeles County features the lowest pay of any of the nation's 50 largest counties. No state advertises its multicultural bona fides more than California, now a majority-minority state. This is evident at theUniversity of California[12], where professors are required to prove their service to 'people of color,' to the state'shigh school curricula[13], with its new ethnic studies component. Much of California's anti-Trump resistance has a racial context. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra has sued the administration numerous times over immigration policy while he helps ensure California's distinction as a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. So far, more than1 million illegal residents[14]have received driver's licenses, and they qualify forfree health care[15], too. San Francisco now permits illegal immigrants tovote in local elections[16]. Such radical policies may make progressives feel better about themselves, though they seem less concerned about how these actions affect everyday people. California's Latinos and African-Americans have seen good blue-collar jobs in manufacturing and energy vanish. According to oneUnited Way study[17], over half of Latino households can barely pay their bills. 'For Latinos,' notes long-time political consultantMike Madrid[18], 'the California Dream is becoming an unattainable fantasy.' In the past, poorer Californians could count on education to help them move up. But today's educators appear more interested in political indoctrination than results. Among the 50 states, California ranked49th in the performance[19]of low-income students. In wealthy San Francisco,test scores[20]for black students are the worst of any California county. Many minority residents, especially African-Americans, are fleeing the state. In a recent UC Berkeley poll, 58 percent of black expressed interest in leaving California, a higher percentage than for any racial group, though approximately 45 percent of Asians and Latinos also considered moving out. Perhaps the biggest demographic disaster is generational. For decades, California incubatedyouth culture[21], creating trends like beatniks, hippies, surfers, and Latino and Asian art, music, and cuisine. The state is a fountainhead ofyouthful wokeness and rebellion[22], but that may prove short-lived as millennials leave. From 2014 to 2018, notes demographer Wendell Cox, net domestic out-migration grew from 46,000 to 156,000. The exiles are increasingly in their family-formation years. In the 2010s, California suffered higher net declines in virtually every age category under 54, with the biggest rate of loss coming among the 35-to-44 cohort. As families with children leave, and international migration slows to one-third of Texas's level, the remaining population is rapidly aging. Since 2010, California's fertility rate has dropped 60 percent, more than the national average; the state is now aging 50 percent more rapidly than the rest of the country. A growing number of tech firms and millennials have headed to theIntermountain West[23]. Low rates of homeownership among younger people play a big role in this trend, with Californiamillennials[24]forced to rent, with little chance of buying their own home, while many of the state's biggest metroslead the nation in long-term owners[25]. California is increasingly a greying refuge for those who bought property when housing was affordable. After Governor Schwarzenegger morphed into a progressive environmentalist, climate concerns began driving state policy. His successors have embraced California 'leadership' on climate issues. Jerry Brownrecently told[26]a crowd in China that the rest of the world should follow California's example. The state's top Democrats, like state senate president pro tem Kevin DeLeon, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, and billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, nowcompete[27]for the green mantle. Their policies haveworsened conditions[28]for many middle- and working-class Californians. Oblivious to these concerns, Greens ignore practical ideas nuclear power, natural gas cars, job creation in affordable areas, home-based work that could help reduce emissions without disrupting people's lives. Ultra-green policies also work against the state'sproclaimed goal[29]of building more than 3.5 million new housing units by 2025. In accordance with its efforts to reduce car use, the state mandates that most growth occurs in already-crowded coastal areas, where land prices are highest. But in cities like San Francisco, the cost ofbuilding one unit[30]for a homeless person surpasses $700,000. California's inland regions, though experiencing population gains, keep losingstate funding[31]fordecrepit highways[32]in favor of urban-centric, mass transit projects yet transit use has stagnated, especially ingreater Los Angeles[33]. The state, nevertheless, continues its pursuit of policies that would eliminate all fossil fuels and nuclear power outpacing national or even Paris Accord levels and guaranteeing ever-rising energy prices. Mandating everything fromelectric cars[34]to electric homes will only drive more working-class Californians into 'energy poverty.' High energy prices also directly affect the manufacturing and logistics firms that employ blue-collar workers at decent wages. Business relocation expertJoe Vranich[35]notes that industrial firms account for many of the 2,000 employers that left the state this decade. California's industrial growth has fallen tothe bottom tier of states[36]; last year, it ranked 44th, with a rate of growth one-third to one-quarter that of prime competitors like Texas, Virginia, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida. Similarly, the high energy prices tend to hit the interior counties that, besides being poorer, have far less temperate climates. Cities likeBakersfield[37], capital of the state's once-vibrant oil industry, are particularly hard-hit. High energy prices will cost the region, northeast of the Los Angeles Basin, 14,000 generally high-paid jobs, even as the state continues toimport oil from Saudi Arabia[38]. California's leaders apply climate change to excuse virtually every failure of state policy. During the California drought,Brown[39]and his minions blamed the 'climate' for the dry period, refusing to take responsibility forinsufficient water storage[40]that would have helped farmers. When the rains returned and reservoirs filled, this argument was forgotten, and little effort has been made to conserve water for next time. Likewise,Newsom[41]and his supporters inthe media[42]have blamed recent fires on changes in the global climate, but the disaster had as much to do with green mandates againstcontrol[43]led burnsandbrush clearance[44]than anything occurring on a planetary scale.Brown[45]joined greens andothers[46]in blocking such sensible policies. Few climate advocates ever seem to ask if their policies actually help the planet. Indeed, California's green policy, asone paper[47]demonstrates, may be increasing total greenhouse-gas emissions by pushing people and industries to states with less mild climates. In the past decade, the state ranked 40th in per-capita reductions, and its global carbon footprint is minimal. Renewable energy may be expensive and unreliable, butstate policy[48]neverthelessenriches[49]the green-energy investments oftech leaders[50], even when their efforts like the Google-backedIvanpah solar farm[51] fail to deliver affordable, reliable energy. It's not so surprising, given these enthusiasms, that progressive politicians likeGarcetti[52] who leads a city with paralyzing traffic congestion, rampant inequality, ahuge rat infestation[53], and proliferating homeless camps would rather talk about becoming chair of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Reality is asserting itself, though. Tech firms already show signs of restlessness with the current regulatory regime and appear to be shiftingemployment to other state[54]s, notablyTexas[55],Tennessee[56],Nevada[57],Colorado[58], andArizona[59]. Economic-modeling firmEmsi[60]estimates that several states Idaho, Tennessee, Washington, and Utah are growing their tech employment faster than California. The state is losing momentum in professional and technical services the largest high-wage sector and now stands roughly in the middle of the pack behind other western states such as Texas, Tennessee, and Florida. And Assembly Bill 5, the state law regulating certain forms ofcontract labor[61], reclassifies part-time workers. Aimed initially at ride-sharing giantsUber and Lyft[62], the legislation also extends to independent contractors in industries from media to trucking. At some point, as evenBrown[63]noted, the ultra-high capital gains returns will fall and, combined with the costs of an expanding welfare state, could leave the state in fiscal chaos. Big Tech could stumble, a possibility made more real by therecent $100 billion drop[64]in the value of privately held 'unicorn' companies, including WeWork. If the tech economy slows, a rift could develop between two of the state's biggest forces unions and the green establishment over future levels of taxation. More thantwo-thirds of California cities[65]don't have any funds set aside for retiree health care and other retirement expenses. The state also confronts $1 trillion in pension debt, according to former Democratic state senatorJoe Nation[66].U.S.[67]News Reportranks California, despite the tech boom, 42nd in fiscal health among the states. The good news: some Californians are waking up.A recent PPIC poll[68]found that increasing proportions of Californians believe that the state is headed in the wrong direction a figure that exceeds 55 percent in the inland areas. And voters dislikethe state legislature[69]even more than they dislike Donald Trump. Newsom'sapproval rating stands at 43 percent[70], placing him toward the bottom among the nation's governors. Aconservative-led campaign[71]to recall him is unlikely to succeed, but surveys reveal growingopposition to the new tax hikes[72]proposed by the legislature. There's a growing concern about the state's expanding homeless population. And a rebellion against the state's energy policies is already under way. Recently,110 cities, with total population exceeding 8 million, have demanded changes in California's drive to prevent new natural gas hookups. The state's Chamber of Commerce and thethree most prominent ethnic chambers African-American, Latino, and Asian-Pacific have joined this effort. Californians need less bombast and progressive pretense from their leaders and more attention to policies that could counteract the economic and demographic tides threatening the state. On its current course, California increasingly resembles a model of what the late Taichi Sakaiya called 'high-tech feudalism,' with a small population of wealthy residents and a growing mass of modern-day serfs. Delusion and preening ultimately have limits, as more Californians are beginning to recognize. As the 2020s beckon, the time for the state to change course is now.

California has the ideas of Athens and the power of Sparta,'declared[1]then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007. 'Not only can we lead California into the future . . . we can show the nation and the world how to get there.' When a movie star who once played Hercules says so who's to disagree? The idea of California as a model, of course, precedes the former governor's tenure. </p><p>Now the state's anti-Trump resistance\u2014in its zeal on matters concerningclimate[2], technology, gender, or race\u2014believes that it knows how to create a just, affluent, and enlightened society. 'The future depends on us,' Governor Gavin Newsomsaid[3]at his inauguration. 'And we will seize this moment.' In truth, the Golden State is becoming a semi-feudal kingdom, withthe nation's widest gap[4]between middle and upper incomes\u201472 percent, compared with the U.S. average of 57 percent\u2014and its highest poverty rate. Roughly half of America's homeless live in Los Angeles orSan Francisco[5], which now has the highest property crime rate among major cities. California hasn't yet become a full-scale dystopia, of course, but it's heading in a troubling direction. This didn't have to happen. No place on earth has more going for it than the Golden State. Unlike the East Coast and Midwest, California benefited from comparatively late industrialization, with an economy based less on auto manufacturing and steel than on science-based fields like aerospace, software, and semiconductors. In the mid-twentieth century, the state also gained from the best aspects of progressive rule, culminating in an elite public university system, a massive water system reminiscent of the Roman Empire, and a vast infrastructure network of highways, ports, and bridges. The state was fortunate, too, in drawing people from around the U.S. and the world. The eighteenth-century Frenchtraveler J. Hector St. John de Crvec\u0153ur[6]described the American as 'this new man,' and California\u2014innovative, independent, and less bound by tradition or old prejudice\u2014reflected that insight. Though remnants of this California still exist, its population is aging, less mobile, and more pessimistic, and its roads, schools, and universities are in decline. In the second half of the twentieth century, California's remarkably diverse economy spread prosperity from the coast into the state's inland regions. Though pockets of severe poverty existed\u2014urban barrios, south Los Angeles, the rural Central Valley\u2014they were limited in scope. In fact,growth[7]often favored suburban and exurban communities, where middle-class families, including minorities, settled after World War II. In the last two decades, the state has adopted policies that undermine the basis for middle-class growth. State energy policies, for example, have made California's gas and electricity prices among the steepest in the country. Since 2011, electricity prices have risenfive times faster[8]than the national average. Meantime, strict land-use controls have raised housing costs to the nation's highest, while taxes\u2014once average, considering California'surban[9]scale\u2014nowexceed those of virtually every state[10]. At the same time, California's economy has shed industrial diversity in favor of dependence on one industry: Big Tech. Just a decade before, the state's largest firms included those in the aerospace, finance, energy, and service industries. Today's 11 largest companies hail from the tech sector, while energy firms\u2014excluding Chevron, which has moved much of its operations toHouston[11]\u2014have disappeared. Not a single top aerospace firm\u2014the iconic industry of twentieth-century California\u2014retains its headquarters here. Though lionized in the press, this tech-oriented economy hasn't resulted in that many middle- and high-paying job opportunities for Californians, particularly outside the Bay Area. Since 2008, notes Chapman University's Marshall Toplansky, the state has created five times the number of low-paying, as opposed to high-wage, jobs. A remarkable 86 percent of new jobs paid below the median income, while almost half paid under $40,000. Moreover, California, including Silicon Valley, created fewer high-paying positions than the national average, and far less than prime competitors like Salt Lake City, Seattle, or Austin. Los Angeles County features the lowest pay of any of the nation's 50 largest counties. No state advertises its multicultural bona fides more than California, now a majority-minority state. This is evident at theUniversity of California[12], where professors are required to prove their service to 'people of color,' to the state'shigh school curricula[13], with its new ethnic studies component. Much of California's anti-Trump resistance has a racial context. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra has sued the administration numerous times over immigration policy while he helps ensure California's distinction as a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. So far, more than1 million illegal residents[14]have received driver's licenses, and they qualify forfree health care[15], too. San Francisco now permits illegal immigrants tovote in local elections[16]. Such radical policies may make progressives feel better about themselves, though they seem less concerned about how these actions affect everyday people. California's Latinos and African-Americans have seen good blue-collar jobs in manufacturing and energy vanish. According to oneUnited Way study[17], over half of Latino households can barely pay their bills. 'For Latinos,' notes long-time political consultantMike Madrid[18], 'the California Dream is becoming an unattainable fantasy.' In the past, poorer Californians could count on education to help them move up. But today's educators appear more interested in political indoctrination than results. Among the 50 states, California ranked49th in the performance[19]of low-income students. In wealthy San Francisco,test scores[20]for black students are the worst of any California county. Many minority residents, especially African-Americans, are fleeing the state. In a recent UC Berkeley poll, 58 percent of black expressed interest in leaving California, a higher percentage than for any racial group, though approximately 45 percent of Asians and Latinos also considered moving out. Perhaps the biggest demographic disaster is generational. For decades, California incubatedyouth culture[21], creating trends like beatniks, hippies, surfers, and Latino and Asian art, music, and cuisine. The state is a fountainhead ofyouthful wokeness and rebellion[22], but that may prove short-lived as millennials leave. From 2014 to 2018, notes demographer Wendell Cox, net domestic out-migration grew from 46,000 to 156,000. The exiles are increasingly in their family-formation years. In the 2010s, California suffered higher net declines in virtually every age category under 54, with the biggest rate of loss coming among the 35-to-44 cohort. As families with children leave, and international migration slows to one-third of Texas's level, the remaining population is rapidly aging. Since 2010, California's fertility rate has dropped 60 percent, more than the national average; the state is now aging 50 percent more rapidly than the rest of the country. A growing number of tech firms and millennials have headed to theIntermountain West[23]. Low rates of homeownership among younger people play a big role in this trend, with Californiamillennials[24]forced to rent, with little chance of buying their own home, while many of the state's biggest metroslead the nation in long-term owners[25]. California is increasingly a greying refuge for those who bought property when housing was affordable. After Governor Schwarzenegger morphed into a progressive environmentalist, climate concerns began driving state policy. His successors have embraced California 'leadership' on climate issues. Jerry Brownrecently told[26]a crowd in China that the rest of the world should follow California's example. The state's top Democrats, like state senate president pro tem Kevin DeLeon, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, and billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, nowcompete[27]for the green mantle. Their policies haveworsened conditions[28]for many middle- and working-class Californians. Oblivious to these concerns, Greens ignore practical ideas\u2014nuclear power, natural gas cars, job creation in affordable areas, home-based work\u2014that could help reduce emissions without disrupting people's lives. Ultra-green policies also work against the state'sproclaimed goal[29]of building more than 3.5 million new housing units by 2025. In accordance with its efforts to reduce car use, the state mandates that most growth occurs in already-crowded coastal areas, where land prices are highest. But in cities like San Francisco, the cost ofbuilding one unit[30]for a homeless person surpasses $700,000. California's inland regions, though experiencing population gains, keep losingstate funding[31]fordecrepit highways[32]in favor of urban-centric, mass transit projects\u2014yet transit use has stagnated, especially ingreater Los Angeles[33]. The state, nevertheless, continues its pursuit of policies that would eliminate all fossil fuels and nuclear power\u2014outpacing national or even Paris Accord levels and guaranteeing ever-rising energy prices. Mandating everything fromelectric cars[34]to electric homes will only drive more working-class Californians into 'energy poverty.' High energy prices also directly affect the manufacturing and logistics firms that employ blue-collar workers at decent wages. Business relocation expertJoe Vranich[35]notes that industrial firms account for many of the 2,000 employers that left the state this decade. California's industrial growth has fallen tothe bottom tier of states[36]; last year, it ranked 44th, with a rate of growth one-third to one-quarter that of prime competitors like Texas, Virginia, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida. Similarly, the high energy prices tend to hit the interior counties that, besides being poorer, have far less temperate climates. Cities likeBakersfield[37], capital of the state's once-vibrant oil industry, are particularly hard-hit. High energy prices will cost the region, northeast of the Los Angeles Basin, 14,000 generally high-paid jobs, even as the state continues toimport oil from Saudi Arabia[38]. California's leaders apply climate change to excuse virtually every failure of state policy. During the California drought,Brown[39]and his minions blamed the 'climate' for the dry period, refusing to take responsibility forinsufficient water storage[40]that would have helped farmers. When the rains returned and reservoirs filled, this argument was forgotten, and little effort has been made to conserve water for next time. Likewise,Newsom[41]and his supporters inthe media[42]have blamed recent fires on changes in the global climate, but the disaster had as much to do with green mandates againstcontrol[43]led burnsandbrush clearance[44]than anything occurring on a planetary scale.Brown[45]joined greens andothers[46]in blocking such sensible policies. Few climate advocates ever seem to ask if their policies actually help the planet. Indeed, California's green policy, asone paper[47]demonstrates, may be increasing total greenhouse-gas emissions by pushing people and industries to states with less mild climates. In the past decade, the state ranked 40th in per-capita reductions, and its global carbon footprint is minimal. Renewable energy may be expensive and unreliable, butstate policy[48]neverthelessenriches[49]the green-energy investments oftech leaders[50], even when their efforts\u2014like the Google-backedIvanpah solar farm[51]\u2014fail to deliver affordable, reliable energy. It's not so surprising, given these enthusiasms, that progressive politicians likeGarcetti[52]\u2014who leads a city with paralyzing traffic congestion, rampant inequality, ahuge rat infestation[53], and proliferating homeless camps\u2014would rather talk about becoming chair of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Reality is asserting itself, though. Tech firms already show signs of restlessness with the current regulatory regime and appear to be shiftingemployment to other state[54]s, notablyTexas[55],Tennessee[56],Nevada[57],Colorado[58], andArizona[59]. Economic-modeling firmEmsi[60]estimates that several states\u2014Idaho, Tennessee, Washington, and Utah\u2014are growing their tech employment faster than California. The state is losing momentum in professional and technical services\u2014the largest high-wage sector\u2014and now stands roughly in the middle of the pack behind other western states such as Texas, Tennessee, and Florida. And Assembly Bill 5, the state law regulating certain forms ofcontract labor[61], reclassifies part-time workers. Aimed initially at ride-sharing giantsUber and Lyft[62], the legislation also extends to independent contractors in industries from media to trucking. At some point, as evenBrown[63]noted, the ultra-high capital gains returns will fall and, combined with the costs of an expanding welfare state, could leave the state in fiscal chaos. Big Tech could stumble, a possibility made more real by therecent $100 billion drop[64]in the value of privately held 'unicorn' companies, including WeWork. If the tech economy slows, a rift could develop between two of the state's biggest forces\u2014unions and the green establishment\u2014over future levels of taxation. More thantwo-thirds of California cities[65]don't have any funds set aside for retiree health care and other retirement expenses. The state also confronts $1 trillion in pension debt, according to former Democratic state senatorJoe Nation[66].U.S.[67]News ...portranks California, despite the tech boom, 42nd in fiscal health among the states. The good news: some Californians are waking up.A recent PPIC poll[68]found that increasing proportions of Californians believe that the state is headed in the wrong direction\u2014a figure that exceeds 55 percent in the inland areas. And voters dislikethe state legislature[69]even more than they dislike Donald Trump. Newsom'sapproval rating stands at 43 percent[70], placing him toward the bottom among the nation's governors. Aconservative-led campaign[71]to recall him is unlikely to succeed, but surveys reveal growingopposition to the new tax hikes[72]proposed by the legislature. There's a growing concern about the state's expanding homeless population. And a rebellion against the state's energy policies is already under way. Recently,110 cities, with total population exceeding 8 million, have demanded changes in California's drive to prevent new natural gas hookups. The state's Chamber of Commerce and thethree most prominent ethnic chambers\u2014African-American, Latino, and Asian-Pacific\u2014have joined this effort. Californians need less bombast and progressive pretense from their leaders and more attention to policies that could counteract the economic and demographic tides threatening the state. On its current course, California increasingly resembles a model of what the late Taichi Sakaiya called 'high-tech feudalism,' with a small population of wealthy residents and a growing mass of modern-day serfs. Delusion and preening ultimately have limits, as more Californians are beginning to recognize. As the 2020s beckon, the time for the state to change course is now.

I even wrote a pretty long paper about it for the Knight 1st Amendment Institute at Columbia University entitled Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech[2]. So, I was definitely curious to see what Senators Warner, Hawley and Blumenthal had cooked up with their new ACCESS Act[3] [Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act] since it's being pitched as pressuring big social media companies to open up their platforms[4] to competitors. I've been a pretty big critic of past proposals from Senator Warner[5], Senator Blumenthal[6] and especially Senator Hawley[7], but given that the topic of this particular bill sounded like it might be in line with my suggestions about creating competition through interoperable protocols and open APIs, I thought that maybe, just maybe, these Senators might have gotten it right. Unfortunately, that does not look to be the case. To be fair, this bill is not nearly as bad as previous efforts by (especially) Hawley and Blumenthal to regulate internet companies. </p><p>Indeed, I'd almost be convinced that, unlike some of their previous bills, this one actually is legitimately trying to solve the issues associated with some internet platforms becoming too dominant, and creating a path towards more actual competition. Also, this does, at the very least, take a different approach compared to the usual tools of governments (fines, breakups, etc) and recognizes the value of interoperability and actually enabling competition. The problem, though, is that this bill won't actually accomplish what it hopes to do so. Because -- and this is a hallmark of Hawley's various tech bills -- it seeks to regulate a dynamic and rapidly evolving market as if it's stagnant and set in stone with little likelihood of ever changing. It also takes a very heavy handed approach, and reminds me, yet again, that Hawley seems to think he should be appointed the product manager for the internet. Also, there are much, much easier ways to accomplish what this bill seeks to accomplish -- by fixing other laws, rather than by piling on new rules. The crux of this bill is that very large internet platforms (over 100 million monthly active US-based users, which would limit it to a very small number of platforms[8], perhaps just Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat and Pinterest) would have to offer up an open API and data portability for others, such as smaller competitors, to access the data on the platform.A large communications platform provider shall, for each large communications platform it operates, maintain a set of transparent, third-party-accessible interfaces (including application programming interfaces) to initiate the secure transfer of user data to a user, or to a competing communications provider acting at the direction of a user, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.One other interesting element here is that it would set up a new class of middlemen, that users could designate to manage their privacy. I envisioned something like this both in my Columbia paper and in one of my fiction stories in the Working Futures[9] anthology, but mandating it by law just seems weird and nonsensical. This is the type of thing that you shouldn't need to mandate if everything else is designed properly. The other crazy thing about this bill is that it seems to exist in a world where it doesn't recognize how this setup conflicts with all of the other complaints -- often put forth by the likes of Senators Warner, Hawley and Blumenthal -- that these companies don't do enough to protect user privacy. Yes, it hand waves at the privacy issue, by basically saying \"make all your data available via an API... but make sure you keep it private.\" And that's about it. How to accomplish this without it creating a massive privacy nightmare is left unstated. Honestly, the description of the API they're asking for sounds an awful lot like the setup Facebook used to have, which was abused by Cambridge Analytica, leading to Facebook getting hit with a $5 billion fine. And now these Senators -- who I'm sure supported the FTC's fine (or even perhaps wanted more) -- are basically demanding that Facebook recreate the same open access plan? Among the many bizarre and unworkable aspects of this bill is that it requires NIST -- the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- to come up with \"standards\" to make online messaging, social networking, and multimedia sharing standardized and \"interoperable\" within 180 days. This just goes to show that Warner, Hawley and Blumenthal (1) have never, ever been involved in the process of setting a technical standard, and (2) have no clue how many different variations there are on those three categories, which would make them fairly difficult to standardize (which is one of the many reasons attempts in the past to standardize each of those categories has failed miserably). Finally, it's unclear why this particular approach is needed in the first place. As we've discussed, the big internet companies launched the Data Transfer Project[10] last year that already accomplishes the core aspects that this bill wants to enable, but in a more privacy-protective manner, and that's been improving a lot[11]. So, yes, I actually appreciate that this is a slightly smarter approach to trying to create more interoperability -- which I do think is important -- but it goes about it in perhaps the least useful way possible. There are a whole bunch of better approaches, many of which we've discussed before[12]: Have Congress clarify that APIs are not covered by copyright (before the Supreme Court even has a chance to weigh in). Overturn the CAFC's awful decision and you'll get more APIs and more interoperability. This is a low-hanging fruit type of option. Get rid of Section 1201 (the anti-circumvention or DRM clause) of the DMCA. This would allow for much more reverse engineering to get access to platforms, allowing more competitors to create their own interoperable systems. Fix the CFAA such to overturn the Power ruling that said that a third party company couldn't scrape Facebook's data even with permission from the user. Get rid of software patents, which can and are used to block interoperability and similar features within services.Do those things and you'll get your interoperability, transportabiliy, and competition without having to \"mandate\" it.

Until today, conventional wisdom held that posting misinformation to Facebook and other platforms was largely a byproduct of ideology. The more conservative you were in 2016, the argument goes, the more likely you were to share hoaxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a fascinating new paper published today in the journal Science Advances suggests that something else is afoot. I wrote about it today at The Verge:</p><p>11 percent of users older than 65 shared a hoax, while just 3 percent of users 18 to 29 did. Facebook users ages 65 and older shared more than twice as many fake news articles than the next-oldest age group of 45 to 65, and nearly seven times as many fake news articles as the youngest age group (18 to 29).</p><p> When we bring up the age finding, a lot of people say,  oh yeah, that s obvious,   co-author Andrew Guess, a political scientist at Princeton University, told The Verge.  For me, what is pretty striking is that the relationship holds even when you control for party affiliation or ideology. The fact that it s independent of these other traits is pretty surprising to me. It s not just being driven by older people being more conservative. </p><p>Why do older users share fake news more often? There are two competing theories, for which we still lack good evidence:</p><p>The first is that older people, who came to the internet later, lack the digital literacy skills of their younger counterparts. The second is that people experience cognitive decline as they age, making them likelier to fall for hoaxes.</p><p>Regardless of age, the digital literacy gap has previously been blamed on users  willingness to share hoaxes. Last year, WhatsApp began developing a program to promote digital literacy in India   where many of its 200 million users are relatively new to the internet   after a series of murders that may have been prompted by viral forwarding in the app. That program is aimed at users of all ages.</p><p>At the same time, elderly Americans are prone to falling for so many scams that the Federal Bureau of Investigations has a page devoted to them. It seems likely that a multi-pronged approach to reducing the spread of fake news will be more effective than trying to solve for only one variable.</p><p>I ll resist the temptation to quote my entire article, and instead ask you once again to read the full thing here.</p><p>Two more notes about this study, drawn from my conversation with a researcher who did not work it: Matthew Gentzkow, who has researched the efforts of Facebook s efforts to slow the spread of fake news.</p><p>First: Gentzkow, a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, noted that this paper is unusual for recording actual Facebook user behavior, rather than self-reported survey data. Researchers were able to do this because   with users  consent   they scraped user timeline posts to see which links they had actually shared. It s one reason why the paper s findings are more compelling than previous work that has been done on the subject.</p><p>Second: who exactly were these Facebook-obsessed seniors? Gentzkow noted that despite Facebook s near-total penetration of the North American market, in 2016 it was still somewhat unusual to see hyperactive social media use among septuagenarians.</p><p> What s also true very, very strongly true is the likelihood of using social media declines with age,  Gentzkow told me.  Elderly people use social media at low rates. Who is the 70-year-old who is spending a lot of time on Facebook in October of 2016? That s not your typical 70-year-old.  Gentzkow speculated that older Facebook users might have a disproportionately strong interest in partisan politics.</p><p>In any case, the study has some good news for Facebook and democracy. As researcher Andrew Guess explained to me, the narrower an explanation you can find for a problem, the easier it is to design an effective solution. Assuming that future studies prove out the idea that sharing fake news is primarily a consequence of old age   or the digital illiteracy that old age effectively serves as a proxy for   then we have a good starting point for a fix.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Senators Call on FCC To Investigate T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Sprint Selling Location Data to Bounty Hunters</emphasis></p><p>A day after Motherboard s superb investigation into telecoms  sale of our real-time location data, several senators called for an investigation:</p><p> The American people have an absolute right to the privacy of their data, which is why I m extraordinarily troubled by reports of this system of repackaging and reselling location data to unregulated third party services for potentially nefarious purposes. If true, this practice represents a legitimate threat to our personal and national security,  Senator Kamala Harris told Motherboard in a statement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google search results listings can be manipulated for propaganda</emphasis></p><p>Remember Google-bombing? Catalin Cimpanu reports on its latest evolution, which exploits a sharing feature inside Google to make incorrect  knowledge panels  show up alongside search results:</p><p>While sharing search result page URLs for queries like  Who invented sliced bread  with an incorrect knowledge panel passes as an innocent prank, sharing malformed URLs for search queries like  Who s responsible for 9/11  and highlighting results like Judaism can have serious consequences in today s complicated political climate. Just imagine the damage you can do with manipulated Google URLs like these [1, 2, 3].</p><p>Link sharing is an important part of today s web and the way in which Google appears to have structured its URL parameters allows threat actors a way to essentially edit search results, which is a dangerous issue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vietnam threatens to penalize Facebook for breaking its draconian cybersecurity law</emphasis></p><p>Last May, I wrote about a new law moving through the Vietnamese legislature that among other things would require big tech companies like Facebook to store data locally and open an office in the country. That law took effect January 1st, and the country has already moved to put pressure on Facebook, Jon Russell reports.</p><p>This story is important because it shows that one outcome of regulating social networks can be the suppression of political dissent   which Vietnam has been rather transparent about.</p><p>The U.S. social network stands accused of allowing users in Vietnam to post  slanderous content, anti-government sentiment and libel and defamation of individuals, organisations and state agencies,  according to a report from state-controlled media Vietnam News. The content is said to have been flagged to Facebook which, reports say, has  delayed removing  it.</p><p>That violates the law which   passed last June   broadly forbids internet users from organizing with, or training, others for anti-state purposes, spreading false information, and undermining the nation state s achievements or solidarity, according to reports at the time. It also requires foreign internet companies to operate a local office and store user information on Vietnamese soil. That s something neither Google nor Facebook has complied with, despite the Vietnamese government s recent claim that the former is investigating a local office launch.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How Cartographers for the U.S. Military Inadvertently Created a House of Horrors in South Africa</emphasis></p><p>A bizarre truth about internet protocol mapping   the technology that lets websites and others track devices to roughly where they are logging on to the internet   is that the science is so inexact that companies will sometimes map millions of addresses onto individual locations. Often these locations are residential addresses, wreaking havoc on their lives. Kashmir Hill, the foremost documentarian, has a wild new study about a couple in South Africa:</p><p>The downside of this delay is that John and Ann continued to get visits over the last couple of years, as recently as last month when police showed up looking for a kidnapping victim. The upside is that John sought other help. He saw on Facebook that a classmate of his from Pretoria Boys High, the same English-speaking high school Elon Musk attended, was a computer science lecturer at the University of Pretoria. John sent him a message.</p><p> I m not the guru, this guy is,  the classmate responded, sending John contact information for Martin Olivier, a professor at the University. Within three days of John contacting him, Olivier discovered that MaxMind didn t choose to put the target on John and Ann s home on its own. It got help from the U.S. military.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos are getting divorced after 25 years of marriage</emphasis></p><p>Two notes here. One, Bezos announced the split on Twitter   a fairly amazing endorsement of that platform s cultural relevance in 2019. (Think of all the other ways he could have done this!) Two, MacKenzie Bezos is going to have a lot of room to make tech and media investment. The world will be watching closely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter hopes you want to watch NBA games from a camera focused on just one player</emphasis></p><p>Kurt Wagner reports on a frankly bizarre-sounding deal between Twitter and basketball executives:</p><p>Twitter doesn t stream NBA games, but soon it will stream parts of NBA games   just not the parts you usually watch on TV from the NBA s traditional broadcast partners like Turner and ESPN.</p><p>Instead of streaming a full game with all the players, graphics, and announcers, starting in February Twitter will stream the second half of some NBA games   yes, only the second half   but the camera will focus on a single player.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporters At The Sun Are Worried The Drudge Report Is Making Them Become More Right-Wing</emphasis></p><p>Every large platform encourages the creation of a particular content, whether it s Google ( what time is the Super Bowl ), Facebook ( Pope endorses Donald Trump ), or YouTube ( Watch Peppa Pig DESTROY a feminist ). Mark Di Stefano writes about the continuing influence of another large platform   the Drudge Report   and how it has affected one Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid:</p><p>The Sun has been targeting important parts of its news agenda to court the attention of right-wing aggregator the Drudge Report, with some staff concerned that it is beginning to change the way the British outlet presents stories on Drudge s favourite UK targets, such as London mayor Sadiq Khan.</p><p>According to emails seen by BuzzFeed News and interviews with Sun staff, the Sun s website editors have become increasingly insistent on creating what they have internally referred to as  Drudge-bait  in an effort to secure huge amounts of traffic from the aggregator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Women In Rural India Are Defying Their Communities By Going Undercover On Facebook</emphasis></p><p>Pranav Dixit examines the phenomenon of women in India joining under assumed names to escape the watchful, judgmental eyes of their communities:</p><p>For women living in these parts of the country, using social networks like Facebook comes with real risks of being socially outcast. While Facebook may have an image problem in most parts of the world for handling data carelessly, spreading fake news, and inciting violence and genocide, male leaders in these parts of India dislike it for an entirely different reason: It gives young women a platform to post pictures, put themselves out there, and meet young men.</p><p>Across rural India, young women are accessing Facebook under false identities, using the names of Bollywood actors or other made-up monikers, and sometimes even posing as men   violating Facebook s policy against  pretending to be anything or anyone    as they seek a place in modern digital life. (Facebook declined to comment on such apparent violations.) Their discretion doesn t stem from an everyday eye for privacy but from a fear of the harsh social consequences of being outed as a woman who uses Facebook.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Launches</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter is rolling out status updates, ice breaker tweets to select users in the coming weeks</emphasis></p><p>Some fairly significant changes are coming to Twitter in the next few weeks as part of a test, Julia Alexander reports. The company tells me I ll get to be part of it, so stay tuned for impressions!</p><p>A green bubble will appear beside beta users  names when they re actively online and using the app, similar to Instagram s status indicator, according to new screenshots released by Twitter and first reported by Engadget. Twitter hopes that by seeing someone is online, you ll be more likely to respond to their tweets and start a conversation.</p><p>The other feature Instagram is introducing is  ice breaker  tweets, which are supposed to help start a conversation about a specific topic. Users will be able to post their own ice breakers for others to respond to; screenshots provided by Twitter show weekly television series like Scandal and events like CES as an example of how  ice breaker  tweets will appear.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Instagram now lets you regram your posts to multiple accounts</emphasis></p><p>I m not quite sure that being able to post a single photo to multiple accounts simultaneously counts as a  regram,  as Josh Constine suggests here, but perhaps it s a step in that direction. And I agree with him here on the risk of these efforts, which are invariably greenlighted based on their potential to boost sharing and screen time:</p><p>Simplifying publishing sounds obviously better, but it could also dilute the quality of Instagram. Luckily, the feed s algorithm can simply demote generic content that doesn t resonate with people. But if the feed becomes full of stale cross-posted promotional spam, it could send younger users fleeing toward the next generation of social apps trying to spice it up.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Takes</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Truly Viral Movie is Here</emphasis></p><p>Sometimes a big tech platform will put something in front of your face constantly in hopes that it will become a hit by sheer statistical odds. Facebook Marketplace comes to mind, as does Snapchat Discover. It works less often than you might think   but as MG Siegler notes here, Netflix seems to have pulled this off perfectly with Bird Box:</p><p>In my case, I watched Bird Box because so many people were talking about it on Twitter. It was word-of-mouth, but not necessarily in the normal sense   again, the movie is decent, but not great and the chatter I saw was largely meme-based!   and yet there it was, staring me in the face when I opened Netflix. It was basically begging me to click-to-watch. And so I did. And so this shows yet again why Netflix is lightyears ahead of traditional Hollywood.</p><p>This isn t the first attempt Netflix has had in this arena. During last year s Super Bowl, they attempted to do the same basic thing with a commercial for TheCloverfield Paradox. It was clever because unlike so many other movie trailers shown during the event, the kicker was that you could watch the movie right now. Again, all of the friction had been compressed to time.</p><p>But ultimately, Netflix likely figured out two things from that experiment. First, you don t even need to spend tens of millions of dollars to promote this type of movie. In fact, a simple in-app promotion likely reaches as many people as a Super Bowl ad   and it undoubtedly leads to much higher conversion! Second, for the virality to truly work, the movie has to be at least halfway decent. Cloverfield Paradox was not. Bird Box is.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And finally  </emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scammers Are Tricking People Into Buying Puppies That Don t Exist</emphasis></p><p>The internet is positively littered with fake puppies, and you don t have to be elderly to fall for one of these scams. Here s dogged reporter Jane Lytvynenko:</p><p>There are a few ways to determine whether a website is legitimate, like doing a reverse image search on the pets or googling a phrase that doesn t mention the breed of the animal to see if other sites are using the exact same language. But the most surefire way to prevent being scammed is to meet the future pet in person, Baker said. That s what Dowden did when she tried to adopt again after losing her money. She said being scammed took an emotional toll on her, and she was embarrassed to tell her husband what happened.</p><p>To make sure an internet dog is real, it seems, you have to get off the internet.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Talk to me</emphasis></h><p>Send me tips, comments, questions, and links likely to confuse the elderly: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:casey@theverge.com\">casey@theverge.com</email></p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18176162/fake-news-old-people-nyu-study-silver-lining\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18176162/fake-news-old-people-nyu-study-silver-lining</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Casey Newton<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecomp1220939</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V73-B2T1-F08D-5012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2783\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last week, it reached $2trn. As I write, it's still climbing. It's both amazing and unsettling. Here are five reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. LAZARUS Apple was a company that almost went bust. Michael Dell once famously quipped that it should just quit and return shareholders' money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, few can touch it. It makes highend products that millions will buy. Then it makes accessories that also sell through the roof. And its customers, by and large, love them.</p><p>2. STOCK MARKET TAKEOVER The market thinks that in a pandemic big tech companies are cast-iron bets. Apple's stock is trading at over 30 times its projected future earnings, an almost unprecedentedly high level.</p><p>In fact, the 'big five' tech firms - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook - are now worth 20pc of the US stock market (and over two thirds of the Nasdaq). Of these, only Facebook ($760bn) isn't now valued at over $1trn, but add Tesla ($370bn) in and you're there. In total, these big five have risen 37pc in value since the pandemic started, while the rest of the market has fallen 6pc.</p><p>3. RESENTMENT AND REGULATORY PRESSURE MIGHT BUILD</p><p>Can a company's financial situation become 'too big' for us to stomach? It's not just that Apple is worth $2trn ((EURO)1.7trn). Its most recent accounts show that its weekly profit is just shy of (EURO)1bn. Apple's profit for the nine months to July was (EURO)37.8bn.</p><p>By any measure, this is jaw-dropping.</p><p>And largely, it's admired for the achievement. But it also may be divisive in some of Apple's current battles, such as the one between it and Fortnite-maker Epic over the flat 30pc Apple takes from app developers' revenue.</p><p>Apple strongly defends the rate and may well win in the court case Epic is taking against it. But such extraordinary overall profitability, allied to this gargantuan valuation, isn't something that will help when Epic pleads its case as the 'little guy' to politicians and regulators outside the legal process.</p><p>More widely, Apple sits atop the big five at a time when big tech companies are being lumped together.</p><p>\"Five companies constitute 20pc of the stock market's worth, run the operating systems on 99pc of devices and deliver to Americans the majority of their news, books and information. Surely we can now all agree that self-regulation of digital markets doesn't work?\" posted Carly Kind, a technology and human rights lawyer.</p><p>Add to this the fact that most of the world's finances are stagnating or shrinking. It's harder to marvel at a $2trn company that has hundreds of billions in cash piling up when your own family (or political constituency) is having to make tough decisions on what to do without for the next few years.</p><p>As my erudite Spurs-loving colleague from the Telegraph, James Titcombe, succinctly put it: \"Apple hitting $1trn was a story of a once-doomed company and a stunning turnaround. Apple hitting $2trn feels like a story of a crazy stock market that rewards a handful of tech giants for owning everything.\"</p><p>One thing Apple has going for it is the lack of an individual deca-billionaire. Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg are much easier targets than Tim Cook, because they're 100 times wealthier. Cook may be part of the 0.1pc, but he's not part of the 0.00000001pc.</p><p>4. END OF 'IT'S ALL BULLS**T' TROPE What has largely gone is the \"it's all bulls**t\" narrative that was popular when discussing Apple a few years ago. Initially common among development communities invested in rival ecosystems, this trope spread to media and marketing types, who inherently believe that there's little substance to anything and that all product success is just an aggregation of clever sales techniques.</p><p>But this was never quite right. Apple is extraordinarily successful in what it builds across a range of markets. Its 'minor' product lines now outsell everything else in those segments. For example, the Apple Watch is the biggest-selling watch in the world, of any kind, both in numbers and revenue. AirPods are now the biggest selling headphones. Even Apple Music, a latecomer to the streaming market, is miles above everyone except Spotify.</p><p>5. NOT EVERYTHING APPLE DOES SPARKLES Apple isn't quite an all-conquering juggernaut. Its multi-billion TV+ streaming services has had a modest start, despite being free for a year with the purchase of any iPhone, iPad or Mac. A recent snapshot of this was given by the Irish ad agency Core Media where a survey of 1,000 people showed only 5pc have \"accessed\" Apple TV+. That compared to a whopping 63pc for Netflix, 26pc for Amazon Prime Video and 20pc for the newcomer, Disney+.</p><p>Furthermore, some Apple services wither and die. Remember when iTunes was the chain that kept you anchored to iPhones? With the near-obsolescence of 'owned' music downloads, that era has passed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook at an iPhone launch</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-162595185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60ND-6DY1-JCBW-N1GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 23, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Bannon, the film\u2019s subject, gamely parries each question with lengthy tirades against elitism. \u201cIf you gave me the choice between being governed by the first 100 people to show up in red ball caps at a Trump rally, versus the first 100 guys to walk in at Davos with their tickets [for the World Economic Forum meeting], I\u2019ll take the working-class people,\u201d Bannon muses. Morris, sitting behind the camera, shifts gears: What does any of this have to do with immigration and corporate tax cuts? Bannon pauses, and the film cuts to the next scene.    If Bannon had an answer, he could have solved a riddle that\u2019s currently stumping the Republican Party: What do tax cuts have to do with working-class quality of life? If you asked Ronald Reagan, he would have espoused the brilliance of trickle-down economics. Today, we know that didn\u2019t really work. The answer to Morris\u2019s question\u2014essentially, what do free markets have to do with community welfare?\u2014is, simply, \u201cnot much.\u201d    Republican insiders are realizing the fragility of this conceptual relationship, which held the party together, even defined it, for much of the last century. Free-market capitalism created 20th-century America. Today, combative Republican factions are yanking at their party in a national game of tug-of-war to decide the direction of a post-Trump GOP. After decades of stagnation, his explosive presidency has created an opportunity for different types of Republicans to engage with the electorate and make their voices heard.    Democrats may call 2020 the most important election of our lifetimes, one that will shape everything from the U.S. Supreme Court balance to decades of climate policy\u2014a battle, they like to say, for the soul of the nation. But Republicans are equally concerned with 2024, when Trump\u2019s successor must pick up the pieces of his chaotic mandate and forge them into policy, setting a course for the party in the 21st century. The battle for the soul of the GOP has just begun.    ***    The next wave of probable Republican presidential candidates can be divided any number of ways, including by ideology and policy agenda. But when analyzing the party\u2019s overall direction, it\u2019s simplest to split them into three informal factions: Pre-Trump, Post-Trump and More Trump.     Appalling as it might sound to the president\u2019s detractors, More Trump represents a traditional contingent for any government: politicians currently affiliated with the White House who say they\u2019ll continue Trump\u2019s legacy while pushing a more robust platform. The most obvious candidate is Vice President Mike Pence, the socially conservative former Indiana governor whose 2024 odds looked better before Trump slapped him with heading the nation\u2019s doomed coronavirus task force. Critics say Pence lacks the charisma needed to truly pick up Trump\u2019s mantle, but he does offer a more mature, diplomatic disposition than the current president. His ambitions could be disrupted, though, by the other obvious candidate in this category: Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son. The firebrand scion has denied wanting to run in 2024, despite GOP polling putting him in the top three choices of hypothetical candidates.    Trump Jr. (left) and Pence are both candidates to carry on his legacy (Drew Angerer/)    A smattering of well-known politicians also fit into this Trump-extension category. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been one of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters and is not-so-secretly planning to run. Many speculate that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, after giving several high-profile speeches in Iowa in July, is laying the groundwork for a values-based, tough-on-China candidacy. Pompeo\u2019s odds, like Pence\u2019s, wouldn\u2019t necessarily plummet if Trump loses his re-election. But it wouldn\u2019t help him.    The second faction, Pre-Trump, comprises more traditional neoconservatives who wish to turn back the clock to the early 2000s; those who think Trump was an aberration, a one-off accident. They may push an aggressive foreign-policy agenda and emphasize old-school tax cuts. Some popular names belong here, including Trump\u2019s runner-up from the 2016 race, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, who spent this year aggressively touring the right-wing speaking circuit. Rick Scott, the junior senator from Florida, spent US$19,000 to run an anti-Dem attack ad in Iowa in January, weeks ahead of the Democratic caucuses; insiders took it as a clear signal he\u2019s running. Arguably the most interesting candidate in this group, though, is Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. A woman of Indian descent, Haley has deftly navigated Trump\u2019s world without sycophantically agreeing with every word he says, making her an especially strong hypothetical contender.    READ:  Trump may still be winning    The third group, the Post-Trumpers, enjoys support from intellectual Republicans hoping to steer trendy populism away from Trump\u2019s blunt nationalism and dog whistles. They are well-educated senators, all in their 40s, like the promising Josh Hawley from Missouri; Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio, hoping to recover after a mediocre 2016 presidential run; Tom Cotton, a brash and candid politician from Arkansas; Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse, who\u2019s bounced between openly criticizing Trump and supporting him; and Mike Lee of Utah, who rose to fame during the Tea Party movement in 2010.    While their priorities differ, each of these men want to tilt the party away from the idea of economic libertarianism as a panacea, and would consider stricter regulation, especially against big tech companies. The common thread: they want to protect Americans from digital privacy breaches, Chinese competition and needless foreign wars, while investing in local communities and businesses.    ***    Oren Cass, the executive director of the conservative think tank American Compass, is banking on these men to usher in a new era of American conservatism. He\u2019s written extensively about the need for Republicans to return to traditional, family-first values, and hopes this movement will challenge the GOP establishment\u2014political bigwigs like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and media outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal \u2014which, Cass fears, will lazily backslide into free-market Reaganism if left unchecked.    \u201cWhile a genuine conservatism would continue to prize very highly the values of individual and economic freedom, limited government and free enterprise, it would also recognize that there are a lot of things that markets don\u2019t do,\u201d Cass says. \u201cAnd there are some things that markets do that, frankly, aren\u2019t very good for other important conservative values in terms of family and community health and social stability.\u201d    Yuval Levin, founding editor of the conservative quarterly National Affairs , predicts some fundamental GOP policies will withstand this transition, including stances on health care, welfare and education. But the shift away from Reaganism is overdue, and Levin boils it down to demographics.    \u201cThere is a need for a generational transition in American politics in general,\u201d he says, pointing out that both presidential candidates (and the two Democratic runners-up) are all in their 70s. Nancy Pelosi is 80; Mitch McConnell is 78. Three of the last four presidents\u2014Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Trump\u2014were, bizarrely, all born in the summer of 1946. Levin sees this baby-boomer power clutch as proof that America\u2019s establishment politics, on both sides of the aisle, desperately need to be refreshed.    READ:  Buy Alberta? Prepare for a civil war? What Americans think in the age of Trump.    \u201cYou find a lot of people saying, in our politics, \u2018I don\u2019t recognize my country anymore,\u2019\u2009\u201d Levin says. \u201cWe need politicians who recognize their country, who are at home in 21st-century America, at home in a much more diverse society that doesn\u2019t expect things to ever go back to the conditions\u2014either economic or cultural\u2014of the \u201950s and early \u201960s.\u201d    Transition is not new for the party, which has swung like a pendulum between private interests and working-class populism throughout its 166-year history. As David Brooks wrote in the New York Times in August, \u201cTrumpism will survive Trump because the history of the modern Republican Party is the history of paradigm shifts.\u201d    In her book To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party , historian Heather Cox Richardson distills this dichotomy to \u201cthe profound tension between America\u2019s two fundamental beliefs, equality of opportunity and protection of property.\u201d She sketches the circumstances that gave rise to three of the nation\u2019s most renowned Republican presidents: Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower. Each won by inspiring the working classes during a tumultuous period. For Lincoln, it was relatively poor northerners who opposed wealthy slave-owning southerners\u2019 westward expansion; Roosevelt grappled with labour rights  during the industrial revolution; and Eisenhower enacted postwar economic policies that elevated the middle class.    Each time, after a decade or two passed, the working-class party retrenched toward big business, small government and the protection of property, only nominally supporting equal opportunity. \u201cThe country was in thrall to a pattern that would reoccur each time the party rededicated itself to its founding principles,\u201d Cox Richardson writes. \u201cIt would become the central story of the Republican Party.\u201d    Trump was elected on promises of providing relief to the working class, but he hasn\u2019t delivered (Matt Rourke/AP/CP)    One could easily transpose those two pillars\u2014equal opportunity and protection of property\u2014onto today\u2019s ideological battle. Establishing equal opportunity means elevating working-class communities (job creation, crime reduction, etc.), while the protection of property, in Cox Richardson\u2019s interpretation, means protection for corporations to run their businesses with minimal government intervention. Ronald Reagan managed to intertwine those two principles so successfully that many Republicans, as Brooks put it, \u201cstuck, mostly through dumb inertia, to an anti-government zombie Reaganism long after Reagan was dead and even though the nation\u2019s problems were utterly different from what they were when he was alive.\u201d    When defunct Reaganism and massive wealth disparity became the problem, Donald Trump promised a solution. Like more successful Republican candidates before him, he focused on opportunities for the working and middle classes. He won the election by blaming the nation\u2019s problems on notional, faraway forces encumbering everyday Americans: elitism, the deep state, Mexico, China, Islam, immigrants you\u2019ll never meet stealing jobs you\u2019ll never apply for. In frightening ways, and with new scapegoats inspired by xenophobia, Trump mimicked the language of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Eisenhower, pitching the Republican Party back toward a kind of twisted version of equality for all.    READ:  How can the U.S. hold a free and fair election?    Except that equality didn\u2019t manifest. An arguably senile New York billionaire, it turns out, did not understand the working classes, and quickly refilled the White House swamp with stodgy Reaganists and neoconservatives. Trump promised to keep auto plants like one in Lordstown, Ohio, open; it closed in 2019. He promised to save America\u2019s dying coal industry; since 2016, numerous mines have closed, coal stocks are down and there are about 1,000 fewer jobs in the industry nationwide. Trump\u2019s landmark tax bill in 2017\u2014his government\u2019s biggest piece of legislation, and the country\u2019s most significant tax reform in three decades\u2014provided relief only temporarily to individuals, but permanently slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21. His distrust of public institutions proved fatally misguided when the coronavirus pandemic struck; by late August, the virus had killed more than 183,000 Americans.    While Trump got elected as a working-class populist, he didn\u2019t end up governing like one. But his legacy was never going to be legislative. As Steve Bannon proudly boasted to the Guardian in 2019, \u201cWe\u2019ve turned the Republicans into a working-class party.\u201d The demand is real. The frustration exists. Even if a traditional, Pre-Trump Republican leads the ticket in 2024, that leader will be forced to run on a populist agenda, once again promising relief for working-class families.    As for Trump himself, no one knows how influential he will be after he leaves. His bedtime tweets in 2025 will obviously matter less if he loses this November. Regardless, Trumpism\u2014the trendy nickname for right-wing populism blended with ardent nationalism, a withdrawal from foreign engagements and a swirl of xenophobia\u2014will survive. The Republicans who gleefully rode to victory in 2016 believe they\u2019ve found a new way to win, a new language to drive home their message. It is the language of populism, of distilled hatred toward Silicon Valley elites, hypocritical celebrities and latte-sipping urbanites. It is, in some respects, the retrograde language of a betrayed working class.    Cass, of American Compass, compares Trump to an earthquake. An earthquake can show which buildings are structurally flawed, destroy old, weak ones, and even make room for something better. But the earthquake itself does not rebuild. That job belongs to someone else.

These competitors use technology, scale, and sharp insights into consumers to lower prices, improve products and services, and draw customers away from traditional companies, forcing those companies to cut costs and lose relevance.[1][1] Blockbuster, Borders, and ESPN are prime examples of victims of nimble disruptors. Victims typically overlook the trajectory of disruptors, which focus initially on perfecting their business models rather than their products or services.[2][2] Flawed governance can lead to such oversight by making it hard for management to identify and respond to warning signs. The 2017-2018 NACD Public Company Governance Survey cites 'business model disruption' as the factor that board members most often predict will have the greatest effect on their companies in 2018.[3][3] The good news is that a prudently composed and positioned board of directors can be a highly effective partner with management in confronting disruptive threats.Basic Fiduciary ConsiderationsIn many respects, leadership responsibility for dealing with business disruption is an extension of the shared leadership approach historically applied to tasks such as strategic planning and risk management. </p><p>These tasks incorporate prominent roles for both the board (which can encourage the development of a strategic or risk management plan and oversee management's implementation it) and management, which develops the specific plan. The effectiveness of both of these tasks relies upon on an integrated perspective on the long term strategy and risk management, as the case may be. An effective response to innovation-based business disruption relies on a similar approach; i.e., the board encourages management to identify business disruption threats and to develop responsive strategies, and then monitors the evolution of such strategies. Management, on the other hand, informs the board as to the nature and source of disruption threats, implements a responsive plan, and supports the board's ability to monitor the success of that plan. Ultimately, responsibility for dealing with business disruption is grounded in the board's fundamental obligation to ensure that the company maintains its long-term value and serves its principal constituents. As current developments demonstrate, business disruption can seriously threaten sustainability by undermining the financial model on which corporate operations are based. For that reason, the impact of business disruption on fiduciary duties is exceptionally diverse, affecting elements of governance ranging from information flow to the board, to director engagement, to refreshing the board with new members, to board composition, to the decision-making process and, ultimately, to the nature of the board's relationship with management.Specific Implications for GovernanceA governance plan to deal with disruption should focus on three related goals: first, a change to a boardroom attitude that more readily acknowledges the threat posed by disruption; second, an information system designed to provide the board and key committees with necessary information related to business disruption; and third, policies, procedures, and governance structure changes designed to support the ability of directors and committee members to maintain engagement with business disruption issues. The aim is to position the board as an informed and attentive partner with executives in identifying and responding to business disruption threats. Attitudinal Shift: This is the 'we get it' concept\u2014increase board awareness of technological disruption and the potential threat it poses to the company and its specific industry sector. As NACD has noted, such awareness necessarily includes a willingness to pay continuous, focused attention to the shifting sources and paths of disruption.[4][4] This includes a willingness to more closely monitor management's familiarity with customer needs and preferences, awareness of technological and competitive changes that could affect the company's business model, and ability to identify and implement responsive strategies.[5][5] This shift in attitude will also prompt directors to re-evaluate how they view the competitive environment, establish organizational goals, and, as noted in more detail below, structure themselves and their activities as a board to be more nimble and decisive. The shift also encourages directors to monitor a broader set of external factors and how those factors may affect competition. The factors can be socioeconomic, technological, investment related, transactional, and competitive trends in business as a whole (as well as those in their specific industry).[6][6] For some boards, this shift in attitude may not be easy to accommodate. Information Reporting System: Require top executives to work with board leaders to identify the types of business disruption-related information that should be brought to the board's attention (e.g., media articles; judicial decisions; government legislation or regulation; expert advice; educational presentations; participation in external seminars; news developments, corporate filings; management reports; whistleblower and 'hotline' reporting); the context in which it is provided (e.g., full original text or abbreviated or edited by management to facilitate board review and comprehension); the frequency with which it is to be provided (e.g., weekly, monthly; per development; as an agenda item at board or committee meetings); and the format through which it is to be provided (e.g., distributed paper copies; email; podcast; confidential online board portal; in person presentations). Protocols and Structural Changes: Designated Responsibility. Formally determine whether fiduciary oversight of business disruption matters should be the responsibility of the board as a whole (as with enterprise management) or delegated to a specific board committee with calendar-specific reporting obligations to the full board (as with strategic planning). The expected monitoring role of governance would be set forth by resolution of the full board, or by charter of the particular committee. Standard of Conduct. Direct the general counsel to periodically advise the board and individual committee members on the scope of their fiduciary obligations for business disruption oversight and related legal developments. Those obligations would include director preparation, participation in meetings, engagement with management and advisers, and exercise of constructive skepticism with respect to management proposals. Board Composition. Direct the board nominating committee to consider the skills and backgrounds best suited to address business disruption-related matters; i.e., is there a need to appoint directors with specific disruption-related competencies such as experience with disruptor companies, companies that have been affected by disruption, or innovative technologies or directors with more diverse perspectives? Director Refreshment. Revise director refreshment policies and procedures (e.g., term limits; age limits; removal rights; individual and full board evaluation policies; officer rotations) to allow for greater flexibility to add directors and board or committee leaders with necessary expertise and commitment to address business disruption threats. This would include policies on term limits, age limits, removal rights, individual and full board evaluations, officer rotations, and determining directors' fitness to serve. Talent Development. Require the board committee responsible for CEO searches and succession and other executive talent development activities to consider the extent to which senior executive-level searches and retention initiatives focus on individuals who are innovative thinkers with expertise in new technology, e.g., digital engagement, artificial intelligence, genomics, and advanced analytics. The talent development process should seek to project the company as a 'career accelerant,' providing its executives with an environment highly conducive to experimentation, innovation, and career mobility, and one that is unencumbered by a corporate or industry tradition of risk-aversion and incrementalism. Intra-Board Coordination. Ensure the coordination of strategic planning and enterprise risk management efforts with the evolution of board oversight of business disruption. Identify the extent to which the responsibilities of the respective oversight tasks are similar, separate, or overlap, and refine the charter and reporting relationships accordingly. Avoid the confusion that often arises with committees that possess broad, all\u2011encompassing portfolios. Decision-Making Process. Review the board decision-making process to identify streamlining options that don't jeopardize the ability to position individual decisions for business judgment rule protection. Determine the extent to which major decisions can be made faster to provide greater organizational agility, without limiting participation by key leaders, reducing access to important advisers, or otherwise handicapping the ability of the board to make informed decisions. Identification of Barriers. Identify potential legal and regulatory barriers at federal and state levels to planned responses to particular business disruption threats (e.g., laws relating to antitrust and competition). Conflicts of Interest. Adjust the board conflicts of interest policy to anticipate relationships of officers and directors with potential disruptive companies. Prompt greater coordination between committees responsible for director independence and conflicts identification and resolution and those responsible for monitoring the potential for business disruption. Board/Management Dynamic. Counsel top executives on the fiduciary expectation of direct board involvement in business disruption planning and strategy. Clarify for all involved parties the relevant lines of authority and articulate those areas in which the board has specific responsibility (e.g., as with shared responsibilities for strategic planning).Impact on Director LiabilityDirector liability exposure is a legitimate concern given the speed with which disruptive companies can change an industry. Yet, Delaware law has historically extended substantial deference to the board's method of monitoring business risks. As long as the board has in good faith adopted and applied a business risk monitoring system, any losses attributable to errors in applying the system (no matter the size of the losses) should be offset by the board's exercise of business judgment. The only exception would be if there were deficiencies in the exercise of such business judgment that rose to the level of bad faith; i.e., ignoring red flags. The less settled question arises in the context of a complete failure by the board to address (or even think about) business disruption risk, especially after being warned by management of the possible threat. In such a situation, it is conceivable that failure to even consider the potential for business disruption risk would be perceived as bad faith. There are very few examples under Delaware law of liability in such circumstances. However, in the current environment there is increasing risk that allegations that incorporate extreme or egregious fact patterns could prompt a different result, especially in jurisdictions other than Delaware.[7][7]SummaryBusiness disruption is one of the most compelling corporate governance challenges emerging in 2018. It requires a response developed through a partnership between the board and management and may require significant changes to traditional board practices.

From attempts to suppress strong encryption technology to the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and China's \"Great Firewall,\" such efforts have generally proven ineffectual. But things are changing, and not for the better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Parliament recently passed a \"Copyright Directive\" which, if implemented, will force internet platforms to actively monitor user content instead of putting the burden of proving copyright infringement on those claiming such infringement. The Directive also includes a \"link tax\" under which publishers will charge aggregation platforms for traditionally \"fair use\" excerpts.</p><p>The U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment is attempting to force the sale of Grindr, a gay dating app, over \"national security\" concerns. Grindr is owned by a Chinese company, Beijing Kunlun.</p><p>CFIUS's supposed fear is that the Chinese government will use information the app gathers to surveil or even blackmail users in sensitive political and military jobs.</p><p>Those are just two current examples of many.</p><p>Big Governments and Big Tech are engaged in a long-term mating dance.</p><p>Big Governments want to regulate Big Tech because that's what governments do, and because, as with Willie Sutton and banks, Big Tech is where the Big Tax Money is.</p><p>Big Tech wants to be regulated by Big Governments because regulation makes it more difficult and expensive for new competitors to enter the market. Facebook doesn't want someone else to make it the next MySpace. Google doesn't want a fresh new face to send it the way of Yahoo.</p><p>It's a mating dance with multiple suitors on all sides.</p><p>The U.S. doesn't like Grindr or Huawei, because FREEDUMB.</p><p>The Chinese don't want uncensored Google or Twitter, because ORDER.</p><p>The EU is at least honest about being sexually indiscriminate: It freely admits that it just wants to rigorously screw everyone, everything, everywhere.</p><p>Big Tech wants to operate in all of these markets and it's willing to buy every potential Big Government as many drinks as it takes to get them all into the sack.</p><p>Everybody wins, I guess. Except the public.</p><p>Governments and would-be monopolists are fragmenting what once advertised itself as a Global Information Superhighway into hundreds of gated streets.</p><p>Those streets are lined by neatly manicured lawns per the homeowners' association's rigorously enforced rules, and herbicide is sprayed on those lawns to kill off the values that made the internet the social successor to the printing press and the economic successor to the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>As Stewart Brand wrote, \"Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive. ... That tension will not go away.\"</p><p>Big Tech and Big Government are both coming down, increasingly effectively, on the side of \"expensive\" and on the side of Ford's Model T philosophy (\"you can have any color you want as long as it's black\").</p><p>They're killing the internet. They're killing the future. They're killing us.</p><p>Thomas L.

And now the government says\u00a0it will try again and\u00a0give the public another chance to weigh in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security released a proposal for how to implement restrictions on exporting\u00a0so-called \"intrusion software\" in order to comply with an international arms control agreement known as the Wassenaar Arrangement. The list of items covered by the agreement was updated in December of 2013 to include some surveillance and intelligence-gathering tools and the proposed rules were meant to ensure the U.S. meets its\u00a0obligations under the pact.</p><p>But the proposal\u00a0drew\u00a0criticism from big tech companies and independent researchers alike, who argued that they were too broad and would end up stymieing defensive\u00a0cybersecurity\u00a0research. Security professionals warned that licensing requirements in the proposed regulations could limit the use of so-called \"penetration testing\" -- tools designed to help researchers discover problems in computers systems or even make it more difficult for researchers to disclose vulnerabilities they uncover to software makers so they can be fixed.</p><p>[It's not just OPM: Cybersecurity across the federal government is pretty awful]</p><p>\"We believe that these proposed rules, as currently written, would have a significant negative impact on the open security research community,\" Google said on its\u00a0security blog earlier this month. \"They would also hamper our ability to defend ourselves, our users, and make the web safer. It would be a disastrous outcome if an export regulation intended to make people more secure resulted in billions of users across the globe becoming persistently less secure.\"</p><p>The Commerce Department received more than\u00a0250 comments on the proposed regulation, with many groups\u00a0raising concerns about the rules.</p><p>In a recent interview on a\u00a0cybersecurity podcast produced by the D.C.\u00a0lawfirm Steptoe &amp; Johnson, Deputy Secretary of Commerce Bruce Andrews hinted that the agency would be going back to the drawing board. \"I think you will see a very strong effort to be responsive to those comments\u00a0and to try to figure out what the next iteration of this is -- and frankly to give people another opportunity to comment.\"</p><p>At a meeting Wednesday, representatives from the Department of Commerce told industry stakeholders\u00a0that there would be a new version of the proposed rules incorporating industry feedback, as well as more time for the public and industry to weigh in, said attendee Jen Ellis, the head of communications for cybersecurity firm Rapid7.</p><p>An official at the agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, who declined to be named because he is not the official media spokesperson, confirmed that it was working on a updated version of the rules and there would be a second comment period, but said it was unclear exactly when the new version would be ready. The initial round of comments closed on July 20th.</p><p>\"They are doing a lot industry outreach -- which is overdue, but welcome,\" said Stewart Baker, a partner at\u00a0Steptoe &amp; Johnson, who\u00a0hosts the cybersecurity podcast and is a former general counsel to the National Security Agency.</p><p>Collin Anderson, an independent security researcher who has expressed\u00a0concerns over the rules, said that the proposed regulations\u00a0reflect the the difficulty of\u00a0separating offensive and defensive uses of cybersecurity tools.</p><p>\"I don't think that BIS was out to destroy the cybersecurity profession, it's just that this is not an issue where they have traditionally engaged,\" he told the Post in an interview. \"They believed that vulnerability disclosure was a lot more clean cut process than it turns out to be.\"</p><p>And because the actual international policy debate over the rules occurred some two years ago and the U.S was already committed to the agreement, the agency was put in a particularly tough spot, Anderson said.</p><p>Now the good news, Baker said, is\u00a0that the next version of the rules will likely have much more\u00a0input from cybsecurity practitioners on the affect\u00a0of the regulation. The bad news, he said, was that some\u00a0in the industry now lack confidence the government will get it right on the second pass \"since they made such a hash out of it the first time.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ed35812509d7498185923eb987b75279</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GJM-H5C1-DXKP-J00X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 29, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

Boris Johnson managed this feat on Wednesday, when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">maverick Julian Lewis</url> was elected chair of the intelligence and security committee over serial bumbler Chris Grayling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The consequences for Johnson are immediate, as the committee has now voted to release the report into Russian interference in British politics, a report which is believed to include details of the links between the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">Conservative</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">party and Russian oligarch wealth</url>. It is a scandal that Johnson succeeded in suppressing this report for so long.</p><p>To divert attention, the government spin machine went into overdrive, insinuating that it was former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who had colluded with the Russians during last year's election, by campaigning against the government's secret trade talks with the US. The government, Donald Trump-style, is deflecting from its own ties to foreign money and its disgraceful censorship by throwing around fake news.</p><p>The facts are very different. More than two years ago, my organisation, Global Justice Now, asked the government to give us <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">details of the trade talks</url> they were holding with more than a dozen countries, including the US. It was basic stuff - when the meetings took place, who attended the meetings, agendas and notes. \"No,\" came back the official freedom of information reply, \"all such information is confidential.\"</p><p>We appealed, and were told we'd been treated a little unfairly. We could see some of the papers we'd asked for. In anticipation, we opened the reams of documents we'd been sent, only to be disappointed. The papers were almost entirely redacted - black pen leaving not much more than page numbers visible (in one case, redacting even that).</p><p>A few months later, Corbyn held up the redacted papers in a 2019 election debate. His point was that if trade deals with countries like the US were so central to the future of Britain, the public had an absolute right to know what was being agreed in our name.</p><p>A few days after the debate, we were sent a link to a Reddit page, where we found leaks of the very papers we'd been given in blacked-out form. The leaks showed that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">our concerns were well founded</url>, and that negotiators were indeed discussing policies that could affect our food standards, our NHS, and our ability to deal with the climate crisis. Corbyn then held a press conference to bring the papers to attention and highlight the serious dangers of a US trade deal under a future Johnson government.</p><p>We have no idea who leaked the documents. My suspicion is it was an official disgruntled with the way the government was being clearly bullied by the Trump administration over Brexit, and concerned that we would end up with a devastating trade deal with the US. Certainly that's what the narrative the leaker posted on Reddit pointed to. Given this information was originally posted well before the election was declared, and sat on Reddit in obscurity for several weeks, generating publicity seems not to have been their strong point.</p><p>The government's strategy this week is clearly to belatedly discredit these papers. They can't be allowed to get away with this. No one has denied that the content of the trade papers is real. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">government ministers accepted this</url> during the election campaign. No one suggested they'd been tampered with. And everything we've found out subsequently underlines our concerns about the US trade deal: from our government's flip-flopping on importing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">food produced to lower standards</url>, to US statements that levying special taxes on Facebook, Amazon and Google would be virtually impossible under that deal. In fact, we now know that the US trade deal will certainly feature a digital trade chapter, which is highly likely to make it more difficult to regulate the big tech corporations that are having such an impact on our democracy.</p><p>What the whole incident really underlines is Johnson's commitment to secret government. Like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">Russia</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">report</url>, the trade papers should have already been in the public domain. Allegations of foreign interference in elections, and trade deals that will change the way our economy and society work, are things we all need to know about. Johnson has shown the depth of his commitment to keeping such information from us - and deliberately spreading disinformation when there's any attempt to expose the facts to the light of day.</p><p>The past week has also shown that this approach might be too much for some of his own backbenchers. The release of the Russia report at long last is very welcome. So too are backbench Conservative <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">amendments to the trade bill</url>, which will be debated next week. Johnson has refused to give parliament <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle\">any meaningful powers</url> over trade policy, making ours one of the most secretive and unaccountable trade systems. This includes denying MPs the right to see any trade negotiating papers, which they need to if they're to scrutinise the executive. Unhappy Tory MPs, worried about the government breaking manifesto promises on food standards, have threatened to change that next week.</p><p>In trying to tie together the Russia report with the US trade documents, the government hoped to distract and confuse. But there is a link, in that both documents show a deeply paranoid government, committed to secrecy, and prepared to go a long way to prevent the transparency and debate that democracy requires to thrive. We mustn't allow them to get away with it.</p><p> Nick Dearden is director of Global Justice Now (formerly World Development Movement)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64521582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CJ-F5C1-JCJY-G2T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><timeReceived>6:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Now, the government process trying to craft a voluntary code of conduct to govern the technology appears to be falling apart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Privacy groups are dropping out of the multi-stakeholder meetings organized by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA), they said in a letter\u00a0obtained by The Washington Post that will be sent Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At this point, we do not believe that the NTIA process is likely to yield a set of privacy rules that offer adequate protections for the use of facial recognition technology,\" the letter says. \"We are convinced that in many contexts, facial recognition of consumers should only occur when an individual has affirmatively decided to allow it to occur. In recent NTIA meetings, however, industry stakeholders were unable to agree on any concrete scenario where companies should employ facial recognition only with a consumer's permission.\"</p><p>NTIA has hosted\u00a012\u00a0meetings on the issue since February 2014. But the tipping point was at the most recent meeting, on Thursday. First, Alvaro Bedoya, the executive director of Georgetown University's Center on Privacy and Law, asked if companies could agree to making\u00a0opt-in for facial recognition technology the default for when identifying people -- meaning that if companies wanted to use someone's face to name them, the person would have to agree to it. No companies or trade associations would commit to that, according to multiple attendees at the meeting.</p><p>Then Justin Brookman, the director of the Center for Democracy \u00a0&amp; Technology's consumer privacy project, asked if companies would agree to a concrete scenario: What if a\u00a0company set up a camera on a public street and surreptitiously used it identify people by name? Could companies agree to opt-in consent there? Again, no companies would commit, according to several attendees.</p><p>\"This is a pretty remarkable opposition to a core privacy concept that's already in state laws on this issue,\" Bedoya said in an interview.</p><p>Some on the business side\u00a0argue that privacy advocates \"drew a line in the sand\" and weren't willing to negotiate. Privacy advocates blame the industry for the impasse. \"Trade associations have successfully blocked any expansion of privacy rights since 2009, and here they are successfully shutting down a process that could have given consumers more control,\" Bedoya said.</p><p>Others go even further,\u00a0blaming the Obama administration's ties with Silicon Valley. \"The White House staff are veterans from Google and Facebook -- they see this sector as vital to the American economy and they used data mining techniques in elections, so it is no surprise that they are ambivalent about protecting privacy, to say the least,\"\u00a0said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>Members of the administration disputed that description. \"This process is being spearheaded by people who come out of the public interest community,\" said John Morris, associate administrator and director of Internet policy at the NTIA.</p><p>But, he agreed, there are few federal standards for how companies can collect information about consumers right now. Most of what little protection people have at the national level stems from the Federal Trade Commission's ability to go after companies that engage in unfair or deceptive practices.</p><p>\"We're trying to work on facial recognition without legislation,\" Morris said. \"Consumers and companies need to know what the rules are for this technology and we think stopping the discussion at this point doesn't get clarity that's needed.\"</p><p>The NTIA process was a major part of\u00a0the White House's draft proposal for comprehensive consumer privacy legislation, which received a chilly reception from the privacy community and even the FTC when it was released this spring. The NTIA meetings were designed to bring the private sector and privacy\u00a0advocates together to help develop \"legally enforceable codes of conduct\" based on concepts\u00a0in the White House's 2012 Privacy Bill of Rights Blueprint for use in the real world.</p><p>The approach was first used to come up with rules for mobile app data, but the process was grueling and few companies have adopted the code of conduct that resulted from it, according to privacy advocates. And now representatives from the consumer advocacy world are pulling out of the facial recognition meetings. They include representatives from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Consumer Federation of America, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Digital Democracy and the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.</p><p>Privacy advocates believe their decision to withdraw could be a significant blow to the legitimacy of proceedings. \"Without the consumer and privacy groups there is no multi-stakeholder process,\" Chester said.</p><p>But the meetings will continue, the agency said.\u00a0\"NTIA is disappointed that some stakeholders have chosen to stop participating in our multistakeholder engagement process regarding privacy and commercial facial recognition technology,\" an agency spokesperson said. \"A substantial number of stakeholders want to continue the process and are establishing a working group that will tackle some of the thorniest privacy topics concerning facial recognition technology. The process is the strongest when all interested parties participate and are willing to engage on all issues.\"</p><p>Industry representatives also have committed to continuing with the process. \"It is disappointing that some stakeholders have chosen to stop participating, but we'll continue to engage with the goal of building guidelines that help people enjoy the benefits of this technology while protecting their privacy.\"\u00a0a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.</p><p>At this point, consumers are better off turning to state legislatures for protection from facial recognition technology, Bedoya said. Two states, Texas and Illinois, have biometric data privacy laws on the books that may already provide some protection against the use of facial technology without informed consent, he said.</p><p>Under the Illinois law, companies must tell\u00a0users whenever biometric information is collected, why it's being collected and how long the companies will keep it. Consumers then must provide \"written release\" that they consent to the data collection. Facebook is being sued  over its image tagging feature, which relies on facial recognition technology. The case will decide if the feature triggers the Illinois law -- and if so, if clicking through the terms and conditions when signing up counts as adequate consent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-0446bac4fab042ba8c122a36e0aae775</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G79-HJB1-JB4M-V2YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><timeReceived>4:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 16, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

This is a big deal. No society has ever centralized control of information as we have in big tech, and this is the first real American strike at the problem. As Scott Galloway frequently notes in his podcast with tech journalist Kara Swisher, the big tech breakup has finally begun.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What have Google and Facebook done to merit such attention from authorities? To put it simply, they use their control of the flow of information to monopolize advertising revenue, killing newspapers across the country and around the world and eliminating potential competitors in a host of areas. Since 2007, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/30/newsroom-employment-dropped-nearly-a-quarter-in-less-than-10-years-with-greatest-decline-at-newspapers\">a little less than half of all newspaper</url> journalism jobs in the US have been eliminated. Out of America's 3,000 counties, two-thirds now have no daily newspaper. Every sector of news gathering is in decline, and not because the appetite for news is down. People want news. But the traffic and ad revenue that used to flow from news now flows to the digital duo.</p><p>Market structure failings in advertising markets are a strange problem, because no one actually wants advertising. But advertising is nonetheless critical to give the press a viable financial lifeline, and one shielded by the state. Advertising has financed our news gathering since the early 1800s, and it is unlikely we can have a democracy without the journalism advertising enables. Facebook's global revenue will be over $60bn this year, and Google's will be more than $110bn. Most of this money used to be directed to publishers. So how do Google and Facebook control ad revenue?</p><p>Facebook and Google are basically advertising backends tied to large consumer-facing products. Google has eight products with more than a billion users, and Facebook has four products with more than a billion users. Their business models are quite complex, but the gist is that they seek to place ads in front of you while you are trying to communicate or when you are looking for something you want. So far, this doesn't sound so bad. But Google and Facebook aren't just getting a lot of online ad revenue growth, they are capturing practically all of it. And this is where data comes in.</p><p>The most important input for an advertiser is knowing who is watching the ad. If you know who is seeing an ad slot, you can charge a lot of money to tailor it for that person's specific interest. If you don't know who is seeing an ad slot, you can't charge very much at all. Google and Facebook know who is looking at ad slots everywhere and what they are interested in, so they can sell anything any marketer needs.</p><p>These corporations enhance their power by getting data from nearly every publisher that exists. Google and Facebook need publishers to serve their large audiences, and publishers need Google and Facebook as distributors. But the power imbalance is stark. Google and Facebook need publishers, but they don't need any one specific publisher. By contrast every publisher desperately needs both Google and Facebook to get their content in front of readers. For example, a few years ago Google decided to punish the Wall Street Journal for enacting a certain type of paywall by downgrading the newspaper's search ranking, lowering the Wall Street Journal's traffic by 44%. Google's business was unaffected.</p><p>With this imbalance, both Google and Facebook can and do entice or force, through a host of arrangements, millions of publishers to hand over data about their audiences and subject themselves to specific formatting choices. In other words, Google and Facebook both compete with publishers for ad revenue and force those publishers to hand over data about their readers and subscribers, data which is the main input that advertisers want.</p><p>The net effect of this market structure is that news gatherers can produce news, but most of the advertising revenue earned from people consuming that news goes to Google and Facebook. Google and Facebook earn money from other people's work, which is unfair and anti-competitive. And it's why newspapers are dying.</p><p>A strong set of antitrust suits, regulatory choices, and/or legislation splitting apart these companies and regulating the data used in ad markets can restore the flow of advertising to the people who do the work to earn it. Such actions will restore the strength of our democratic institutions.</p><p>Normally, antitrust enforcement would come from the federal government, but Trump enforcers have proved irrelevant at best. Instead these investigations are being led by the states. The Republican attorney general of Texas and the Democratic attorney general of New York are informal leaders, meaning that the investigations are bipartisan. The state attorney generals complement an important investigation by the House antitrust subcommittee led by David Cicilline. Such leadership suggests the rule of law, absent from American business for several decades, may be on its way back. There are also important investigations, hearings or cases by enforcers in Germany, France, the European Union, Israel, India, Singapore, Russia, Mexico and Australia, among others.</p><p>These corporations have become too powerful to be contained by democratic societies. We must work through our government to break them up and regulate our information commons, or they will end up becoming our government and choosing what we see and know about the world around us. It's easy to be despondent about the state of the world. But at least in this case, there are public servants fighting for the people.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Matt Stoller is a fellow at the Open Markets Institute and the author of Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-55927078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-6CH1-F021-63YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But one thing is already clear: coronavirus will change the world.</p><p>  The shock to the economy will be immense. Governments will fall. Careers will end. International institutions will come under severe pressure. Globalisation will be questioned like never before. To survive the crisis, liberal democracies will rely on the power of the state to a greater extent than at any time since the Second World War. And when the time comes to learn the lessons from this experience, we will see demands for an increased role for the state in our politics.</p><p>  There will be a drive, across the world, for increased resilience on every front: local, national, continental and global. Populations will expect improved public health policies, tougher border controls, and state agencies with the power and resources to protect the public.\u00a0</p><p>  We will also see demands that the habits and patterns of modern life change. We will debate the ways in which we manage our coexistence with nature. We will demand better animal welfare standards. And we will question the aspects of life we used to consider normal and unavoidable: the way we commute to work on crowded trains and clogged roads, the routines and structures of commercial life, and the extent of non-essential international travel.</p><p>  Together, these demands will create a pressure for a world that is likely to become more local and communal, more self-reliant and resilient, and more national and less global. Yet at the same time, the world will not suddenly cease to be interconnected, and the coronavirus experience will leave us with a clearer understanding of the need for international cooperation, in scientific research, information sharing, and the coordination of national policies.</p><p>  The changes that are likely to happen, therefore, will come from different directions. First, states will seek more control. Second, businesses are likely to apply new, and probably more regional, operating models. And third, we will need to find new ways of delivering the kind of international cooperation necessary to meet the challenges of our time.</p><p>  This mission is complicated by the fact that coronavirus will hasten ongoing changes in global politics. The pandemic might have started in China, and its spread might have begun because of failures in the Chinese state. But the scale of China\\x92s response to the crisis \\x96 compared to the hesitancy and lethargy of Western governments, the lack of leadership by the United States, and a visible lack of state capacity among the liberal democracies \\x96 has not gone unnoticed in the wider world.\u00a0</p><p>  Despite the origins of the crisis, China looks likely to emerge from the pandemic stronger in the world than before \\x96 particularly vis-\\xE0-vis the United States and the wider West.</p><p>  This does not mark a sudden change of direction in world affairs. Coronavirus will hasten a trend that has been evident for some years. Thanks to enormous economic and geopolitical changes \\x96 from the rise of China to the relative decline of the West, the emergence of new technologies to the conduct of rogue states \\x96 the rules-based system of global governance is breaking down. Destabilising international competition and rivalry has returned. The world as we have known it was coming apart before the pandemic began.</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Thirty years ago, it all felt very different. The Cold War had ended, and President George HW Bush proclaimed a \\x93new world order\\x94. Fascism had been defeated, communism had collapsed and Islamism was not yet understood. Few even thought about China. Liberal democracy reigned supreme.\u00a0</p><p>  This ideological hubris might have appeared absurd, but it coincided, from a Western point of view, with a period of unusual peace and calm, and a sustained economic expansion. Between the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the West felt secure, and its military action was limited to elective wars of liberation or humanitarian intervention. In Britain, Tony Blair promised a foreign policy based on liberal interventionism and the installation of democracies around the world.\u00a0</p><p>  Meanwhile, the long economic boom that lasted through the 1990s and early 2000s led many to speculate that the business cycle had been abolished. Gordon Brown boasted that he had ended \\x93boom and bust\\x94. It was not just liberal democracy but also liberal economics that had triumphed.\u00a0</p><p>  Neither Blair nor Brown \\x96 nor US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush, nor European leaders such as Gerhard Schr\\xF6der, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy \\x96 realised that the basis of Western stability during this period would become one of the causes of its current crisis. The globalising forces that kept Western inflation low and stock prices high during the 1990s were the same forces that internationalised production networks and later squeezed the incomes of Western workers. Blair\\x92s liberal interventionism, allied with US neoconservatism, caused a disastrous war in Iraq in 2003 that weakened the West\\x92s geopolitical strength. Clinton\\x92s assumption that free trade would liberalise China\\x92s society and government proved hopelessly misplaced.\u00a0</p><p>  Liberal democracy did not, for very long at least, reign supreme. Since long before coronavirus, the international system built by the liberal democracies has been under attack. A unipolar world has given way to a multipolar world, in which American leadership is challenged by China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and even the European Union. Making the case for a \\x93real European army\\x94, the French president Emmanuel Macron once argued, \\x93we have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America\\x94.</p><p>  The conflict between different global values and interests is on open display. China and the US under Donald Trump are engaged in a trade war. China is asserting its security rights in the South China Sea and the Western Pacific Ocean. Russia has annexed Crimea \\x96 sovereign territory in Ukraine, which borders the European Union. North Korea continues to flaunt its defiance of international law. India has tense relationships with Pakistan to its west and China to its east. The conflict in Syria became a proxy sectarian war between Middle Eastern powers, and an opportunity for Russia to flex its muscles. Iran seeks nuclear weapons and threatens Israel. Saudi Arabia may be seeking nuclear weapons of its own.\u00a0</p><p>  While these rivalries play out, new technologies and methods of warfare mean weaker states \\x96 and non-state actors such as terrorists \\x96 can attack the interests of others from distance and with impunity. Hybrid warfare \\x96 which can include terrorism, criminality, misinformation through social media, and interference in another country\\x92s diplomacy, media and politics \\x96 is common. Weapons and equipment that were once the exclusive property of powerful states, such as drones and guided missiles, are now in the hands of smaller states and terrorist groups. Cyber attacks, from terrorists, states and state-sponsored organisations, are also a new threat.\u00a0</p><p>  Trade and economic relations are driving and reinforcing security and military tensions. China\\x92s Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiative spans 65 countries, covers more than 60 per cent of the world\\x92s population, and involves investment plans reportedly worth $900bn. Many analysts agree that it is about extending China\\x92s military and political reach as much as its trading relationships. True or not, Belt and Road is causing other countries, such as India and Japan, to form new alliances in response to the perceived threat. Meanwhile, as the EU refuses to countenance fiscal transfers from richer to poorer member states \\x96 despite being a policy dictated by the logic of its single currency \\x96 China is investing heavily in eastern Europe and the Balkans and gaining diplomatic influence. When Brussels advocated that EU countries restrict exports of medical equipment in response to coronavirus, it was China who came to the aid of EU accession countries such as Serbia. Even in the US, China owns more than $1trn of US public debt.\u00a0</p><p>  Climate change and mass migration are also causing changes in geopolitical relations. Europe is still struggling to deal with the migration crisis that began in 2015. In that single year, more than 1.8 million illegal border crossings were made throughout Europe. Germany received 1.1 million asylum applications alone. Thousands of migrants are still reaching Europe\\x92s southern borders every week, and Turkey\\x92s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has recently opened his country\\x92s border with Greece. Throughout the worst of the migration crisis, thousands of European Muslims travelled across the continent\\x92s porous borders to Syria to fight for Islamic State or live in the so-called caliphate, only for some of them to return to Europe later, further radicalised, unimpeded and unprosecuted.</p><p>  As the balance of global power changes, the world\\x92s institutions are not changing with it, and many are in decline. As China initially covered up the truth about coronavirus, the World Health Organisation was unable to coordinate an international response. The United Nations was powerless to prevent the war in Syria or Russia\\x92s annexation of Crimea. Nato faces an uncertain future and constant criticism from the United States. The World Trade Organisation has been paralysed, deliberately, by Trump as he pursues his trade wars. In 2015 the Chinese established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in a bid to rival the World Bank. And the EU seems incapable of resolving the contradictions and tensions caused by its single currency and imperial ambitions.\u00a0</p><p>Western leaders have so far failed to respond to this changing world. They cling to their belief in open borders. They refuse to question free trade even with countries such as China that openly abuse international markets. They have failed to invest sufficiently in their defence and security capabilities. They carry on attending summits hosted by international institutions oblivious of the need to reform them. They mock populist leaders who disagree with them \\x96 and blame these leaders\\x92 election victories on their unscrupulous methods, the abuse of Facebook data, and foreign interference \\x96 but rarely do they question their own assumptions, beliefs and policies.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Leviathan: in his 1651 work the philosopher Thomas Hobbes \\x93proposed a state so strong that few would consider him a liberal at all\\x94</emphasis></p><p>  ***</p><p>  Many of the changes happening in the world are unavoidable, and some are welcome. The reintegration of China into the world economy is an irreversible fact. The convergence of Eastern and Western economies, and of living standards in both hemispheres, is likely to continue. New technologies cannot be uninvented. The 2008 financial crash happened, and the policy remedies concocted in its wake cannot be undone. We will live with the consequences of coronavirus \\x96 social, economic and political \\x96 for many years.</p><p>  But this does not mean we have no control. Policies matter. Many of the problems we face today are the direct consequence of political decisions. International trade and transnational production networks are shaped by trade agreements and domestic and international regulatory frameworks. International institutions can be made, unmade and reformed by national governments working together. The ability to control borders \\x96 for countries outside the EU \\x96 still lies with national governments. The power to regulate technology firms resides with governments and parliaments. And Western countries have no need to involve themselves in unwinnable Middle Eastern wars. The threats of today and tomorrow will, like those of years gone by, be met by economic might and sheer hard power, investment in security capabilities, ingenuity and innovation, strong international institutions, and alliances with countries with shared interests.\u00a0</p><p>  Policies always reflect choices. And the choices made by our leaders always reflect political \\x96 and philosophical \\x96 beliefs. Just as with domestic policy, our foreign policies are shaped by the liberal world-view of our politicians. The trouble is that there are fundamental flaws in that world-view.  From the start, liberalism was built on the premise that there are not only universal values but also natural and universal rights. Early liberals made this argument by imagining a \\x93state of nature\\x94: life without any kind of government at all. Life in the state of nature, according to the 17th-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, was \\x93solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\\x94, and to escape this hellish existence, humans agreed a \\x93social contract\\x94 to form a government.</p><p>  In<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leviathan</emphasis> (1651) Hobbes proposed a state so strong that few would consider him a liberal at all, but for John Locke, writing in his <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Two Treatises of Government</emphasis> (1689), the contract guaranteed personal safety and property rights. \\x93No one can be\\x85 subjected to the political power of another without his own consent,\\x94 Locke wrote, which is done by \\x93agreeing with other men, to join and unite into a community for their comfortable, safe and peaceable living, one among another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties.\\x94</p><p>  From its earliest days, liberalism had several features hard-wired into it. Citizens are considered autonomous and rational individuals and their consent to liberal government is assumed. And rights are natural and universal. For this reason, many liberals fall into the trap of believing that the historical, cultural and institutional context of government is irrelevant. Institutions and traditions that impose obligations on us can simply be cast off. All that matters, as far as government is concerned, is the freedom of the individual and the preservation of their property. The relational essence of humanity \\x96 our dependence on others, our reliance on the institutions and norms of community life \\x96 is ignored. From the start, liberalism took both community and nation for granted.\u00a0</p><p>  Just like other traditions of thought, liberalism also had a tendency towards teleology. Liberal thinkers including John Stuart Mill often made the case for pluralism and tolerance on the basis that the trial and error they make possible leads to truth and an increasingly perfect society. This teleological fallacy is what can lead liberalism towards illiberalism: its intolerance of supposedly backward traditional opinions, norms and institutions can easily turn to intolerance of the people who remain loyal to those traditional ways of life.\u00a0</p><p>  Taken together, these are some of the core ideas that explain why the West so often misunderstands the world. That we are all rational, even selfish, individuals, driven by our desire to be free and autonomous. That we are all the same, regardless of the contexts of time, place or culture: in the pursuit of freedom, we will shed with enthusiasm our customs, institutions and traditions as absurd and irrational hindrances. And this is not just a punt: liberalism tells us that this is destined to happen, all across the world.</p><p>  It is not hard to see how these flaws have influenced the West\\x92s approach to international relations. We were told, for example, that we had no reason to worry when China was permitted into the international trading system, because its communist state would observe international laws and trade agreements. As China agreed to trade more with the West, it was \\x96 in Bill Clinton\\x92s words \\x96 also \\x93agreeing to import one of democracy\\x92s most cherished values: economic freedom\\x94. And as China\\x92s economy became more market-based, liberals supposed, so its state would accede to the demands of its people for freedom.</p><p>  Of course, no such thing happened. China has abused the international trading system by overproducing goods and dumping them on other markets. It has engaged in mass industrial espionage. It has set debt traps for other countries to win leverage over them. Its state has not become more liberal or democratic, but even more oppressive. It has used the technologies made possible by international trade to control its people. And it has used the openness of other economies to undercut rival businesses and blackmail governments.</p><p>  But the mistakes are not limited to China. When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the West behaved as though Russia would in time become another liberal democracy with a functioning market economy and welfare state. Britain and the United States invaded Iraq and Afghanistan because, our leaders assumed, Iraqis and Afghans wanted to become more like us. In 2011, the West bombed Muammar Gaddafi out of power in Libya and seemed surprised that the result was a dangerous vacuum. Western powers cut a deal with the theocratic and deadly Iranian state in 2015, allowing the ayatollahs to develop a nuclear capability.\u00a0</p><p>  And our attitude to globalisation and international trade has been just as naive. Liberal economic theory tells us that the more countries specialise, the more they trade, and the more they trade, the richer we all become. But as supply chains have become multinational, and commercial and technical knowledge transfers have gone cross-border, comparative advantage has shrunk. International economic competition is no longer just between nation states but between classes of workers \\x96 divided by education and skills \\x96 that stretch across borders.\u00a0</p><p>  A generation ago, when British companies became more competitive, British workers shared in the success of the company. Now, as skilled functions such as research and development and product design remain in the West, production and assembly is often completed in lower-cost countries. The wealth created by the company is distributed between its shareholders, its executives and its high-skilled designers and technicians. Lower- and medium-skilled workers in Britain do not just get a smaller share in the company\\x92s success: many are no longer employed by the company at all. The result is that while the wealthiest Westerners have grown richer in the past decade, the incomes of ordinary working-class and lower-middle-class families have stagnated. And this is one of the contributing factors to the rise of populists, the fragmentation of electoral politics, and political stalemate and inaction.</p><p>  The list of problems and crises is long: Western workers squeezed, trade wars under way and a crisis in international trade. Culture wars, the election of populists, and political fragmentation. Middle Eastern wars, aggressive rogue states, a race for nuclear weapons, and the rise of hybrid warfare, cyber attacks and terrorism. Chinese industrial espionage, debt traps and dumping. Climate change and migration crises. The financial crash and its aftermath. The rise of big tech, artificial intelligence and the speed of technological change. The failure of international organisations, from Nato to the World Trade Organisation, and the rise of new international institutions \\x96 such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \\x96 designed to challenge Western power.</p><p>  Globalisation \\x96 and the world as we have known it for the past few decades \\x96 was coming apart long before coronavirus reached our shores. But the pandemic and its aftermath are likely to inflict one final and decisive blow that leaves the existing international order in pieces. The question is what comes in its place.</p><p>Western leaders need to listen to their voters and offer more economic security, cultural protection and national resilience against danger. But they also need to recognise that globalisation \\x96 in some form or other \\x96 is here to stay. The world will remain interconnected and nations will remain interdependent. That will require the reform of existing international institutions, and the construction of new ones. But our leaders also need to accept that Western hegemony is no more, and countries such as China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico will become richer and more powerful. Many states look not to Europe and America for ideas, inspiration and investment, but to different forms of authoritarian regime.</p><p>  Democratic leaders also need to challenge their own assumptions and beliefs. Liberal ideology \\x96 presenting a mistaken impression of human wants and needs, an unrealistic universalism and a dangerous tendency towards teleology \\x96 needs to be cast aside. Instead we need a more conservative and pragmatic approach to international relations and global governance. We need to respect the different \\x96 and often clashing \\x96 values and interests that exist around the world.</p><p>  The world needs a new multilateralism, in which the rise of powers such as India and Indonesia is reflected at the United Nations. We need new institutions to ensure peaceful economic competition between East and West. The West needs to create a new forum in which democratic governments can work together to regulate cyberspace. As coronavirus has showed, we need better international mechanisms to promote collaboration in scientific research, information sharing about public health and the coordination of national policies. But to maintain democratic legitimacy and public support, multilateral organisations need to remain intergovernmental and not supranational.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Enemies close: Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, June 2019</emphasis></p><p>  ***  For all the defeatism and sense of managed decline in Britain, we will remain a strong international player. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with significant military and security capabilities, and nuclear weapons, Britain\\x92s voice will matter. While fast-growing and populous developing countries will overtake many Western economies in size, by 2050 the UK will still be in the world\\x92s top ten economies.</p><p>  We need the strength to defend our interests in a more complex and dangerous world, but we also need to end the unsuccessful, wasteful and debilitating wars fought in the name of liberal interventionism. While we should make every effort to avoid involving ourselves in the sectarian war being fought across the Islamic world, we need to protect ourselves from its fallout, including the risk of extremism, terrorism and mass migration.\u00a0</p><p>  We need to be realistic about the imperial nature of Chinese policy in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, and become more strategic about our own foreign policy. We need to recognise that China is the principal strategic rival of our most important ally, the United States, and so we cannot go \\x93all in\\x94 with China as it rises. We must also recognise that China\\x92s modus operandi \\x96 setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage \\x96 is a danger to Western interests.\u00a0</p><p>  We need to develop a special relationship with India and find a way of normalising our relations with Russia \\x96 something that will, admittedly, be difficult as long as Vladimir Putin continues his aggressive policies. We need a more hard-headed attitude to foreign policy, defence, aid and trade. While Brexit must ensure Britain remains genuinely independent of the EU, it will need to negotiate a close future relationship incorporating both trade and security cooperation.\u00a0</p><p>  At home, we need a radically different economic model that addresses the challenges posed by globalisation, changing technology and our ageing society. We will need to think differently about free markets, the role of the state in the economy, the level of public spending, the ways we raise taxes, the balance between labour and capital, and international trade.\u00a0</p><p>  In particular, we need to think again about the way globalisation is working. We have to question whether our assumptions about the benefits of free trade and comparative advantage are still true.\u00a0</p><p>  Does increased specialisation, to the degree we are experiencing today, still make us inexorably richer? Or does it consign ever more Western workers to lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs? Traditional methods of measuring economic strength might no longer be appropriate. Instead, we might need to start thinking about economic strength in ways that show how prosperity is shared across society as a whole.\u00a0</p><p>  Increasingly, unrestricted free trade might no longer be the inevitable route to prosperity many leaders have assumed it to be. International trade agreements will need to be negotiated to reflect this growing realisation \\x96 giving Western workers much-needed respite \\x96 but the world does not need a neo-mercantilist descent into trade wars and industrial espionage.\u00a0</p><p>  They say we should never waste a crisis. And coronavirus is a crisis like none the modern world has known before. It brings with it social, economic and political devastation, and much human misery. But it also presents the West with the undeniable truth that the world we made is coming apart. It is time to build something better.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Timothy was joint-chief-of-staff to Theresa May from 2016 to 2017.

They had seen much worse: the two bloodiest wars in human history, mass unemployment and destitution created by the Great Depression (which still dwarfs this century's recessions), and far more serious threats to democracy in the form of Soviet communism, fascism, and Hitler's National Socialism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nonetheless, resolving today's predicaments could be more difficult than in the past, because most will have to be addressed through global governance, which is in short supply. True, globalization also contributed to rising inequality and the destabilization of national economies in the early twentieth century, and the Great Depression was very much a systemic crisis, originating in the United States and afflicting most other countries by way of international markets. But, ultimately, the fundamental problems that the interwar generation needed to fix were at the level of the nation-state.</p><p>Policymakers at the time recognized that macroeconomic instability, unregulated market economies, and mounting inequalities were the root causes of most of their problems. By experimenting with institutional remedies and formulating new ideas, they laid the foundation for the social-democratic welfare state. Macroeconomic management, progressive taxation and redistribution, minimum-wage laws, workplace safety regulations, government-provided health insurance and retirement benefits, and a social safety net for the least fortunate became the norm.</p><p>The modern welfare state first took shape in Scandinavia - most notably in Sweden after the Workers Party's first electoral victory in 1932 - and was further enshrined in the United Kingdom's 1942 Beveridge Report, which offered a comprehensive institutional outline even as World War II was still raging. Over the course of the following decade, similar visions were articulated across continental Europe. In each case, the policies being proposed lay fully within the purview of national governments, and could be designed in such a way as to strengthen democracy and marginalize the political forces that had led to two world wars.</p><p>Of course, the imperative to maintain peace went beyond national borders; but that project started with ensuring macroeconomic stability and shared prosperity at the national level. As Immanuel Kant had prophesied in 1795, robust democracy at home would engender cooperation abroad.</p><p>But post-war leaders pinned their hopes on more than Kant's theory. In Europe, they forged new supranational institutions, starting with the European Coal and Steel Community, established by the 1951 Treaty of Paris. These arrangements worked exceptionally well, ushering in four decades of democratic flourishing, international peace, macroeconomic stability, and widespread prosperity. Never before have so many countries enjoyed such fast, broadly shared, and simultaneous economic growth.</p><p>The question for today is whether this glorious post-war achievement can be repeated. Will the pandemic be the wake-up call that prompts democratic governments to develop a new social contract for the twenty-first century? Yes, but only if we come to grips with the global nature of today's crises - not just COVID-19, but also climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and other shared risks.</p><p>On the issue of climate change, national solutions are simply insufficient at this point. And the situation may be even worse with respect to the nuclear threat, considering that this category of existential risk is being intensified by the ongoing expansion and \"modernization\" of existing nuclear arsenals.</p><p>Moreover, many other problems that appear national are ultimately global. Consider inequality, the three major causes of which are globalization, automation, and the growing power imbalance between capital and labor.</p><p>Globalization has contributed to the problem partly because its rules have been written to benefit business owners, financial capital, and high-skilled workers over everyone else.</p><p>For example, labor-intensive products can be manufactured in countries where collective bargaining arrangements are weak or non-existent, such that wages are systematically repressed. No single country wholly controls the rules that allow such outsourcing and offshoring, and most do not have the option of isolating themselves from globalization.</p><p>Similarly, while national governments can influence automation through tax and regulatory policies, their control is ultimately limited. If the Chinese or US government is pressuring multinational companies to develop more powerful surveillance technologies, and if Big Tech's priorities lie in relentlessly substituting algorithms for human workers, these trends will determine the trajectory for the entire world. While the tendency toward labor-replacing automation has already inflicted major costs on advanced-economy workers, it threatens even greater pain for developing countries, where abundant labor is the chief production input.</p><p>Finally, there are very few ways for labor to regain its bargaining power when the constant threat of capital flight has tied national policymakers' hands. Even if national governments were to raise taxes on capital above the current meager levels, much of the hoped-for revenue would be funneled elsewhere through accounting tricks and offshore tax havens.</p><p>Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has argued that limiting economic globalization can create more room for national macroeconomic policies. But curtailing globalization would not reduce the scale of global problems. On climate change, the nuclear threat, and many other issues, there is no choice but to formulate global solutions through multilateral institutions.</p><p>The experience of post-war Europe shows that to build effective institutions, there first must be a shared vision. Yet that is precisely what the international community currently lacks. Making matters worse, already weakened multilateral institutions are likely to suffer even more in the near future, as the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines deepens existing fault lines between countries and regions.</p><p>We could have avoided the governance failures that brought us to this point. Despite ample warning, we have yet to take seriously, let alone prepare for, the global challenges that await us. The interwar generation might be underwhelmed by our current problems. But it would no doubt be impressed by the mess we've created for ourselves.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Unlike in the past, however, today's biggest threats must be addressed at both the national and global levels, implying the need for political leadership of a kind that is utterly lacking in today's world.     CAMBRIDGE \u2013 To the interwar generation of the first half of the twentieth century, today\u2019s crises would have appeared rather ordinary. They had seen much worse: the two bloodiest wars in human history, mass unemployment and destitution created by the Great Depression (which still dwarfs this century\u2019s recessions), and far more serious threats to democracy in the form of Soviet communism, fascism, and Hitler\u2019s National Socialism.     Nonetheless, resolving today\u2019s predicaments could be more difficult than in the past, because most will have to be addressed through global governance, which is in short supply. True, globalization also contributed to rising inequality and the destabilization of national economies in the early twentieth century, and the Great Depression was very much a systemic crisis, originating in the United States and afflicting most other countries by way of international markets. But, ultimately, the fundamental problems that the interwar generation needed to fix were at the level of the nation-state.    Policymakers at the time recognized that macroeconomic instability, unregulated market economies, and mounting inequalities were the root causes of most of their problems. By experimenting with institutional remedies and formulating new ideas, they laid the foundation for the social-democratic welfare state. Macroeconomic management, progressive taxation and redistribution, minimum-wage laws, workplace safety regulations, government-provided health insurance and retirement benefits, and a social safety net for the least fortunate became the norm.    The modern welfare state first took shape in Scandinavia \u2013 most notably in Sweden after the Workers Party\u2019s first electoral victory in 1932 \u2013 and was further enshrined in the United Kingdom\u2019s 1942 Beveridge Report , which offered a comprehensive institutional outline even as World War II was still raging. Over the course of the following decade, similar visions were articulated across continental Europe. In each case, the policies being proposed lay fully within the purview of national governments, and could be designed in such a way as to strengthen democracy and marginalize the political forces that had led to two world wars.    Of course, the imperative to maintain peace went beyond national borders; but that project started with ensuring macroeconomic stability and shared prosperity at the national level. As Immanuel Kant had prophesied in 1795, robust democracy at home would engender cooperation abroad.    But post-war leaders pinned their hopes on more than Kant\u2019s theory. In Europe, they forged new supranational institutions, starting with the European Coal and Steel Community, established by the 1951 Treaty of Paris. These arrangements worked exceptionally well, ushering in four decades of democratic flourishing, international peace, macroeconomic stability, and widespread prosperity. Never before have so many countries enjoyed such fast, broadly shared, and simultaneous economic growth.    The question for today is whether this glorious post-war achievement can be repeated. Will the pandemic be the wake-up call that prompts democratic governments to develop a new social contract for the twenty-first century? Yes, but only if we come to grips with the global nature of today\u2019s crises \u2013 not just COVID-19, but also climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and other shared risks.    On the issue of climate change, national solutions are simply insufficient at this point. And the situation may be even worse with respect to the nuclear threat, considering that this category of existential risk is being intensified by the ongoing expansion and \u201cmodernization\u201d of existing nuclear arsenals.    Moreover, many other problems that appear national are ultimately global. Consider inequality, the three major causes of which are globalization, automation, and the growing power imbalance between capital and labor.    Globalization has contributed to the problem partly because its rules have been written to benefit business owners, financial capital, and high-skilled workers over everyone else. For example, labor-intensive products can be manufactured in countries where collective bargaining arrangements are weak or non-existent, such that wages are systematically repressed. No single country wholly controls the rules that allow such outsourcing and offshoring, and most do not have the option of isolating themselves from globalization.    Similarly, while national governments can influence automation through tax and regulatory policies, their control is ultimately limited. If the Chinese or US government is pressuring multinational companies to develop more powerful surveillance technologies, and if Big Tech\u2019s priorities lie in relentlessly substituting algorithms for human workers, these trends will determine the trajectory for the entire world. While the tendency toward labor-replacing automation has already inflicted major costs on advanced-economy workers, it threatens even greater pain for developing countries , where abundant labor is the chief production input.    Finally, there are very few ways for labor to regain its bargaining power when the constant threat of capital flight has tied national policymakers\u2019 hands. Even if national governments were to raise taxes on capital above the current meager levels , much of the hoped-for revenue would be funneled elsewhere through accounting tricks and offshore tax havens .    Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has argued that limiting economic globalization can create more room for national macroeconomic policies. But curtailing globalization would not reduce the scale of global problems. On climate change, the nuclear threat, and many other issues, there is no choice but to formulate global solutions through multilateral institutions.    The experience of post-war Europe shows that to build effective institutions, there first must be a shared vision. Yet that is precisely what the international community currently lacks. Making matters worse, already weakened multilateral institutions are likely to suffer even more in the near future, as the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines deepens existing fault lines between countries and regions.    We could have avoided the governance failures that brought us to this point. Despite ample warning, we have yet to take seriously, let alone prepare for, the global challenges that await us. The interwar generation might be underwhelmed by our current problems. But it would no doubt be impressed by the mess we\u2019ve created for ourselves.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43087591629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VJ-2WP1-F07F-80X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Project Syndicate</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 16, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Czech Republic</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It was the Monday before Thanksgiving, and the news came to him, bad-breakup-style, via email. ''Following a thorough investigation, the company has found that you committed several acts in violation of Google's policies,'' the note said. It did not elaborate on what he had done to violate these policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Berland, an engineer who had spent more than a decade at the company, had reason to expect he might be fired. He had been suspended a few weeks earlier after subscribing to the open calendars of several senior Google employees, whom he suspected of meeting with outside consultants to suppress organizing activity at the company. During a subsequent meeting at which he was questioned by Google investigators, he had the feeling that they were pressuring him to say something that could be grounds for termination. Then, the Friday before he was fired, he had spoken at a well-publicized rally of his co-workers outside Google's San Francisco offices, accusing the company of silencing dissent. </p><p>  Even so, the timing and manner of his dismissal surprised him. ''I thought they'd do it when all the media attention died down,'' he said. ''When the suspensions and the rally were no longer on people's minds.'' Instead, at a moment when the spotlight was shining brightly, Google had escalated -- as if to make a point.</p><p>  Berland was one of at least four employees Google fired that day. All four were locked in an ongoing conflict with the company, as they and other activists had stepped forward to denounce both its treatment of workers and its relationship with certain customers, like U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p><p>  Berland's terminated colleagues were even more shocked by the turn of events than he was. Rebecca Rivers, a software engineer based in Boulder, Colo., was dismissed over the phone after accessing internal documents. Rivers had only recently come out as transgender and was pursuing a medical transition. ''I came out at Google expecting to stay at Google through the entire transition,'' she said. ''It's terrifying to think about going to a job interview, because I'm so scared of how other companies treat trans employees.''</p><p>  Sophie Waldman and Paul Duke, the two other Googlers fired that day, had not received so much as a warning, much less a suspension. Though they had been questioned by corporate security two months earlier about whether they had circulated documents referring to Customs and Border Protection contracts, they had been allowed to continue their work without incident. Waldman, a software developer in Cambridge, Mass., said she was given a 15-minute notice before she was summoned to the meeting where she was fired; Duke, an engineer in New York, said an invitation appeared on his calendar precisely one minute beforehand. Security officials escorted him out of the building without letting him return to his desk. ''I had to describe to them what my jacket, scarf and bag looked like,'' he said.</p><p>  From its earliest days, Google urged employees to ''act like owners'' and pipe up in all manner of forums, from mailing lists to its meme generator to open-ended question-and-answer sessions with top executives, known as T.G.I.F. It was part of what it meant to be ''Googley,'' one of the company's most common compliments. So well \u00adentrenched was this ethic of welcoming dissent that the company seemed to abide by it even after the uprising began, taking pains to show it was heeding activists' concerns.</p><p>  Over the past year, however, Google has appeared to clamp down. It has gradually scaled back opportunities for employees to grill their bosses and imposed a set of workplace guidelines that forbid ''a raging debate over politics or the latest news story.'' It has tried to prevent workers from discussing their labor rights with outsiders at a Google facility and even hired a consulting firm that specializes in blocking unions. Then, in November, came the firing of the four activists. The escalation sent tremors through the Google campus in Mountain View, Calif., and its offices in cities like New York and Seattle, prompting many employees -- whether or not they had openly supported the activists -- to wonder if the company's culture of friendly debate was now gone for good.</p><p>  (A Google spokeswoman would not confirm the names of the people fired on Nov. 25. ''We dismissed four individuals who were engaged in intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data-security policies,'' the spokeswoman said. ''No one has been dismissed for raising concerns or debating the company's activities.'' Without naming Berland, Google disputed that investigators pressured him.)</p><p>  As similar forms of worker activism have spread to other companies, including Amazon and Microsoft, it has also raised deeper questions about the nature of the entire industry. Silicon Valley has often held itself up as a highly evolved ecosystem that defies the usual capital-labor dichotomy -- a place where investors, founders, executives and workers are all far too dependent on one another to make anything so crass as class warfare. The recent developments at Google have thrown that egalitarian story into doubt, showing that even in the most rarefied corners of Silicon Valley, the bosses are willing to close ranks and shut down debate when the stakes are high enough. The fate of these activists, meanwhile, forces America's white-collar professionals to grapple with an uncomfortable thought: If the nation's most sought-after workers can't stop their employer from behaving in ways that they deplore, where does that leave the rest of us?</p><p>  As recently as a decade ago, the prospect of labor unrest at Google, of all workplaces, would have seemed laughable. From the very beginning, its founders embraced the view that the value of its business hinged far more on the brainpower of its workers than on any particular lines of code it might own. ''Google is organized around the ability to attract and leverage the talent of exceptional technologists and business\u00adpeople,'' Larry Page, a founder, wrote in the company's 2004 I.P.O. prospectus. ''We will reward and treat them well.''</p><p>  To this end, the founders not only made Google one of the cushiest workplaces in corporate America, with its screening rooms, nap pods and mounds of free snacks. They also made it one of the most idealistic. ''Talented people are attracted to Google because we empower them to change the world,'' Page added in his letter. He was channeling a worldview with roots in the 1960s, when the engineers in Northern California's nascent computer industry imbibed the local consciousness-\u00adraising counterculture and emerged with a faith in the power of technology to save human\u00adkind. As so much of the world economy moved online and the company's profits soared, Google and the rest of Silicon Valley developed a reputation as the American dream factory, the place where the world's smartest young people wanted to be -- where technologists and business\u00adpeople could pull down staggering incomes while still believing that they were engaged in an act of altruism.</p><p>  But as the world they were remaking came into focus, many of those engineers had second thoughts. With social media swallowing up the public square, it was hard not to notice that Google and Facebook had become an advertising duopoly with an unsettling grip on the entire world's attention. And after the 2016 presidential election, the consequences of the social media revolution came to seem dystopian. Many engineers felt deeply anguished at the news that foreign governments had exploited their technology in an attempt to influence domestic politics. ''It showed that pretty much any system large enough and complex enough can be co-opted for nefarious purposes,'' Rivers said.</p><p>  Others became increasingly concerned that the Trump administration might now use their tools in service of policies they found immoral. Unknown to them, Google was at work on a project that would bring these anxieties right to their own work spaces. In September 2017, the company quietly entered into a contract to help the U.S. Department of Defense track people and vehicles in video footage captured by drones. During a meeting that December, Google presented initial results that showed its artifical-intelligence software was more successful than human data labelers at identifying vehicles, according to an internal Google document we reviewed. By February, the effort, known as Project Maven, was slotted into a launch calendar for soon-to-be-deployed products.</p><p>Google's involvement in the project remained under wraps within the company for months. But by February, rumors about it had seeped out beyond the small circle of engineers who were doing the work. Concerned employees began to search through code and documents and compile their findings. One activist, an engineer named Liz Fong-Jones, called attention to Project Maven in an internal blog post, according to other workers who saw it, and the circle of concern grew. Many of the engineers feared that the technology would be used to single out targets for killing. A growing number of workers concluded that the program was not in keeping with Google's values, and they wanted management to know about it. The discovery that their employer was working hand in hand with the Defense Department to bolster drone warfare ''was a watershed moment,'' said Meredith Whittaker, an A.I. researcher based in New York who led Google's Open Research Group. ''If they were able to do that without any internal backlash, dissent, we would have crossed a significant line.''</p><p>  Whittaker, along with some colleagues, drafted a letter petitioning management to cancel the program, which quickly amassed thousands of signatures after they published it internally. In April, company leaders also flew Whittaker to Google's headquarters in Mountain View for three back-to-back town-hall discussions about the A.I. project, which it broadcast to Google employees around the world.</p><p>  The discussions did not go well for the company. Whittaker's concerns that the technology would enable extrajudicial killings were met with platitudes, or worse. One participant, according to Whittaker and workers who watched, compared Google's technology to a hammer: something that could be used to harm or to build. Diane Greene, then the chief executive of Google's cloud business, said the government was essentially using the same off-the-shelf software any customer could buy, a claim that the activists believed to be false. Even Googlers sympathetic to the contract found the presentation lacking. Many workers cheered Whittaker on in a series of memes, including one -- echoing a popular meme about Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- with the words ''nevertheless she persisted'' superimposed on her photo.</p><p>  And her performance seemed to yield results. At an internal town hall in June 2018, Greene said Google would not seek to renew the contract, which internal emails showed could have been worth up to $250 million per year. (The Defense Department declined to comment on Project Maven's vendors or its military applications.) The about-face shocked many Google employees, even as it gave them a sense of their growing power. Greene soon stepped aside from her role leading the cloud business.</p><p>  Galvanized, the activists began to press further. They quickly honed a formula for pushing back on products they opposed: research the project using Google's internal search tools, compile the findings into a Google Doc, write a protest letter and gather co-worker signatures, debate the issue on Google Plus. Over the summer, another secret program, nicknamed Dragonfly, came to light in The Intercept. The project would censor search results in China on behalf of the Chinese government, and after months of internal protest, Google appeared to back away from that program too. During congressional testimony that December, the company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said he had ''no plans to launch a search service in China,'' though some activists worried it might yet return.</p><p>  Workers weren't just organizing to save the world from Google. They were also organizing to save themselves from Google, where those who didn't fit the mold of the straight, white, male techie felt they could be too easily marginalized or dismissed.</p><p>  The previous year, after a Google software engineer named James Damore circulated an essay he had written arguing that women were less suited biologically for careers in technology than men, a handful of Google employees pushed back with a memo of their own. ''We must remember that we are ultimately all affected by technology,'' they wrote, ''and that every one of us should have a voice in how it's built.''</p><p>  The eight authors of the memo were part of a growing group of workers who spent the next 15 months laying the groundwork for a wider counteroffensive. They knew that unionizing would be a tall order in an industry in which workers had long regarded unions suspiciously. They settled on a more modest plan: to quietly confer with colleagues about the workplace issues they most wanted to address.</p><p>  By 2018, the moment was ripe. That October, The New York Times revealed that the company had given Andy Rubin, a former executive, a $90 million exit package after an employee's sexual-misconduct complaint against him was deemed credible. (Rubin denied any wrongdoing and blamed a smear campaign for the allegations.) Amid the outrage that followed the revelation, Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager for YouTube, which Google bought in 2006, suggested that women walk out. Stapleton, who had not been involved in previous activism, thought the walkout would demonstrate that women are pivotal to Google's work force.</p><p>  A more seasoned activist, worried that not enough people would walk out, suggested that Stapleton give colleagues other ways of participating, like putting an out-of-office message on their inboxes. But Stapleton forged ahead, figuring the walkout would work if even a few hundred people showed up. The organizers took to their mailing lists to get the word out.</p><p>  The idea caught on swiftly, though, and on Nov. 1, some 20,000 Google employees around the world left their offices to protest the payout and other workplace frustrations. Critically for a tech company, it wasn't just well-paid engineers and product leads who turned up, but also clerical and maintenance workers. Many were contractors and temps determined to challenge their second-class status.</p><p>  Managers took notice. During a subsequent staff meeting, Google's vice president for human resources, Eileen Naughton, said the Rubin revelations had created a mess for the company. ''We're cleaning up after the circus elephants here,'' she said, going on to note that Rubin had left the company and that no payouts had been awarded to harassers since she had stepped into her role.</p><p>  Activists capitalized on the success. In San Francisco and New York, they coordinated weekly ''walkout lunches'' to keep their co-workers involved and mobilize against the next workplace outrage, whether it was a product that threatened humanity or a human-resources practice that threatened their livelihood. The more they talked, the more they realized their concerns had a common thread: Executives had too much power over the company, and they had too little. They wanted more. They organized chat groups on encrypted apps like Signal, with innocuous names like ''care package delivery'' so that they wouldn't be outed if a manager glimpsed their phones. They prepared tip sheets to help workers approach colleagues, in hopes of building a permanent organization.</p><p>  Some senior Google executives spoke approvingly about the walkout, but the company also made clear there were limits to its tolerance for worker protests.</p><p>  The approach had a rich pedigree in the tech sector. In 1990, Apple announced changes to a profit-sharing plan that sent employees to the company's internal message boards to vent their outrage. Apple soon backtracked. But when about 50 workers formed an organization called Employees for One Apple, which demanded more influence over company decisions, Apple's leadership granted only token concessions. The organization proved largely powerless, according to a paper by the researchers Libby Bishop and David Levine.</p><p>Alan Hyde, an expert on labor law at Rutgers Law School in Newark who has written extensively about the tech sector, said the pattern has repeated itself again and again in Silicon Valley: Management missteps, irate workers take to their mailing lists and message boards and leaders sometimes back down. ''Then it dissipates,'' he said. ''No permanent organizations form, no organization that can plan and act strategically.''</p><p>Google seemed to be following a similar playbook. Activists workshopped the questions they would ask at staff meetings to force executives to explain why they weren't responding to their walkout demands, which included a request for an employee representative on the board and an end to forced arbitration for all claims by employees.</p><p>Google would soon fold on arbitration. But it also announced that it would no longer take in-person questions at companywide meetings. Hereafter, all questions would have to be submitted through Dory, the company's digital question platform.</p><p>  The workers continued to agitate, with mixed results. In April 2019, Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president for global affairs and top lawyer, convened an external council to advise the company on its use of artificial intelligence. But workplace activists discovered that one appointee, the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kay Cole James, had made what some employees saw as anti-L.G.B.T.Q. and anti-immigrant comments. This generated a wave of embarrassing publicity and, just over one week after he announced the council, Walker pulled the plug.</p><p>  Soon the most troublesome activists began to disappear from the company. Whittaker, who had spoken out against James's appointment, had been close to finding a new home within the company after being told that her specialty, ethical questions relating to artificial intelligence, was no longer a priority for Google Cloud. Shortly after the council was disbanded, an official in the new group told her the transfer was dead. Her prospects for remaining at the company appeared to dim.</p><p>  Stapleton, for her part, said that managers took responsibilities and direct reports away from her and that an executive suggested she go on medical leave until the dispute blew over, even though she had no illness. ''When people are speaking up -- and they are because that's the Google way -- it's not good for your career,'' she said. Both women soon left the company. The company said that it changed the structure of Stapleton's team as part of a routine shift but did not demote her, and that Whittaker was asked to return to an earlier role and refused to do so. Whittaker said the specific role was not one she had held before and was effectively a demotion.</p><p>  It was around this time that Google appeared to be preparing for a more aggressive approach to confronting activists. In May, Walker sent out a companywide email informing workers that they could be disciplined or fired for accessing material that was supposed to be viewed by only those with a ''need to know.'' The email styled itself as a simple reminder about policy changes the company had recently made. (Subject line: ''An important reminder on data classifications.'')</p><p>  Many Googlers accepted the change as a natural shift for a company with increasingly high-profile and publicity-averse customers. A Google spokeswoman said that the underlying policy had been in place since 2007 but that the language is periodically updated to make it easier to understand and apply. And admirers and critics alike say Walker, who served as an assistant U.S. attorney before migrating to Big Tech, is evangelical about Google's power to do good, and that he has vastly expanded his reach over the rest of the organization.</p><p>  But other accounts put Walker's vision in a different light. Ross LaJeunesse, a top public-policy official at the company, had long been concerned that Google's cloud business was drawing the company into a web of relationships with repressive foreign governments and other questionable actors. ''It makes us an accessory if we are hosting their email systems or their data,'' he said in an interview. LaJeunesse, who left the company last year and is currently running for the U.S. Senate in Maine, took his concerns to Walker in 2017 and suggested creating a human rights program that would vet deals. But LaJeunesse said Walker repeatedly demurred, eventually responding that such a program would itself expose Google to legal liability. (Google denied the account. ''Google's commitment to human rights is unwavering,'' the spokeswoman said. ''While Ross had lobbied to have his group oversee human rights issues across our products, we felt it was more effective to have product and functional teams directly handle these issues.'')</p><p>  Now activists were particularly troubled by the vagueness of Walker's dictum: Sensitive material would not necessarily be labeled ''need to know.'' The onus would be on workers to determine whether they should look at it or not. ''In my orientation, I was encouraged to read all the design documents I could find, look at anything about how decisions are made,'' said Duke, the New York engineer. ''Now they're saying that's no longer OK. That is a major shift in culture.'' (The Google spokeswoman denies that a shift has occurred. ''Google has a rich history of employees' raising concerns and debating company decisions, but flagrant violation of our policy has never been part of our culture,'' she said.)</p><p>  To some activists, the policy shift appeared to be a recipe for a kind of digital entrapment, or worse. ''I said at the time that they intended to fire whoever finds the next Maven,'' said Irene Knapp, a Google engineer and activist who left the company in September.</p><p>  For six months after the 2018 walkout, Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had little to say to their workers. There was no mass email with their names on it, no sighting of them at gatherings of rank-and-file employees. Googlers were beginning to take notice. One popular internal meme, playing on the error message a web browser displays when a site won't load, joked, ''404 Page not found.''</p><p>  The founders suddenly materialized at a companywide meeting in May 2019. But it wasn't to reassert control over the company. According to multiple employees who tuned in, the two men made idle small talk with Pichai, the chief executive, about what they had been up to -- Page said he'd been working with Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, that focused on urban problems like housing; Brin said he'd been working with Wing, the company's delivery-drone subsidiary. They mostly ducked employees' questions, including one about whether the company had retaliated against Stapleton.</p><p>  The main presentation was from Thomas Kurian, the new head of the company's cloud division. Kurian spoke about how he planned to increase Google Cloud's revenue by competing with Microsoft and Amazon. The two rivals had a significant head start, but Kurian promised to catch up, rapidly. It was a message that Kurian, a longtime Oracle executive, had been pounding internally since he arrived at the company earlier in the year.</p><p>  ''He said we are a distant third in the cloud market,'' an engineer in the cloud department recalled, echoing other sources. ''If we don't make it to the top two, maybe we should not be in this market anymore.''</p><p>  Kurian focused on hiring more sales and customer-support personnel and made clear that he was eager to do business with the government. At one point, Whittaker recalled her manager's telling her that Kurian aspired to be ''everywhere Lockheed is.'' (Google said Kurian never made a direct comparison between Google's business and Lockheed Martin's defense work.) And in July, Kurian got an opportunity: Customs and Border Protection announced the first step toward bidding out a major information-technology contract.</p><p>  The idea of working with C.B.P. filled many Googlers with dread, and they began to circulate a petition urging executives to spurn the agency. ''The winning cloud provider will be streamlining C.B.P.'s infrastructure and facilitating its human rights abuses,'' the petition said. ''It's time to stand together again and state clearly that we will not work on any such contract.'' (The agency declined to comment for this article.)</p><p>  Rebecca Rivers quickly signed, then began to wonder: How deeply was Google already entangled with the agency? She turned to Moma, a company intranet that employees have used to find everything from cafeteria menus to design documents, and quickly unearthed emails referencing several projects sold through third-party vendors, including one contract for about $15,000 worth of Google Cloud services, a roughly $250,000 contract for a version of Google Chrome and a third contract for about $600,000 with Google Maps.</p><p>  Rivers had personally built features for Maps, including one that flagged recent changes to locations of interest. She thought it might have humanitarian uses, like locating refugees fleeing war or climate catastrophe, or could just help retailers pick the sites of new stores. ''The worst I thought it could be used for was making rich people more rich,'' she said. But it could be used by anyone, she later realized, including an agency that separated children from their parents. ''It was gut-wrenching,'' she said. ''It was the software I wrote that I was most proud of.'' Rivers said she passed the information to Sophie Waldman, a co-worker, who combined it with information she had found and disseminated it to other colleagues. Before long, many realized that they, too, had been unwittingly working on technology that could benefit the agency.</p><p>  The biggest uproar surrounded a project called Anthos, a program that allows customers to combine their existing cloud services and Google's. According to a report in Business Insider, internal documents showed that Google had given C.B.P. a trial of Anthos. Some engineers working on the project were enraged. They had been told that Anthos was intended for banks and other businesses. Workers took to internal mailing lists to express their outrage about the project.</p><p>  Kurian had previously said the cloud department had nothing to do with the ''Southern border,'' according to employees. Now he reiterated the point on one of the threads, adding that in any case, Anthos was just a trial.</p><p>  Many of the engineers were satisfied with Kurian's response. ''I wish we didn't do those things,'' the engineer in the cloud department said. ''If someone is going to do them, I don't trust Microsoft. At least we could have some oversight.''</p><p>Google officials insist that the decision to consider working with C.B.P. was not a statement about the company's values. ''Every experience I've had past or present, Google is a deeply values-driven, deeply mission-driven, deeply principled company,'' said Jennifer Fitzpatrick, a senior vice president at the company. ''But these are not areas where consensus is possible or even likely.'' She added: ''We do have to make decisions. We do have to move forward.''</p><p>  But to the activists, Kurian's explanation was nonsensical. There didn't seem to be anything in the contracts that restricted Google from contributing to work on the Southern border. The I.T. infrastructure Google was providing would support the agency's operations everywhere. And regardless of the merits of the contracts, there was the disturbing fact that the engineers working on them had been misled about the purpose of the technology they were creating. Some had decided to work on Anthos precisely because it did not appear to be destined for the national-security apparatus. ''If workers aren't told what the real purpose of their work is, they have no agency in deciding whether or not they want to help with those things,'' Berland said. ''They become unwittingly complicit.'' (Google declined to comment specifically on Anthos.)</p><p>  By last fall, workers and management appeared to be locked in a game of brinkmanship. The company tried to cancel a meeting about unions and labor rights that its Zurich employees had arranged with two union officials, but the employees disregarded messages from office leadership and held the meeting anyway.</p><p>  Around the same time, employees discovered that Google officials had been meeting with a firm called IRI Consultants since at least May. The firm has done work helping to defeat organizing campaigns at hospitals and other workplaces, in one case by instructing managers to play up the history of Mafia influence on organized labor. (IRI did not return calls seeking comment.) Google also brought on a former assistant U.S. attorney with expertise prosecuting white-collar crime, Stephen C. King, as a top internal security official, in addition to a former Colorado police officer it hired earlier in the year.</p><p>  It was during this time that the practical effect of the need-to-know policy began coming into focus. In September, the internal security team interviewed a handful of employees who had been involved in circulating the petition asking Google not to work with Customs and Border Protection and in unearthing the documents showing that Google already was.</p><p>  According to Rivers, who was among those interviewed, one investigator asked how she found the documents and whom she shared them with, a potentially legitimate line of questioning in light of the new policy. But, she said, he seemed more interested in what she knew about how the petition was planned. ''It was about how we're organizing,'' Rivers recalled. ''How many people there were, the methods we used to meet.'' (Google said that policy violations were the focus of the interview and that it appropriately conducted the investigations, giving individuals a chance to explain their actions.)</p><p>  Rivers and the other employees interviewed believed that the questions about the documents were a pretext for trying to restrict their organizing. She and some of the others considered filing a charge with the National Labor Relations Board, but they worried that this would put them further at risk. ''We were all terrified of retaliation,'' Rivers said. ''The second we file, we put a big target on our back.''</p><p>  She had another reason to worry: She was not yet public about her transition and worried that the company would out her. ''I was extremely afraid,'' she said. ''I feared any investigation would reveal communication that used my new name, Rebecca Rivers, rather than my dead name.''</p><p>  Then in \u00adNovember, Rivers and Berland were abruptly put on administrative leave. Rivers turned up at work one morning and realized her security badge didn't work. ''I called the badging office, and they didn't know; they reactivated me,'' she said. ''It was a very rushed turn of events.''</p><p>  When Rivers and Berland were interviewed soon after, Rivers for the second time, they were asked about material they had accessed, but investigators once again spent much of the interviews on other topics. An investigator asked Rivers a series of questions about her role in the anti-C.B.P. activism, including her social media commentary. ''He was just fishing for more information related to C.B.P.,'' she said.</p><p>  According to Berland, investigators asked him about his subscription to the calendars of several senior Google employees who had met with IRI Consultants. They asked if he planned to show up unannounced to any of the meetings, which made no sense to him. ''I honestly couldn't believe they seriously suggested that,'' he said. ''Until they asked, it hadn't even occurred to me. Why would I do that?'' He said he had subscribed to the calendars, which were open to any employee, because he worried the consultants might be helping the company curtail labor rights.</p><p>  Within Google, the suspensions generated angst, and even nonactivists began to wonder if the company was overreacting. On Nov. 12, Walker posted an internal note defending the move. He said, apparently alluding to Rivers, that one employee had deliberately ''searched for, accessed and shared a number of confidential or need-to-know documents outside the scope of their job'' and that another employee's calendar-tracking had caused ''a lot of stress for people who are just trying to go about their work.''</p><p>  ''We have the potential to develop incredible products and services that can help billions of people around the world,'' he added, but ''we can't let internal wrangling get in the way of that mission.''</p><p>Google fired the four activists on the Monday before Thanksgiving. In an internal memo that soon leaked to the press, the company said the workers were involved in ''systematic'' searches for material ''outside the scope of their jobs.'' It also cited an employee's efforts to track information on the calendars of colleagues ''outside of their work group.'' And it said that information the employees accessed made its way outside the company -- a suggestion that they had abetted leaking at a company where even rank-and-file workers regard leaks as a form of betrayal.</p><p>  The company later said the workers had accessed need-to-know documents, only some of which were labeled such. All four workers said they were unaware of having inappropriately accessed documents labeled need-to-know, and none were ever accused of directly leaking information. When asked, Google could not point to a specific rule that forbade accessing material on colleagues' open calendars or setting up calendar notifications. Laurie Burgess, a lawyer representing the workers, said that they had done what Googlers have traditionally been encouraged to do and that the firing was intended to chill employee activism. ''They picked on people all over the country -- they fired them at the same time,'' Burgess said. ''It's sort of giving a lesson to employees everywhere that you could be next.''</p><p>  Among activists, the reaction was sheer terror. ''The folks whose names are on the bottom of the petitions were checking their bank accounts,'' said Colby Jordan, a sometime activist based in Seattle who left the company in January. .'If I don't have a job, how's this going to work for me?.'' But the firings did appear to mobilize hundreds if not thousands of Googlers who had previously stood on the sidelines. An activist said one city's weekly lunch, which usually attracted about 100 people, had doubled in size the week after the firings, and an additional meeting on the topic drew 300 people. ''It's a very short-term play,'' Jordan said. ''When a company is its workers -- a fact that's true in tech in particular -- you can't beat them into submission.''</p><p>  The more aggressive reaction by the company also began to convince many activists that only a formal union could protect them. Bruce Hahne, a project manager who left Google in February after 14 years, said the crackdown with the Zurich team was a galvanizing moment that created a backlash and drove employees to say: ''Let's learn more about this labor union stuff. What is it that they're trying to suppress?''</p><p>  Some Google workers had previously reached out to unions, but the idea was met with little enthusiasm from their colleagues. The success of any worker organization at Google would depend on the number of workers it could mobilize, they said, so why not focus on that? For a while, one popular idea was a so-called solidarity union -- a union that didn't seek certification under federal labor law. Unlike a formally certified union, creating a solidarity union wouldn't depend on winning a majority of employees in a secret-ballot election, which at Google could theoretically require winning tens of thousands of votes.</p><p>  But since the firings, Google workers have begun softening on organized labor. ''I have felt comfortable within some of the email lists I have posted to, to say here is some labor news or some union news,'' Hahne said. ''You can say that and not have 20 people jump into the thread telling anti-union stories.''</p><p>  Some workers have reached out to the Office and Professional Employees International Union, which represents white-collar workers like nurses, podiatrists, clerical staff and university staff, and the Communications Workers of America, which represents telephone-company workers, airline workers and many journalists. ''We at C.W.A. are happy to be a resource to folks who are looking for resources to support them,'' said Tom Smith, the union's organizing director. ''We want to be known as a place folks can turn.''</p><p>  Beyond the cultural hurdles of trying to bring traditional unions to an industry in which they have been largely absent, the effort would face significant procedural hurdles as well, not least of which is simply determining who would be eligible to join. Some union proponents, taking note of a group of about 80 Google contract workers from Pittsburgh who had unionized in September, have begun to sketch out plans to circumvent the logistical challenges of unionizing by proceeding office by office, job function by job function.</p><p>  A young security engineer named Kathryn Spiers epitomized the recent shift in thinking. She had once believed that Google was too large and too scattered geographically to unionize all at once. But over drinks with co-workers to celebrate her 21st birthday, she began to wonder: What if their team of about 100 workers unionized on its own? The conversation sparked interest among her co-workers. ''I ended up having to put an F.A.Q. doc together because every conversation had the same few questions, mostly around: Why do well-paid, well-benefited engineers need this? Will this result in more administrative overhead with no real benefit?'' she said. ''A union will make it easier, especially for security, to stand up when they think what they're being asked to build is wrong.''</p><p>  Spiers had not hid her organizing conversations from her managers, frequently chatting with co-workers in their open office space. The ax fell shortly after she created a notification reminding co-workers of their right to participate in protected activities like organizing when they visited the website of IRI Consultants or an internal site about company guidelines. Co-workers could see the notification only if they were using Google-managed devices within the corporate network. ''I can't imagine something more clearly protected,'' said Burgess, who is now representing Spiers.</p><p>  Spiers said she was told only that she violated several policies, but not the specific infractions. (The Google spokeswoman said the notification had been created by misusing internal tools and that the message per se was not an issue.)</p><p>  In January, hundreds of workers at Amazon began to defy a corporate-communications policy by publishing quotes critical of the company's business practices. Many in the tech industry saw the protest as part of a wave that had radiated out from Google. ''Google's walkout was huge for us,'' said Weston Fribley, an Amazon software engineer involved in climate protests there. ''It really expanded our imagination about what was possible.''</p><p>  Even after the events of the past year, it's hard to say whether Google's reputation has been meaningfully tarnished within the broader pool of talented, idealistic engineers it hopes to recruit and retain. After all, it just has to look more ethical and worker-friendly than its rivals, all of which are confronting controversies of their own. As if to hammer home that fact, the day after the Amazon workers' protest began, a Google recruiter praised the Amazon activists in a LinkedIn post, flagged by Vice. He urged them to consider coming to Google, where they could better live out their values. The post, which soon disappeared, seemed both strangely oblivious to the labor turmoil in Mountain View and inadvertently revealing about the calculations that linger over it. (Google said the recruiter was acting on his own initiative.)</p><p>  If Google continues to set the curve in the competition to be the most righteous tech employer, then it may feel it can keep cracking down. ''There are a small number of firms that could possibly absorb the vast majority of people hired here,'' one Google activist said. ''It's like: 'Go ahead, work for Bezos. Or work for Sales\u00adforce. They have a charismatic liberal founder who also works with ICE.'''</p><p>  On the other hand, the risk of irreparably damaging the company's worker-swaddling reputation almost certainly constrains Google management, which presumably wants to stop the discontent from leaching further into its work force, to say nothing of the popular consciousness. The shift to a more heavy-handed approach also creates the possibility of a costly overreach. ''As recently as six months ago, I thought I'd seen this movie before,'' said Hyde, the labor law expert at Rutgers Law School. ''Then, for reasons I don't know but would love to know, the ball seems to have been passed to idiots who seem to be doing everything possible to bring about what their predecessors were able to avoid.''</p><p>  Perhaps this concern was why, two months after the company announced it was turning the weekly T.G.I.F. ritual into a monthly meeting restricted to a narrow set of questions, Pichai told workers he was reconsidering. At a staff meeting in January, he said that he had heard from many Googlers that T.G.I.F. was important to them and that he would look into finding a way to preserve the original free-for-all concept, according to two people who watched. (Google said it now allows a few off-topic questions at the end of each session.) In mid-February, Google also announced that Naughton, its longtime head of human resources, would leave her position for another role at the company later this year.</p><p>  The activists are still pushing. In the most recent annual employee survey, many say they vented their frustration over the company's need-to-know policy, whose enforcement Walker recently referred to at a meeting as ''common sense.'' There is also the matter of the five workers Google recently fired. In December, the C.W.A. filed charges on their behalf with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of retaliating over their workplace activism. The agency will decide whether to issue complaints, which are akin to indictments, and could eventually reinstate them.</p><p>  If that happens -- and Hyde said that redressing illegal firings is one of the few areas of labor law that workers can still leverage, even with a hostile company and the current administration in Washington -- it would deal a blow to the narrative Google has labored to create internally. Rather than viewing their fired colleagues as rogue agents intent on sabotaging the company, many Googlers who currently accept the company's good faith may begin to question its motives.</p><p>  And then there is the Customs and Border Protection relationship. It's unclear when the agency will formally open the bidding on the contract that it indicated in July would be forthcoming. But if the company submits a proposal, the activists will have vulnerabilities to exploit. Not least is Kurian's remark that the infrastructure would not support the agency's work on the Mexican border, a claim that even some nonactivists consider dubious.</p><p>  In the meantime, the surviving Google activists lurch between gallows humor and defiance. With every rumor of a retaliatory firing, dozens of Googlers steel themselves emotionally for what they expect will be the end of the line. But they also believe that there are structural forces propelling their activism forward. ''Locally pessimistic, globally optimistic,'' was how one put it, descending into engineering speak.</p><p>  Mar Hicks, a labor historian and author of the book ''Programmed Inequality,'' said there were in fact reasons to believe that the Google activists could succeed at building a lasting worker movement. For one thing, they said, today's tech workers, unlike earlier generations, have built coalitions beyond the walls of their own company, making it more difficult for employers to isolate them. They have forged alliances across class and job categories, and they situate themselves within a larger political and cultural reaction to the extreme inequality that the tech industry has come to epitomize.</p><p>  The uprising also comes at a moment of unprecedented scrutiny of technology in the political realm and in the media, which dovetails with the workers' own anxieties about how the company monetizes their work. ''The potential for top-down regulatory action at the same time that we're having a large groundswell from the bottom \u00adup of labor activism,'' Hicks said, ''puts us in a somewhat different place than earlier moments.''</p><p>  Yet even these developments can't quite explain the workers' audacious -- some might say Googley -- sense of confidence. While they recognize their mission to be a moonshot, they may simply be that rare class of worker used to engineering moon landings. ''Management can decide whether or not to get on board,'' Berland said. ''But Google workers are increasingly aware of the power they have. They're going to continue to exercise that power, and in the end, they're going to prevail.''</p><p>  The Great Google RevoltHow to Work the System at WorkBreaking the Salary Sharing TabooHow to Make Billions in E-SportsWhy Are Workers Struggling?

The inside story of how one company, Cambridge Analytica, misused intimate personal Facebook data to micro-target and manipulate swing voters in the US election, is compellingly told in \u201cThe Great Hack\u201d, a new documentary out today.</p><p>But as the former CEO of the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica tells the film-makers, this is \u201cnot just about one company\u201d. The film goes further to open our eyes to the way our lives are constantly monitored - and controlled - through digital technology. And it goes to the heart of how far the entire business model of some Big Tech companies may be deeply threatening our human rights.</p><p>In the online and digital world, everything you do leaves a trace of \u201cdata exhaust\u201d \u2013 a record of everything, from what time you put petrol in your car, to what websites you visited. When combined, even seemingly innocuous data points can reveal a LOT about a person.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica bragged that it had up to 5000 data points on every US voter. By applying \u201cpsychographic\u201d analytics to its dataset, it claimed to be able to determine people\u2019s personality type and then individually micro-target messages to influence their behaviour. The most important source of the data was Facebook. Via a third-party app, Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles \u2013 including status updates, likes and even private messages.</p><p>But the incident was not an aberration: it was an inevitable consequence of a system founded on harvesting and monetising our information - the business model that academic Shoshana Zuboff dubs \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. The model\u2019s fundamental characteristics are: aggregating vast amounts of data on people, using it to infer incredibly detailed profiles on their lives and behaviour, and monetising it by selling these predictions to others such as advertisers. Cambridge Analytica simply deployed the same basic model to target voters rather than consumers.</p><p>This model has become core to the data economy, and underpins a complex ecosystem of tech companies, data brokers, advertisers and beyond. But it is the model\u2019s pioneers Google and Facebook that have unparalleled access to tracking and monetising our lives, by controlling the primary gateways \u2013 outside China \u2013 to the online world (between them Google Search, Chrome, Android, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp).</p><p>Facebook and Google of course have long affirmed their commitment to respecting human rights. But increasingly, we are being forced to ask whether the internet\u2019s surveillance model itself inherently conflicts with our human rights.</p><p>Facebook and Google have amassed data vaults with an unprecedented volume of information on human beings. This goes far beyond the data that you choose to share on their platforms to include the vast amounts of data tracked as you engage with the digital world. Mass corporate surveillance on such a scale threatens the very essence of the right to privacy. Indeed, in 2010, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg famously admitted that social networking had already changed privacy as a \u201csocial norm\u201d.</p><p>But harvesting the data is only the first part of the story. The next step is using sophisticated analytics powered by machine learning to profile people \u2013 and thereby influence their behaviour. In the furore over Cambridge Analytica, Facebook\u2019s own profiling practices largely escaped scrutiny. The company has explored personality profiling, how to manipulate emotions, and target people based on psychological vulnerabilities such as when they felt \u201cworthless\u201d or \u201cinsecure\u201d. Google developed a tool to target ads so precisely that they can sway people\u2019s beliefs and change behaviour through \u201csocial engineering\u201d \u2013 while initially developed to counter Islamic extremism, the tool is publicly available for anyone to (mis)use.</p><p>One of the most urgent and uncomfortable questions raised in The Great Hack is: to what extent are we susceptible to such behavioural manipulation? Ultimately, if these capabilities are as powerful as the companies and their customers claim, they pose a real threat to our ability to make our own autonomous decisions or even our right to opinion, undermining the fundamental value of dignity that underpin all human rights. Advertising and propaganda aren\u2019t new, but there is no precedent for targeting individuals in such intimate depth, and at the scale of whole populations.</p><p>The model may also be helping to fuel discrimination. Companies \u2013 and governments \u2013 could easily abuse data analytics to target people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. The push to grab users\u2019 attention and to keep them on platforms can also encourage the current toxic trend towards the politics of demonization. People are more likely to click on sensationalist or incendiary material, meaning platforms systematically privilege conspiracy theories, misogyny, and racism.</p><p>What is to be done? The data-driven business model presents a systemic and structural issue that will not be easy to address and requires a mix of political and regulatory solutions. Stronger data protection is certainly part of the answer: properly enforcing Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which has international reach, and using it as a model in other countries, would mitigate the extent of data-mining and profiling.</p><p>More radical calls to break up the Big Tech companies have now become commonplace, and the industry is already being examined by competition authorities in various jurisdictions. A recent decision by Germany\u2019s Federal Cartel Office to limit data sharing and aggregation between Facebook and WhatsApp is an example of a precise measure to counter the concentration of power towards the big players.</p><p>Whatever regulatory tools are deployed, it is vital that they are grounded in an analysis of the human rights risks posed by the model. Human rights provide the only international, legally binding framework that can capture the multi-faceted ways in which the business model is impacting our lives and what it means to be human \u2013 and hold the companies to account.</p><p>What is clear is that current efforts are not tackling the root causes of the problem. Two weeks ago, US regulators approved a record $5bn settlement against Facebook over Cambridge Analytica. But after news of the fine broke, Facebook\u2019s share price went UP.</p><p>The lesson: the company and its investors would be happy for this to remain an isolated incident. It will pay some relatively nominal fines - $5bn is a drop in the ocean for a company that makes $22bn in pure profit a year \u2013 and make a few improvements to their privacy protections, but then go back to business as usual.</p><p>We cannot let this happen. It is high time to confront the human rights impacts of \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d itself.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2232261I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNC-K1X1-F0YC-N2XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1161\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That's the most charitable way to describe the unwitting technical mining of our personal data, and the manipulation of it in order to change our behavior, that's turned into one of the most pressing issues of modern times. Since it's facilitated the rise in authoritarianism across the globe, it can't be explained enough, or fought back against too strongly. With the new documentary 'The Great Hack,' there's now a sufficiently paranoid primer at hand to keep you questioning just what happens every time you engage with the world digitally, and why you should care about holding big tech accountable for their breaches of trust. </p><p>Directors Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim focus primarily on the scandal involving Facebook and now-bankrupt Cambridge Analytica, the sinisterly ambitious data firm funded by Republican moneyman Robert Mercer, which notoriously harvested the personal information of over 50 million of the social media giant's users in order to sway the 2016 presidential election and the Brexit vote with individually-targeted propaganda. Watch Video: How 'The Great Hack' Evolved From the 'Sony Hack Film' Into a Story of Algorithms Running Our Lives[1] This full-throttle effort to upend democracy had to have been a sobering topic for the pair to dive into considering their last film, the Oscar-nominated 'The Square,' memorably spotlit the positive impact Mark Zuckerberg's outsized baby had as a mobilizing tool during the tumult and triumph of the Arab Spring. But while good stories about the ubiquity of technology in our lives are surely around the corner once more, 'The Great Hack' convincingly stands out as a call to be vigilant about ferreting out the bad actors, regulating the behemoths, and putting an end to the weaponization of our data. One of the movie's main characters on the frontlines to make data rights a human rights movement is digital media professor David Carroll. He narrates the filmmakers' thesis-like opening about how our online love went so horribly wrong ('It began with the dream of a connected world '), and his lawsuit in the UK against Cambridge Analytica \u2014 in an effort to retrieve their illegally coopted data profile of him \u2014 is an ongoing storyline. One of the chillier things we learn is that Cambridge boasted having profiles of every American voter, to an accuracy of 5,000 data points. We also meet intrepid British journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose near-obsessive investigative work on Cambridge Analytica for The Guardian and The Observer has been instrumental in revealing to the public the dark arts going on behind the lax acquisition and political repurposing of our likes, purchases, and fears. Also Read: Facebook Sued by DC Attorney General for Cambridge Analytica Privacy Violations[2] But the filmmakers were also diligent enough to find a key voice from inside the swamp: a young American woman and former Cambridge business development head named Brittany Kaiser, who becomes the film's central dramatic figure after she's discovered in Thailand laying low in the wake of the scandal. A onetime idealistic Obama 2008 digital campaigner drawn to Cambridge's 2016 election work by the allure of power and money \u2014 she drew up the contract for the company's Trump campaign work \u2014 Kaiser turns whistleblower. One could argue this turnabout was a conveniently face-saving tactic; her turn comes in the wake of the lid-busting reporting and negative publicity. As we watch Kaiser prep for testimony in front of a fact-finding committee of British MPs, her nervous narrative compels as a redemptive tale, especially when she scoffs at her former boss Alexander Nix's public obfuscations and lies on television. (Kaiser offered proof Cambridge was involved in the LeaveEU campaign.) But there's just enough of the mercurial to her demeanor \u2014 alternatively wry, rueful, self-satisfied, and combative \u2014 that it's unclear how much we should still trust her. Also Read: Trump's 2020 Campaign 'Secretly Working' With Ex-Cambridge Analytica Staffers (Report)[3] Kaiser's story is like many of this saga's pieces: We sense there's a lot more left to be uncovered, if at the very least because even with Cambridge Analytica a defunct entity, their tactics for targeting voters are still out there, waiting to be deployed by other troublesome alliances between an anything-to-win campaign and an anything-for-money data outfit. And right now there's little sense that lawmaking is ready to leap into the fray to protect free and fair elections from these types of attacks. As eye-opening and propulsive as the movie is, Amer and Noujaim don't always keep the thread of their multi-faceted narrative, which was going to be a daunting task for any well-meaning filmmaker trying to give you arresting personalities while parsing complex aspects of the digital world. But 'The Great Hack,' with its simple but effective visual metaphor for the traces we leave in our daily lives \u2014 pixels released into the air with every card swipe and touchscreen tap \u2014 is as essential an explainer as we could get right now, with 2020 around the corner, about the hidden efforts to make who we are into what the powerful need us to be.

The film has been hailed as \"required viewing for every American citizen\" at a seminal moment in a critical conversation around data privacy.</p><p>\"This film is an important step in bringing to light - and raising awareness about - the grave dangers faced by big data, big tech and disinformation,\" said Damian Collins, MP. \"I look forward to working with colleagues in the United States and around the world to combat these threats and safeguard elections.\"</p><p>The discussion that followed the film viewing examined the vulnerabilities and remedies for one of the most complex and pressing issues facing lawmakers, technologists and citizens: what is at stake for society now that data has surpassed oil as the world's most valuable asset?</p><p>Panelist Shoshana Zuboff, author of \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" defined personal data as a collection of recordable, human behavior and explored what it means to have built an entire economic system based on data, and what 21st century solutions to this issue look like.</p><p>\"Surveillance capitalism starts with claiming human experience as free raw material,\" explained Zuboff. \"We need to reclaim human experience as an interface where we have decision rights. Not everything should be data. And once we start talking about data ownership, data accessibility, even privacy, we've sort of let the ship sail. We need to get back to the beginning.\"</p><p>Karen Kornbluh, director at the Digital Innovation &amp; Democracy Initiative of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, is a self-proclaimed \"internet optimist,\" and has been working in this field since the earliest days of the internet. As part of the panel, she discussed what kinds of structural changes are needed to protect democracy in the age of the internet, including new privacy laws that go beyond notice and consent, creating true transparency online and solving systemic problems that battle misinformation and hacking.</p><p>\"I've been suggesting that we need a new agency and to give the FTC more resources,\" said Kornbluh. \"The main problem is the FTC is focused on you as a consumer, and markets and making them function. This is a problem for democracy, for you as a citizen, and for our overall information ecosystem, which is important it is secure for our democracies. We don't have an agency focused on that.\"</p><p>Emerson T. Brooking, fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council and co-author of \"LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media,\" rounded out the panel, where he spoke about what micro-targeting and personal data will look like in the near future.</p><p>\"The issue of influence campaigns and these psychologically targeted campaigns via social media is not going to go away,\" said Brooking. \"[Players in this field] are continuing to evolve and develop ever more sophisticated tactics. It's going to be an endless arms race, and eventually, as they get more and more sophisticated, they will be better equipped to target audiences here in the states.\"</p><p>Zuboff went on to explain that although surveillance capitalism is the new frontier of capitalism, a regulatory paradigm is possible.</p><p>\"Who will be the next leaders and framers of the new regulatory paradigm?\" asked Zuboff. \"The answer comes from democracy. Because surveillance capitalism and its consequences are on a collision course with democracy, it will be warriors for democracy, lawmakers, citizens and specialists who will be the framers of the next regulatory paradigm. Everything has to double down on democracy because it is the only thing that stands between us and the chaos that these artists have so brilliantly depicted in The Great Hack.\"</p><p>Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), who has called on the social media companies to work with Congress and provide feedback on ideas he put forward in a white paper discussing potential policy solutions to challenges surrounding social media, privacy, and data security, introduced the event at the Congressional Auditorium. He framed the conversation by stating:</p><p>\"Often times without our knowledge, we are giving up on a daily basis literally huge reams of data to companies that can then take, manipulate, use and often times misuse in ways that are unprecedented.\"</p><p>About the film</p><p>Data has surpassed oil as the world's most valuable asset. It's being weaponized to wage cultural and political warfare. People everywhere are in a battle for control of our most intimate personal details. From award-winning filmmakers Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim, THE GREAT HACK uncovers the dark world of data exploitation with astounding access to the personal journeys of key players on different sides of the explosive Cambridge Analytica/Facebook data scandal.</p><p>View source version on businesswire.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190726005377/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190726005377/en/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Media Contacts<br/>Staley White<br/>Point PR<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:staleywhitePR@gmail.com\">staleywhitePR@gmail.com</email><br/>801-885-3696<br/><br/>Jessica Hutchison<br/>Point PR<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jessicashutchison@gmail.com\">jessicashutchison@gmail.com</email><br/>801-641-0085</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BWIRE-20190726005377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNJ-9S71-JBG1-82N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7924</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><timeReceived>3:53 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Wire, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Business Wire</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businesswire.com\">http://www.businesswire.com</url><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The paperwork doesn't break out which funds were buying or selling different stocks. It does offer a rare window into current tastes at the firm, whose tech- and telecom-heavy funds rode the Nasdaq bubble up to thin-air returns in 1999 but have since cratered.<br/>If we look at Janus' 20 largest tech and telecom positions at the end of the first quarter, we find that Janus managers sold shares nearly across the board. The biggest casualties were networker Cisco, server maker Sun Microsystems(SUNW:Nasdaq) and chip shop Vitesse (VTSS:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>The scope of Janus' selling explains some of the tech sector's woes in recent quarters. But because they still own massive stakes in several tech companies, continued selling or redemptions from burned Janus fund shareholders could add up to another lethal dose of selling pressure for the already beleaguered sector.\u00a0</p><p>Cisco -- still a core holding with many stock funds and Janus' third-largest holding at the start of this year -- is clearly unloved. At the end of the first quarter, Janus funds owned more than 107 million shares, but they hacked that down to 41 million by the end of June. At the same time, their Sun Microsystems share balance fell from 67 million to 18 million, while the Vitesse stake dropped from 23 million shares to 14 million.\u00a0</p><p>Among Janus' 20 favorite U.S.-traded tech and telecom stocks on March 31, fund managers raised their positions in only four stocks during the next 90 days: software titan Microsoft(MSFT:), chipmakers Linear Technology (LLTC:Nasdaq) and Maxim Integrated Products(MXIM:Nasdaq), and contract manufacturer Flextronics(FLEX:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>Aside from its aggressive selling, the firm's appetite for Microsoft's shares was remarkable. On March 31, Janus funds owned about 7 million shares, but that rocketed up to almost 25 million by June 30, according to the filing. Mister Softee's shares have been a port in the storm over the past year, falling just 11% compared with the Nasdaq's 48% free fall.\u00a0</p><p>Janus managers also stuck by longtime favorites like AOL Time Warner (AOL:NYSE) and Finnish wireless outfit Nokia(NOK:NYSE ADR). While they did modestly reduce their holdings in these stocks, Janus funds still have more than $17 billion tied up in the two. That's more than 12% of the firm's $141 billion stock portfolio outlined in the filing.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"608\"><tgroup cols=\"4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"2\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"3\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"4\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"5\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">Tech?

Janus managers raised their Citigroup(C:NYSE) share balance from 48 million to 61 million in the second quarter. And on June 30 they owned 35 million shares of Merrill Lynch(MER:NYSE), up from 29 million on March 31. They also hung on to big positions like Goldman Sachs(GS:NYSE) and Bank of New York(BK:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>In health care the share balance in pharmaceutical giant Pfizer(PFE:NYSE) jumped from 42 million to 61 million. They also raised their stake in hospital operator Tenet Healthcare (THC:NYSE) from 17 million shares to 23 million.\u00a0</p><p>Beyond the top-20 tech and telecom faves, there was more selling in the second quarter. The funds' stake in Web-hoster Exodus, down 97% over the past 12 months, fell from more than 60 million shares on March 31 to just 71,000 shares on June 30.\u00a0</p><p>And networkers beyond Cisco were on the outs. On March 31, Janus funds owned 19 million shares of JDS Uniphase(JDSU:Nasdaq); they sold almost 17 million of those shares in the second quarter. At the same time, the firm's Juniper Networks(JNPR:Nasdaq) share balance dropped from 10 million to 5.5 million. Over the past year, the two stocks are down 92% and 86%, respectively.\u00a0</p><p>In another intriguing twist, WebMD(HLTH:Nasdaq) isn't listed in the filing. In January of last year, Janus bought 15 million shares directly from the company. On March 31 there were 11 million shares in the funds' coffers, but the position isn't listed in Tuesday's filing. In last year's private purchase, Janus paid $62 for each share; the stock was recently trading at $5.14.\u00a0</p><p>It's easy to see why Janus managers are shifting gears, but the funds' shareholders probably wish they'd done so sooner. The funds' big tech appetite has led to big losses over the past year. In 1999, Janus' diversified, direct-sold stock funds averaged a 74% gain, trouncing the S&amp;P 500's 21% rise. But over the past 12 months, the funds average more than a 30% loss, and the vast majority are trailing their peers.\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0(Chart Omitted)\u00a0</p><p>Funds like Janus Twenty and Janus Enterprise rode tech picks to heady gains in the past, but they're are down 47% and 55%, respectively, over the past year, compared with a 19.5% fall for the S&amp;P 500.\u00a0</p><p>Thanks to their moves away from tech so far this year, the firm's current top-10 holdings aren't as tech heavy as its funds' top picks were a year ago. Unless things look up for tech stocks, that trend may continue.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"624\"><tgroup cols=\"4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"6\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"7\" colwidth=\"216\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"8\" colwidth=\"216\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"9\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">Janus' Top 10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Percentage of Holdings on June 30</entry><entry>Percentage of Holdings on March 31</entry><entry>1-Year Return</entry></row><row><entry>AOL Time Warner</entry><entry>8.9%</entry><entry>7.2%</entry><entry>-23.0</entry></row><row><entry>General Electric</entry><entry>4.0</entry><entry>3.3</entry><entry>-26.0</entry></row><row><entry>Nokia</entry><entry>3.6</entry><entry>3.4</entry><entry>-53.0</entry></row><row><entry>Comcast</entry><entry>3.1</entry><entry>2.4</entry><entry>12.2</entry></row><row><entry>Viacom</entry><entry>3.1</entry><entry>2.8</entry><entry>-34.0</entry></row><row><entry>Citigroup</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>1.6</entry><entry>-10.0</entry></row><row><entry>Boeing</entry><entry>1.9</entry><entry>1.9</entry><entry>13.0</entry></row><row><entry>Tyco</entry><entry>1.9</entry><entry>1.6</entry><entry>-3.4</entry></row><row><entry>Pfizer</entry><entry>1.7</entry><entry>1.1</entry><entry>-4.2</entry></row><row><entry>Enron</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>1.5</entry><entry>-46.4</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">Source: 10kWizard.com and Morningstar.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#1518943#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:43S6-BYM0-00MP-T2K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2001 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>August 15, 2001 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0JANUS CAPITAL GROUP INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>\u00a0AOL INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0MERRILL LYNCH &amp;
