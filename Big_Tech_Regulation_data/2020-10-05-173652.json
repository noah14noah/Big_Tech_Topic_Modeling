But the colours aren't on the blackboard. They are lighting up on the kids' foreheads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The children are part of a trial, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3005448/brainwave-tracking-start-china-schoolchildren-controversy-working\">reported earlier this year</url>, in which each is fitted with a brainwave-reading headset, made by Boston-based startup BrainCo, that measures how focused they are on their school work. A small light on the device tells the teacher if those young minds are straying. Blue means relaxed, yellow means focused and red means very focused.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neat. And maybe the headband, which is called Focus 1, is a useful teaching tool. But the experiment also has a darker side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BrainCo has said it aims to \"build the world's largest brainwave database\", a claim that has some neuroscientists worried. Their fears centre on a tsunami of research that is delving deep into people's minds and get ever closer to knowing what they are feeling - and even thinking.</p><p>It is science that threatens what is perhaps the last frontier of privacy: our minds.</p><p>In July, tech guru Elon Musk announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/elon-musk-building-braincomputer-interface-to-protect-against-ai-singularity-20170501-gvw4n1.html\">his company Neuralink</url> had built a tiny Bluetooth-enabled brain chip that he hopes will be trialled next year in people with paralysis, to let them control a computer cursor with their thoughts.</p><p>Musk's implant consists of thousands of flexible thread-like electrodes that are inserted, robotically, via a small incision in the skull into the outer layer of the brain. It's called a brain-computer interface and harvests the same electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals as the Chinese kids' headsets, albeit with much greater resolution.</p><p>The tech could be life-changing, but it's also been racking up serious cachet in brain-reading circles.</p><p>It has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25803\">used to detect words</url>, such as \"cowboys\" and \"swimming\", that people are merely thinking about, just from their brainwaves. And last year a group led by Edward Chang at the University of California San Francisco used a related implant to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200\">detect people's mood states</url>.</p><p>Then in July, another group from Chang's lab <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">deciphered people's answers</url>, and the questions they were responding to, just from EEG signals.</p><p>That work merits special attention because it was funded by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in a recent interview that he is pushing ahead with plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-telepathy-is-the-future-heres-how-it-could-actually-work-20150702-gi34sc.html\">to develop a brain-machine interface</url> that will, one day, let users don a headset to type posts with their thoughts.</p><p>Given Facebook's questionable record on privacy, you could be forgiven for wondering if that's a good thing; new doco The Great Hack gives chilling insight into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-tries-to-move-on-but-cambridge-analytica-won-t-go-away-20180704-p4zpic.html\">the Cambridge Analytica breach</url> that exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>In particular, one big privacy implication of any Facebook brain-to-text device was nailed by the man questioning Zuckerberg in that interview, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain.</p><p>\"The Fifth Amendment implications are staggering,\" Zittrain said.</p><p>An all-seeing brain-computer interface could indeed render the right to remain silent - enshrined in the US Constitution - a historical curiosity.</p><p>If all that tech is backing privacy into a corner, it's also getting pushback from some heavy hitters.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a professor of neuroscience at New York's Columbia University, led the team that inspired Barack Obama in 2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/obama-offers-100m-to-map-human-brain-20130403-2h70w.html\">to launch the multibillion-dollar BRAIN initiative</url>, a research program aimed at mapping the wiring and firing of the human brain.</p><p>Yuste has made at least one stellar breakthrough towards that goal. In 2017 his team was the first to record the activity of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127625-entire-nervous-system-of-an-animal-recorded-for-the-first-time/\">entire nervous system of an animal</url> - the pint-sized sea-dwelling Hydra. But Yuste has another passion beyond the lab.</p><p>\"My night job, so to speak, is science advocacy,\" he says.</p><p>Yuste leads an international posse of 25 scientists, ethicists and engineers called the Morningside group. Eighteen months ago in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/news/four-ethical-priorities-for-neurotechnologies-and-ai-1.22960\">article in the journal Nature</url> they argued that the rise of AI and brain-computer interfaces demands a new suite of rights, dubbed \"neurorights\", to protect citizens. A right to \"mental privacy\" is among them.</p><p>His advocacy role took Yuste to an unlikely destination this year. He's been in Chile trying, with doctor and politician Senator Guido Girardi, to amend that country's constitution. They want to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>enshrine brain data protection as a human right</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and, to that end, have two bills before parliament slated for a vote in November.</p><p>Neural data, defined as data taken from brain devices, either invasive or non-invasive, should be defined with the same rigour legally as organ transplantation, says Yuste.</p><p>As happens with kidney donation, he says, the output of our \"mental organ\" must not be traded commercially.</p><p>\"One of the bills that we're introducing in the Chilean parliament legally defines the concept of neural data and makes it illegal to buy or sell it.\"</p><p>Yuste's ambitions, however, are global. He wants neural data protections written into the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As it happens, the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile.</p><p>\"This was not the reason we did this in Chile, but I hope it helps,\" says Yuste.</p><p>The cutting edge of brain reading is still confined to hi-tech labs, but there are plenty of punters who will want to know what data can be siphoned from over-the-counter \"neurowearables\". EEG-reading headsets are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mind-control-eeg-research-closes-in-on-thoughtoperated-computers-20151013-gk7r9t.html\">commercially available for a range of applications</url>, including monitoring mental health and using       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>thoughts to control drones</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and video games - something called neurogaming.</p><p>Marcello Ienca, a bioethics academic at Swiss technology university ETH Zurich, says those users face some unique vulnerabilities.</p><p>\"It is possible that a malevolent third-party hacker accesses brain signals in an unauthorised manner,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is something that could be easily done in the neurogaming domain because you always have brain activity being measured while visual stimuli are being presented in a virtual environment.\"</p><p>Hackers, says Ienca, could send malware into a game that flashed images of different banks and random numbers. EEG sensors can mine something called a P300 signal, a spike on the trace when a person sees something they recognise. Using P300 spikes, hackers could work out the person's bank and their four-digit PIN number, something that's been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/technical-sessions/presentation/martinovic\">shown in a proof-of-concept study</url>.</p><p>Last year, a group in Toronto used brainwave data from scalp electrodes to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reconstruct faces people had seen</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. It's an advance that conjures dystopian visions of courts issuing subpoenas for brain data to use as eyewitness testimony, to a murder for example. Granting the tech could ever be reliable enough to meet an evidence requirement, Ienca has plenty of issues with it.</p><p>\"People should not be forced to share content related to their mental states against their will,\" he says.</p><p>Ienca says this could infringe on the right against self-incrimination, if brain data were used to implicate the person in a felony. Ienca also believes extracting brain data under duress could strike at our very core, undermining freedom of thought, a right chiselled into the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>\"Part of what amounts to being a person is having conscious control over the thoughts that we want to share and the thoughts that we want to seclude,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"Once that conscious control is eliminated, the very idea of being an independent person and having personal identity might be undermined.\"</p><p>China may well be a litmus test for where this tech is heading. Last year the South China Morning Post reported Chinese train drivers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2143899/forget-facebook-leak-china-mining-data-directly-workers-brains\">being fitted with EEG readers</url> in their hat bands. The stated purpose was to monitor stress and improve performance.</p><p>\"I think this is very problematic from an ethical perspective because it is an act of coercion, either explicit or implicit,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The explicit scenario, says Ienca, might be a threat of getting fired if you refuse. Implicit coercion exists in the \"competitive disadvantage\" that comes from not putting your hand up for brain monitoring.</p><p>\"Either scenario is frightening,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The rising threat to mental privacy from neurotech comes as Australia overhauls its own privacy regulation. In March the federal government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Media/Pages/Tougher-penalties-to-keep-australians-safe-online-19.aspx\">announced new protections and penalties</url> under the Privacy Act in the face of an \"explosion in major social media and online platforms that trade in personal information\".</p><p>And in July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/need-to-be-held-to-account-government-backs-sweeping-crackdown-on-tech-giants-20190726-p52azl.html\">recommends a raft of new privacy measures</url> targeting players such as Facebook and Google, including the right for users to have their data erased.</p><p>I asked David Watts, professor of Information Law and Policy at La Trobe University and former privacy commissioner for Victoria, if these changes mitigate the privacy threats posed by brain tech.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"Because all they do is tinker at the edges and this technology is so fundamentally transformative that tinkering around the edges is just not good enough ... they still rely on consent and consent can be gamed.</p><p>\"You're likely to be offered products and services that are so compelling you'll give up consent or you won't even read about it, you'll just tick the box,\" Watts says.</p><p>The remedy, he says, lies in part in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/why-you-should-read-all-those-gdpr-privacy-policy-updates-20180524-p4zh5k.html\">template of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation</url>, implemented last year. It offers a right to opt out of \"automated processing\", the compiling of personal profiles from user data. It also gives the right to an explanation from a human about how an algorithm made a decision about you - for example, to downgrade your credit rating or refuse you a home loan.</p><p>But Watts finds the spectre of brain intrusion so alarming that even stronger measures are warranted.</p><p>\"I would add an absolute right, that could not be foregone by consent, to prevent and criminalise the upload or using of people's brain waves, or their thoughts, for any purpose that was not specifically related to the treatment of certain medical conditions,\" he says.</p><p>In 2017 The Economist pronounced that data is now worth more than oil. Watts is only too aware that even medical device manufacturers may be conflicted once in possession of users' increasingly valuable brain data. Such data would be of undoubted interest to political parties, adding insights beyond even the laser-like voter profiling seen in the 2016 US election.</p><p>\"This is an incredibly refined version of that. It makes it look like caster sugar as compared to molasses,\" says Watts.</p><p>Amid the fears around emerging neurotech there is a tempering voice. It belongs to Associate Professor Adrian Carter, a neuroethicist at Monash University in Melbourne.</p><p>\"I come back to not overhyping what these technologies can do,\" says Carter.</p><p>Carter points out the data tech behemoths have on us now already gives them profound insights into our behaviour. Chain store Target's claimed ability to know which of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/04/15/3985934.htm\">its customers is pregnant</url> has been a much-publicised example.</p><p>\"I don't think there is anything particularly special about brain data. Our interaction with smartphones is a surrogate measure of what's going on in the brain,\" says Carter.</p><p>Mindstrong Health, says Carter, has an app they claim could <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one day help diagnose Parkinson's disease</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> using your scrolling, tapping and swiping behaviour on a smartphone.</p><p>\"People get really pent up or particularly worried about brain data, as if that is somehow more true or more real than other forms of data,\" says Carter.</p><p>So does Carter think these brain technologies pose a threat to mental privacy?</p><p>\"They do. But at this stage not beyond the current technology that surrounds smartphones and other kinds of devices.\"</p><p>Carter may well be right. But Ienca points out that rolling advances in gene technology mean we now know much more about genetic data that was collected back in the 1990s.</p><p>\"Once the data are collected they will be there to stay,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"We have limited ability to read and decode those data today but we might be very able to decode those data 20 years from now with better analytic techniques.\"</p><p>Yuste offers an addendum on just how deep that analysis could run.</p><p>\"I think that we should treat neural data as sacred, because that's actually not just our minds, our intentions, but it's also our subconscious,\" he says.</p><p>\"In principle you should be able to decode not just what people are thinking but what they don't know they're thinking.\"</p><p>Yuste is deeply impressed by the work of US neuroscientist Jack Gallant. Almost unbelievably, Gallant has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mindreading-technology-reconstructs-videos-from-brain-20110923-1ko5s.html\">recreated videos people have seen</url> by decoding their brain activity on MRI scans. That decoding can include words linked to images the person saw, such as \"water\" and \"wave\" for a beach scene. Yuste recalls one scene in which a woman appears.</p><p>\"All kinds of words are flashing in the decoder, and it doesn't take too much to think that maybe some of those words are private feelings that the person has for a particular woman ... and maybe even the person is not aware of the extent of those feelings,\" says Yuste.</p><p>Which raises the intriguing possibility that someone else could know your thoughts better than you do.</p><p>Ienca sees these advances as the final iteration in what has been an inexorable undermining of privacy in recent years.</p><p>\"The very last step of this privacy erosion process is making brain information transparent, dismantling the firewalls of the human brain,\" he says.</p><p>What we need, says Ienca, is a firm grasp on the precautionary principle, a rule of thumb whose short form is, roughly, \"better safe than sorry\".</p><p>It's a maxim that may well start to get more airplay as disillusion grows with the mantra of Facebook's Zuckerberg.</p><p>In case anyone needs reminding, that mantra is \"move fast and break things\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520167007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV3-DY91-DY19-C4D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2291\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the colours aren't on the blackboard. They are lighting up on the kids' foreheads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The children are part of a trial, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3005448/brainwave-tracking-start-china-schoolchildren-controversy-working\">reported earlier this year</url>, in which each is fitted with a brainwave-reading headset, made by Boston-based startup BrainCo, that measures how focused they are on their school work. A small light on the device tells the teacher if those young minds are straying. Blue means relaxed, yellow means focused and red means very focused.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neat. And maybe the headband, which is called Focus 1, is a useful teaching tool. But the experiment also has a darker side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BrainCo has said it aims to \"build the world's largest brainwave database\", a claim that has some neuroscientists worried. Their fears centre on a tsunami of research that is delving deep into people's minds and get ever closer to knowing what they are feeling - and even thinking.</p><p>It is science that threatens what is perhaps the last frontier of privacy: our minds.</p><p>In July, tech guru Elon Musk announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/elon-musk-building-braincomputer-interface-to-protect-against-ai-singularity-20170501-gvw4n1.html\">his company Neuralink</url> had built a tiny Bluetooth-enabled brain chip that he hopes will be trialled next year in people with paralysis, to let them control a computer cursor with their thoughts.</p><p>Musk's implant consists of thousands of flexible thread-like electrodes that are inserted, robotically, via a small incision in the skull into the outer layer of the brain. It's called a brain-computer interface and harvests the same electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals as the Chinese kids' headsets, albeit with much greater resolution.</p><p>The tech could be life-changing, but it's also been racking up serious cachet in brain-reading circles.</p><p>It has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25803\">used to detect words</url>, such as \"cowboys\" and \"swimming\", that people are merely thinking about, just from their brainwaves. And last year a group led by Edward Chang at the University of California San Francisco used a related implant to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200\">detect people's mood states</url>.</p><p>Then in July, another group from Chang's lab <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">deciphered people's answers</url>, and the questions they were responding to, just from EEG signals.</p><p>That work merits special attention because it was funded by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in a recent interview that he is pushing ahead with plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-telepathy-is-the-future-heres-how-it-could-actually-work-20150702-gi34sc.html\">to develop a brain-machine interface</url> that will, one day, let users don a headset to type posts with their thoughts.</p><p>Given Facebook's questionable record on privacy, you could be forgiven for wondering if that's a good thing; new doco The Great Hack gives chilling insight into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-tries-to-move-on-but-cambridge-analytica-won-t-go-away-20180704-p4zpic.html\">the Cambridge Analytica breach</url> that exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>In particular, one big privacy implication of any Facebook brain-to-text device was nailed by the man questioning Zuckerberg in that interview, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain.</p><p>\"The Fifth Amendment implications are staggering,\" Zittrain said.</p><p>An all-seeing brain-computer interface could indeed render the right to remain silent - enshrined in the US Constitution - a historical curiosity.</p><p>If all that tech is backing privacy into a corner, it's also getting pushback from some heavy hitters.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a professor of neuroscience at New York's Columbia University, led the team that inspired Barack Obama in 2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/obama-offers-100m-to-map-human-brain-20130403-2h70w.html\">to launch the multibillion-dollar BRAIN initiative</url>, a research program aimed at mapping the wiring and firing of the human brain.</p><p>Yuste has made at least one stellar breakthrough towards that goal. In 2017 his team was the first to record the activity of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127625-entire-nervous-system-of-an-animal-recorded-for-the-first-time/\">entire nervous system of an animal</url> - the pint-sized sea-dwelling Hydra. But Yuste has another passion beyond the lab.</p><p>\"My night job, so to speak, is science advocacy,\" he says.</p><p>Yuste leads an international posse of 25 scientists, ethicists and engineers called the Morningside group. Eighteen months ago in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/news/four-ethical-priorities-for-neurotechnologies-and-ai-1.22960\">article in the journal Nature</url> they argued that the rise of AI and brain-computer interfaces demands a new suite of rights, dubbed \"neurorights\", to protect citizens. A right to \"mental privacy\" is among them.</p><p>His advocacy role took Yuste to an unlikely destination this year. He's been in Chile trying, with doctor and politician Senator Guido Girardi, to amend that country's constitution. They want to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>enshrine brain data protection as a human right</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and, to that end, have two bills before parliament slated for a vote in November.</p><p>Neural data, defined as data taken from brain devices, either invasive or non-invasive, should be defined with the same rigour legally as organ transplantation, says Yuste.</p><p>As happens with kidney donation, he says, the output of our \"mental organ\" must not be traded commercially.</p><p>\"One of the bills that we're introducing in the Chilean parliament legally defines the concept of neural data and makes it illegal to buy or sell it.\"</p><p>Yuste's ambitions, however, are global. He wants neural data protections written into the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As it happens, the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile.</p><p>\"This was not the reason we did this in Chile, but I hope it helps,\" says Yuste.</p><p>The cutting edge of brain reading is still confined to hi-tech labs, but there are plenty of punters who will want to know what data can be siphoned from over-the-counter \"neurowearables\". EEG-reading headsets are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mind-control-eeg-research-closes-in-on-thoughtoperated-computers-20151013-gk7r9t.html\">commercially available for a range of applications</url>, including monitoring mental health and using       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>thoughts to control drones</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and video games - something called neurogaming.</p><p>Marcello Ienca, a bioethics academic at Swiss technology university ETH Zurich, says those users face some unique vulnerabilities.</p><p>\"It is possible that a malevolent third-party hacker accesses brain signals in an unauthorised manner,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is something that could be easily done in the neurogaming domain because you always have brain activity being measured while visual stimuli are being presented in a virtual environment.\"</p><p>Hackers, says Ienca, could send malware into a game that flashed images of different banks and random numbers. EEG sensors can mine something called a P300 signal, a spike on the trace when a person sees something they recognise. Using P300 spikes, hackers could work out the person's bank and their four-digit PIN number, something that's been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/technical-sessions/presentation/martinovic\">shown in a proof-of-concept study</url>.</p><p>Last year, a group in Toronto used brainwave data from scalp electrodes to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reconstruct faces people had seen</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. It's an advance that conjures dystopian visions of courts issuing subpoenas for brain data to use as eyewitness testimony, to a murder for example. Granting the tech could ever be reliable enough to meet an evidence requirement, Ienca has plenty of issues with it.</p><p>\"People should not be forced to share content related to their mental states against their will,\" he says.</p><p>Ienca says this could infringe on the right against self-incrimination, if brain data were used to implicate the person in a felony. Ienca also believes extracting brain data under duress could strike at our very core, undermining freedom of thought, a right chiselled into the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>\"Part of what amounts to being a person is having conscious control over the thoughts that we want to share and the thoughts that we want to seclude,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"Once that conscious control is eliminated, the very idea of being an independent person and having personal identity might be undermined.\"</p><p>China may well be a litmus test for where this tech is heading. Last year the South China Morning Post reported Chinese train drivers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2143899/forget-facebook-leak-china-mining-data-directly-workers-brains\">being fitted with EEG readers</url> in their hat bands. The stated purpose was to monitor stress and improve performance.</p><p>\"I think this is very problematic from an ethical perspective because it is an act of coercion, either explicit or implicit,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The explicit scenario, says Ienca, might be a threat of getting fired if you refuse. Implicit coercion exists in the \"competitive disadvantage\" that comes from not putting your hand up for brain monitoring.</p><p>\"Either scenario is frightening,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The rising threat to mental privacy from neurotech comes as Australia overhauls its own privacy regulation. In March the federal government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Media/Pages/Tougher-penalties-to-keep-australians-safe-online-19.aspx\">announced new protections and penalties</url> under the Privacy Act in the face of an \"explosion in major social media and online platforms that trade in personal information\".</p><p>And in July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/need-to-be-held-to-account-government-backs-sweeping-crackdown-on-tech-giants-20190726-p52azl.html\">recommends a raft of new privacy measures</url> targeting players such as Facebook and Google, including the right for users to have their data erased.</p><p>I asked David Watts, professor of Information Law and Policy at La Trobe University and former privacy commissioner for Victoria, if these changes mitigate the privacy threats posed by brain tech.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"Because all they do is tinker at the edges and this technology is so fundamentally transformative that tinkering around the edges is just not good enough ... they still rely on consent and consent can be gamed.</p><p>\"You're likely to be offered products and services that are so compelling you'll give up consent or you won't even read about it, you'll just tick the box,\" Watts says.</p><p>The remedy, he says, lies in part in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/why-you-should-read-all-those-gdpr-privacy-policy-updates-20180524-p4zh5k.html\">template of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation</url>, implemented last year. It offers a right to opt out of \"automated processing\", the compiling of personal profiles from user data. It also gives the right to an explanation from a human about how an algorithm made a decision about you - for example, to downgrade your credit rating or refuse you a home loan.</p><p>But Watts finds the spectre of brain intrusion so alarming that even stronger measures are warranted.</p><p>\"I would add an absolute right, that could not be foregone by consent, to prevent and criminalise the upload or using of people's brain waves, or their thoughts, for any purpose that was not specifically related to the treatment of certain medical conditions,\" he says.</p><p>In 2017 The Economist pronounced that data is now worth more than oil. Watts is only too aware that even medical device manufacturers may be conflicted once in possession of users' increasingly valuable brain data. Such data would be of undoubted interest to political parties, adding insights beyond even the laser-like voter profiling seen in the 2016 US election.</p><p>\"This is an incredibly refined version of that. It makes it look like caster sugar as compared to molasses,\" says Watts.</p><p>Amid the fears around emerging neurotech there is a tempering voice. It belongs to Associate Professor Adrian Carter, a neuroethicist at Monash University in Melbourne.</p><p>\"I come back to not overhyping what these technologies can do,\" says Carter.</p><p>Carter points out the data tech behemoths have on us now already gives them profound insights into our behaviour. Chain store Target's claimed ability to know which of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/04/15/3985934.htm\">its customers is pregnant</url> has been a much-publicised example.</p><p>\"I don't think there is anything particularly special about brain data. Our interaction with smartphones is a surrogate measure of what's going on in the brain,\" says Carter.</p><p>Mindstrong Health, says Carter, has an app they claim could <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one day help diagnose Parkinson's disease</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> using your scrolling, tapping and swiping behaviour on a smartphone.</p><p>\"People get really pent up or particularly worried about brain data, as if that is somehow more true or more real than other forms of data,\" says Carter.</p><p>So does Carter think these brain technologies pose a threat to mental privacy?</p><p>\"They do. But at this stage not beyond the current technology that surrounds smartphones and other kinds of devices.\"</p><p>Carter may well be right. But Ienca points out that rolling advances in gene technology mean we now know much more about genetic data that was collected back in the 1990s.</p><p>\"Once the data are collected they will be there to stay,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"We have limited ability to read and decode those data today but we might be very able to decode those data 20 years from now with better analytic techniques.\"</p><p>Yuste offers an addendum on just how deep that analysis could run.</p><p>\"I think that we should treat neural data as sacred, because that's actually not just our minds, our intentions, but it's also our subconscious,\" he says.</p><p>\"In principle you should be able to decode not just what people are thinking but what they don't know they're thinking.\"</p><p>Yuste is deeply impressed by the work of US neuroscientist Jack Gallant. Almost unbelievably, Gallant has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mindreading-technology-reconstructs-videos-from-brain-20110923-1ko5s.html\">recreated videos people have seen</url> by decoding their brain activity on MRI scans. That decoding can include words linked to images the person saw, such as \"water\" and \"wave\" for a beach scene. Yuste recalls one scene in which a woman appears.</p><p>\"All kinds of words are flashing in the decoder, and it doesn't take too much to think that maybe some of those words are private feelings that the person has for a particular woman ... and maybe even the person is not aware of the extent of those feelings,\" says Yuste.</p><p>Which raises the intriguing possibility that someone else could know your thoughts better than you do.</p><p>Ienca sees these advances as the final iteration in what has been an inexorable undermining of privacy in recent years.</p><p>\"The very last step of this privacy erosion process is making brain information transparent, dismantling the firewalls of the human brain,\" he says.</p><p>What we need, says Ienca, is a firm grasp on the precautionary principle, a rule of thumb whose short form is, roughly, \"better safe than sorry\".</p><p>It's a maxim that may well start to get more airplay as disillusion grows with the mantra of Facebook's Zuckerberg.</p><p>In case anyone needs reminding, that mantra is \"move fast and break things\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520167007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV9-1C51-DY19-C0YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2291\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the colours aren't on the blackboard. They are lighting up on the kids' foreheads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The children are part of a trial, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3005448/brainwave-tracking-start-china-schoolchildren-controversy-working\">reported earlier this year</url>, in which each is fitted with a brainwave-reading headset, made by Boston-based startup BrainCo, that measures how focused they are on their school work. A small light on the device tells the teacher if those young minds are straying. Blue means relaxed, yellow means focused and red means very focused.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neat. And maybe the headband, which is called Focus 1, is a useful teaching tool. But the experiment also has a darker side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BrainCo has said it aims to \"build the world's largest brainwave database\", a claim that has some neuroscientists worried. Their fears centre on a tsunami of research that is delving deep into people's minds and get ever closer to knowing what they are feeling - and even thinking.</p><p>It is science that threatens what is perhaps the last frontier of privacy: our minds.</p><p>In July, tech guru Elon Musk announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/elon-musk-building-braincomputer-interface-to-protect-against-ai-singularity-20170501-gvw4n1.html\">his company Neuralink</url> had built a tiny Bluetooth-enabled brain chip that he hopes will be trialled next year in people with paralysis, to let them control a computer cursor with their thoughts.</p><p>Musk's implant consists of thousands of flexible thread-like electrodes that are inserted, robotically, via a small incision in the skull into the outer layer of the brain. It's called a brain-computer interface and harvests the same electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals as the Chinese kids' headsets, albeit with much greater resolution.</p><p>The tech could be life-changing, but it's also been racking up serious cachet in brain-reading circles.</p><p>It has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25803\">used to detect words</url>, such as \"cowboys\" and \"swimming\", that people are merely thinking about, just from their brainwaves. And last year a group led by Edward Chang at the University of California San Francisco used a related implant to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200\">detect people's mood states</url>.</p><p>Then in July, another group from Chang's lab <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">deciphered people's answers</url>, and the questions they were responding to, just from EEG signals.</p><p>That work merits special attention because it was funded by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in a recent interview that he is pushing ahead with plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-telepathy-is-the-future-heres-how-it-could-actually-work-20150702-gi34sc.html\">to develop a brain-machine interface</url> that will, one day, let users don a headset to type posts with their thoughts.</p><p>Given Facebook's questionable record on privacy, you could be forgiven for wondering if that's a good thing; new doco The Great Hack gives chilling insight into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-tries-to-move-on-but-cambridge-analytica-won-t-go-away-20180704-p4zpic.html\">the Cambridge Analytica breach</url> that exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>In particular, one big privacy implication of any Facebook brain-to-text device was nailed by the man questioning Zuckerberg in that interview, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain.</p><p>\"The Fifth Amendment implications are staggering,\" Zittrain said.</p><p>An all-seeing brain-computer interface could indeed render the right to remain silent - enshrined in the US Constitution - a historical curiosity.</p><p>If all that tech is backing privacy into a corner, it's also getting pushback from some heavy hitters.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a professor of neuroscience at New York's Columbia University, led the team that inspired Barack Obama in 2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/obama-offers-100m-to-map-human-brain-20130403-2h70w.html\">to launch the multibillion-dollar BRAIN initiative</url>, a research program aimed at mapping the wiring and firing of the human brain.</p><p>Yuste has made at least one stellar breakthrough towards that goal. In 2017 his team was the first to record the activity of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127625-entire-nervous-system-of-an-animal-recorded-for-the-first-time/\">entire nervous system of an animal</url> - the pint-sized sea-dwelling Hydra. But Yuste has another passion beyond the lab.</p><p>\"My night job, so to speak, is science advocacy,\" he says.</p><p>Yuste leads an international posse of 25 scientists, ethicists and engineers called the Morningside group. Eighteen months ago in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/news/four-ethical-priorities-for-neurotechnologies-and-ai-1.22960\">article in the journal Nature</url> they argued that the rise of AI and brain-computer interfaces demands a new suite of rights, dubbed \"neurorights\", to protect citizens. A right to \"mental privacy\" is among them.</p><p>His advocacy role took Yuste to an unlikely destination this year. He's been in Chile trying, with doctor and politician Senator Guido Girardi, to amend that country's constitution. They want to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>enshrine brain data protection as a human right</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and, to that end, have two bills before parliament slated for a vote in November.</p><p>Neural data, defined as data taken from brain devices, either invasive or non-invasive, should be defined with the same rigour legally as organ transplantation, says Yuste.</p><p>As happens with kidney donation, he says, the output of our \"mental organ\" must not be traded commercially.</p><p>\"One of the bills that we're introducing in the Chilean parliament legally defines the concept of neural data and makes it illegal to buy or sell it.\"</p><p>Yuste's ambitions, however, are global. He wants neural data protections written into the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As it happens, the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile.</p><p>\"This was not the reason we did this in Chile, but I hope it helps,\" says Yuste.</p><p>The cutting edge of brain reading is still confined to hi-tech labs, but there are plenty of punters who will want to know what data can be siphoned from over-the-counter \"neurowearables\". EEG-reading headsets are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mind-control-eeg-research-closes-in-on-thoughtoperated-computers-20151013-gk7r9t.html\">commercially available for a range of applications</url>, including monitoring mental health and using       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>thoughts to control drones</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and video games - something called neurogaming.</p><p>Marcello Ienca, a bioethics academic at Swiss technology university ETH Zurich, says those users face some unique vulnerabilities.</p><p>\"It is possible that a malevolent third-party hacker accesses brain signals in an unauthorised manner,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is something that could be easily done in the neurogaming domain because you always have brain activity being measured while visual stimuli are being presented in a virtual environment.\"</p><p>Hackers, says Ienca, could send malware into a game that flashed images of different banks and random numbers. EEG sensors can mine something called a P300 signal, a spike on the trace when a person sees something they recognise. Using P300 spikes, hackers could work out the person's bank and their four-digit PIN number, something that's been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/technical-sessions/presentation/martinovic\">shown in a proof-of-concept study</url>.</p><p>Last year, a group in Toronto used brainwave data from scalp electrodes to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reconstruct faces people had seen</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. It's an advance that conjures dystopian visions of courts issuing subpoenas for brain data to use as eyewitness testimony, to a murder for example. Granting the tech could ever be reliable enough to meet an evidence requirement, Ienca has plenty of issues with it.</p><p>\"People should not be forced to share content related to their mental states against their will,\" he says.</p><p>Ienca says this could infringe on the right against self-incrimination, if brain data were used to implicate the person in a felony. Ienca also believes extracting brain data under duress could strike at our very core, undermining freedom of thought, a right chiselled into the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>\"Part of what amounts to being a person is having conscious control over the thoughts that we want to share and the thoughts that we want to seclude,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"Once that conscious control is eliminated, the very idea of being an independent person and having personal identity might be undermined.\"</p><p>China may well be a litmus test for where this tech is heading. Last year the South China Morning Post reported Chinese train drivers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2143899/forget-facebook-leak-china-mining-data-directly-workers-brains\">being fitted with EEG readers</url> in their hat bands. The stated purpose was to monitor stress and improve performance.</p><p>\"I think this is very problematic from an ethical perspective because it is an act of coercion, either explicit or implicit,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The explicit scenario, says Ienca, might be a threat of getting fired if you refuse. Implicit coercion exists in the \"competitive disadvantage\" that comes from not putting your hand up for brain monitoring.</p><p>\"Either scenario is frightening,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The rising threat to mental privacy from neurotech comes as Australia overhauls its own privacy regulation. In March the federal government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Media/Pages/Tougher-penalties-to-keep-australians-safe-online-19.aspx\">announced new protections and penalties</url> under the Privacy Act in the face of an \"explosion in major social media and online platforms that trade in personal information\".</p><p>And in July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/need-to-be-held-to-account-government-backs-sweeping-crackdown-on-tech-giants-20190726-p52azl.html\">recommends a raft of new privacy measures</url> targeting players such as Facebook and Google, including the right for users to have their data erased.</p><p>I asked David Watts, professor of Information Law and Policy at La Trobe University and former privacy commissioner for Victoria, if these changes mitigate the privacy threats posed by brain tech.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"Because all they do is tinker at the edges and this technology is so fundamentally transformative that tinkering around the edges is just not good enough ... they still rely on consent and consent can be gamed.</p><p>\"You're likely to be offered products and services that are so compelling you'll give up consent or you won't even read about it, you'll just tick the box,\" Watts says.</p><p>The remedy, he says, lies in part in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/why-you-should-read-all-those-gdpr-privacy-policy-updates-20180524-p4zh5k.html\">template of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation</url>, implemented last year. It offers a right to opt out of \"automated processing\", the compiling of personal profiles from user data. It also gives the right to an explanation from a human about how an algorithm made a decision about you - for example, to downgrade your credit rating or refuse you a home loan.</p><p>But Watts finds the spectre of brain intrusion so alarming that even stronger measures are warranted.</p><p>\"I would add an absolute right, that could not be foregone by consent, to prevent and criminalise the upload or using of people's brain waves, or their thoughts, for any purpose that was not specifically related to the treatment of certain medical conditions,\" he says.</p><p>In 2017 The Economist pronounced that data is now worth more than oil. Watts is only too aware that even medical device manufacturers may be conflicted once in possession of users' increasingly valuable brain data. Such data would be of undoubted interest to political parties, adding insights beyond even the laser-like voter profiling seen in the 2016 US election.</p><p>\"This is an incredibly refined version of that. It makes it look like caster sugar as compared to molasses,\" says Watts.</p><p>Amid the fears around emerging neurotech there is a tempering voice. It belongs to Associate Professor Adrian Carter, a neuroethicist at Monash University in Melbourne.</p><p>\"I come back to not overhyping what these technologies can do,\" says Carter.</p><p>Carter points out the data tech behemoths have on us now already gives them profound insights into our behaviour. Chain store Target's claimed ability to know which of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/04/15/3985934.htm\">its customers is pregnant</url> has been a much-publicised example.</p><p>\"I don't think there is anything particularly special about brain data. Our interaction with smartphones is a surrogate measure of what's going on in the brain,\" says Carter.</p><p>Mindstrong Health, says Carter, has an app they claim could <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one day help diagnose Parkinson's disease</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> using your scrolling, tapping and swiping behaviour on a smartphone.</p><p>\"People get really pent up or particularly worried about brain data, as if that is somehow more true or more real than other forms of data,\" says Carter.</p><p>So does Carter think these brain technologies pose a threat to mental privacy?</p><p>\"They do. But at this stage not beyond the current technology that surrounds smartphones and other kinds of devices.\"</p><p>Carter may well be right. But Ienca points out that rolling advances in gene technology mean we now know much more about genetic data that was collected back in the 1990s.</p><p>\"Once the data are collected they will be there to stay,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"We have limited ability to read and decode those data today but we might be very able to decode those data 20 years from now with better analytic techniques.\"</p><p>Yuste offers an addendum on just how deep that analysis could run.</p><p>\"I think that we should treat neural data as sacred, because that's actually not just our minds, our intentions, but it's also our subconscious,\" he says.</p><p>\"In principle you should be able to decode not just what people are thinking but what they don't know they're thinking.\"</p><p>Yuste is deeply impressed by the work of US neuroscientist Jack Gallant. Almost unbelievably, Gallant has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mindreading-technology-reconstructs-videos-from-brain-20110923-1ko5s.html\">recreated videos people have seen</url> by decoding their brain activity on MRI scans. That decoding can include words linked to images the person saw, such as \"water\" and \"wave\" for a beach scene. Yuste recalls one scene in which a woman appears.</p><p>\"All kinds of words are flashing in the decoder, and it doesn't take too much to think that maybe some of those words are private feelings that the person has for a particular woman ... and maybe even the person is not aware of the extent of those feelings,\" says Yuste.</p><p>Which raises the intriguing possibility that someone else could know your thoughts better than you do.</p><p>Ienca sees these advances as the final iteration in what has been an inexorable undermining of privacy in recent years.</p><p>\"The very last step of this privacy erosion process is making brain information transparent, dismantling the firewalls of the human brain,\" he says.</p><p>What we need, says Ienca, is a firm grasp on the precautionary principle, a rule of thumb whose short form is, roughly, \"better safe than sorry\".</p><p>It's a maxim that may well start to get more airplay as disillusion grows with the mantra of Facebook's Zuckerberg.</p><p>In case anyone needs reminding, that mantra is \"move fast and break things\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520167007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV7-8C81-DY19-C30S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2291\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the colours aren't on the blackboard. They are lighting up on the kids' foreheads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The children are part of a trial, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3005448/brainwave-tracking-start-china-schoolchildren-controversy-working\">reported earlier this year</url>, in which each is fitted with a brainwave-reading headset, made by Boston-based startup BrainCo, that measures how focused they are on their school work. A small light on the device tells the teacher if those young minds are straying. Blue means relaxed, yellow means focused and red means very focused.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neat. And maybe the headband, which is called Focus 1, is a useful teaching tool. But the experiment also has a darker side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BrainCo has said it aims to \"build the world's largest brainwave database\", a claim that has some neuroscientists worried. Their fears centre on a tsunami of research that is delving deep into people's minds and get ever closer to knowing what they are feeling - and even thinking.</p><p>It is science that threatens what is perhaps the last frontier of privacy: our minds.</p><p>In July, tech guru Elon Musk announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/elon-musk-building-braincomputer-interface-to-protect-against-ai-singularity-20170501-gvw4n1.html\">his company Neuralink</url> had built a tiny Bluetooth-enabled brain chip that he hopes will be trialled next year in people with paralysis, to let them control a computer cursor with their thoughts.</p><p>Musk's implant consists of thousands of flexible thread-like electrodes that are inserted, robotically, via a small incision in the skull into the outer layer of the brain. It's called a brain-computer interface and harvests the same electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals as the Chinese kids' headsets, albeit with much greater resolution.</p><p>The tech could be life-changing, but it's also been racking up serious cachet in brain-reading circles.</p><p>It has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25803\">used to detect words</url>, such as \"cowboys\" and \"swimming\", that people are merely thinking about, just from their brainwaves. And last year a group led by Edward Chang at the University of California San Francisco used a related implant to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200\">detect people's mood states</url>.</p><p>Then in July, another group from Chang's lab <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">deciphered people's answers</url>, and the questions they were responding to, just from EEG signals.</p><p>That work merits special attention because it was funded by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in a recent interview that he is pushing ahead with plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-telepathy-is-the-future-heres-how-it-could-actually-work-20150702-gi34sc.html\">to develop a brain-machine interface</url> that will, one day, let users don a headset to type posts with their thoughts.</p><p>Given Facebook's questionable record on privacy, you could be forgiven for wondering if that's a good thing; new doco The Great Hack gives chilling insight into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-tries-to-move-on-but-cambridge-analytica-won-t-go-away-20180704-p4zpic.html\">the Cambridge Analytica breach</url> that exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>In particular, one big privacy implication of any Facebook brain-to-text device was nailed by the man questioning Zuckerberg in that interview, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain.</p><p>\"The Fifth Amendment implications are staggering,\" Zittrain said.</p><p>An all-seeing brain-computer interface could indeed render the right to remain silent - enshrined in the US Constitution - a historical curiosity.</p><p>If all that tech is backing privacy into a corner, it's also getting pushback from some heavy hitters.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a professor of neuroscience at New York's Columbia University, led the team that inspired Barack Obama in 2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/obama-offers-100m-to-map-human-brain-20130403-2h70w.html\">to launch the multibillion-dollar BRAIN initiative</url>, a research program aimed at mapping the wiring and firing of the human brain.</p><p>Yuste has made at least one stellar breakthrough towards that goal. In 2017 his team was the first to record the activity of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127625-entire-nervous-system-of-an-animal-recorded-for-the-first-time/\">entire nervous system of an animal</url> - the pint-sized sea-dwelling Hydra. But Yuste has another passion beyond the lab.</p><p>\"My night job, so to speak, is science advocacy,\" he says.</p><p>Yuste leads an international posse of 25 scientists, ethicists and engineers called the Morningside group. Eighteen months ago in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/news/four-ethical-priorities-for-neurotechnologies-and-ai-1.22960\">article in the journal Nature</url> they argued that the rise of AI and brain-computer interfaces demands a new suite of rights, dubbed \"neurorights\", to protect citizens. A right to \"mental privacy\" is among them.</p><p>His advocacy role took Yuste to an unlikely destination this year. He's been in Chile trying, with doctor and politician Senator Guido Girardi, to amend that country's constitution. They want to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>enshrine brain data protection as a human right</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and, to that end, have two bills before parliament slated for a vote in November.</p><p>Neural data, defined as data taken from brain devices, either invasive or non-invasive, should be defined with the same rigour legally as organ transplantation, says Yuste.</p><p>As happens with kidney donation, he says, the output of our \"mental organ\" must not be traded commercially.</p><p>\"One of the bills that we're introducing in the Chilean parliament legally defines the concept of neural data and makes it illegal to buy or sell it.\"</p><p>Yuste's ambitions, however, are global. He wants neural data protections written into the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As it happens, the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile.</p><p>\"This was not the reason we did this in Chile, but I hope it helps,\" says Yuste.</p><p>The cutting edge of brain reading is still confined to hi-tech labs, but there are plenty of punters who will want to know what data can be siphoned from over-the-counter \"neurowearables\". EEG-reading headsets are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mind-control-eeg-research-closes-in-on-thoughtoperated-computers-20151013-gk7r9t.html\">commercially available for a range of applications</url>, including monitoring mental health and using       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>thoughts to control drones</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and video games - something called neurogaming.</p><p>Marcello Ienca, a bioethics academic at Swiss technology university ETH Zurich, says those users face some unique vulnerabilities.</p><p>\"It is possible that a malevolent third-party hacker accesses brain signals in an unauthorised manner,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is something that could be easily done in the neurogaming domain because you always have brain activity being measured while visual stimuli are being presented in a virtual environment.\"</p><p>Hackers, says Ienca, could send malware into a game that flashed images of different banks and random numbers. EEG sensors can mine something called a P300 signal, a spike on the trace when a person sees something they recognise. Using P300 spikes, hackers could work out the person's bank and their four-digit PIN number, something that's been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/technical-sessions/presentation/martinovic\">shown in a proof-of-concept study</url>.</p><p>Last year, a group in Toronto used brainwave data from scalp electrodes to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reconstruct faces people had seen</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. It's an advance that conjures dystopian visions of courts issuing subpoenas for brain data to use as eyewitness testimony, to a murder for example. Granting the tech could ever be reliable enough to meet an evidence requirement, Ienca has plenty of issues with it.</p><p>\"People should not be forced to share content related to their mental states against their will,\" he says.</p><p>Ienca says this could infringe on the right against self-incrimination, if brain data were used to implicate the person in a felony. Ienca also believes extracting brain data under duress could strike at our very core, undermining freedom of thought, a right chiselled into the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>\"Part of what amounts to being a person is having conscious control over the thoughts that we want to share and the thoughts that we want to seclude,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"Once that conscious control is eliminated, the very idea of being an independent person and having personal identity might be undermined.\"</p><p>China may well be a litmus test for where this tech is heading. Last year the South China Morning Post reported Chinese train drivers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2143899/forget-facebook-leak-china-mining-data-directly-workers-brains\">being fitted with EEG readers</url> in their hat bands. The stated purpose was to monitor stress and improve performance.</p><p>\"I think this is very problematic from an ethical perspective because it is an act of coercion, either explicit or implicit,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The explicit scenario, says Ienca, might be a threat of getting fired if you refuse. Implicit coercion exists in the \"competitive disadvantage\" that comes from not putting your hand up for brain monitoring.</p><p>\"Either scenario is frightening,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The rising threat to mental privacy from neurotech comes as Australia overhauls its own privacy regulation. In March the federal government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Media/Pages/Tougher-penalties-to-keep-australians-safe-online-19.aspx\">announced new protections and penalties</url> under the Privacy Act in the face of an \"explosion in major social media and online platforms that trade in personal information\".</p><p>And in July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/need-to-be-held-to-account-government-backs-sweeping-crackdown-on-tech-giants-20190726-p52azl.html\">recommends a raft of new privacy measures</url> targeting players such as Facebook and Google, including the right for users to have their data erased.</p><p>I asked David Watts, professor of Information Law and Policy at La Trobe University and former privacy commissioner for Victoria, if these changes mitigate the privacy threats posed by brain tech.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"Because all they do is tinker at the edges and this technology is so fundamentally transformative that tinkering around the edges is just not good enough ... they still rely on consent and consent can be gamed.</p><p>\"You're likely to be offered products and services that are so compelling you'll give up consent or you won't even read about it, you'll just tick the box,\" Watts says.</p><p>The remedy, he says, lies in part in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/why-you-should-read-all-those-gdpr-privacy-policy-updates-20180524-p4zh5k.html\">template of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation</url>, implemented last year. It offers a right to opt out of \"automated processing\", the compiling of personal profiles from user data. It also gives the right to an explanation from a human about how an algorithm made a decision about you - for example, to downgrade your credit rating or refuse you a home loan.</p><p>But Watts finds the spectre of brain intrusion so alarming that even stronger measures are warranted.</p><p>\"I would add an absolute right, that could not be foregone by consent, to prevent and criminalise the upload or using of people's brain waves, or their thoughts, for any purpose that was not specifically related to the treatment of certain medical conditions,\" he says.</p><p>In 2017 The Economist pronounced that data is now worth more than oil. Watts is only too aware that even medical device manufacturers may be conflicted once in possession of users' increasingly valuable brain data. Such data would be of undoubted interest to political parties, adding insights beyond even the laser-like voter profiling seen in the 2016 US election.</p><p>\"This is an incredibly refined version of that. It makes it look like caster sugar as compared to molasses,\" says Watts.</p><p>Amid the fears around emerging neurotech there is a tempering voice. It belongs to Associate Professor Adrian Carter, a neuroethicist at Monash University in Melbourne.</p><p>\"I come back to not overhyping what these technologies can do,\" says Carter.</p><p>Carter points out the data tech behemoths have on us now already gives them profound insights into our behaviour. Chain store Target's claimed ability to know which of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/04/15/3985934.htm\">its customers is pregnant</url> has been a much-publicised example.</p><p>\"I don't think there is anything particularly special about brain data. Our interaction with smartphones is a surrogate measure of what's going on in the brain,\" says Carter.</p><p>Mindstrong Health, says Carter, has an app they claim could <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one day help diagnose Parkinson's disease</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> using your scrolling, tapping and swiping behaviour on a smartphone.</p><p>\"People get really pent up or particularly worried about brain data, as if that is somehow more true or more real than other forms of data,\" says Carter.</p><p>So does Carter think these brain technologies pose a threat to mental privacy?</p><p>\"They do. But at this stage not beyond the current technology that surrounds smartphones and other kinds of devices.\"</p><p>Carter may well be right. But Ienca points out that rolling advances in gene technology mean we now know much more about genetic data that was collected back in the 1990s.</p><p>\"Once the data are collected they will be there to stay,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"We have limited ability to read and decode those data today but we might be very able to decode those data 20 years from now with better analytic techniques.\"</p><p>Yuste offers an addendum on just how deep that analysis could run.</p><p>\"I think that we should treat neural data as sacred, because that's actually not just our minds, our intentions, but it's also our subconscious,\" he says.</p><p>\"In principle you should be able to decode not just what people are thinking but what they don't know they're thinking.\"</p><p>Yuste is deeply impressed by the work of US neuroscientist Jack Gallant. Almost unbelievably, Gallant has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mindreading-technology-reconstructs-videos-from-brain-20110923-1ko5s.html\">recreated videos people have seen</url> by decoding their brain activity on MRI scans. That decoding can include words linked to images the person saw, such as \"water\" and \"wave\" for a beach scene. Yuste recalls one scene in which a woman appears.</p><p>\"All kinds of words are flashing in the decoder, and it doesn't take too much to think that maybe some of those words are private feelings that the person has for a particular woman ... and maybe even the person is not aware of the extent of those feelings,\" says Yuste.</p><p>Which raises the intriguing possibility that someone else could know your thoughts better than you do.</p><p>Ienca sees these advances as the final iteration in what has been an inexorable undermining of privacy in recent years.</p><p>\"The very last step of this privacy erosion process is making brain information transparent, dismantling the firewalls of the human brain,\" he says.</p><p>What we need, says Ienca, is a firm grasp on the precautionary principle, a rule of thumb whose short form is, roughly, \"better safe than sorry\".</p><p>It's a maxim that may well start to get more airplay as disillusion grows with the mantra of Facebook's Zuckerberg.</p><p>In case anyone needs reminding, that mantra is \"move fast and break things\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520167007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWB-67G1-JBJ7-N1TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2291\"/><timeReceived>08:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the colours aren't on the blackboard. They are lighting up on the kids' foreheads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The children are part of a trial, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3005448/brainwave-tracking-start-china-schoolchildren-controversy-working\">reported earlier this year</url>, in which each is fitted with a brainwave-reading headset, made by Boston-based startup BrainCo, that measures how focused they are on their school work. A small light on the device tells the teacher if those young minds are straying. Blue means relaxed, yellow means focused and red means very focused.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neat. And maybe the headband, which is called Focus 1, is a useful teaching tool. But the experiment also has a darker side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BrainCo has said it aims to \"build the world's largest brainwave database\", a claim that has some neuroscientists worried. Their fears centre on a tsunami of research that is delving deep into people's minds and get ever closer to knowing what they are feeling - and even thinking.</p><p>It is science that threatens what is perhaps the last frontier of privacy: our minds.</p><p>In July, tech guru Elon Musk announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/elon-musk-building-braincomputer-interface-to-protect-against-ai-singularity-20170501-gvw4n1.html\">his company Neuralink</url> had built a tiny Bluetooth-enabled brain chip that he hopes will be trialled next year in people with paralysis, to let them control a computer cursor with their thoughts.</p><p>Musk's implant consists of thousands of flexible thread-like electrodes that are inserted, robotically, via a small incision in the skull into the outer layer of the brain. It's called a brain-computer interface and harvests the same electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals as the Chinese kids' headsets, albeit with much greater resolution.</p><p>The tech could be life-changing, but it's also been racking up serious cachet in brain-reading circles.</p><p>It has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25803\">used to detect words</url>, such as \"cowboys\" and \"swimming\", that people are merely thinking about, just from their brainwaves. And last year a group led by Edward Chang at the University of California San Francisco used a related implant to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4200\">detect people's mood states</url>.</p><p>Then in July, another group from Chang's lab <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10994-4\">deciphered people's answers</url>, and the questions they were responding to, just from EEG signals.</p><p>That work merits special attention because it was funded by Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in a recent interview that he is pushing ahead with plans <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mark-zuckerberg-thinks-telepathy-is-the-future-heres-how-it-could-actually-work-20150702-gi34sc.html\">to develop a brain-machine interface</url> that will, one day, let users don a headset to type posts with their thoughts.</p><p>Given Facebook's questionable record on privacy, you could be forgiven for wondering if that's a good thing; new doco The Great Hack gives chilling insight into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-tries-to-move-on-but-cambridge-analytica-won-t-go-away-20180704-p4zpic.html\">the Cambridge Analytica breach</url> that exposed the data of 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>In particular, one big privacy implication of any Facebook brain-to-text device was nailed by the man questioning Zuckerberg in that interview, Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain.</p><p>\"The Fifth Amendment implications are staggering,\" Zittrain said.</p><p>An all-seeing brain-computer interface could indeed render the right to remain silent - enshrined in the US Constitution - a historical curiosity.</p><p>If all that tech is backing privacy into a corner, it's also getting pushback from some heavy hitters.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a professor of neuroscience at New York's Columbia University, led the team that inspired Barack Obama in 2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/obama-offers-100m-to-map-human-brain-20130403-2h70w.html\">to launch the multibillion-dollar BRAIN initiative</url>, a research program aimed at mapping the wiring and firing of the human brain.</p><p>Yuste has made at least one stellar breakthrough towards that goal. In 2017 his team was the first to record the activity of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127625-entire-nervous-system-of-an-animal-recorded-for-the-first-time/\">entire nervous system of an animal</url> - the pint-sized sea-dwelling Hydra. But Yuste has another passion beyond the lab.</p><p>\"My night job, so to speak, is science advocacy,\" he says.</p><p>Yuste leads an international posse of 25 scientists, ethicists and engineers called the Morningside group. Eighteen months ago in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/news/four-ethical-priorities-for-neurotechnologies-and-ai-1.22960\">article in the journal Nature</url> they argued that the rise of AI and brain-computer interfaces demands a new suite of rights, dubbed \"neurorights\", to protect citizens. A right to \"mental privacy\" is among them.</p><p>His advocacy role took Yuste to an unlikely destination this year. He's been in Chile trying, with doctor and politician Senator Guido Girardi, to amend that country's constitution. They want to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>enshrine brain data protection as a human right</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and, to that end, have two bills before parliament slated for a vote in November.</p><p>Neural data, defined as data taken from brain devices, either invasive or non-invasive, should be defined with the same rigour legally as organ transplantation, says Yuste.</p><p>As happens with kidney donation, he says, the output of our \"mental organ\" must not be traded commercially.</p><p>\"One of the bills that we're introducing in the Chilean parliament legally defines the concept of neural data and makes it illegal to buy or sell it.\"</p><p>Yuste's ambitions, however, are global. He wants neural data protections written into the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As it happens, the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile.</p><p>\"This was not the reason we did this in Chile, but I hope it helps,\" says Yuste.</p><p>The cutting edge of brain reading is still confined to hi-tech labs, but there are plenty of punters who will want to know what data can be siphoned from over-the-counter \"neurowearables\". EEG-reading headsets are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mind-control-eeg-research-closes-in-on-thoughtoperated-computers-20151013-gk7r9t.html\">commercially available for a range of applications</url>, including monitoring mental health and using       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>thoughts to control drones</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> and video games - something called neurogaming.</p><p>Marcello Ienca, a bioethics academic at Swiss technology university ETH Zurich, says those users face some unique vulnerabilities.</p><p>\"It is possible that a malevolent third-party hacker accesses brain signals in an unauthorised manner,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is something that could be easily done in the neurogaming domain because you always have brain activity being measured while visual stimuli are being presented in a virtual environment.\"</p><p>Hackers, says Ienca, could send malware into a game that flashed images of different banks and random numbers. EEG sensors can mine something called a P300 signal, a spike on the trace when a person sees something they recognise. Using P300 spikes, hackers could work out the person's bank and their four-digit PIN number, something that's been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/technical-sessions/presentation/martinovic\">shown in a proof-of-concept study</url>.</p><p>Last year, a group in Toronto used brainwave data from scalp electrodes to <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reconstruct faces people had seen</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. It's an advance that conjures dystopian visions of courts issuing subpoenas for brain data to use as eyewitness testimony, to a murder for example. Granting the tech could ever be reliable enough to meet an evidence requirement, Ienca has plenty of issues with it.</p><p>\"People should not be forced to share content related to their mental states against their will,\" he says.</p><p>Ienca says this could infringe on the right against self-incrimination, if brain data were used to implicate the person in a felony. Ienca also believes extracting brain data under duress could strike at our very core, undermining freedom of thought, a right chiselled into the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>\"Part of what amounts to being a person is having conscious control over the thoughts that we want to share and the thoughts that we want to seclude,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"Once that conscious control is eliminated, the very idea of being an independent person and having personal identity might be undermined.\"</p><p>China may well be a litmus test for where this tech is heading. Last year the South China Morning Post reported Chinese train drivers were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2143899/forget-facebook-leak-china-mining-data-directly-workers-brains\">being fitted with EEG readers</url> in their hat bands. The stated purpose was to monitor stress and improve performance.</p><p>\"I think this is very problematic from an ethical perspective because it is an act of coercion, either explicit or implicit,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The explicit scenario, says Ienca, might be a threat of getting fired if you refuse. Implicit coercion exists in the \"competitive disadvantage\" that comes from not putting your hand up for brain monitoring.</p><p>\"Either scenario is frightening,\" says Ienca.</p><p>The rising threat to mental privacy from neurotech comes as Australia overhauls its own privacy regulation. In March the federal government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Media/Pages/Tougher-penalties-to-keep-australians-safe-online-19.aspx\">announced new protections and penalties</url> under the Privacy Act in the face of an \"explosion in major social media and online platforms that trade in personal information\".</p><p>And in July, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released the final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/need-to-be-held-to-account-government-backs-sweeping-crackdown-on-tech-giants-20190726-p52azl.html\">recommends a raft of new privacy measures</url> targeting players such as Facebook and Google, including the right for users to have their data erased.</p><p>I asked David Watts, professor of Information Law and Policy at La Trobe University and former privacy commissioner for Victoria, if these changes mitigate the privacy threats posed by brain tech.</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"Because all they do is tinker at the edges and this technology is so fundamentally transformative that tinkering around the edges is just not good enough ... they still rely on consent and consent can be gamed.</p><p>\"You're likely to be offered products and services that are so compelling you'll give up consent or you won't even read about it, you'll just tick the box,\" Watts says.</p><p>The remedy, he says, lies in part in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/why-you-should-read-all-those-gdpr-privacy-policy-updates-20180524-p4zh5k.html\">template of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation</url>, implemented last year. It offers a right to opt out of \"automated processing\", the compiling of personal profiles from user data. It also gives the right to an explanation from a human about how an algorithm made a decision about you - for example, to downgrade your credit rating or refuse you a home loan.</p><p>But Watts finds the spectre of brain intrusion so alarming that even stronger measures are warranted.</p><p>\"I would add an absolute right, that could not be foregone by consent, to prevent and criminalise the upload or using of people's brain waves, or their thoughts, for any purpose that was not specifically related to the treatment of certain medical conditions,\" he says.</p><p>In 2017 The Economist pronounced that data is now worth more than oil. Watts is only too aware that even medical device manufacturers may be conflicted once in possession of users' increasingly valuable brain data. Such data would be of undoubted interest to political parties, adding insights beyond even the laser-like voter profiling seen in the 2016 US election.</p><p>\"This is an incredibly refined version of that. It makes it look like caster sugar as compared to molasses,\" says Watts.</p><p>Amid the fears around emerging neurotech there is a tempering voice. It belongs to Associate Professor Adrian Carter, a neuroethicist at Monash University in Melbourne.</p><p>\"I come back to not overhyping what these technologies can do,\" says Carter.</p><p>Carter points out the data tech behemoths have on us now already gives them profound insights into our behaviour. Chain store Target's claimed ability to know which of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/04/15/3985934.htm\">its customers is pregnant</url> has been a much-publicised example.</p><p>\"I don't think there is anything particularly special about brain data. Our interaction with smartphones is a surrogate measure of what's going on in the brain,\" says Carter.</p><p>Mindstrong Health, says Carter, has an app they claim could <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one day help diagnose Parkinson's disease</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> using your scrolling, tapping and swiping behaviour on a smartphone.</p><p>\"People get really pent up or particularly worried about brain data, as if that is somehow more true or more real than other forms of data,\" says Carter.</p><p>So does Carter think these brain technologies pose a threat to mental privacy?</p><p>\"They do. But at this stage not beyond the current technology that surrounds smartphones and other kinds of devices.\"</p><p>Carter may well be right. But Ienca points out that rolling advances in gene technology mean we now know much more about genetic data that was collected back in the 1990s.</p><p>\"Once the data are collected they will be there to stay,\" says Ienca.</p><p>\"We have limited ability to read and decode those data today but we might be very able to decode those data 20 years from now with better analytic techniques.\"</p><p>Yuste offers an addendum on just how deep that analysis could run.</p><p>\"I think that we should treat neural data as sacred, because that's actually not just our minds, our intentions, but it's also our subconscious,\" he says.</p><p>\"In principle you should be able to decode not just what people are thinking but what they don't know they're thinking.\"</p><p>Yuste is deeply impressed by the work of US neuroscientist Jack Gallant. Almost unbelievably, Gallant has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mindreading-technology-reconstructs-videos-from-brain-20110923-1ko5s.html\">recreated videos people have seen</url> by decoding their brain activity on MRI scans. That decoding can include words linked to images the person saw, such as \"water\" and \"wave\" for a beach scene. Yuste recalls one scene in which a woman appears.</p><p>\"All kinds of words are flashing in the decoder, and it doesn't take too much to think that maybe some of those words are private feelings that the person has for a particular woman ... and maybe even the person is not aware of the extent of those feelings,\" says Yuste.</p><p>Which raises the intriguing possibility that someone else could know your thoughts better than you do.</p><p>Ienca sees these advances as the final iteration in what has been an inexorable undermining of privacy in recent years.</p><p>\"The very last step of this privacy erosion process is making brain information transparent, dismantling the firewalls of the human brain,\" he says.</p><p>What we need, says Ienca, is a firm grasp on the precautionary principle, a rule of thumb whose short form is, roughly, \"better safe than sorry\".</p><p>It's a maxim that may well start to get more airplay as disillusion grows with the mantra of Facebook's Zuckerberg.</p><p>In case anyone needs reminding, that mantra is \"move fast and break things\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520167007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWB-JNC1-JBJ7-N0FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2291\"/><timeReceived>08:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They could use Google Home to page a nurse, request spiritual care, or find out when their doctor is scheduled to arrive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Already, Beth Israel Deaconess has tested how both the Alexa and Google Home ambient listening devices might work with inpatients. The medical center is also considering how these technologies could be used to help physicians with tasks such as accessing patient data without having to click through electronic files.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such applications could be just the start of advances ushered in by consumer tech giants, said John D. Halamka, MD, MS, chief information officer for Beth Israel Deaconess and dean for technology at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>The healthcare industry is ripe for digital transformation, according to healthcare and health IT executives like Halamka. Given that, it is not surprising speculation is rampant about what the giant consumer tech companies-specifically Amazon, Apple, and Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc-might bring to healthcare.</p><p>Although all these companies are not disclosing ideas for future healthcare products, leading health IT officials say their innovative histories and experience with disruption could bring significant tech-driven improvements to how physicians work and deliver care.</p><p>\"I don't think Google, Apple, or Amazon are going to be competitors to existing EHR vendors, but they'll be highly complementary and bring [beneficial] functions to patients and providers and enhance the usability and the experience of what we do,\" said Dr. Halamka, a practicing emergency physician.</p><p>Yet experts also say physicians should not look to these companies to deliver revolutionary improvements or any panaceas. Like any other companies in this field, they have high barriers to overcome-from creating technologies that meet any regulatory requirements to understanding the unique workflows and processes that exist in healthcare.</p><p>\"I see incremental innovation, but it's not going to fundamentally change the way we deliver care,\" said Joseph C. Kvedar, MD, vice president of Partners HealthCare Connected Health, a Boston-based organization studying technology-enabled care delivery and connected health programs. \"No tech company can change care delivery. Care delivery has to be changed by people who deliver care. So if you're looking for any of these to be a savior, I very much doubt that will be the case.\"</p><p>PERSISTEN! SPECULATION</p><p>U.S. spending for healthcare grew 4.3% in 2016, reaching $3.3 trillion, or $10,348 per person, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts. Healthcare spending that year accounted for 17.9% of gross domestic product.</p><p>Given the size of the market, health IT practitioners, analysts, and researchers say it's not surprising that a growing number of companies are looking at breaking into the space or trying to grow their share of the business.</p><p>\"It's a very attractive business opportunity,\" said Michael Hodgkins, MD, MPH, chief medical information officer with the AMA.</p><p>Apple already has a presence in healthcare. For instance, it has its own CareKit and ResearchKit frameworks that software developers can use to develop applications on Apple's platform.</p><p>In late January, Apple announced its launch of a personal health record app that will bring together health data generated by the user and integrate it with the user's EHR data-provided that person is also a patient at one of 12 participating medical centers it is partnering with.</p><p>Likewise, Amazon works with healthcare institutions, with offerings such as cloud-based products designed specifically to facilitate medical work, including genomics research, biotech and pharma projects, and healthcare analytics for providers. It also works with institutions such as Beth Israel Deaconess to pilot Alexa and other technologies in medical settings.</p><p>Amazon aims to use technology to improve healthcare delivery for its own employees as well. The company recently Continues on page 64: Big tech announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase to create a new independent healthcare entity that will provide services for their employees. In announcing the move, the companies said they'll rely on technology to provide \"simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.\" However, the companies did not provide further details on how that they plan to do that, noting that the effort is in the early planning stages.</p><p>Alphabet, too, has targeted the healthcare market. Google, for instance, offers analytics products that leverage its vast data sets and artificial intelligence technologies, and secure workplace tools such as encryption and storage through its G Suite for Healthcare. Meanwhile, Verily Life Sciences LLC, another Alphabet company, offers tools for collecting, organizing, and analyzing health data.</p><p>There are reports, however, that these companies have a growing interest in offering more products and services designed specifically for the medical field. For example, news stories appearing in 2017 from multiple places, including Business Insider, CNBC, and Reuters, report that Amazon acquired wholesale pharmacy licenses in several states, indicating that the company could expand into pharmaceuticals.</p><p>An October 23, 2017, item on CNBC.com quotes Apple COO Jeff Williams saying the healthcare industry is \"ripe for change\" and that he \"can't think of anything more significant\" than using technology to advance healthcare.</p><p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment, while Amazon responded that it has \"a longstanding practice of not commenting on rumors and speculation.\"</p><p>A Google spokesman, in a written statement, pointed to the company's online information about its work in the healthcare field, adding that \"Google is doing a lot of AI research for healthcare, using machine learning (that is, training computers to learn by example, rather than being explicitly programmed) to improve outcomes.\"</p><p>IMPROVEMENTS EXPECTED</p><p>Many experts agree that the industry has lagged other sectors when it comes to using IT to create efficiencies, eliminate waste, and drive improvements.</p><p>As a result, institutions and individual employees, including physicians, have ended up with systems that don't work well, are difficult to use or both. Doctors frequently complain that EHR systems-with their data-entry needs-take their focus off of patients, that entering and retrieving information takes too long, and that they don't easily share information with other systems.</p><p>\"Physicians tell us the current tools are clunky. We don't have interoperability and we can't use information across different systems,\" says Joel White, executive director of Health IT Now, a coalition of patient groups, provider organizations, employers, and payers supporting health IT to improve patient outcomes.</p><p>White and others say the possible entry of Amazon, Apple, and other consumer-focused tech companies could bring IT system improvements that have so far eluded healthcare.</p><p>White says the tech giants bring their strong understanding of what users want out of their technologies and the ability to deliver highly intuitive products and products with userfriendly interfaces. They also bring capital. \"It all says to me that this could be incredibly disruptive,\" White adds.</p><p>He says that even mere speculation around what Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, and others might do in healthcare has brought increased competition and thus put more pressure on existing health IT vendors to deliver better products. \"What we're already seeing is the market changing in response. Competition is awesome; it forces people to up their game,\" White says, noting, for example, that some EHR vendors say they're putting more resources toward addressing physician complaints about poor usability.</p><p>TRANSFORMATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>The consumer tech giants bring more than just competition to the market, however. White and others point to a host of functionalities that the companies are mastering-functionalities that could transform how physicians work and how they deliver care.</p><p>\"These companies have really pushed forward with consumer-facing artificial intelligence, speech recognition and verbal communication with Alexa and Siri and Google Home. Those are really the strengths of those companies,\" says Robert Rowley, MD, a healthcare and health IT consultant based in Hayward, CA.</p><p>Dr. Rowley says he expects tech companies to develop products for physicians that are more intuitive and easier to use, so they're not tied to their keyboards doing data entry while treating patients-something doctors frequently cite as one of the biggest problems with current EHRs.</p><p>He also expects these tech companies to deliver AI components that can instantaneously analyze information to assist physicians better in identifying patterns and relevant findings in the data so as to recommend the best course of action for each patient.</p><p>\"We can envision a future EHR where [the physician] can take his phone or Alexa into the exam room, can pre-populate that EHR, and where data from the patients' devices can be [uploaded] to create documentation to help flesh out what's going on,\" he says.</p><p>Dr. Rowley explains that the ability for an EHR to take in and analyze such data can quickly provide physicians with a more complete picture of the patient's conditions and medical needs-thereby helping to generate treatment plans that produce better outcomes. For example, a physician could upload from a patient's smartphone his or her at-home blood sugar readings to see how well the patient's diabetes is controlled outside the doctor's office.</p><p>BARRIERS TO MARKET ENTRY</p><p>Despite the buzz around what tech giants are doing in the healthcare space, the AMA's Dr. Hodgkins cautions against expecting a technology revolution any time soon. \"This is d\u00e9ja vu all over again; there have been cycles of companies from outside healthcare coming in only to leave it,\" he says.</p><p>He cites Google Health, the personal health data records service that failed after a couple of years, to illustrate his observation.</p><p>Additionally, Dr. Hodgkins says, any company that wants to successfully deliver innovative technologies must understand the nuances of delivering care, regulatory requirements, insurance requirements and many other factors unique to the medical industry.</p><p>Dr. Hodgkins says adding more products that can't easily share data \"will just amplify the problems out there today.\" To help counter this, the AMA created its Integrated Health Model Initiative as a way to bring together the health and technology sectors to build a common data model.</p><p>Others point to barriers to entering the health IT market such as delivering products that are compliant with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Dr. Halamka notes, for example, that Alexa, Google Home and Siri aren't HIPAA-compliant, which limits what types of tasks can be performed using those forms of voicerecognition technologies.</p><p>Dr. Kvedar, meanwhile, cautions against pinning too much hope on transformation from the Apple platform, pointing out that nearly half the world's smartphones run on the Android platform-and Apple products don't run on its competitor's operating systems.</p><p>He notes that CVS and Walgreens, both of which have developed mobile apps at the same time, are offering healthcare services in addition to pharmaceuticals, are just as likely to disrupt healthcare as any of the tech giants.</p><p>As a result of such barriers, some technology analysts and experts say existing health IT vendors also could deliver innovations, because they already have a history of working with these industry-specific requirements.</p><p>Still, Dr. Hodgkins thinks the consumer technology companies are the ones worth watching when it comes to disrupting the industry. \"I do firmly believe that these consumer tech companies have something very important to offer,\" he says, \"and it has to do with how to best engage the patient/consumer, because we can't be successful without that.\" ?</p><p>Editor's Note: This article originally appeared in sister publication, Medical Economics.</p><p>TAKE-HOME</p><p>Consumer tech giants bring more than just competition to the market.

McCarthy cites IBM's Watson, which uses AI to assist physicians with analyzing medical scans and other data for diagnosis and research findings, as one example of such a product.</p><p>McCarthy says such products help physicians to be more efficient by eliminating the multitude of clicks and data-entry requirements in their current EHRs.</p><p>She also expects big tech companies entering the healthcare market to offer better population health management solutions, thereby helping physicians produce better outcomes for patients struggling with chronic conditions-a significant prospect as more and more insurers move to reimbursing physicians based on results rather than services.</p><p>Farzad Mostashari, MD, former National Coordinator for Health IT at the Department of Health and Human Services, predicts that Amazon will enter healthcare by offering supply chain services.</p><p>Dr. Mostashari, co-founder and CEO of Bethesda, MD-based Aledade Inc., a nationwide network of accountable care organizations, predicts that Amazon will lean on its usability and scale to compete in that area with potentially better pricing, customer service and usability for customers of all sizes.</p><p>And he predicts that Apple and Google will bring to market products that will help tackle one of the biggest problems vexing healthcare today-the lack of data portability.</p><p>Dr. Mostashari says he envisions a future technology where the patient would store and control his or her own medical records with additional applications enabling the patient to access and share what's needed when it's needed with physicians and other providers.</p><p>\"That would be my dream of how the internet giants could enter healthcare,\" he says, noting that Apple and Google already have applications that work similarly in other industries, such as travel and banking. A case in point is Apple Wallet, which allows users to store and manage credit cards, store loyalty cards, tickets to shows and other events, boarding passes and coupon codes.</p><p>On helping patients control their own medical records: 'That would be my dream of how the internet giants could enter healthcare.'</p><p>-Farzad Mostashari, MD, former National Coordinator for Health IT</p><p>'I don't think Google, Apple, or Amazon are going to be competitors to existing EHR vendors.'</p><p>-John D.

It's an incredibly popular tourist destination, offering the towering Burj Khalifa, desert safaris, and endless indoor and outdoor attractions[1]. It has also been home to an inordinate population explosion, growing from one million people just a decade ago to over nine million today. But one of the most interesting features of Dubai is its place as an entrepreneurial Mecca, offering many unique opportunities to prospective business owners looking to get a foot in the area and sponsoring dozens of high-growth companies.We're already starting to see the fruits of this transition; for example, Dubai was home to the fast-growing ridesharing service Careem[2], which is now available in dozens of cities throughout the Middle East, and the popular peer-to-peer mobile payments app Bridg[3]. Dubai has already made an impressive name for itself on the world stage, and now it may have one more advantage to hold over its competing metropolitan areas; Dubai could be the world's next biggest global startup hub.Poised for GrowthDubai is considered to be one of the five fastest-growing metropolitan areas[4] in the world, and part of this is due to its unique location. In the United Arab Emirates, Dubai is a central hub, capable of reaching the Middle East, Africa, and Asia with relative ease. </p><p>Strong emerging markets, like those in Pakistan, India, and northeastern Africa are ripe for entrepreneurial opportunities \u2014 and Dubai represents a focal point that can reach all of them at once[5]. Entrepreneurs and investors see this as an entryway, or a kind of gateway drug that could lead to more potential. With these developing countries poised for explosive technological and economic growth, it's no wonder why so many business leaders want to get in on the ground level.Incubators and AcceleratorsPartially because of its high propensity for growth, Dubai has become home to a number of startup accelerators and incubators, all of which are designed to help young entrepreneurs build a foundation for their ideas, and earn the support they need to make their businesses a reality. For example, in5 Media Innovation Center[6] offers creative spaces, mentorship programs, and networking opportunities, and Turn8[7] has collected a massive venture capital fund to close funding gaps for promising startups.Governmental SupportIt also helps that the UAE has been subject to an ambitious economic program from its government, and as a result, it now boasts a GDP of more than $45,000 per capita[8]. The UAE is an all-around tax haven. Companies do not pay taxes. Individuals do not pay taxes\u2014not even expats. To entrepreneurs who dream of building wealth, this is a dream come true. In addition, Dubai sponsors a number of incubator and accelerator programs (as you've seen in the previous section) and continues to invest in entrepreneurial activities. The economic strength of the region also owes thanks to Dubai and the UAE's decision to diversify their economic reliance. While most Middle Eastern countries have grown accustomed to relying on their vast oil reserves to fuel a commodity-based economy, Dubai has been reinvesting in more trade avenues, infrastructure, and service industries. As a result, it's been insulated from the recent drop in oil prices \u2014 which has crushed some of its neighboring countries' economies. Speaking of neighboring countries, Dubai gets to boost its economy even further thanks to the UAE government's open stance on free trade. While other countries in the area have remained staunchly opposed to opening their borders, trying to remain as autonomous and independent as possible, the UAE openly encourages free trade with limited regulations and restrictions. In fact, it's even home to the International Financial Centre[9], an area where regulation against the foreign-originated ownership of businesses is nonexistent.Angel Investors and Venture CapitalistsDubai is famously home to some of the wealthiest people in the world, attractive to billionaires[10] looking for a high-class vacation spot and wealthy businesspeople looking for a place to settle down. Of course, there are a handful of downsides to this; the cost of living in Dubai is high \u2014 though not as exorbitant as you might imagine \u2014 and the area is home to a rigid class structure that makes living in poverty nearly impossible. Still, the prevalence of wealthy individuals is enough to make its environment of angel investors and venture capitalists flourish. Investors aren't exactly giving money away, but for the right entrepreneur with a solid business plan and a good idea, there's plenty of capital available to start building momentum.The Service IndustryAbout 28 percent of the entire GDP[11] of the UAE is tied up in trade and tourism, and as a result, the service industry is thriving. Hotels, restaurants, and special attractions are all booming in the area, serving tourists and locals alike. This high-trade, high-service industry is a prime opportunity for emerging startups; since residents and tourists are freely spending money, consumer-facing applications have a high chance of building initial momentum, so long as their ideas are feasible and attractive. With its unique location, the government's continued investment in infrastructure and business development, and enormous public visibility, it's unlikely that Dubai will stop growing or expanding anytime soon. Currently serving as one of the world's biggest and highest-potential startup hubs, this is only the beginning of what the UAE city has to offer.

Facebook has hired top lawmakers in the past, including Timothy Muris, former chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission, and Kevin Martin, former chair of the Federal Communications Commission.

Claims that Facebook has swayed elections or even played a role in genocide are appalling, but difficult to prove. A monopoly is quantifiable. Facebook has a market share of 77 per cent of social media use in Europe, not including Instagram, which it owns. The original uses of the mobile phone, speech and messaging, have largely been captured by WhatsApp, which serves 65 billion messages and 3,800 years\u2019 worth of calls a day, and is owned, again, by Facebook.\u00a0</p><p>  When Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in April 2018, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham asked him to name his main competitor, or a product that consumers could choose instead. As Zuckerberg stalled, Graham asked if Facebook was a monopoly. The best Zuckerberg could offer was that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like that to me\u201d.</p><p>  The documents seized in late November by Damian Collins, chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, detail a pattern of activity at Facebook that certainly feels anti-competitive. Competitors that used Facebook\u2019s Onavo app \u2013 sold as a security measure \u2013 were monitored. Commercial partners were \u201cwhitelisted\u201d for special access to user data. On 24 January 2013, Twitter \u2013 Facebook \u2018s biggest competitor for social media market share \u2013 launched an app called Vine, which enabled users to post short, shareable videos. The same day, Facebook\u2019s vice president Justin Osofsky emailed Mark Zuckerberg to warn him that Vine users could \u201cfind friends via FB [Facebook]\u201d and to suggest they \u201cshut down their friends API access today\u201d \u2013 throttling the data that Vine could receive from its own users. Zuckerberg replied: \u201cYup, go for it.\u201d</p><p>Facebook is also a new kind of company \u2013 global, nebulous and constantly changing. The economist Jean Tirole points out that natural monopolies occur when a technology\u2019s \u201cessential facility\u201d cannot realistically be duplicated. Railway lines, an energy grid or a telephone network all do one job for which it is very hard to create a competing alternative. Last century, it was possible to break up Standard Oil and AT&amp;T into smaller entities without affecting the services they provided. Yet Facebook\u2019s essential facility is less clear \u2013 is it a social network; a publisher of video, text, pictures and games; a communications service; or an advertising agency? Nor can it be separated into equally valuable components; Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus and others are interdependent, and the data they share is crucial to Facebook\u2019s dominance.</p><p>  There is also the question of who gets to regulate Facebook, and how. The EU can issue heavy fines, but a company that serves 2.2 billion people around the world is a slippery thing to regulate. This is why Facebook, despite having made \u00a31.3bn from advertising sales in the UK last year, paid just \u00a37.4m net tax (0.62 per cent).</p><p>  The political will to tame Facebook may also waver. Donald Trump has said that his administration is \u201ccertainly looking\u201d at antitrust allegations, but his new North American Free Trade Agreement gives Facebook more power to challenge US regulators. It must also be asked why he would regulate a company credited with assisting his rise to power.</p><p>  Yet this does not mean that 2019 will be a great year for Facebook, because there are still two agents who can do more than any regulator to curtail Facebook\u2019s power. These are the agents who gave it that power in the first place: the user and the investor.</p><p>  On 25 July last year, Facebook\u2019s total stock market capitalisation was over $620bn (\u00a3490bn). This is as much as $500bn (\u00a3395bn) more than all the revenue it has earned since it became cash-flow positive in 2009. On 26 July, Facebook published quarterly results that showed slower-than-expected growth of both revenue and users. The company\u2019s stock fell 20 per cent, wiping $120bn (\u00a390.8bn) off its market cap; it has since fallen to its lowest level for more than 18 months. In less than an hour, Zuckerberg lost an amount of money comparable to the yearly GDP of Cambodia.</p><p>  In September, Pew Research published a survey of 3,400 Facebook users which found that 44 per cent of the 18-29 age group had deleted the Facebook app from their phone in the past year. This, more than anything else, should be Facebook\u2019s wake-up call; nearly every trend in internet use has been led by the young. These users are the product Facebook sells to its clients, and they appear to be leaving in droves.</p><p>  This could be because of Facebook\u2019s many scandals. But\u00a0 monopolies are also dull. And on the internet, sold to the young as a cure for boredom, no regulator is as powerful as the simple decision to switch off.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read all the pieces in our \u201c2019 \u2013 the big questions\u201d\u00a0series:\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Bew: Will Trump go to war?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Felix Martin: Will there be another crash?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">George Eaton: Will Brexit actually happen?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anna Leszkiewicz: Are TV channels irrelevant?</emphasis></p><p>  Paul Mason: Will the far right triumph in Europe?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V43-J8V1-DYX2-C14R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Statesman Ltd.

Each agency seems hungrier than the next \u2014 for the revenue that can be extracted from fines and judgments against the tech giants and for the opportunity to be seen as bringing two very large corporations to heel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The assault on Facebook has been the big story of late. A month ago, \"the Federal Trade Commission approved a fine of roughly $5 billion against Facebook for mishandling users' personal information,\" The New York Times reported, calling it \"a landmark settlement that signals a newly aggressive stance by regulators toward the country's most powerful technology companies.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A month ago, Politico reported that President Trump had pledged to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions\" to address the market power of Big Tech. And in recent weeks, as the Times reported, \"Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has joined two leading antitrust academics, Scott Hemphill of New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, in meetings with the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and state attorneys general. In those meetings, the three have laid out a potential antitrust case against Facebook, Mr. Wu and Mr. Hemphill said.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, a Facebook board member and prominent Silicon Valley investor, Peter Thiel, took to The New York Times op-ed page to back up his recent characterization of Google's work with Chinese researchers on artificial intelligence as \"seemingly treasonous.\" Thiel wrote, \"AI's military power is the simple reason that the recent behavior of America's leading software company, Google \u2014 starting an AI lab in China while ending an AI contract with the Pentagon \u2014 is shocking.\" As Ash Carter, who was defense secretary in the Obama administration, pointed out last month, \"If you're working in China, you don't know whether you're working on a project for the military or not.\"</p><p>Google hasn't said much in response to Thiel's attacks or those of other critics. Facebook has responded by (1) preparing to lease vast amounts of office space in mid-town Manhattan, (2) announcing its intention to create a global cryptocurrency \u2014 Libra \u2014 that will \"bank the unbanked\" and completely disrupt the remittance business, and (3) declaring its intention to rebrand WhatsApp and Instagram as WhatsApp from Facebook and Instagram from Facebook.</p><p>The exploring of office space in Manhattan was an unsubtle message to Wall Street that Facebook is deadly serious about entering the financial services arena and unconcerned about competing with the incumbent banks. With about 1.6 billion daily average users, Facebook's entrance into any business is almost automatically disruptive, because it is able to operate at almost unimaginable scale. If it takes dead aim at the endless cascade of fees on overdrafts, credit cards, remittances (and the like) that the banking business depends on, Facebook immediately poses an existential threat to those incumbent institutions.</p><p>Facebook's entrance into the cryptocurrency arena was less an unveiling of a \"Facebook Bitcoin\" and more like the introduction of a sovereign currency. No less than the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, Jay Powell, took note, saying: \"While the project's sponsors hold out the possibility of public benefits, including improved financial access for consumers, Libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, and financial stability. These are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed before proceeding.\"</p><p>Finally, taking note of anti-trust proposals for breaking up Facebook by divesting it of Instagram, WhatsApp and perhaps its Messenger app, Facebook took the unusual step of making two of its most successful operating companies less attractive to millennial consumers by rebranding those applications with two words: \"From Facebook.\" As in: We own them.</p><p>In his seminal essay on Facebook, John Lanchester wrote: \"It's important to bear in mind that thefacebook \u2014 its original name \u2014 was launched exclusively for Harvard students in 2004. No human enterprise, no new technology or utility or service, has ever been adopted so widely so quickly. The speed of uptake far exceeds that of the Internet itself, let alone ancient technologies such as television or cinema or radio.\"</p><p>Facebook didn't get to where it is today by going along to get along. It got here by being opportunistic and ruthless and relentlessly determined. It understands its leverage and its power, as does Google, whose business success is every bit as astounding as that of Facebook.</p><p>The leverage both companies have, in dealing with the US government, is in the field of artificial intelligence. Everyone, from President Xi Jinping of China and his People's Liberation Army to the Pentagon and the White House (and Vladimir Putin in between), understands the importance of AI leadership.</p><p>Indeed, Putin had this to say two years ago: \"Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also [with] threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\"</p><p>Who is the leader in AI research at the moment? It depends on how you measure it, but the rough consensus is: The United States leads, followed by China, England, Canada, Japan, and Germany.</p><p>The United States is the leader in large measure because of the research being done at Facebook and Google.</p><p>According to Machine Box CEO Aaron Edell, \"80 percent of all machine learning engineers work at Google or Facebook.\" Of the three winners of the 2018 Turing Prize \u2014 the Nobel Prize of computer science, basically \u2014 one spends half his time working for Google and another is the chief AI scientist at Facebook.</p><p>What happens if Facebook and Google grow tired of what they almost certainly regard as regulatory encroachment and government overreach? What happens if Facebook and Google spin off their AI research companies and re-domicile those companies in, say, Canada?</p><p>One thing that happens is that Canada becomes the world's leading superpower, overnight, by virtue of its being the new home to the world's two greatest AI research organizations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the people of Canada might find that prospect quite agreeable.</p><p>What happens if Facebook decides that it doesn't want to get slow-rolled on its Libra project by the Federal Reserve and the SEC and the Comptroller of the Currency and the Treasury Department and the Department of Justice and ad infinitum?</p><p>One thing it might do is pay a visit to Trudeau and open up a dialogue about how a de facto sovereign state (Facebook) and a de jure sovereign state (Canada) might partner up to create a new global cryptocurrency tied in some fashion to the Canadian dollar (the aptly named \"loonie\"). To run that kind of operation on a global scale, a massive amount of electrical power will be needed to keep the computer servers working 24/7. And as it happens, the fourth largest hydropower producer in the world, Hydro-Quebec, stands ready to serve.</p><p>On the matter of breaking up Facebook in a far-reaching antitrust action, don't look for resolution anytime soon. Facebook has vast amounts of cash and will no doubt spend as much as it takes to bollix up government prosecution. Eventually, some kind of settlement will be reached, and by that time it may not matter.</p><p>The fact is that Facebook and Google aren't really companies in the traditional sense of that word. Because power in the modern era derives from AI, machine learning, and data science, they are more like corporate countries than companies.</p><p>One option available to them is to become a country, by partnering with a sovereign state like Canada. Such an undertaking, obviously, would be fiendishly difficult to execute. No one has ever sat down and written the legal code for a corporate-sovereign national partnership. But that doesn't mean it can't be done.</p><p>US regulators and legislators would be well-advised to proceed with caution on whatever plans they have in mind for Facebook and Google (and the rest of Big Tech). One might even say they should proceed with extreme caution, since in the realm of artificial intelligence, those companies are the difference between the balance of power and superpower.</p><p>John Ellis, a former Globe columnist, is editor of News Items.

Facebook keeps us connected. Amazon anticipates our shopping desires and delivers them fast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as the importance of these software-driven, data-collecting, money-making giants in our lives has mushroomed, so too have concerns that these sprawling businesses - whose combined market cap is a whopping $1.6 trillion - have grown too big, too influential, too unmonitored. Too much the Big Brother that dystopians warn about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's particularly striking about the growing chorus criticizing Google, Facebook and Amazon is it comes from all corners, from consumers to congressmen, from the conservative right (including President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon) to the liberal left (Sen. Elizabeth Warren).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives charge that platforms such as Facebook suppress exposure to their views, while companies such as Google unfairly demonize employees who raise controversial issues. And liberals decry Facebook's role in the proliferation of false information that played a role in the presidential election, and sound antitrust alarms as Amazon looks to dominate yet another industry.</p><p>Consumers also have fears. They don't trust the computer algorithms that determine what Facebook updates they see from friends. They wonder about the veracity of the search links that Google delivers. And they fear that Amazon, the \"everything\" store, will put every brick and mortar retailer out of business.</p><p>Patsy Wehner, 44, who works at a military store in Severna Park, Md., adores her Amazon Prime membership, something she shares with about 85 million Americans. But she also senses she's \"in a Catch-22 of sorts,\" trading short-term convenience for long-term troubles.</p><p>\"I feel that monopoly companies are just bad for business,\" she says. \"Because then, when all of the other stores are gone, they can change prices to be sky-high and we won't be able to do anything about it besides gripe.\"</p><p>Cost of convenience</p><p>Long praised as shining examples of American innovation, Internet companies for years enjoyed a collective pass from consumers and lawmakers enamored with their ease and seemingly overnight ability to vault us into the future.</p><p>Antitrust laws anchored to a singular concern - fair competition for the benefit of consumers - didn't touch disruptive companies providing goods and services that were often cheaper, if not free.</p><p>But while few experts predict the breakup of big tech in the way that railroads and oil companies were dismantled, Silicon Valley's biggest players are now facing the kind of grilling usually reserved for Wall Street hedge funds and big banks.</p><p>Facebook and Google have come under the most intense pressure from U.S. lawmakers they've ever faced - scrutiny that's likely to at least prove a new cost. Consider the $2.7-billion fine recently levied against Google by European regulators, which said Google gave an unfair advantage to its own shopping service in its search results. Google has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>This new pressure could possibly hamper growth. Facebook, in response to congressional investigators looking at the sales of $100,000 in Russian ads on its platform during the U.S. election, has already promised a change to how it sells political ads.</p><p>While Amazon's rampant business deals rarely caused a stir in the past, its recent $13.7-billion purchase of Whole Foods was flagged for its monopolistic implications by some Democrats.</p><p>The deal eventually was approved by the Federal Trade Commission, citing no evidence it would lessen competition - likely a reflection of Amazon's mere 2% share of the $600-billion grocery market. Yet the debate put a new spotlight on the Seattle-based company's tightening yoke over all facets of retail shopping, from books to shoes to music, and now, fresh food.</p><p>\"We should really be concerned about the influence these companies have on the ways we structure out thoughts and our lives,\" says Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of \"The Googlization of Everything: (And Why We Should Worry).\"</p><p>\"Our everyday interaction with Google and Facebook seems to imply no danger or annoyance,\" he says. \"But that doesn't mean there is nothing to worry about.\"</p><p>In a SurveyMonkey poll for USA TODAY, 76% of respondents felt technology companies were getting too influential in the lives of everyday Americans, with 52% describing this influence as a bad thing.</p><p>When asked whether they were concerned about unchecked growth, such as the recent Whole Foods deal, opinions were almost evenly split, the SurveyMonkey poll found, but monopolies concerned 30% of respondents, and layoffs 19%. On the flip side, some felt such consolidations increased innovation (28%) and lowered prices (19%).</p><p>\"In the back of my mind I'm thinking, 'Yes, I am paying a price for this (convenience),'\" says Lisa Carey, 50, who runs a social media marketing company in Houston and is regularly logged onto dozens of platforms daily. \"People give out so much information (to tech companies), and they think it doesn't mean anything but it does.\"</p><p>Worries over tech companies getting too big have rippled across the political divide.</p><p>Lina Khan of Open Markets Institute, who wrote a case study using Amazon to argue for remaking antitrust laws, says that liberals and conservatives are in rare agreement over the fact that \"this level of gatekeeper power among a handful of companies is anathema to democracy.\"</p><p>Last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Warren warned that Google and Amazon were trying to \"snuff out competition,\" while Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., this month said Facebook's Russian ad debacle is \"the tip of the iceberg\" for the social network.</p><p>Conservative Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, echoing the sentiments of former White House adviser Bannon, recently argued that large tech companies should be regulated as utilities, citing in particular its \"power to censor the Internet.\"</p><p>The right recently rallied around James Damore, the Google engineer who released a treatise criticizing Google's efforts to hire and promote more women and people of color, lambasting the company for a \"politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.\" He was dismissed by the company for suggesting women weren't as biologically suited to tech as men.</p><p>Monopoly concerns</p><p>\"It doesn't matter which side of the political aisle you're on, what matters is these are the largest corporations in the world and they accumulated too much political power,\" said Jonathan Taplin, also a tech-as-utility advocate and author of \"Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\"</p><p>Taplin notes that Microsoft ran into the same sort of controversy when it was sued in 2001 by the U.S. government on grounds that it had created a software monopoly.</p><p>\"People didn't like Microsoft and AT&amp;T because they were monopolies, and now they're waking up to the fact that Google and Facebook are as well, and Amazon is on the cusp.\"</p><p>Exhibit A could be the fact that Google and Facebook have come to utterly dominate the U.S. digital ad market, according to a new study by research firm eMarketer. The two are now expected to rake in a combined 63.1% of U.S. digital ad spending in 2017, up from eMarketer's previous prediction of 60.4%.</p><p>That sort of control is bound to have repercussions, says Scott Galloway, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and author of the upcoming book \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\" \"The worm has turned,\" he says.</p><p>Galloway predicts that within the next year European regulators will levy \"the mother of all fines, maybe $10 billion\" against a U.S. tech company, \"mainly because where we in the U.S. see most of the upsides from these companies, Europeans don't get the financial impact and see most of the downsides.\"</p><p>He also expects that what can be best described as the arrogance of some tech companies - he cites Amazon's recent competition among U.S. cities to provide it with the best subsidies for its second headquarters - will prove to be fodder for upcoming politicians. Amazon has framed this contest as a search for \"second home\" that will bring $5 billion in investment and 40,000 jobs.</p><p>\"Amazon's trying to extract billions in tax credits instead of being the best corporate citizen in the world,\" says Galloway. \"That's short-sighted, because soon people will say that what's good for the consumer might not be good for society.\"</p><p>Some experts suggest that a call to curtail the power of some tech companies may come from new political actors eager to tap into these growing Red and Blue State grumblings. While Trump administration officials have not displayed an eagerness to curtail Facebook, Google and Amazon, those vying for the White House next may sing a more modern antitrust tune.</p><p>\"Americans don't like bigness, whether it's big businesses or big government,\" says Margaret O'Mara, a University of Washington history professor who focuses on the high tech economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Google was fined $2.7 billion by European regulators for unfair competition.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Special for USA TODAY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DETFRP-dfp-1858926833</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DETFRP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJY-9921-JC3H-00H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247193</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Detroit Free Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Detroit Free Press (Michigan)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 26, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But California's sweeping law goes a few steps further than the city's June 2018 bylaw. It allows secondary units everywhere, not just on lots that share a property line with a public laneway, and includes suburban communities across the state.</p><p>Toronto's bylaw is just for Toronto and East York. The planning and housing committee recently recommended expanding it across the city. But this needs final approval from council and would still sharply limit how many secondary units can be built as most laneways are downtown.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>TTC vehicles get caught in gridlock too often. Transit planners want to change that</p><p>Small apartment buildings are virtually impossible to build in much of Toronto. What are we afraid of?</p><p>The California law is no silver bullet. But it is \"a silver buck shot,\" says Brown with a laugh, a reference to a hunting shot where multiple pellets scatter at a target.</p><p>It's also a way to get around NIMBY (not in my backyard) neighbours who might oppose the density a multi-story housing tower would bring. Brown sees ADUs as a \"different and flexible way\" to add a lot of housing units relatively quickly.</p><p>\"A garage is already there. So it won't look or feel any different at all,\" she says. \"I see it as very complementary to rededicating our cities to people, instead of cars.\"</p><p>The cities of Portland and Bend, Oregon, and Seattle have also recently made it easier to build ADUs.</p><p>Jo Flatt, program director at Evergreen, a Canadian non-profit that works to build better cities, said laneway homes were the \"low hanging fruit\" in Toronto because people around them were already used to activity and traffic.</p><p>\"Laneway suites are a great solution for the downtown, but when you think about the massive swaths of land that people have at their disposal in suburban areas or in other parts of the city, we need to think about how to unlock those opportunities for rental,\" she says.</p><p>\"We know that we're in a position with our housing that we need to be as creative as we can be and we need to look in every kind of place we can look to find new and creative solutions to address this challenge we have right now.\"</p><p>Some people would oppose more secondary suites, as they sometimes do tall housing towers. But it's not an \"either or situation,\" Flatt says. Both kinds of housing are needed, and the strategy for tackling NIMBYism for both includes breaking down stigma about bringing renters into single-family-home neighbourhoods.</p><p>\"There's obviously a need for culture change and for people to be comfortable with that but I think it's a huge opportunity for our city and we should be thinking about the different unique ways,\" she says.</p><p>California's new law overrides local regulations, mandating cities and counties issue permits on applications for second units on properties that have a single-family dwelling within 120 days, according to Greg Nickless, a housing policy analyst with the state.</p><p>Local jurisdictions can expand on development standards, like maximum height, and size. But they cannot prohibit a secondary unit or be too burdensome with regulations. Secondary units also have to be rented if not used by the owner, and can't be independently sold.</p><p>By the numbers, California's new law has been a \"tremendous success,\" Brown says. The state doesn't track permits, but cities do.</p><p>In Los Angeles, there's been 17 times the number of permits filed for ADUs since the change in state law in January 2017, compared to two years earlier, according to the city's most recent housing progress report. Eighty-percent are conversions of or additions to existing buildings, such as garages, and there's been a 42 per cent increase in permits filed from 2017-2018. Although, as Brown notes, some of this is from people who already had secondary units and are now just obtaining the proper permits.</p><p>Many cities have gone further, putting in their own legislation that makes it even easier to convert garages and build other kinds of secondary units.</p><p>Like San Jose, a sprawling Silicon Valley bedroom community of about 1.1 million tucked between big tech headquarters, where the housing crisis has gotten so bad that last year local news outlets reported on a university professor living out of her car.</p><p>The city has partnered with the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley for the Yes In My Backyard Program (a play on NIMBY), to waive city fees and offer forgivable loans of up to $20,000 for homeowners who convert a garage or build another kind of secondary housing unit and agree to restrict rents to a level that is affordable to low-to-moderate income households.</p><p>\"We're trying to see if we can do whatever's possible to eliminate the barriers to entry and really scale the number of these ADUs,\" Mayor Sam Liccardo told the Star.</p><p>\"We have ambitions to do much more.\"</p><p>San Jose is the 10th largest city in the U.S. but is \"relatively new on the scene\" compared to the better known L.A or San Francisco. Like a lot of the GTA, it \"grew up\" very fast in the '60s, '70s and '80s, Liccardo says.</p><p>\"That rapid period of growth was really in the age of the automobile, so it was a very suburban sprawl pattern of growth, which provided a very high quality of life for a lot of families for many years but ultimately created a chronic challenge around housing affordability and traffic.\"</p><p>At the same time, tech companies like Google and Apple have moved in nearby. They create \"multimillion-square-foot campuses\" that generate enormous revenue but leave their own employees without anywhere to live. Liccardo estimates average one-bedroom rent is almost $3,000 (U.S.).</p><p>San Jose is now caught in an \"awkward age\" like a teenager as a city. \"It's a very painful time for us to be taking parking spaces away from folks who feel chained to the steering wheel,\" says Liccardo.</p><p>\"There's no question that the densification in these single family neighbourhoods is going to have adverse impacts for those who believe they have a constitutional right to the parking space in front of their home.\"</p><p>That's a sentiment that wouldn't be out of place in the GTA. Off-street parking makes up 15 per cent Mississauga's land, for example, according to a parking master plan released in May.</p><p>Evergreen's Flatt said it's \"the biggest irony\" that cars have their own houses, in a city where so many people don't.</p><p>City staff did not have an estimate of how many garages there are in Toronto, but according to the 2016 census, across the GTA almost 40 per cent of about 2.1 million private dwellings are single-detached houses, or about 845,000. Many if not most of those come with garages.</p><p>That's a lot of potential affordable housing.</p><p>The region's population keeps growing - it's projected to jump from 6.9 million in 2017 to 9.7 million by 2041, according to provincial population projections. But with already congested streets, and everyone needing to cut down the carbon emissions generated by vehicles, car ownership can't keep pace, Flatt says.</p><p>The California solution isn't perfect. In addition to pains around parking, there have been issues with high cost of conversion, which can be in the $150,000 to $160,000 range, says San Jose's Liccardo. His city is trying to lower the cost.</p><p>Cherry Tung, an L.A. accountant and YouTuber, says living in a converted garage has both pros and cons.</p><p>There's no central air and she struggles to keep out ants. But the price, at $950 a month compared to $2,000 for comparable places in Alhambra, about 10 minutes from downtown L.A, is right. And she finds she has plenty of space for herself and her cats Cotton and Candy, with a living room, kitchen, bedroom and bath.</p><p>\"It's pretty common but I've never lived in one before, so I was a little skeptical at first but I've gotten used to it,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's relatively quiet, no upstairs neighbour, and the rent is cheap.\"</p><p>About two hours south from Tung's cosy garage apartment, long-time contractor John Arendsen has seen his San Diego area business Crest Homes increase \"dramatically\" since the changes in state law.</p><p>Garage conversions make up a huge chunk of it, as they're the most \"practical\" and \"least costly,\" kind of secondary units by far.</p><p>He estimates at least 50 per cent of his customers are looking to rent out a secondary unit.

But California's sweeping law goes a few steps further than the city's June 2018 bylaw. It allows secondary units everywhere, not just on lots that share a property line with a public laneway, and includes suburban communities across the state.</p><p>Toronto's bylaw is just for Toronto and East York. The planning and housing committee recently recommended expanding it across the city. But this needs final approval from council and would still sharply limit how many secondary units can be built as most laneways are downtown.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>TTC vehicles get caught in gridlock too often. Transit planners want to change that</p><p>Small apartment buildings are virtually impossible to build in much of Toronto. What are we afraid of?</p><p>The California law is no silver bullet. But it is \"a silver buck shot,\" says Brown with a laugh, a reference to a hunting shot where multiple pellets scatter at a target.</p><p>It's also a way to get around NIMBY (not in my backyard) neighbours who might oppose the density a multi-story housing tower would bring. Brown sees ADUs as a \"different and flexible way\" to add a lot of housing units relatively quickly.</p><p>\"A garage is already there. So it won't look or feel any different at all,\" she says. \"I see it as very complementary to rededicating our cities to people, instead of cars.\"</p><p>The cities of Portland and Bend, Oregon, and Seattle have also recently made it easier to build ADUs.</p><p>Jo Flatt, program director at Evergreen, a Canadian non-profit that works to build better cities, said laneway homes were the \"low hanging fruit\" in Toronto because people around them were already used to activity and traffic.</p><p>\"Laneway suites are a great solution for the downtown, but when you think about the massive swaths of land that people have at their disposal in suburban areas or in other parts of the city, we need to think about how to unlock those opportunities for rental,\" she says.</p><p>\"We know that we're in a position with our housing that we need to be as creative as we can be and we need to look in every kind of place we can look to find new and creative solutions to address this challenge we have right now.\"</p><p>Some people would oppose more secondary suites, as they sometimes do tall housing towers. But it's not an \"either or situation,\" Flatt says. Both kinds of housing are needed, and the strategy for tackling NIMBYism for both includes breaking down stigma about bringing renters into single-family-home neighbourhoods.</p><p>\"There's obviously a need for culture change and for people to be comfortable with that but I think it's a huge opportunity for our city and we should be thinking about the different unique ways,\" she says.</p><p>California's new law overrides local regulations, mandating cities and counties issue permits on applications for second units on properties that have a single-family dwelling within 120 days, according to Greg Nickless, a housing policy analyst with the state.</p><p>Local jurisdictions can expand on development standards, like maximum height, and size. But they cannot prohibit a secondary unit or be too burdensome with regulations. Secondary units also have to be rented if not used by the owner, and can't be independently sold.</p><p>By the numbers, California's new law has been a \"tremendous success,\" Brown says. The state doesn't track permits, but cities do.</p><p>In Los Angeles, there's been 17 times the number of permits filed for ADUs since the change in state law in January 2017, compared to two years earlier, according to the city's most recent housing progress report. Eighty-percent are conversions of or additions to existing buildings, such as garages, and there's been a 42 per cent increase in permits filed from 2017-2018. Although, as Brown notes, some of this is from people who already had secondary units and are now just obtaining the proper permits.</p><p>Many cities have gone further, putting in their own legislation that makes it even easier to convert garages and build other kinds of secondary units.</p><p>Like San Jose, a sprawling Silicon Valley bedroom community of about 1.1 million tucked between big tech headquarters, where the housing crisis has gotten so bad that last year local news outlets reported on a university professor living out of her car.</p><p>The city has partnered with the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley for the Yes In My Backyard Program (a play on NIMBY), to waive city fees and offer forgivable loans of up to $20,000 for homeowners who convert a garage or build another kind of secondary housing unit and agree to restrict rents to a level that is affordable to low-to-moderate income households.</p><p>\"We're trying to see if we can do whatever's possible to eliminate the barriers to entry and really scale the number of these ADUs,\" Mayor Sam Liccardo told the Star.</p><p>\"We have ambitions to do much more.\"</p><p>San Jose is the 10th largest city in the U.S. but is \"relatively new on the scene\" compared to the better known L.A or San Francisco. Like a lot of the GTA, it \"grew up\" very fast in the '60s, '70s and '80s, Liccardo says.</p><p>\"That rapid period of growth was really in the age of the automobile, so it was a very suburban sprawl pattern of growth, which provided a very high quality of life for a lot of families for many years but ultimately created a chronic challenge around housing affordability and traffic.\"</p><p>At the same time, tech companies like Google and Apple have moved in nearby. They create \"multimillion-square-foot campuses\" that generate enormous revenue but leave their own employees without anywhere to live. Liccardo estimates average one-bedroom rent is almost $3,000 (U.S.).</p><p>San Jose is now caught in an \"awkward age\" like a teenager as a city. \"It's a very painful time for us to be taking parking spaces away from folks who feel chained to the steering wheel,\" says Liccardo.</p><p>\"There's no question that the densification in these single family neighbourhoods is going to have adverse impacts for those who believe they have a constitutional right to the parking space in front of their home.\"</p><p>That's a sentiment that wouldn't be out of place in the GTA. Off-street parking makes up 15 per cent Mississauga's land, for example, according to a parking master plan released in May.</p><p>Evergreen's Flatt said it's \"the biggest irony\" that cars have their own houses, in a city where so many people don't.</p><p>City staff did not have an estimate of how many garages there are in Toronto, but according to the 2016 census, across the GTA almost 40 per cent of about 2.1 million private dwellings are single-detached houses, or about 845,000. Many if not most of those come with garages.</p><p>That's a lot of potential affordable housing.</p><p>The region's population keeps growing - it's projected to jump from 6.9 million in 2017 to 9.7 million by 2041, according to provincial population projections. But with already congested streets, and everyone needing to cut down the carbon emissions generated by vehicles, car ownership can't keep pace, Flatt says.</p><p>The California solution isn't perfect. In addition to pains around parking, there have been issues with high cost of conversion, which can be in the $150,000 to $160,000 range, says San Jose's Liccardo. His city is trying to lower the cost.</p><p>Cherry Tung, an L.A. accountant and YouTuber, says living in a converted garage has both pros and cons.</p><p>There's no central air and she struggles to keep out ants. But the price, at $950 a month compared to $2,000 for comparable places in Alhambra, about 10 minutes from downtown L.A, is right. And she finds she has plenty of space for herself and her cats Cotton and Candy, with a living room, kitchen, bedroom and bath.</p><p>\"It's pretty common but I've never lived in one before, so I was a little skeptical at first but I've gotten used to it,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's relatively quiet, no upstairs neighbour, and the rent is cheap.\"</p><p>About two hours south from Tung's cosy garage apartment, long-time contractor John Arendsen has seen his San Diego area business Crest Homes increase \"dramatically\" since the changes in state law.</p><p>Garage conversions make up a huge chunk of it, as they're the most \"practical\" and \"least costly,\" kind of secondary units by far.</p><p>He estimates at least 50 per cent of his customers are looking to rent out a secondary unit. But he also sees millennial kids back with their parents who want more space, downsizing boomers who move into the smaller unit themselves, and older adults who want live-in caregivers to stay on the property.</p><p>The 72-year-old plans to eventually build his own secondary unit in the backyard of the single-storey California ranch, where he lives with his wife.</p><p>\"We will never leave our home, chances are we'll probably age in place,\" he said over the phone from 40-degree Palm Desert.</p><p>It may not be perfect, but Evergreen's Flatt says the \"California model\" starts to give Toronto \"things to work with.\" It also helps us realize it \"isn't so scary after all.\"</p><p>\"It just needs to be customized to our context,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's not yes or no, but how.\"</p><p>May Warren is a breaking news reporter based in Toronto.

California has the answer</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>May Warren</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a weekly series the Star seeks simple, affordable solutions to the problems faced by Torontonians and the city as a whole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem: While Toronto needs way more housing in the coming decades, it also has tens of thousands of garages that may become redundant as private vehicle ownership becomes less necessary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the car was king in the Golden State, the garage was its castle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It made a cosy fortress for four-wheels, as well as unused workout equipment, and boxes destined for Goodwill.</p><p>But as California grapples with an affordable housing crisis, garages, along with other backyard units, are emerging as one potential solution, evicting the automobile to let people take precedence.</p><p>A new 2017 statewide law now makes it much easier for secondary units, dubbed accessory dwelling units (ADUs), to be added next to single family homes, blazing a trail for sprawling cities across North America that are moving away from car-centric planning while simultaneously struggling with affordable housing.</p><p>\"One of the things that excites me most is just the potential to add this invisible density,\" says Anne Brown, an assistant professor at the University of Oregon.</p><p>In Toronto these units are often now known as laneway suites. But California's sweeping law goes a few steps further than the city's June 2018 bylaw. It allows secondary units everywhere, not just on lots that share a property line with a public laneway, and includes suburban communities across the state.</p><p>Toronto's bylaw is just for Toronto and East York. The planning and housing committee recently recommended expanding it across the city. But this needs final approval from council and would still sharply limit how many secondary units can be built as most laneways are downtown.</p><p>More from this series:</p><p>TTC vehicles get caught in gridlock too often. Transit planners want to change that</p><p>Small apartment buildings are virtually impossible to build in much of Toronto. What are we afraid of?</p><p>The California law is no silver bullet. But it is \"a silver buck shot,\" says Brown with a laugh, a reference to a hunting shot where multiple pellets scatter at a target.</p><p>It's also a way to get around NIMBY (not in my backyard) neighbours who might oppose the density a multi-story housing tower would bring. Brown sees ADUs as a \"different and flexible way\" to add a lot of housing units relatively quickly.</p><p>\"A garage is already there. So it won't look or feel any different at all,\" she says. \"I see it as very complementary to rededicating our cities to people, instead of cars.\"</p><p>The cities of Portland and Bend, Oregon, and Seattle have also recently made it easier to build ADUs.</p><p>Jo Flatt, program director at Evergreen, a Canadian non-profit that works to build better cities, said laneway homes were the \"low hanging fruit\" in Toronto because people around them were already used to activity and traffic.</p><p>\"Laneway suites are a great solution for the downtown, but when you think about the massive swaths of land that people have at their disposal in suburban areas or in other parts of the city, we need to think about how to unlock those opportunities for rental,\" she says.</p><p>\"We know that we're in a position with our housing that we need to be as creative as we can be and we need to look in every kind of place we can look to find new and creative solutions to address this challenge we have right now.\"</p><p>Some people would oppose more secondary suites, as they sometimes do tall housing towers. But it's not an \"either or situation,\" Flatt says. Both kinds of housing are needed, and the strategy for tackling NIMBYism for both includes breaking down stigma about bringing renters into single-family-home neighbourhoods.</p><p>\"There's obviously a need for culture change and for people to be comfortable with that but I think it's a huge opportunity for our city and we should be thinking about the different unique ways,\" she says.</p><p>California's new law overrides local regulations, mandating cities and counties issue permits on applications for second units on properties that have a single-family dwelling within 120 days, according to Greg Nickless, a housing policy analyst with the state.</p><p>Local jurisdictions can expand on development standards, like maximum height, and size. But they cannot prohibit a secondary unit or be too burdensome with regulations. Secondary units also have to be rented if not used by the owner, and can't be independently sold.</p><p>By the numbers, California's new law has been a \"tremendous success,\" Brown says. The state doesn't track permits, but cities do.</p><p>In Los Angeles, there's been 17 times the number of permits filed for ADUs since the change in state law in January 2017, compared to two years earlier, according to the city's most recent housing progress report. Eighty-percent are conversions of or additions to existing buildings, such as garages, and there's been a 42 per cent increase in permits filed from 2017-2018. Although, as Brown notes, some of this is from people who already had secondary units and are now just obtaining the proper permits.</p><p>Many cities have gone further, putting in their own legislation that makes it even easier to convert garages and build other kinds of secondary units.</p><p>Like San Jose, a sprawling Silicon Valley bedroom community of about 1.1 million tucked between big tech headquarters, where the housing crisis has gotten so bad that last year local news outlets reported on a university professor living out of her car.</p><p>The city has partnered with the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley for the Yes In My Backyard Program (a play on NIMBY), to waive city fees and offer forgivable loans of up to $20,000 for homeowners who convert a garage or build another kind of secondary housing unit and agree to restrict rents to a level that is affordable to low-to-moderate income households.</p><p>\"We're trying to see if we can do whatever's possible to eliminate the barriers to entry and really scale the number of these ADUs,\" Mayor Sam Liccardo told the Star.</p><p>\"We have ambitions to do much more.\"</p><p>San Jose is the 10th largest city in the U.S. but is \"relatively new on the scene\" compared to the better known L.A or San Francisco. Like a lot of the GTA, it \"grew up\" very fast in the '60s, '70s and '80s, Liccardo says.</p><p>\"That rapid period of growth was really in the age of the automobile, so it was a very suburban sprawl pattern of growth, which provided a very high quality of life for a lot of families for many years but ultimately created a chronic challenge around housing affordability and traffic.\"</p><p>At the same time, tech companies like Google and Apple have moved in nearby. They create \"multimillion-square-foot campuses\" that generate enormous revenue but leave their own employees without anywhere to live. Liccardo estimates average one-bedroom rent is almost $3,000 (U.S.).</p><p>San Jose is now caught in an \"awkward age\" like a teenager as a city. \"It's a very painful time for us to be taking parking spaces away from folks who feel chained to the steering wheel,\" says Liccardo.</p><p>\"There's no question that the densification in these single family neighbourhoods is going to have adverse impacts for those who believe they have a constitutional right to the parking space in front of their home.\"</p><p>That's a sentiment that wouldn't be out of place in the GTA. Off-street parking makes up 15 per cent Mississauga's land, for example, according to a parking master plan released in May.</p><p>Evergreen's Flatt said it's \"the biggest irony\" that cars have their own houses, in a city where so many people don't.</p><p>City staff did not have an estimate of how many garages there are in Toronto, but according to the 2016 census, across the GTA almost 40 per cent of about 2.1 million private dwellings are single-detached houses, or about 845,000. Many if not most of those come with garages.</p><p>That's a lot of potential affordable housing.</p><p>The region's population keeps growing - it's projected to jump from 6.9 million in 2017 to 9.7 million by 2041, according to provincial population projections. But with already congested streets, and everyone needing to cut down the carbon emissions generated by vehicles, car ownership can't keep pace, Flatt says.</p><p>The California solution isn't perfect. In addition to pains around parking, there have been issues with high cost of conversion, which can be in the $150,000 to $160,000 range, says San Jose's Liccardo. His city is trying to lower the cost.</p><p>Cherry Tung, an L.A. accountant and YouTuber, says living in a converted garage has both pros and cons.</p><p>There's no central air and she struggles to keep out ants. But the price, at $950 a month compared to $2,000 for comparable places in Alhambra, about 10 minutes from downtown L.A, is right. And she finds she has plenty of space for herself and her cats Cotton and Candy, with a living room, kitchen, bedroom and bath.</p><p>\"It's pretty common but I've never lived in one before, so I was a little skeptical at first but I've gotten used to it,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's relatively quiet, no upstairs neighbour, and the rent is cheap.\"</p><p>About two hours south from Tung's cosy garage apartment, long-time contractor John Arendsen has seen his San Diego area business Crest Homes increase \"dramatically\" since the changes in state law.</p><p>Garage conversions make up a huge chunk of it, as they're the most \"practical\" and \"least costly,\" kind of secondary units by far.</p><p>He estimates at least 50 per cent of his customers are looking to rent out a secondary unit. But he also sees millennial kids back with their parents who want more space, downsizing boomers who move into the smaller unit themselves, and older adults who want live-in caregivers to stay on the property.</p><p>The 72-year-old plans to eventually build his own secondary unit in the backyard of the single-storey California ranch, where he lives with his wife.</p><p>\"We will never leave our home, chances are we'll probably age in place,\" he said over the phone from 40-degree Palm Desert.</p><p>It may not be perfect, but Evergreen's Flatt says the \"California model\" starts to give Toronto \"things to work with.\" It also helps us realize it \"isn't so scary after all.\"</p><p>\"It just needs to be customized to our context,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's not yes or no, but how.\"</p><p>May Warren is a breaking news reporter based in Toronto.

Their schools are being urged to teach more about it. Monuments related to that history are also being reviewed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is of course right and well overdue that we have a full and frank discourse about colonial actions. Years from now, perhaps, there will also be a similar discussion about the current wave of digital colonisation that is going on almost unchecked across the world.</p><p>Our digital existences have been taken over by Google, Facebook, Amazon and other large US technology firms in their relentless accumulation of users and our online data. Their endeavours have created trillions of dollars in corporate value. The benefit of that is going to their shareholders, including the world's richest man Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.</p><p>These companies might well argue that they provide opportunities for people and countries to advance their digital ambitions, supporting a more prosperous and healthy future through the deployment of their technologies. The truth is that any benefits received by a society from Google, Facebook and other companies are secondary to the main goal, which is simply and undramatically global domination. Take, for example, what is playing out in India right now.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, seen with one of Google's quantum computers in California last year, recently announced Google's investment in India. AFP<br/><br/>Read More from Mustafa Alrawi</p><p>The IMF needs to take a break from forecasting</p><p>For Mustafa Al Kadhimi's Iraq, history may well be rhyming</p><p>The post-lockdown world might seem scary \u2013 but it will also be full of opportunity</p><p>Google has become the latest big American tech firm to pledge a deeper commitment there with plans to invest $10 billion over the next five to seven years. The company's chief executive,  Sundar Pichai, said on Monday: \"This mission is deeply personal to me. When I was young, every new piece of technology brought new opportunities to learn and grow. But I always had to wait for it to arrive from someplace else. Today, people in India no longer have to wait for technology.\"</p><p>We hear the word \"mission\" a lot from those running or investing in companies in Silicon Valley. In fairness, the executives from there that I have personally met do genuinely believe that they are working towards that higher and more noble goal, and that bringing their services to as many people as possible can only be a good thing.</p><p>Such zealous corporate cultures are highly beneficial when companies are in the start-up stage with all the commensurate challenges and obstacles to survival. When talking about the world's largest companies, however, it can create a tunnel vision that can do real damage.</p><p>A quarter-century since the creation of the World Wide Web, we are far less naive about the dangers posed by our more connected lives even as we appreciate the stunning benefits that the internet has brought our societies. That a handful of technology companies, all from the US, are now each more powerful than any government must present the chief worry, however.</p><p>\"Privacy\" is displayed during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference seen on a laptop computer in Arlington, Virginia last month. Bloomberg</p><p>Issues related to this dominance \u2013 such as the loss of jobs to the rapid digital transformation, protections for our privacy, a respect for local cultures, traditions and mores and perhaps most importantly, the funneling of billions in revenue offshore \u2013 must be adequately addressed. If not, we will be allowing an echoing of the colonial experience.</p><p>In the example of Google and India, what is $10bn over five or seven years? It is nothing to marvel at in terms of the scale of investment. It does not represent an emotional attachment or responsibility for the people there. It is PR.</p><p>Google made that much in profit in a single year in 2019. Its annual revenue was $162bn. By investing an amount of money that it can easily afford to lose, Google says what its priorities really are in India. Note that it is spending almost half that amount in a single deal with Reliance's Mukesh Ambani.</p><p>I will be curious to see how much real oversight and regulation of its activities Google will actually experience in India going forward. Or in any country for that matter.</p><p>Washington has proved unable or unwilling to administer any control over it and the other big technology companies. So, it seems the first country Silicon Valley colonised was its own.</p><p>US accuse Huawei of being a threat on security grounds. But it shies away from the idea that allowing the digital space to be so beholden to a handful of American corporations is just as much a risk for any nation. AP Photo</p><p>Washington has proved unable or unwilling to administer any control over it and the other big technology companies. So, it seems the first country Silicon Valley colonised was its own</p><p>Only China has shown any kind of resilience in the face of American digital expansionism. It retains its own cultural identity having learned better than most the painful lessons of the past. Officials still refer to the Opium Wars \u2013 19th-century conflicts that led the defeated Qing dynasty to grant tariffs and territory to western powers \u2013 as if they only just happened.</p><p>Straight-faced Washington officials accuse the Chinese tech giant Huawei of being a threat on security grounds while shying away from the idea that allowing the digital space to be so beholden to a handful of American corporations is just as much a risk for any nation.</p><p>It is not too late for other governments and regulators to redress the imbalance.</p><p>The idea of digital taxes \u2013 being considered by France, India and other countries \u2013 is a very good start. Let the likes of Google and Facebook give back proportionately.</p><p>Governments can also do more to protect their own technology sectors as they have other strategic industries such as energy and defence.</p><p>As Canadian professor and philosopher Marshall McLuhan wrote in the 1960s in reference to the future of technology and the media, \"once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left\".</p><p>Mustafa Alrawi is an assistant editor-in-chief at The National</p><p>Updated: July 15, 2020 04:51 PM</p><p>While you're here</p><p>Mary Ames: Our digital culture needs an overhaul amid watershed moment for Big Tech</p><p>Barry Ritholtz: Why the Big Tech stock market surge is not entirely driven by the US</p><p>Rhodri Marsden: After India bans the TikTok app, will other countries follow suit?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/38/159482954915.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/38/159482954915.jpg</url></p><p>Sundar Pichai, seen with one of Google's quantum computers in California last year, recently announced Google's investment in India.

Near downtown Baton Rouge. #LaSen #LaGov pic.twitter.com/CP9gFVdBFF</p><p>-- Julia O'Donoghue (@JSODonoghue) June 16, 2018</p><p>The ISPs want the power to prioritize content when internet capacity is tight or even charge content providers for \"fast lane\" service; and the content makers--Google, Facebook and Amazon--want #NetNeutrality to stop them.</p><p>Viewed from a financial standpoint, this is one group of billionaires fighting with another. Writing about the #NetNeutrality fight in Forbes recently, Clyde Wayne Crews Jr.of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute observes  \"It is unclear how tech titans' supporting net neutrality rules that help them call the shots against ISPs qualifies as 'level[ing] the playing field away from the big corporations.'\"</p><p>Ah, but which corporations matters. For years, conservatives and Republicans have bristled at the open partisanship of #BigTech. Jeff Bezos of Amazon also owns the liberal Washington Post newspaper. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is a frequently-rumored future Democratic candidate for president whose company's policies have been openly hostile to conservative FB users; and Google is a liberal icon of tech industry.</p><p>They all love #NetNeutrality and hate Donald Trump--or so many on the Right believe.</p><p>So while Republicans may in fact oppose #NetNeutrality on the basis of their free-market principles (\"I favor a free and open Internet and I oppose Title II.\" -- FCC chief Ajit Pai),it can't help that the ox being gored by ending these federal mandates bleeds deep blue.</p><p>When Sen. Kennedy joined Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkoswski of Alaska to cross over and back the Democrats' CRA (Congressional Review Act) measure to repeal the FCC's rollback of #NetNeutrality, they may have thought they were casting a vote about technology.  But it could easily become a frontline in the ongoing culture war, with angry Trumpian conservatives demanding the GOP stand up to the media and internet elites they believe oppose them.</p><p>Thus far, all the energy has been with the #NetNeutrality opponents. Having gotten their CRA through the Senate, activists are now push for the 218 votes they'll need in the House. A well-funded grassroots coalition including Fight For The Future and Battle For The Net is organizing protests at the district offices of some 50 Republicans on July 26th, with the message \"The Internet is angry!\" The pressure is on.</p><p>But what happens if Republican House members start seeing billboards in their district like the one targeting Sen.

I think it will. Global economy grows at 4.5%-plus -- again too early to tell. The IMF in May       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10009436.shtml\">predicted 4.9%</url>. I don't see any reason to believe Karlgaard will be wrong on this. American stocks do well --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/business/story/368282.html\">So-so</url>: Dow - nominal +6.4% (8.9% with dividends); S&amp;P 500 - nominal +3.5% (5.5% with dividends); NASDAQ - nominal +9.8% (with dividends not noted). I say Kargaard missed on this one. Global stocks do better -- from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/business/story/368282.html\">the same link</url> as the previous  \"Overseas markets generally trounced the U.S. stock market in 2007, continuing the trend of the last few years.\" Big Tech has another good year -- See NASDAQ above. Although it's a bit short of the 75-plus year long-term trend for stocks in general of 11% (with dividends), it's good enough. Web 2.0 inflates to bubble status -- No proof of a burst, but enough       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/12/10/whats_that_noise_little_20_drips_falling_into_the_deadpool.html\">early signs like this</url> to say it's probably waiting to.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/llewclaasen/2007/12/12/the-cause-of-the-web20-bubble/\">This guy</url> assumes it currently exists. Bargains emerge in U.S. residential real estate -- Well, yeah. The \"broad-based\" Case Schiller index -- which, since it looks at 20 cities, really isn't -- is down quite a bit (PDF link       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_csmahp/0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0.html\">can be found at this page</url>), while overall residential real estate prices are up in nominal terms       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizzyblog.com/2007/11/29/ofheo-national-home-prices-dipped-04-in-quarter-up-18-in-past-year/\">but trail inflation</url> (not descending into Hades, as you might think from Old Media reports). So there would are probably some pretty good bargains in many of the Case Schiller cities. Tiny jets begin to ship -- Last sentence       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://news14.com/content/headlines/591228/hondajet-makes-merry-year-for-triad/Default.aspx\">here</url> about  \"So far, Honda Aero has received more than 100 orders for the new jet. Deliveries are set for 2010.\" I believe they're the only ones in the business at the moment. Hockey and soccer gain popularity -- If they did, they must have been very tiny gains. That's a miss.  The New Orleans Saints win Super Bowl XLI -- Uh, no.  Karlgaard gets a 6 out of 10 (correct on 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7). Biz Weak's (that's how we say \"Business Week\" around here)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizzyblog.com/2006/12/29/predictions-were-holding-people-to-part-2-housing-prices/\">home price predictions</url>: Biz Weak predicted these metro-area home price declines for the year beginning November 7, 2006. Their figure is presented first, followed by the metro-are price declines according to the report from the governmnet's Office of Housing Enterprise Oversight (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ofheo.gov/\">OFHEO</url>) dated September   Boston, -5.7%; -3.6% Chicago, -4.3%; +2.16% Denver, -4.6%; -0.32% Las Vegas, -5.9%; -2.51% Los Angeles, -5.1%; -0.07% Miami, -5.9%; +3.45% New York, -5.0%; +1.72% San Diego, -6.0%; -5.07% San Francisco, -4.7%; -0.93% Washington DC, -6.0%; -0.33%  Although the date ranges don't match up (and I don't see how anyone can audit what Biz Weak did because of the weird date it picked, which may be why they picked it), Biz Weak differs from OFHEO by more than 3% in 8 of the 10 metro areas listed -- all in the negative direction (/surprise). Those are misses that by any reasonable definition can't be explained by the 38-day difference (Sept. 30 - Nov. 7) in the measurement date. It seems like there wasn't a lot of 2008 predicting going on at the end of 2007.

That's the concern some have raised in the wake of the E.U.'s ruling on the Safe Harbor agreement[1] Tuesday, which will force global internet companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and thousands of\u00a0others to contend\u00a0with local laws, and store data individually, in the European countries where they have users.&lt;nl/&gt; 'It concerns me that we may be moving to a balkanized era, where data has to be held in a country very specifically across many different jurisdictions,\" said\u00a0Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales at a technology conference in London on Wednesday.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> Wales added that such a move to create a siloed internet would, from a purely technological point of view, be 'annoying and complicated' and would result in a poorer experience for the consumer.&lt;nl/&gt; 'If I'm in Europe I hope they are near me on a server in Europe, but other than that I want them to provide the best technical experience for me. And if they suddenly have all those requirements and have to keep certain pictures in certain places, it just sounds like a nightmare, so I like the idea of uniformity in the law so that we can all not worry about it,' he told CNBC[2].&lt;nl/&gt; On Tuesday\u00a0Europe's top court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), ruled that the 15-year-old facility to transfer data from Europe to U.S. -- known as the Safe Harbor Agreement -- was invalid and that each country within the European Union will now have to decide for itself if the transferring of their citizen's data to the U.S. by companies is safe.&lt;nl/&gt; While each country can come to its own conclusion, it is widely expected that national courts will follow the ruling, which says[3]\u00a0\"the access enjoyed by the United States intelligence services to the transferred data constitutes an interference with the right to respect for private life and the right to protection of personal data, which are guaranteed by the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU].'&lt;nl/&gt; Business As Usual?&lt;nl/&gt; But big tech giants have reacted to the decision with a collective \"whatever,\" saying they anticipated the ruling and have plans in place to comply.\u00a0Facebook told International Business Times that it's\u00a0business as usual; Microsoft already has provisions in place to limit the impact of the ruling, and Google says it welcomes the decision and the ensuing debate.&lt;nl/&gt; To date, over 4,000 U.S. companies have taken advantage of the Safe Harbor agreement and in the wake of the ruling, questions are being asked about just what this will mean for tech companies which do business in Europe.&lt;nl/&gt; 'For companies like Facebook the implications are incredibly complex. The whole point of Facebook is sharing data across many jurisdictions, so how are they even going to cope with that,' Wales said, while claiming that\u00a0Wikipedia, which has no legal presence in Europe, would be completely unaffected.&lt;nl/&gt; Facebook is at the center of this case after Austrian student and Facebook user since 2008, Max Schrems lodged a complaint with the Irish Data Commissioner (Facebook's European operation is based in Ireland) in light of the revelations made by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013, claiming, 'The law and practices of the United States offer no real protection against surveillance by the United States of the data transferred to that country.'&lt;nl/&gt; The CJEU explicitly states that Facebook has been not found guilty of any wrong doing, but like Wales, many people have suggested in the wake of the ruling that it cause major disruption for the social network.&lt;nl/&gt; An old Facebook post about privacy changes has gained momentum once more. Getty Images &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;Facebook, however, disagrees entirely. It says there are other processes in place to allow it\u00a0legally transfer data from Europe to the U.S. and as a result will continue to operate normally.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Facebook, like many thousands of European companies, relies on a number of the methods prescribed by EU law to legally transfer data to the US from Europe, aside from Safe Harbor. It is imperative that EU and US governments ensure that they continue to provide reliable methods for lawful data transfers and resolve any issues relating to national security,' a Facebook spokesperson told International Business Times.&lt;nl/&gt; Google: \"This Is A Good Thing\"&lt;nl/&gt; Google, another company which transfers\u00a0a lot of data from Europe\u00a0to the U.S. has not commented officially on the ruling, but speaking at a technology conference in London, the head of Google's cloud platform in the UK, Matt McNeill, told IBT: 'I think if you take the big picture around the [Safe Harbor ruling], I think it's actually a really good thing that's happening, that people care about it.' McNeill added that it was good to have a discussion now about this from both an industry and political point of view.&lt;nl/&gt; Microsoft too has said it will continue to operate as normal. Brad Smith, the company's lead legal counsel said[4] its customers can continue to transfer data by relying on additional steps and legal safeguards it has put in place on the basis that this outcome was expected:\u00a0\"We don't believe\u00a0[the] ruling has a significant impact on our consumer services. Our terms of use make clear that to provide these services, we transfer data between users, which occurs for example, when one user sends email or other online content to another user. We also have data centers in many countries and regions, including several located in Europe.\"&lt;nl/&gt; A Balkanized Internet&lt;nl/&gt; This is not the first time that a balkanization of the internet has been proposed as a result of the increase awareness of the NSA's spying capabilities as a result of the leaks from whistleblower Snowden.&lt;nl/&gt; Back in 2013, when it was revealed that the NSA had been monitoring the emails and phone calls of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, as well as those of Brazil's biggest oil company and the communications of millions of citizens, it was proposed that U.S. companies like Facebook and Google would store information on Brazilian citizens on servers only based within the country. We have also seen similar proposals in Russia and South Korea in recent years.&lt;nl/&gt; The questions is, can a balkanized internet really work on a practical level?&lt;nl/&gt; One of the people involved in negotiating the Safe Harbor agreement on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Brian Hengesbaugh, does not believe it's possible.\u00a0'Given the close economic integration between Europe and the United States, where thousands of companies have employees and operations on both sides of the Atlantic, it is difficult to imagine that a truly divided internet would arise where European data stays in Europe and US data stays in the US.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Mark Thompson, privacy practice leader at KPMG agrees with Hengesbaugh, saying the task of restructuring the internet on such a huge scale would be an almost impossible effort: 'Whilst it is a possibility that personal information will be required to remain within the geographical borders of some jurisdictions, to do this on a global scale it would be a monumental task for an organization and the practicalities and costs involved would be immense. It would also likely be prohibitive to global trade, innovation and result in high costs of products and services to the end consumer, thus while possible we believe it would be unlikely.'&lt;nl/&gt; However Stuart Buglass, an international business expert at Radius, thinks there is a danger of such a split happening:\u00a0'Balkanization is definitely a risk if there is no joined-up thinking on how national security requirements and individual data privacy rights can co-exist. Big players such as Amazon have already taken a localized approach to its data centers ensuring that data does not transfer so we have already gone some way towards a Balkanized approach - to stop proceeding any further down this path requires individual nations to adopt best practice data privacy regimes, make concessions on national security and agree trade deals.'&lt;nl/&gt; Smaller Companies Impacted&lt;nl/&gt; The truth is that companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Twitter have known this ruling is likely for some time and have been putting systems in place to make sure their operations are not disrupted. These include using transfers can be legitimized by using model data transfer contracts (so-called EU Model Clauses) which is effectively a standard contract approved by the European Commission which contractually binds the overseas data receiver to EU data standards.&lt;nl/&gt; For internal transfers of data within an organization there is also the option of Binding Corporate Rules --\u00a0internal company standards of data privacy which are required to be approved by an EU data privacy regulator.&lt;nl/&gt; While some companies like Twitter have been rolling out separate privacy policies for users in the U.S. and users everywhere else in the world -- apparently in response to the Safe Harbor ruling -- the bigger companies seem confident that the change in the law will not dramatically impact their business, at least in the short term.&lt;nl/&gt; Where the biggest impact may be felt is in those thousands of companies which rely on Safe Harbor which are not Facebook, Google or Microsoft and which do not have the resources to create alternative and comprehensive corporate legal structures for the transfer of data and will be left in limbo until each country rules on the Safe Harbor agreement.&lt;nl/&gt;

But with news from Bloomberg this week that <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>is in funding talks with China's Alibaba valuing the company at $10 billion, it's safe to say many observers are reconsidering <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>worth. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>and Alibaba declined to comment on the reported funding talks. But the question about <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>has always been whether a product that seems so ephemeral has the potential to justify such a massive long-term investment.</p><p>That's hard to judge, as the privately held company is very selective about the data it releases publicly. <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>doesn't provide figures for its total user base or its revenue, though it's undoubtedly losing money at present given its lack of ads. </p><p>What is clear is that the service is wildly popular, particularly among younger users. </p><p>CEO Evan Spiegel has said <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>core audience is between 18 and 25 years of age -- a demographic advertisers covet. As of May, users were viewing over 1 billion stories and sharing more than 700 million snaps per day, up from just 350 million in October. </p><p>That's a stunning pace of growth -- Mitch Lasky, general partner at <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>investor Benchmark, told CNNMoney last year that the company's growth as a mobile service \"is probably the most explosive we have ever seen.\" </p><p>But back up for just a second and repeat that valuation: $10 billion. Can a three-year-old company with no revenue really be worth more than Hyatt Hotels? Than Safeway? Than Burger King? </p><p>It's valuations like this that have prompted observers like hedge-fund mogul <person><nameText>David Einhorn </nameText></person>to proclaim that we're in the midst of a new tech bubble, with the bottom set to fall out \"when the market reapplies traditional valuations.\"</p><p>Whether <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>is worth it depends on exactly how the company plans to make money. Display ads and sponsored messages are the most obvious routes, though the service could also experiment with premium subscriptions or \"virtual goods\" like filters to enhance messages.</p><p>\"You have to think about where the revenue could come from to support that value, and it's hard to see that today because the company hasn't shown any user interfaces that are revenue-generating,\" said Brian Blau, research director at Gartner.</p><p>What <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>does have going for it, Blau said, is great brand awareness and a growing user base to rival similar mobile-ready services like WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter and Japanese messaging app Line.</p><p>Line is reportedly mulling an IPO that would value it around $10 billion, while WhatsApp fetched $19 billion in an acquisition by Facebook earlier this year. </p><p>Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram back in 2012, and has grown its user base substantially since then. Twitter, while still losing money, is flying high on the New York Stock Exchange at the moment with a market cap of around $27 billion. </p><p>\"At the level that <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>at today, it's difficult for any tech company to reach those heights,\" Blau said. </p><p>But it's not as if <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>technology is hard to replicate. It's already facing competition for similar photo-sharing service like Taptalk, and just this week, Instagram introduced Bolt, its own disappearing-message app. </p><p>Even if it can hold off these competitors, <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>still faces the challenge of collecting meaningful user data, the currency of big tech and social media companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>A big part of <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>appeal is the fact that messages sent through the app exist only temporarily, rather than being logged for potential discovery by parents, co-workers and other unwanted viewers. But that means that -- provided <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>keeps its promise to regulators -- it can't mine the communications of users for marketing insights the way other social networks do. </p><p>\"I don't have a lot of clients asking about <person><nameText>Snapchat, </nameText></person>because how do you gather data?\" said Bob Pearson, president of marketing firm W20 Group. \"How do you get market research? How do you integrate it with search and e-commerce?\"</p><p>So while <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>is generating a lot of excitement, it's got a long way to go to deliver on the hype. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But with news from Bloomberg this week that <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>is in funding talks with China's Alibaba valuing the company at $10 billion, it's safe to say many observers are reconsidering <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>worth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>and Alibaba declined to comment on the reported funding talks. But the question about <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>has always been whether a product that seems so ephemeral has the potential to justify such a massive long-term investment.</p><p>That's hard to judge, as the privately held company is very selective about the data it releases publicly. <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>doesn't provide figures for its total user base or its revenue, though it's undoubtedly losing money at present given its lack of ads.</p><p>What is clear is that the service is wildly popular, particularly among younger users.</p><p>CEO Evan Spiegel has said <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>core audience is between 18 and 25 years of age -- a demographic advertisers covet. As of May, users were viewing over 1 billion stories and sharing more than 700 million snaps per day, up from just 350 million in October.</p><p>That's a stunning pace of growth -- Mitch Lasky, general partner at <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>investor Benchmark, told CNNMoney last year that the company's growth as a mobile service \"is probably the most explosive we have ever seen.\"</p><p/><p>But back up for just a second and repeat that valuation: $10 billion. Can a three-year-old company with no revenue really be worth more than Hyatt Hotels? Than Safeway? Than Burger King?</p><p>It's valuations like this that have prompted observers like hedge-fund mogul <person><nameText>David Einhorn </nameText></person>to proclaim that we're in the midst of a new tech bubble, with the bottom set to fall out \"when the market reapplies traditional valuations.\"</p><p>Whether <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>is worth it depends on exactly how the company plans to make money. Display ads and sponsored messages are the most obvious routes, though the service could also experiment with premium subscriptions or \"virtual goods\" like filters to enhance messages.</p><p>\"You have to think about where the revenue could come from to support that value, and it's hard to see that today because the company hasn't shown any user interfaces that are revenue-generating,\" said Brian Blau, research director at Gartner.</p><p>What <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>does have going for it, Blau said, is great brand awareness and a growing user base to rival similar mobile-ready services like WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter and Japanese messaging app Line.</p><p>Line is reportedly mulling an IPO that would value it around $10 billion, while WhatsApp fetched $19 billion in an acquisition by Facebook earlier this year.</p><p>Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram back in 2012, and has grown its user base substantially since then. Twitter, while still losing money, is flying high on the New York Stock Exchange at the moment with a market cap of around $27 billion.</p><p>\"At the level that <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>at today, it's difficult for any tech company to reach those heights,\" Blau said.</p><p/><p>But it's not as if <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>technology is hard to replicate. It's already facing competition for similar photo-sharing service like Taptalk, and just this week, Instagram introduced Bolt, its own disappearing-message app.</p><p>Even if it can hold off these competitors, <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>still faces the challenge of collecting meaningful user data, the currency of big tech and social media companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>A big part of <person><nameText>Snapchat's </nameText></person>appeal is the fact that messages sent through the app exist only temporarily, rather than being logged for potential discovery by parents, co-workers and other unwanted viewers. But that means that -- provided <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>keeps its promise to regulators -- it can't mine the communications of users for marketing insights the way other social networks do.</p><p>\"I don't have a lot of clients asking about <person><nameText>Snapchat, </nameText></person>because how do you gather data?\" said Bob Pearson, president of marketing firm W20 Group. \"How do you get market research? How do you integrate it with search and e-commerce?\"</p><p>So while <person><nameText>Snapchat </nameText></person>is generating a lot of excitement, it's got a long way to go to deliver on the hype.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20140731snapchat-10-billion1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CTF-CKP1-JBPX-W206-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><timeReceived>11:37 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 31, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC00029Q1</classCode><className>HYATT HOTELS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS721110 HOTELS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS) &amp;

Once again, technology is fundamentally changing how we do business as a society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology stocks are on pace for a record year. For the past decade, the tech sector has led the bull market. While the overall S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed a 24% increase in 2019, the S&amp;P's tech sector is on pace for a 41% gain this year. Big tech controversies, private data use, tariffs and free speech debates aside, investors are convinced that consumer demand, creativity, competition and private capital will continue to feed strong revenue and earnings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While certain sectors in tech will do better than others and some tech stocks will surely falter, it is clear that tech innovation is going to be a big part of our future, no matter where we live. Why should this matter to Mississippi or Jackson? Because nothing has the potential to dramatically improve our economy like tech innovation.</p><p>Last month, a conference on technology innovation was held in Jackson. The conference featured AOL founder and billionaire Steve Case, who shared the stage with Jackson's own Jim Barksdale. They told some fascinating stories about their decades working together through  AOL's acquisition of Netscape and the eventual merger with Time Warner. But the most valuable information came from Case. Now a venture capitalist, Case provided some sage advice about where he's putting his money and why, and he gave Mississippi's political leadership some very specific direction about the future.</p><p>Case recently announced the establishment of Rise of the Rest Seed Fund II, a venture capital fund led by his investment firm, Revolution. This is his second fund designed to support entrepreneurs, startups and early stage tech companies in underserved areas in the United States. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also backs the fund along with a host of highly successful entrepreneurs, like Spanx founder Sara Blakely. Blakely says, \"geography should not be the reason bight ideas don't come to life.\"</p><p>Partly due to overvaluation in places like Silicon Valley and partly due to a wide distribution of talents and ideas across America, Case is looking in cities and states outside of the traditional tech incubation zones. According to Case, roughly 85% of all venture capital investments are made in three states - California, New York and Massachusetts.</p><p>His message to the leaders in Mississippi was a hopeful one. He chided lawmakers to eschew the normal corporate welfare and incentive hunting competition and instead think about better ways to get sustainable economic growth - like encouraging tech innovation.</p><p>He suggested policymakers in Mississippi should think about how to permit tech innovations, rather than how to protect incumbent industries. He spent some time discussing how tech innovation could lead to a faster economic recovery than anything the government could try to orchestrate. He even suggested a robust tech innovation sector in Mississippi could be the antidote to brain drain, causing a \"boomerang effect,\" bringing talented and ambitious Mississippians back to the Magnolia State for jobs, opportunities and improved quality of life.</p><p>At the Mississippi Center for Public Policy, our job is to recommend evidence-based policy ideas to help our political leaders make prudent decisions. This is why we are beginning an effort to encourage leaders to adopt a \"permissionless innovation\" policy.

Legislation already enacted by some states (with more in the queue) combined with momentum in Washington, D.C. following congressional hearings and recent activity by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are fueling movement on the issue. In addition, the business community is keenly interested in developing a federal framework for privacy regulation. A uniform set of rules at the federal level certainly beats the nightmare of having to comply with a patchwork of fifty separate state regulatory regimes. The European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implemented in May 2018 provides a model of what to do and include, and more importantly what not to do and include for privacy regulation in the U.S. As most of us know by now, GDPR requires U.S.-based companies doing business in the EU to comply with their rules. </p><p>Among other provisions, the regulations require an \u201copt-in\u201d system where consumers have to agree to every occurrence of data collection. California\u2019s new law \u2013 the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) signed this past summer \u2013 is not as harsh as GDPR but is definitely generous with the rules and red tape. The CCPA, which takes effect in 2020, gives consumers new rights regarding their data. Companies are required to: provide an opt-out to data sharing, inform consumers about what data is being collected on them or shared with third parties, and allow consumers to delete data about themselves. There are big fines and ambiguous language in CCPA, which sets the stage for a lot of confusion and costly litigation The \u201cgood\u201d news? Businesses with less than $25 million in revenue are exempt from the CCPA. So, lawmakers were thinking about smaller businesses in terms of regulatory burden. But if you are a firm that buys, receives, sells, shares the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, or derives 50 percent or more of your revenues from the sale of consumer\u2019s personal information on an annual basis, CCPA applies to your business. According to Upside, businesses will reach that 50,000 consumer-threshold very quickly if they accept credit cards because of how this data will be counted. For businesses over the $25 million threshold or that meet the other tests, upfront and ongoing compliance costs could get rather hefty. Businesses need to begin preparing now in order to be fully compliant in 2020. That means, according to Upside: \u201cTo comply with the 12-month look-back for consumer requests as of the law\u2019s effective date, businesses will need to begin mapping data and keeping records of personal information (PI) on January 1, 2019. Data inventorying and management vendors are scrambling to update their platforms to enable businesses to do so, and the cost of such solutions is projected to be significant \u2014 $50,000 to $100,000 a year.\u201d Beyond direct costs for these \u201clarger\u201d or data-rich small businesses, there is no doubt there will be costs to the Internet ecosystem with regard to innovation. This will prove harmful for all firms and consumers, not to mention the overall economy. And as we\u2019ve seen with intrusive regulation in general, it tends to produce unintended consequences. Yes, a uniform set of federal rules is desirable. But Congress must approach privacy legislation with humility and caution. Our data-driven economy offers many benefits, and regulation should only occur where there is harm or great risks for the consumer. From the entrepreneur\u2019s perspective, a new privacy framework must continue to encourage private-sector innovation. It needs to address the real (not perceived) problems in the marketplace. Regulation must be industry neutral and adaptable to the rapidly-changing marketplace and economy. Meaning, it needs to be flexible. The \u201cbig tech backlash\u201d should not lead to over-regulation of all businesses because of the misdeeds (or fallen reputations) of a few. When this happens, entrepreneurs and small businesses are harmed, and investment and innovation are diminished. Our economy, which is now getting back on track because of healthy investment, high small business optimism and stronger business creation can ill afford this type of regulatory setback. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN635598120181124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTC-SM31-DXCW-D1BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 24, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Legislation already enacted by some states (with more in the queue) combined with momentum in Washington, D.C following congressional hearings and recent activity by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are fueling movement on the issue. In addition, the business community is keenly interested in developing a federal framework for privacy regulation. A uniform set of rules at the federal level certainly beats the nightmare of having to comply with a patchwork of fifty separate state regulatory regimes. The European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implemented in May 2018 provides a model of what to do and include, and more importantly what not to do and include for privacy regulation in the U.S As most of us know by now, GDPR requires U.S -based companies doing business in the EU to comply with their rules. </p><p>Among other provisions, the regulations require an \u201copt-in\u201d system where consumers have to agree to every occurrence of data collection. California\u2019s new law \u2013 the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) signed this past summer \u2013 is not as harsh as GDPR but is definitely generous with the rules and red tape. The CCPA, which takes effect in 2020, gives consumers new rights regarding their data. Companies are required to: provide an opt-out to data sharing, inform consumers about what data is being collected on them or shared with third parties, and allow consumers to delete data about themselves. There are big fines and ambiguous language in CCPA, which sets the stage for a lot of confusion and costly litigation The \u201cgood\u201d news? Businesses with less than $25 million in revenue are exempt from the CCPA. So, lawmakers were thinking about smaller businesses in terms of regulatory burden. But if you are a firm that buys, receives, sells, shares the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, or derives 50 percent or more of your revenues from the sale of consumer\u2019s personal information on an annual basis, CCPA applies to your business. According to Upside, businesses will reach that 50,000 consumer-threshold very quickly if they accept credit cards because of how this data will be counted. For businesses over the $25 million threshold or that meet the other tests, upfront and ongoing compliance costs could get rather hefty. Businesses need to begin preparing now in order to be fully compliant in 2020. That means, according to Upside: \u201cTo comply with the 12-month look-back for consumer requests as of the law\u2019s effective date, businesses will need to begin mapping data and keeping records of personal information (PI) on January 1, 2019. Data inventorying and management vendors are scrambling to update their platforms to enable businesses to do so, and the cost of such solutions is projected to be significant \u2014 $50,000 to $100,000 a year.\u201d Beyond direct costs for these \u201clarger\u201d or data-rich small businesses, there is no doubt there will be costs to the Internet ecosystem with regard to innovation. This will prove harmful for all firms and consumers, not to mention the overall economy. And as we\u2019ve seen with intrusive regulation in general, it tends to produce unintended consequences. Yes, a uniform set of federal rules is desirable. But Congress must approach privacy legislation with humility and caution. Our data-driven economy offers many benefits, and regulation should only occur where there is harm or great risks for the consumer. From the entrepreneur\u2019s perspective, a new privacy framework must continue to encourage private-sector innovation. It needs to address the real (not perceived) problems in the marketplace. Regulation must be industry neutral and adaptable to the rapidly-changing marketplace and economy. Meaning, it needs to be flexible. The \u201cbig tech backlash\u201d should not lead to over-regulation of all businesses because of the misdeeds (or fallen reputations) of a few. When this happens, entrepreneurs and small businesses are harmed, and investment and innovation are diminished. Our economy, which is now getting back on track because of healthy investment, high small business optimism and stronger business creation can ill afford this type of regulatory setback.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1119439I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNS-G5G1-F0YC-N3YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 24, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

One model they might consider is what happened some 35 years ago to another tech giant, the phone company. NPR's Brian Naylor reports.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIAN NAYLOR:                 Before Sprint, before Verizon, before T-Mobile, it was a simpler time. There was the phone company - just one - American Telephone and Telegraph, known by all as AT&amp;T Ma Bell. If you're old enough, you might remember their ads.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 (Singing) Reach out. Reach out and touch someone. Reach out. Call up and just say, hi.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 AT&amp;T controlled it all. You leased your phone from them. Your local and long-distance calls traveled over their lines. They ran their own research laboratory. AT&amp;T was, in every sense of the word, a monopoly. And this began to bother some folks.             </p><p>STEVE COLL:                 As the computer age blossomed and computers increasingly interacted with the phone system to create new opportunities for consumers, the monopoly seemed like an obstacle to innovation, an obstacle to the future.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 Steve Coll wrote a book about the AT&amp;T monopoly called \"The Deal Of The Century: The Breakup Of AT&amp;T.\"             </p><p>STEVE COLL:                 And so some of the new startup companies, the equivalent of Silicon Valley companies in the '70s, started to bring private antitrust actions against AT&amp;T, complaining that the phone system was so inflexible and so pervasive that it stifled competition.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 It wasn't just competitors who felt that way. The Department of Justice started looking at the Bell System and whether it was in violation of antitrust law. It was a daunting task to take on such a corporate behemoth. Philip Verveer was a young staff attorney at the DOJ's antitrust division at the time.             </p><p>PHILIP VERVEER:                 It's hard, probably, for most people to appreciate how powerful AT&amp;T was in those days, but it provided phone service for 90% of the country and long-distance service for essentially 100% of the country.             </p><p>BRIAN NAYLOR:                 But despite the phone company's power, the Justice Department took it on, filing suit to break up AT&amp;T in 1974. In 1982, the company decided to settle the case. And two years later, AT&amp;T chief financial officer Robert Allen mournfully announced the breakup had taken place.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ROBERT ALLEN:                 Gone is the old Bell System franchise.

Could today's tech revolution and the application of digitalization and artificial intelligence be having a powerful disruptive effect not fully recognized statistically? And what are the policy implications if productivity growth is being under-measured in the official data?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the industrial revolution of the late 1800s as the United States was fast becoming an industrial giant, the U.S. economy experienced roughly 8 percent growth and 3 percent deflation. Are there lessons from this period for today's policymakers, who are struggling to make sense of the inexplicable workings of monetary policy even as they continue to undershoot the central bank's inflation targets despite extraordinary levels of monetary stimulus? And who benefits if productivity growth turns out to have been explosive? What about the bulk of the population that doesn't work in technology or own tech-centered stock portfolios?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARCO ANNUNZIATA</p><p>Co-founder, Annunziata + Desai Advisors, and Co-host, M4Edge tech podcast</p><p>This technological revolution will prove more powerful and far-reaching than the first industrial revolution, in my view. Digital innovation has opened new frontiers in product design, through generative design processes, and in manufacturing, through 3D printing. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a new general-purpose technology capable of accelerating progress from biotechnology to materials science, from augmented and virtual reality to autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Traditional measurements struggle to cope with this fast and broad-ranging transformation. Academic studies suggest that official statistics underestimate GDP and productivity growth--though measurement issues are unlikely to explain the bulk of the productivity growth deceleration observed in the past ten years. Most of the productivity benefits still lie ahead of us: they will materialize as new technologies scale through new investment, and as companies learn to adapt operations, management practices, and workforce skills to make optimal use of these innovations.</p><p>We have evidence that technological innovation is exerting a significant disinflationary impact--from the rapidly falling costs of data computing and storage power, to the increased competition brought about by online retail platforms, to the data-driven efficiency gains in supply chains.</p><p>In a nutshell, thanks to technological innovation, inflation remains muted even in a fast-growth environment, and productivity growth is a bit better than we think and set to accelerate a lot more.</p><p>What implications should we draw? First of all, we should be more optimistic, as these are positive, welfare-enhancing trends. They can be complex, they make it harder to measure and interpret economic trends, and they bring new challenges--such as identifying and building new skills in the workforce. Some of the challenges, like the benefits, will take time to emerge, and we must be watchful. But on balance, these are good problems to have--especially as the benefits of better products at lower prices in a faster-growing economy accrue well beyond the smaller ranks of technology workers and investors.</p><p>Central banks should ponder whether their efforts to boost inflation are justified. Yes, inflation is lower than we expected. But there is no evidence of real and present deflation dangers, and low inflation has not prevented the United States and eurozone from growing at a robust pace in the last few years. Indeed, to the extent that we are underestimating productivity growth, the economy is further away from stalling than policymakers seem to fear. And if ongoing innovation is building steam for a further productivity acceleration, then our economy has even greater pent-up momentum that will come on line over the coming decade.</p><p>Discussions of secular stagnation, deflation risks, and additional fiscal and monetary stimulus are then misplaced and mis-timed. Policy efforts should go towards stimulating further private investment, which will accelerate the spread of productivity gains; focusing public spending on upgrading critical infrastructure, including data infrastructure; bolstering education and training to identify and build the right skills and enable lifelong learning; and adapting social safety nets to better assist segments of the workforce at higher risk of disruption.</p><p>SCOTT BESSENT</p><p>CIO and Founder, Key Square Capital Management</p><p>The prevailing narrative holds that productivity growth has fallen significantly since the financial crisis. Indeed, data from the Census Bureau show productivity growth had grown at an average rate of 2.1 percent from 1980-2009, but has grown at an average rate of only 1.1 percent since. However, there are good reasons to believe that this data paint a gloomy and unimaginative picture.</p><p>Economists have produced an ample body of work suggesting that the Consumer Price Index significantly overstates the true rate of inflation. As economist Martin Feldstein pointed out in his September 2016 remarks at the Brookings Institution Conference on Productivity, the most common method used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to assess the quality change of a good is to measure the marginal cost of new input requirements directly tied to changes in product quality. To the extent there hasn't been any change in cost, the BLS concludes there's been no change in quality. The BLS similarly relies on input costs when assessing the change in quality of services. Clearly this methodology misses important quality improvements and leads to an upward bias in the inflation statistics.</p><p>But the problem with calculating the CPI runs even deeper. As Brent Neiman and Joseph Vavra note in a recent paper on \"The Rise of Niche Consumption,\" there has been an explosion in the number of products available to consumers. This has allowed households to increasingly concentrate their purchases on a smaller number of preferred products, as consumers increasingly differ on the individual products they purchase. In other words, it's not just that individual products are themselves getting better, but rather there's been a proliferation of new products specifically targeted to meet the individual tastes and preferences of each consumer. This creates welfare benefits for consumers that are not adequately captured by the standard government statistics.</p><p>In his important new book, Narrative Economics, Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller cites economist Tjalling Koopmans' famous article, \"Measurement without Theory.\" Koopmans (also a Nobel laureate) asked for theories based on actual human behavior rather than the standard statistical properties of time series data. It is not difficult to posit where Koopmans would have come down on the question of under-measured productivity growth.</p><p>Adjusted for measurement errors, inflation has been lower than reported and thus real GDP, properly measured, has been substantially higher. Likewise, as real GDP is imputed from nominal GDP data and then adjusted for inflation, a lower rate of inflation means that the slowdown in both real GDP and productivity growth has been less dramatic than reported.</p><p>However, this is not what matters to the average consumer, and knowledge of these corrected statistics is unlikely to quell the populist fervor we are witnessing around the world. For what matters to individuals is not whether their absolute welfare has improved, but rather how their absolute welfare has changed relative to the welfare of those around them.</p><p>In fact, rather than appreciating the dramatic improvement in living standards allowed by the digital revolution, most Americans likely adhere to the narrative that technology is destroying their future earning capacity. This two-century-old existential fear, coupled with levels of wealth inequality not seen since the early 1900s, has the potential to further inflame both nationalist and socialist populist political gains.</p><p>Francis Browne contributed to this article. The views presented in this article are purely the opinions of the author and are not intended to constitute investment, tax, or legal advice of any nature and should not be relied on for any purpose.</p><p>JASON FURMAN</p><p>Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy, Harvard University's Kennedy School, and Nonresident Senior Fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics</p><p>The official statistics miss a lot of the productivity growth in the economy. They miss the full benefits of Google searches, Amazon Prime, Wikipedia pages, and online travel booking, among other items. A common feature of every item in this list is that they were all widely available by 2007. So the 2.7 percent annual productivity growth from 1995 to 2007 was understated, possibly by a lot. We have continued innovating since then but at nowhere near the pace. So while the 1.3 percent annual growth in productivity since 2007 has also been understated, it has not been understated by as much as it was in the earlier period. As a result, the slowdown in productivity growth is--if anything--even larger than what is shown in the official statistics.</p><p>This introspective judgment is borne out in a range of studies that have attempted to quantify bias in measures of prices, or conversely of productivity. These measures typically find that, if anything, the bias has gotten smaller over time. Still, this seems completely counterintuitive. How could it be?</p><p>First, technology is only a small subset of our economy and innovation has not been nearly as large or consequential in larger sectors such as construction, education, or healthcare. Second, technology has done more to offer new options for consumers than to change business processes. Third, much of what technology offers consumers is new ways to use their time that are often marginal improvements at best. YouTube may be great, but what matters is how much better YouTube is than television. Finally, as Nicholas Bloom, Charles Jones, John Van Reenen, and Michael Webb have argued, new ideas may simply be becoming harder to find. The combination of artificial intelligence and robotics enabling the mechanization of the picking of soft fruits like strawberries is simply much less economically important than everything else we mechanized in agriculture without the benefit of the artificial intelligence, like the harvesting of grains. Similarly, personalized medicine is making amazing advances but often limited to treating much narrower categories of diseases than previous innovations, such as antibiotics.</p><p>Moreover, as economist Robert Gordon has pointed out, it is hard to argue the latest technologies are anywhere near as transformative as those in earlier periods. Take the 1890s, a decade that saw the invention of or major innovations and commercialization of American subways, aspirin, bottle caps, diesel engines, escalators, gasoline-powered cars, motion pictures, paper clips, radio, rubber surgical gloves, steel-framed skyscrapers, typewriters, vertical filing cabinets, wireless telegraph, x-rays, and the zipper. Compare that to smartwatches.</p><p>We might hit an inflection point in the future where productivity finally starts to take off, but I am getting increasingly pessimistic with each passing year. Assuming it does not happen, what does it mean for policymakers? Monetary policymakers may decide that bias in inflation is so large and variable that we should target something we can more easily measure, like nominal GDP. Most important, however, it is an argument against policymakers complacently assuming technology will ride to the rescue all on its own and an argument for policymakers stepping up structural policies, including public investments in innovation and the promotion of competition, to help the innovation process along.</p><p>MAREK DABROWSKI</p><p>Non-Resident Scholar, Bruegel, and CASE Fellow, CASE-Center for Social and Economic Research</p><p>In the last decade, most advanced economies have grown more slowly than before. In Japan, a slowdown began in the 1990s. Slower growth has frequently been seen as a legacy of financial crises, especially that of 2007-2009. Indeed, shocks generated by that crisis in particular include a far-reaching financial disintermediation that depressed demand in short term. However, it coincided with a deterioration of several supply-side factors. The first was related to demography, that is, the stagnation or decline of working-age population and population aging. So far, the United States has been less affected than Japan, Europe, or China, but a slower increase in the U.S. labor force is visible. Increasing immigration and a higher retirement age can neutralize partly negative demographic trends, but both meet political resistance.</p><p>Lower productivity growth as compared with the 1990s and early 2000s is the second factor. Perhaps this phenomenon is also partly related to demography (is an aging society equally as innovative as a younger one?), or perhaps it is just a matter of the technology cycle.</p><p>Is actual technological progress under-measured? There is no empirical evidence in favor of such a hypothesis. Can one expect a new wave of technological revolution, this time related to robotization, artificial intelligence, big data, or any other great innovation? Maybe, but we do not know when exactly it will happen. History suggests that for rapid productivity growth, innovation itself is not enough. It must be broadly applied, as happened with electricity and the combustion engine in the first half of twentieth century and, more recently, with computers. It is also worth noting that the recent wave of trade protectionism, foreign investment screening, and security-motivated restrictions on technology transfer will harm both technological progress (which requires global cooperation), and its fast and broad application.</p><p>Can monetary policy help accelerate economic growth in such circumstances? Not at all. Advanced economies do not suffer from insufficient demand. The International Monetary Fund estimates of output gap show that the eurozone is growing at potential and the United States above potential. Additional monetary (or fiscal) stimulus is unable to push up economic growth on a sustainable basis because these economies are supply-side constrained. Therefore, the recent monetary easing decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank cannot bring the expected growth effects. On the contrary, they may do more harm than good if they contribute to further financial disintermediation and new financial bubbles.</p><p>Similarly, attempts to deliver on declared inflation targets (usually 2 percent) are pointless because there is no evidence that such an inflation rate is better for economic growth and employment than a slightly lower one such as 1.5 percent. In fact, the latter is closer to the literal meaning of price stability, which is the overarching mission of most central banks. Hence, central banks should revise down their operational inflation targets rather than push inflation up.</p><p>JAMES K. GALBRAITH</p><p>Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., Chair in Government/Business Relations, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin, and 2020 recipient, Veblen-Commons Award</p><p>An excellent question, because it gives me a chance to celebrate having made this precise point five years ago. In The End of Normal: The Great Crisis and the Future of Growth (Free Press, 2014), I devote a chapter to the digital revolution. My answer is an emphatic yes: the problem is with statistics and not with the evidence of eyes and memories:</p><p>With the digital technologies... [f]irst, the price of the equipment required to make the new digital products--measured per unit of output--falls rapidly over time, reducing the value of business investment in the GDP. Second, the products themselves replace marketable output. Communications, information, education, entertainment, and (perhaps especially) retail sales, all previously paid for on a per-unit basis, start arriving for free. They are still part of life--of activity--even to a greater extent than ever before. But they drop out from the economy. The activities in question no longer provide income, and so they no longer provide jobs, and so they no longer form part of what we measure when we speak of economic growth. In this sense, the new technologies save both labor and capital, which accounts for the fact that the ratio of employment to GDP has not fallen as the technologies diffuse. The main effect is on the measured growth of GDP itself, not on the relationship of GDP growth to employment growth.</p><p>In the previous technological wave, automobiles, roads, service stations, and repair shops replaced horses, largely raised and maintained off-market, while appliances, restaurants, and laundries replaced home production--unpaid and unmeasured. The effect then was to boost our measure of economic activity. The effect now is to depress that measure, while dis-employed office and service workers go the way, alas, of the horses.</p><p>New patterns of international trade compound the illusion. In the previous century, business investment had large elements of cement and steel, along with heavy machines produced in the United States. In today's economy, business investments have large elements of imported electronics--and imports are subtracted from GDP. So a business boom adds less to GDP than it used to.</p><p>Is there a cure? Yes, and we've found it. It consists of expanding and improving services, public goods, and maintenance, including especially education, health care, and the environment. Growth in service jobs explains why unemployment has come down. The difficulty is in the distribution of incomes and the structure of demands. We've got too many dog-walkers, security guards, tattoo parlors, and nail salons, but not enough nurses and school teachers because (guess what?) we don't pay those middle-class professionals enough to compensate for the training and the stress.</p><p>Raise the minimum wage. Provide health care and higher education free of debt. Expand Social Security. Tax high incomes and estates. If we rebuild the middle class, the new technologies will work out fine.</p><p>MAURICE R. GREENBERG</p><p>Chairman and CEO, C.V. Starr and Co.</p><p>With the global population now reaching close to 7.7 billion, all world leaders will continue to search for ways to improve the living standards of their people. History has shown us that increases in economic productivity are closely related to an increase in living standards, and that the only permanent way to increase productivity is through technology innovation.</p><p>During my long career, many examples come to mind--jet engines, fiber optics, advances in health care, mobile phones, personal computers, and the internet, all of which have led to significant improvements in economic productivity. More recently, rapid advances in cloud computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing, have laid the blueprint for the next generation of technological innovation.</p><p>It may be some time before the increases in economic productivity that these new technologies bring are fully realized, but there is no doubt they will be substantial.</p><p>Governments and companies that embrace them will be the winners and those that resist will not. Kai-Fu Lee, one of the leaders of artificial intelligence development in China, stated on a \"60 Minutes\" broadcast that artificial intelligence would prove to be more significant than the development of electricity.</p><p>It is true that new technologies when introduced into the workforce can be a source of temporary or permanent disruption for the economy as business processes and employees adapt to and are trained in the new technologies. There are predictions that within fifteen years, artificial intelligence will be able to replace around 40 percent to 50 percent of present jobs in the United States. Even if this disruption takes longer to become a factor, the disruption to the job markets will be very significant and have many ramifications.</p><p>Disruptions resulting from technological innovation can lead to productivity growth being under-measured by official statistics, which may be happening now, but over the longer term, significant increases in productivity will be realized.</p><p>There are economic policy implications if increases in productivity are not accurately captured in official statistics. For example, if productivity growth is being under-measured, this could disrupt the resetting of interest rates and improper measures could be utilized in the consideration of interest rate changes. Who benefits if productivity growth turns out to have been explosive? Consumers could benefit as there could be lower prices, while workers in clerical or repetitive-type jobs would be adversely affected (for example, by loss of jobs).</p><p>It is up to policymakers and business leaders to come together to discuss the impact of technological innovation on the economy so that better economic policies can be put forth.</p><p>According to the International Data Corporation Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Systems Spending Guide, worldwide spending on artificial intelligence systems is forecast to reach $37.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to increase to $97.9 billion in 2023. At Starr Insurance Companies, we have invested in and partnered with Amenity Analytics, which develops cloud-based text analytics solutions using natural programming language processing and machine learning.</p><p>Tools offered by Amenity are currently being used or are in development to help us learn more about the risk profiles of target companies to which we would like to offer insurance products, enhance and improve our underwriting capabilities, and other uses are also being considered. Our business processes are being streamlined and employees trained to incorporate these new technologies. We intend to further integrate these and other technologies into our insurance and investment businesses in the coming months.</p><p>Technology innovation will continue and hopefully past advances will pave the way for future innovations that will be used to protect our natural resources, advance healthcare, improve living standards, and make the world a safer and more peaceful place for all.</p><p>CATHERINE L. MANN</p><p>Global Chief Economist and Managing Director, Citi</p><p>Artificial intelligence, 5G, digitalization, freemium models of business--innovations, but where is the productivity? Without a doubt, there is robust innovation in accessing, aggregating, and deploying data to better understand existing as well as create new firms and production technologies, and both meet and create customer and business demands. Is the United States experiencing an unmeasured productivity miracle, somewhat akin to the Solow paradox of the 1980s? Unfortunately, the current innovation ecosystem faces important headwinds, which collectively lead to more modest prospects for productivity growth going forward. It is unlikely that productivity growth is so mis-measured as to give a false signal about the state of U.S. firms, workers, and the U.S. economy. Policy changes are needed to underpin faster productivity growth.</p><p>What headwinds hold back innovation and productivity that are not related to measurement, and that proper measurement will not solve? The first headwind is a stalled diffusion process. Frontier firms innovate. But other firms either cannot absorb the new ideas or intellectual property rules prevent them from accessing the innovations. The creative destruction process seems to have changed, with more low-productivity firms remaining. Many metrics of business dynamism have slowed.</p><p>The second headwind is lower competitive pressures. Although the productivity growth of frontier firms has been more dramatic than that of the laggards, the wave of mergers and acquisitions in the recent decade appears to have reduced the incentives to innovate to \"beat the competition.\" Measured productivity growth at the frontier has moderated.</p><p>A third headwind has been a retreat from globalization. Globalization as measured by trade intensity (exports plus imports as a share of GDP) stalled a decade ago, hand-in-hand with the productivity-growth slowdown. Foreign direct investment flows have fallen off. With reduced prospects for new customers and expanding markets abroad, there may be less incentive to innovate to reach scale or to meet heterogeneous tastes.</p><p>A fourth headwind is unproductive financial investment flows. More financial capital appears to flow to non-innovative uses such as debt build-up, mergers and acquisitions, and buy-backs. Firms that engage in more research and development to support innovation are not necessarily rewarded by investors. Government spending on basic research, which all companies can share to support their own innovative efforts, has deteriorated.</p><p>The final headwind is rising inequality. The relationship between innovation and inequality is complex. Certainly productivity and innovation gains that are measured are returned to stockholders and workers at the frontier firms. But with regard to measurement issues, if the U.S. economy was experiencing an unmeasured productivity miracle, it seems unlikely that so much of the unmeasured gains would go to the lower end of the income distribution so as to alter the widening income and wealth gap, within and across generations.</p><p>In sum, mis-measurement of productivity does not materially impact these five forces affecting innovation and productivity growth. A real productivity miracle requires addressing these headwinds.</p><p>ROBERT LITAN</p><p>Non-Resident Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution</p><p>Economists are lousy at predicting future productivity growth, the engine of improvement in average living standards. That is because the growth of productivity largely depends on the pace of advances in diffusion of disruptive innovations, such as those in artificial intelligence, which economists, or even the technologists themselves, cannot come close to confidently forecasting. We are thus left with at least three scenarios, and little basis for attaching any probability to each.</p><p>Skeptics such as Northwestern University's Robert Gordon, author of the magisterial The Rise and Fall of U.S. Growth, are likely to claim that the pace of advance in artificial intelligence, like that of the information technology revolution itself, is being over-hyped. If this is case, the United States and the rest of the world must learn to cope with continued slow growth--something no one seems to have handled well so far, judging by rising nationalism and political polarization.</p><p>Artificial intelligence enthusiasts claim we have seen nothing yet, and that advances in artificial intelligence eventually will put productivity growth on a much higher path. Cassandras fear that this outcome will lead to substantially higher levels of unemployment, claiming that this time will be different: unlike the pattern of the last two hundred years of productivity growth, the AI-induced boost to productivity in the future will be so large and so sudden that millions of people rendered unemployed will never find another job. Hence the support for a \"universal basic income,\" which would do little to help the displaced while greatly enlarging an already bloated federal budget deficit.</p><p>The Cassandras also ignore the fact that faster productivity growth will lower the prices of many goods and services, enabling consumers to spend on other things--like education, health care, and entertainment, among other industries, that will need more workers over time to meet the demand. The labor market eventually will adapt to market-driven changes, as it always has.</p><p>The clear policy challenge: government must do its part to smooth this adjustment process by enabling workers to gain new skills continuously throughout their working lives, on their current jobs (by using fiscal and monetary policy levers to keep the economy \"running hot\" as it has been in recent year) or outside work, through support for skills certificate programs offered by community colleges and private educators (regulated to prevent fraud, including mandated disclosure of data on job placement rates in the certificated fields and initial salaries for those gaining such jobs).</p><p>In addition, government should provide \"place-based\" assistance for areas hard hit by productivity or climate change-induced disruption--preferably by subsidizing the wages of new hires rather than the Opportunity Zones authorized by the 2017 tax bill, which seem to be subsidizing mainly high-end residential real estate construction even in those zones (such as apartments for well-heeled students in some university towns).</p><p>In fact, that same set of policies--people- and place-based assistance--is warranted in the middle scenario in which artificial intelligence and other sources of productivity growth keep it on modest path--say at 1.5-2.0 percent annually, a little bit above where we have been, but not so rapid as in the high-growth scenario.</p><p>Politicians in both parties so far have paid insufficient attention to these remedies, preferring to take the time-worn path of least resistance: promising voters to \"save their jobs\" through various means, such as firm-specific handouts or trade protection. I hope, perhaps in vain, that at some point our leaders will just level with voters: tell them that trying to hold back technological progress is impossible, that promises to do so cannot be fulfilled, and government does best when it helps people who need help to swim in the river of change rather than letting them drown.</p><p>JIM O'NEILL</p><p>Former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, United Kingdom, and former Chairman, Asset Management, Goldman Sachs International</p><p>Until a few years ago, I was quite a big fan of the idea that our nominal and real GDP were being underestimated, especially in economies where the services sector is a dominant part of the economy. It is quite clear that the measurement of many technology-based services businesses is quite difficult, and it is intuitively sensible that their contribution to GDP is underestimated.</p><p>However, as statisticians have got wise to this dilemma, and have started to explore, and in some cases try to employ, techniques which use modern technology to survey people about the nominal value they attach to such services, the subsequent revisions to GDP haven't been spectacular. At some point, perhaps the imagined and understandable productivity benefits of many of these things may come through, and then productivity will rise.</p><p>However, as we creep through time, I think there are evidential reasons to doubt these ideas. First, if productivity were actually much stronger than is currently measured, we should also see evidence of the parallel higher wages and earnings in the regular statistics, and quite clearly in many countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, this has not happened despite very strong employment levels. Indeed, a separate surprise remains just how soft wage growth is despite extremely strong levels of reported employment. It is also the case that if true growth were stronger than reported, then government finances should be higher than is often reported, as tax revenues would be higher.</p><p>Second, and it is this last observation that has got me exploring this idea, perhaps the way modern financial management, and indeed overall risk management, has evolved, many companies--especially publicly quoted ones--are not incentivized to invest in fixed capital, and with the flexible labor markets apparent, it is easier to hire people instead of investing. This is especially true in some modern tech industries where the fixed capital requirements are less than in historic industries. This can easily explain the productivity weakness, if true, as essentially the result of business leaders preferring the flexibility and price of labor to that of capital. If this is true, policymakers should explore some of the regulations governing how companies are managed, and especially how CEOs are given incentives, including share options.</p><p>Third, while many modern technologies seem to have improved our lives, as is becoming recognized in some aspects of life, perhaps we are all spending too much time online and this is not making us more productive. A controversial way of trying to test ideas like this is to change the perception, and perhaps reality, that many online services are free.</p><p>J. W. MASON</p><p>Assistant Professor of Economics, John Jay College-CUNY, and Fellow, Roosevelt Institute</p><p>How many hamburgers equal one haircut?</p><p>In itself, this question doesn't make sense. They're just different things. What we can compare is how much they cost. This is true across the board--the only way we can convert all the endlessly varied objects and activities that make up \"the economy\" into a single number is through their market prices. Markets are what let us express all the various products of human labor as a single quantity we call output.</p><p>This means that productivity is only meaningful in the context of market prices. There are lots of things that people do that are useful, important, even essential to economic life, from raising children to following the law, that can't be expressed as output per hour.</p><p>So it doesn't really make sense to ask if the nonmarket effects of technological change mean we are under-measuring productivity. A new technology may transform our lives in all sorts of ways, but we can't talk about its effect on productivity except insofar as its products are sold. There's no other basis on which productivity can even be defined--we have to go by market prices. And what market prices are telling us is that productivity growth is slower than it used to be.</p><p>This slowdown is not really surprising. Manufacturing--where the transformation of work by technology has gone farthest, and where productivity growth is almost always fastest--is steadily shrinking as a share of the economy.</p><p>It is true that we often think of economic growth as something broader than market prices. It's supposed to describe a more general rise in living standards. So a more meaningful way to ask the question might be: Does measured productivity growth accurately reflect the material improvements in people's lives?</p><p>The answer here is indeed no. But unfortunately, in the rich countries at least, the mismeasurement probably goes the opposite way as the question suggests.</p><p>Measures such as life expectancy used to be closely linked with economic growth. In poor countries, this is still the case--higher GDP is associated with longer lifespans, lower child mortality, and similar improvements in health and wellbeing. If anything, today's GDP growth may be associated with even faster improvement than we would expect based on the historical record. But in richer countries the opposite is true--higher GDP no longer translates reliably into better health outcomes. In some places--such as the United Kingdom, and much of the United States -- life expectancy is actually falling, even as income per capita continues to rise.</p><p>Leisure time is another measure of wellbeing. Presumably if people were having an easier time meeting their material needs, they would choose to take more time off work. (Adam Smith once suggested that the amount of leisure people enjoyed was the only meaningful standard of economic value across countries.) On this measure too, living standards seem to be falling short of GDP growth rather than running ahead of it. Between the end of World War II and the early 1980s, the average weekly hours of an employed American fell by almost 15 percent. But since then, average hours per worker have been essentially flat. This makes the postwar growth performance look even better, and the more recent performance worse, than the headline numbers suggest.</p><p>It seems likely that measured productivity overstates, rather than understates, our real improvement in living standards, at least in the United States. If so, the policy implications seem clear. Policymakers should worry less about growth, and more about concrete interventions that we know improve people's lives--things like universal access to childcare and health care, high-quality education, and paid time off for all.</p><p>MOHAMED A. EL-ERIAN</p><p>Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz; Chair, President Obama's Global Development Council; and Professor of Practice, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania</p><p>An increasing number of today's technological innovations are changing not just what we do, but also how. This is particularly the case for areas that are influenced by the combination of big data, artificial intelligence, and mobility. It's a global phenomenon that is only likely to accelerate, raising a broader host of economic, regulatory, and social questions.</p><p>One of the lessons from past technological shocks of this magnitude is that it takes time for them to be embedded deeply in economy-wide structures--and for at least one good reason. Established companies need time to incorporate the innovations in a full internal investment cycle, and also to adapt their internal procedures and external footprints accordingly.</p><p>This is but one of several reasons why our traditional measures of productivity have yet to capture the full scale and scope of a series of accelerating technological disruptions that have important economic, financial, institutional, social, political, and geopolitical dimensions. The net aggregation has the potential to be positive and beneficial. But the underlying input-output equations involve significant compositional effects that need to be taken seriously, as well as a range of consequential uncertainties.</p><p>You need only look at what's happening to Big Tech to observe the complexities in play. Undoubtedly these companies' innovations have enabled and empowered people to do more, including expanding the range of anywhere/anytime/any place activities. The combination of what I call the Amazon/Google/Uber influences has been to significantly enlarge the range of direct, better-informed, and monitorable activities that the population at large can undertake using both existing and new assets. But it has also raised serious questions about behavior modification, and it is empowering bad actors--both of which speaks to a larger reality: what has been enabled is now outpacing not only what governments and society can keep up with, but also what the Big Tech companies themselves are prepared to handle.</p><p>The next few years will see innovations being reflected in a shifting distribution of potential outcomes for the economy which, importantly, will also be more bi-modal in shape (that is, with fatter negative and positive tails, and with a less dominant belly/center). Ensuring that these tails are tilted more to the positive end of the distribution is a major challenge for governments and companies, and also a shared responsibility.</p><p>WILLIAM H. JANEWAY</p><p>Special Limited Partner, Warburg Pincus, Affiliated Member of the Faculty of Economics, Cambridge University, and author, Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy: Reconfiguring the Three-Player Game between Markets, Speculators and the State (2018)</p><p>The U.S. economy is experiencing a technological revolution of a depth and scale comparable to the impact of steam and electrification. This revolution has been ongoing since the 1980s and has not been so \"quiet\": it encompassed the great dot.com/internet bubble of the late 1990s and also played a critical role in generating the global financial crisis of 2008. While the hype about artificial intelligence is grotesquely overstated versus the limited capabilities of current machine learning techniques, never before has so much data been generated and captured for analysis and action, with consequences potentially productive and destructive.</p><p>The digital revolution has enabled the second great globalization of economic life due to extreme reductions in the friction of moving goods, capital, and work across borders. Another great wave of automation is transforming both the content and the management of work, with a definite bias in favor of capital and against labor. And the financialization of the economy is a third outcome, from the securitization of assets of all kinds--from mortgages to student loans--to the derivative securities that served, in Warren Buffett's famous phrase, as \"financial weapons of mass destruction.\"</p><p>Altogether, these effects of the digital revolution have overwhelmed the capacity of states to buffer their constituents. Not only has it challenged the authority of the state at multiple levels and across multiple dimensions, it is even undermining the integrity of the political process on which the authority of the state ultimately rests. There is a profound irony here, given that all the technologies, from silicon to software, that combined to generate the digital revolution were sponsored by the American state.</p><p>As they have matured, digital technologies have become more accessible: open-source tools and \"cloud\" computing resources have rendered experimentation radically less expensive. And the internet itself offers a friction-free channel for marketing and delivery of new digital offerings. Hence the proliferation of the \"unicorns.\" But note: from Uber to WeWork, these ventures have been paying their bills not by selling services to paying customers, but rather by selling securities. The entire unicorn bubble is a consequence of the historic reduction of nominal interest rates to minimal, even negative levels, driving investors to reach for returns however speculative. This phenomenon is highly vulnerable to any normalization of monetary policy.</p><p>The reported slowdown in productivity growth in recent years reflects both the application of measurement methods developed for a manufacturing economy to an overwhelmingly service economy and the long lags between deployment of advanced technologies at the frontier and their general adoption. But the ongoing digitalization of economic life can be seen in increased concentration across almost all industries accompanied by increased profits and reduced labor share.</p><p>As inequality remains stuck at levels not seen in a hundred years, re-legitimizing state engagement with the economy is urgently needed. There are encouraging signs: from the increasingly animated discussion of anti-trust policies relevant to a digital economy to the California legislative initiative with respect to \"gig\" employment. Yet in the age of Trump and Brexit, our system is stressed to extremes. Tech revolutions do that.</p><p>MICHAEL J. BOSKIN</p><p>Hoover Institution Senior Fellow and Professor of Economics, Stanford University, and former Chair, President's Council of Economic Advisors</p><p>There is no question that technological innovation has had important impacts in the last several decades. Whether that has been, or will be, an acceleration from past trends is an open question. A dynamic market economy is always innovating, disseminating innovation, and adjusting to technology developments. Fundamental forces, such as demographic shifts, alter demand patterns. Entrepreneurs and firms respond with new products, improvements in existing products, new processes, and new distribution channels. Statistical systems are challenged to keep up in real time and legal and regulatory systems are challenged to keep up without stifling innovation.</p><p>We are not measuring the impact of this technological change adequately. Economists have known for well over a century that traditional price inflation and therefore real GDP and productivity measures fail to account adequately for substitution biases, quality change, and new products. Economist Irving Fisher declared in a 1922 book that his entire life work would be worthwhile if we switched to what Erwin Diewert labeled superlative index numbers. It took three-quarters of a century for government statisticians to begin incorporating Fisher's insights into the consumer price index. Delays also occur in implementing measures to partially adjust for quality change and new products.</p><p>Particular attention has been focused on the fact that important new services are provided \"free\" to consumers, such as internet search and social media. Of course, consumers are paying by allowing these firms to use their data to generate revenue from advertising, which is treated as an intermediate input to the industry paying for the advertising.</p><p>Economist Robert Gordon argues that more recent technology does not pack the productivity-enhancing punch of previous generations of new products, from electricity to automobiles, household appliances to airplanes. Optimists respond with the promise of nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Historically, the \"killer app\" that drives productivity has sometimes taken considerable time, and a product detour, from the original idea. Watt's steam engine was for lifting water out of coal mines; steam ships and locomotives came later. Marconi's wireless was to compete with the telegraph; he never envisioned mass broadcast radio or cell phones.</p><p>Some important uses of technology are in sectors such as healthcare, where it is difficult to measure outcomes, and especially how they are valued since most consumers do not pay for them at the margin when decisions are made. Several decades ago, MIT's Robert Solow opined that \"you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\" Eventually they did show up, and accounting for the decline in computing prices added a quarter point to real GDP growth for decades. Perhaps any \"above and beyond trend\" productivity effects from modern technology will eventually show up as well.</p><p>But it is also possible that some of the value will be in non-market activity not usually included in GDP, such as intrafamilial sharing of photos. That has real value, but is different from traditional productivity measures used to construct estimates and forecasts of real GDP and tax revenue. Finally, the contribution to real income nets out the value of displaced economic activity, such as newspapers and magazines, traditional photography, and so forth, and only counts the net increase.</p><p>Modern technology developments have combined with globalization as a deflationary force. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, need to understand these phenomena in the conduct of monetary policy. Economist Brent Moulton, who spent more than thirty years working at the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, provided an excellent survey last year of research measuring potential biases, and many improvements made by statistical agencies, since the 1996 Boskin Commission Report estimated an upward bias of a little more than a percentage point. My best judgement is that any additional, above trend, overstatement of inflation caused by widespread use of recent technology innovation is likely balanced by statistical improvements made since then. Only time and research will tell whether new technologies prove to be as productivity-enhancing as previous advances, and if the size of biases in measures of real GDP, productivity, and inflation has changed considerably.</p><p>In the meantime, central banks are quite aware of biases in the measurement of inflation. (Indeed, then-Bundesbank board member Otmar Issing led a delegation from the Bundesbank to see me at Stanford University to discuss these issues shortly after the publication of the Boskin Commission Report.) That is one reason 2 percent is the inflation target and for their use of the PCE deflator rather than the CPI. Their main task in this regard is to stay on top of, and contribute to, the estimates of these biases.</p><p>RICHARD N. COOPER</p><p>Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics, Harvard University</p><p>The short answer is \"yes.\" Technological advances abound, affecting many areas of both production and consumption. Productivity growth for the economy and for particular sectors over a period of time is measured by deflating the changing value of production by price increases over that period. If we overestimate price increases, as I believe along with the late Martin Feldstein, especially for hard-to-measure services which take up an ever-increasing share of employment, by the same token we underestimate real output and hence labor productivity. This is especially true of the rapid advancements in medical care, a large and growing fraction of American production and consumption. The same observation can be made of all modern economies, but services make up a higher fraction--85 percent--of U.S. employment than is true elsewhere.</p><p>Real growth today is nothing like the 8 percent growth of the late nineteenth century, which was augmented by high and increasing immigration as well as by the spread of steam power, electricity, and the new internal combustion engine. But it is significantly higher than that recorded today.</p><p>I would not particularly emphasize artificial intelligence, but rather digitization of the whole economy, of which artificial intelligence is only a part, along with cloud computing, analysis of larger amounts of data, the so-called internet of things, and so on. Artificial intelligence will proceed, but much more slowly than currently hyped. Electricity took five decades to be widely and efficiently absorbed by the U.S. economy. Human behavior and institutions and regulations have a high degree of inertia--everywhere, not just in the United States.</p><p>Who will benefit? In the first instance, the owners of the firms which successfully produce the new technology, and of those traditional firms that digitize their activities quickly and efficiently, as well as workers with the relevant talent and training to produce and install the new technologies. But as the ownership spreads through purchases of stock, for example by college endowments, life insurance companies, and especially pension funds, many more people can enjoy the benefits, and still more people as consumers by the greater variety and lower prices that digitization will permit. Many existing jobs will disappear, as happened in the late nineteenth century, but that will take place over many years. And as in the past, many new jobs will be created by increased consumption, especially of new activities, such as recreational skiing created after the Second World War.</p><p>JAMES E. GLASSMAN</p><p>Managing Director and Head Economist, JPMorgan Chase's Commercial Bank</p><p>There is nothing quiet about today's technological revolution and it's touching everyone, those who work in the tech sector as well as those who don't. Technological innovation probably is underrepresented by our metric system, but what is measured is visibly transforming business, the workplace, and home life. Today's vintage of technological innovation, like that of the past, gives workers better tools to do their jobs and supports stronger pay gains. But it also displaces routine work. That diverts more and more of the economic value of what workers do to profits and away from labor compensation, creating big challenges for people whose skills aren't keeping up. New technologies create new opportunities, but workers need to invest in new skills to take advantage of those opportunities, and that doesn't happen overnight.</p><p>You don't have to be an economist to know that something big is underway in the technology arena. Many auto workers saw it when many of their jobs were replaced by robots. We can see it in the hours we save going to the mall with one or two clicks on our mobile phones. We can see it in the sprawling retail distribution centers and the struggles of shopping malls to find new purpose. We can see it when our flights are disrupted by bad weather and we are able to rearrange travel plans and pick new airplane seats in seconds on our mobile phones. We can see it in the innovative ride-sharing services and new options for renting vacation stays. Businesses see it in the insights they gain from machine learning and mining of the exponential growth of data. We can see it in the experimental convenience stores that have no checkout operations. We can see it in the vast array of financial services available on mobile phones. And we can see it in the access available on mobile phone apps to the services that are interconnected on the internet. These are only some of the most visible features of today's technological revolution.</p><p>Add it all up and it is pretty clear that it takes a lot less time to accomplish traditional tasks than it used to. That's called productivity. The explosion of labor productivity may be more visible on the home front (household production) than in the business arena. That may explain why the productivity metrics don't show what we all know is occurring, that labor productivity is rising quickly. But we also know that the metrics can be behind the times when technology is opening up new frontiers of activity. For example, it wasn't until hedonic price measures were employed to capture the idea that the economic contribution of information technology improves with every successive vintage of technology that we solved MIT Professor Robert Solow's 1990s riddle that we could see computers everywhere but in the metrics.</p><p>Technological brings metrological challenges, and some of the economic value in the e-commerce arena probably is not fully captured by traditional measures of economic activity. For example, the subsidies provided to consumers (free shipping and other amenities) that are effectively funded by optimistic stock market valuations because investors are betting that today's disruptive technologies will be tomorrow's standard, even if these companies are not very profitable yet, are not reflected in GDP. They won't be until the advertising costs that support new ideas are reflected in the price of products consumers buy. And it has become more challenging to measure labor productivity because the internet blurs the line between work and leisure, making it more difficult to estimate the true amount of time put into work (for many people, work at the office doesn't look very different than life at home).</p><p>But what we can see of today's technology footprint is striking and unprecedented. It is particularly visible in the way that income flows to the various factors of production. For example, the share of income accruing to labor compensation averaged about 56 percent of total Gross Domestic Income from the end of World War II to the late 1990s, but since then has shrunk to 53.8 percent. The inverse image? After-tax profits have been grinding up to near 10 percent of GDI since the late 1990s from 6 percent on average for most of the post-World War II era.</p><p>The economic story driving that widening distribution of aggregate income to labor and profits (and this underpins the widening distribution of income in the United States) is evident in the decoupling of real hourly compensation and labor productivity since the late 1990s. Hourly pay tends to match the trend in labor productivity. It's a logical textbook story. But in the late 1990s, real hourly pay began to lag labor productivity, implying that more and more of the economic value of labor is flowing to capital and, therefore, profits. That's the result of innovation that displaces routine work. It's easiest to visualize this by thinking about the business model of Amazon, ride sharing services, and other industries where superstar enterprises are forging new frontiers. The record high value of the U.S. stock market relative to the size of the economy (1.5 times nominal GDP, far above the historical tendency to match GDP) implies that equity investors now believe the technology story has legs.</p><p>This is the economic story of our time. And it is a story that most other economies are facing as well. It brings opportunity and challenges. It transforms the way the economy works. And it reverberates through the nation's political discussions because it is socially disruptive. Technological innovation makes old ways of doing things obsolete but it also brings new opportunities that, when people have time to invest in new skills, are favorable. Today's technological revolution will be lifting the nation's living standard to new heights.</p><p>JENNIFER ZHU SCOTT</p><p>Associate Fellow with dual fellowships of the Asia Pacific Programme and Digital Society Initiative, Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House)</p><p>Historically, the indicators of future wealth and the metrics of economic performance often show significant discrepancies during the times of fundamental technological transformation. To assume that we are living at such a time can be an attractive temptation. Powerful innovations such as artificial intelligence and machine learning could indeed be the next general purpose technology (GPT) that fundamentally transforms economies, similar to electricity, the steam engine, the internal combustion engine, and computers. However, so far, despite the great capacity promise, artificial intelligence is only benefiting a fraction of the total economy. The tech and tech-friendly industries have started to see some great results, while many traditional industries that remain a large part of the total output are scrambling to adapt.</p><p>Productivity in the United States has been growing consistently since the post-war era, although at a different rate in different periods. In the mid-2000s, we witnessed a productivity fall in developed countries, including the United States. Between 2005-2016, the aggregate labor productivity growth in the United States averaged 1.3 percent (compared to around 2.8 percent between 1995 and 2004), while the tech industry has arguably created the most excitement (and wealth) during this time. It is easy to confuse such excitement with the actual artificial intelligence general applications to every corner of the economy.</p><p>Indeed, that is not to say such hidden (or visible) productivity growth will not happen soon. What happened bears no responsibility to repeat in the future. The productivity deceleration in the past decade and a half do not predict what might be forthcoming. An optimistic way to view this productivity growth pause is that the real artificial intelligence transformation has just started. When artificial intelligence indeed becomes a GPT and is applied to all industries, the United States could witness another industrial expansion more potent than the late 1800s.</p><p>Having said that, the United States in the late 1800s was a different country than the United States today. The young country was an energetic challenger to the establishment at the time: Britain. Since the United States took over from Britain and became the global innovation powerhouse, it has never been challenged in the area of innovation and technology until now. The United States was also a much more open country in late 1800s. People from all over the world moved to the United States to build, create, produce, and innovate. Today, the United States is the establishment being challenged by China. The United States is also increasingly inward-looking, with a considerable part of the country supporting the anti-immigration policies the current administration has carried out. Anti-China approaches in the fields of tech and academic research are arguably the only genuinely bipartisan issue in the United States.</p><p>Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are different beasts compared to internal combustion engines. They require greater connectivity, the efficiency of a global supply chain, and careful moral considerations for the future of our species. Such requirements are beyond nationalities and borders. The two artificial intelligence superpowers owe humankind to collaborate while competing healthily.</p><p>Domestically, there are large populations in the United States that are not working in the tech industry and may never be able to own tech stocks. In order to include them in the forthcoming artificial intelligence economy, policymakers must proactively consider the empowerment of full individual data ownership. The economics of data are well established between large corporates. However, the producers of such a source of wealth--the individuals--are not part of this game. Realizing the economic value of data for the individuals would allow a more inclusive artificial intelligence economy. It also could become a source of universal basic income.</p><p>MARK SOBEL</p><p>U.S. Chair, Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Monetary and Financial Policy, U.S. Treasury</p><p>Will artificial intelligence and other new technologies prove transformative, bolstering total factor productivity growth and helping the world escape a continued grinding down in global growth? Are we excessive techno-optimists or pessimists?</p><p>These are questions studied in a specialized corner of the economics profession. Alas, our crystal balls cannot answer those questions.</p><p>Robert Gordon, in The Rise and Fall of American Growth, is surely right to argue that not all innovations are equally transformative and that many recent innovations, notwithstanding hype, have failed to meet the transformational qualities of those--such as in transportation and energy--of the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>At the same time, the famous Solow Paradox observed that the computer revolution was everywhere, except in the productivity statistics. Solow's statement was soon followed by an acceleration in productivity. The paradox points out that it is hard to recognize transformations, especially as they are taking place.</p><p>Where there is agreement, though, is that the diffusion of innovative new technologies into production processes, daily economic life, and higher total factor productivity can take a long time, if not decades, to materialize.</p><p>Many new artificial intelligence technologies are still coming of age and only now--literally--being road-tested.</p><p>Higher total factor productivity growth can have important implications for macroeconomic policy management, which often depends on judgments about whether an economy is overheating. Were officials to miss a jump in total factor productivity growth, policy settings for stabilization could prove too restrictive. Were officials to erroneously presume a jump in total factor productivity growth had taken place, policy could be too accommodative.</p><p>Artificial intelligence and other new technologies may well boost future total factor productivity growth and provide a welcome fillip to economic activity. But in the meantime, there is little reason for policymakers to abandon the widely accepted proposition that productivity growth has generally been in long-term decline and that it will continue to face headwinds from an aging population, the shift toward services economies, and other factors. It would be premature for the formulation of macroeconomic policy to assume that higher potential growth is buried in the data.</p><p>MICHAEL MANDEL</p><p>Chief Economic Strategist, Progressive Policy Institute, and Senior Fellow, Mack Institute for Innovation Management at Wharton</p><p>Overall, the official data--and especially the slow rate of measured productivity growth--accurately reflect our two-speed economy. A broad technological revolution is coming, but it's not here yet.</p><p>So far the information revolution is primarily concentrated in \"digital\" industries such as tech, communications, content (such as movies and print), and ecommerce, which together make up less than 10 percent of gross domestic product.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bulk of the private sector--primarily comprised of \"physical\" industries such as manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and healthcare--has lagged far behind in spending per worker on information technology equipment, software, and cloud services.</p><p>Think about it: Audiences are justifiably amazed by the use of sophisticated digital technologies to portray Iron Man's armor on the screen. But manufacturers are nowhere close to being able to build his armor or anything similar in real life. Manipulating bits and bytes is easy, doing the same for atoms is hard.</p><p>By my calculations, productivity in the relatively small digital sector rose by almost 60 percent from 2007 to 2017, which likely underestimates true growth. But those gains were not enough to overcome the slow productivity growth in the more important physical industries. Over the same period, productivity in the rest of the non-health private sector rose by only 5 percent.</p><p>Other economic indicators show the same dichotomy. Prices in the digital sector fell by 15 percent, while rising by 21 percent in rest of the non-health private sector. Both real pay growth and job growth in the digital sector were more than double that of the rest of the non-health private sector.</p><p>This division is profoundly economically and politically unhealthy. The regions that are the focus of the digital economy have zoomed ahead, while the regions that are dependent on physical industries have been left behind. This is not a measurement problem.</p><p>But there's good news, as digitization is slowly taking hold in the physical sector. Amazon and other ecommerce companies have transformed lowly warehouses into data-driven, robot-filled ecommerce fulfillment centers. These ecommerce fulfillment centers are creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs for \"tech-enabled\" workers with a high school education, at wages significantly higher than brick-and-mortar retail.</p><p>Similarly, manufacturing is going digital after a long delay. Robots are spreading out of the automotive sector to other manufacturing industries, and 3D printing is becoming more common. Moreover, new \"manufacturing platforms\" are making it easier for small and medium-sized factories to participate in the global economy.</p><p>The ongoing digital transformation of the physical sector won't immediately show up in the productivity statistics. For example, the measured productivity of the warehouse industry is down 28 percent since 2012, despite the digitization of distribution. The reason? The measured output of ecommerce fulfillment centers does not take into account consumer gains from millions of fewer hours spent in driving to malls, standing in line to pay, and other unproductive shopping activities.</p><p>We have suffered so far from a lack of tech-based innovation, not an excess. As digitization spreads, so will the gains for workers and consumers.</p><p>HOLGER SCHMIEDING</p><p>Chief Economist, Berenberg</p><p>We are living through a profound revolution in technology. The way in which humans inform themselves and communicate and interact with one another is changing beyond recognition. A generation ago, my parents and I used similar sources of information, one or two newspapers, three TV channels, radio, and the hearsay of friends, family, and colleagues. Today, my four children receive, process, and spread information in a completely different way. The interaction between humans and technology looks set to evolve further with hitherto almost unimaginable combinations of human intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>Never before have so many people worked so hard to expand the frontiers of knowledge. And never before have they been able to spread their insights so easily and cheaply. It makes intuitive sense to presume that technological progress is more rapid than our backward-looking statistics suggest.</p><p>Statistics are good at measuring what we know well. But they cannot fully capture nascent changes we do not yet fully understand. As a result, they may underestimate the impact of the changes. Of course, we cannot be sure. Some technological advances are showing up more in how well we can enjoy our free time rather than in the monetary value of the goods and services we sell to each other.</p><p>Even if we knew for sure that our statistics under-report the gains in productivity and real GDP, the policy impact would be limited. We might learn that inflation is even lower than we thought it is. At face value, the threat of disruptive deflation may then loom larger. But a supply-driven decline in prices would be a positive, not a negative. The risk that faster productivity growth could cause harmful deflation, namely a reluctance of consumers to buy today as they wait for goods or services to be cheaper tomorrow, seems remote. The major effect of the technological revolution is not to make similar things cheaper. Instead, it improves the quality and usefulness of new products. This is a reason to buy rather than to hold back.</p><p>In the same vein, uncovering a more benign split of nominal GDP growth between more real growth and less inflation courtesy of a faster gain in productivity would not be a reason to change nominal interest rates.</p><p>Instead, we ought to address the distributional effects of disruptive technological changes. The capacity of individuals and societies to learn and adjust is limited. Today's technological revolution may well be comparable to that of the late 1800s. Mass industrialization raised real GDP dramatically. But it also spawned social counterreactions that caused grave damage in the decades thereafter. Today, improving public infrastructure and public education systems, and distributing the gains from technological changes more fairly through the tax and welfare system, ought to be at the top of the policy agenda. Otherwise, the populist backlash against free exchanges of goods, services, and ideas could continue to mount. That facts seem to play a diminishing role in many policy discussions ought to serve as a warning signal.</p><p>RICHARD JERRAM</p><p>Chief Economist, Top Down Macro</p><p>Economics has been struggling with the apparent contradiction between slow productivity growth, as measured in the macro data, and the rapid technological change apparent in our daily lives. Part of the problem is that GDP is poor at incorporating \"free\" consumer services that occupy a growing part of our leisure time. It is a measure of economic output, not well-being. Even so, there are doubts whether we are measuring nominal output or price changes accurately, and consequently, questions over the real pace of productivity growth.</p><p>Rather than trying to measure productivity through imperfect metrics such as national accounts data, we could look for the shadows from the effect. For example, if there is a quiet technological revolution in progress, then we would expect to see a large transformation in the labor market, as some skills become redundant and others become much more valuable. The data give no support for this, with workers leaving or joining firms at a pace that is consistent with the current unusually low level of unemployment.</p><p>Similarly, if we are in a period of creative destruction driven by technological change, then we would expect to see a rise in both the number of new ventures being established and older ones failing as they lose viability. However, entry and exit rates for firms in the United States have remained subdued in recent years, at a pace well-below historical averages.</p><p>A different problem could simply be recency bias, where we are so amazed by the latest inventions that we forget how dramatically life changed in the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s. I was born into a world of black-and-white television, bank tellers, slide rules, phone boxes, and crushingly expensive international travel and communication. It seems hard to argue that recent inventions are as transformational as personal computers, email, and mobile phones, and equally difficult to find the effects in the data.</p><p>MICHAEL HUTHER</p><p>Director, Cologne Institute for Economic Research, and Gerda Henkel Adjunct Professor, Stanford University</p><p>During the post-World War II period, many industrialized economies experienced a deindustrialization in combination with declining or low productivity growth. Stimulated by post-war investments and reunification, the German economy constituted a notable exception as it secured reasonable productivity growth until the early 2000s, when it converged into the typical low total factor productivity growth trajectory. At the time, the impressive rise of Silicon Valley tech companies triggered significant fears in Germany that the important manufacturing sector could become a commodity provider for data-driven businesses from the United States. Politicians and scholars alike prophesied the end of manufacturing-led growth and the golden age of highly innovative tech companies.</p><p>What is more, several scholars underlined the productivity-hostile environment resulting from structural factors such as demography, climate change, and globalization. In this view, productivity decreases are especially expected in manufacturing economies that depend on an aging workforce, face the costs of decarbonization, and are constantly threatened with companies moving abroad because information and communications technologies allow low-cost real-time steering of global value chains.</p><p>In contrast to these expectations, after the financial crisis, productivity growth performed particularly poorly in the United States. Puzzlingly, low productivity figures from the United States are even interpreted as a result of the economy's dependence on Silicon Valley companies' innovations. It turned out that tech firms run highly profitable business models but only through securing a high level of market power in winner-takes-it-all platform markets. Today, the tech giants hold huge cash reserves and hoard highly qualified employees in a way that is tantamount to creating implicit barriers to market entry. In this sense, large tech corporates create a two-speed economy where normal companies cannot compete at arm's length at the technology frontier, but instead focus on standard products requiring lower risks and investments. Additionally, the new information and communications technology companies are less dependent on geographical production sites than the old manufacturing industries. For taxing authorities, this provides a major challenge as it becomes more difficult to prevent profit shifting and enforce a level playing field.</p><p>However, the domination of new platform corporations in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets is not the only game in town. A country-wide and long-established business model that has recently proven fruitful for productivity progress can be found in the Germany. In contrast to the presumably secular trend of deindustrialization and in the face of demographic change, medium-sized German high-tech Mittelstand companies from rural areas keep dominating global niche markets with their highly innovative manufacturing goods. Manufacturing still accounts for 23 percent of German value added (and only 12 percent in the United States, 11 percent in France, and 10 percent in the United Kingdom). During the past few years, these companies have managed to integrate customer-specific services such as servicing or consulting into their goods. This joint production accounts for another 9 percent of the German economy. As a result, productivity progress is not limited to a few shining stars but distributed much more inclusively. Due to the integrated value chains in Germany, service sector innovations spill over into manufacturing faster than in the United States, where the economy is more characterized by stand-alone companies. It seems obvious that if we want to master the challenges of the future--climate change, demographic change, and globalization--in a socially acceptable way, we need more productivity progress and we need it to be distributed throughout the entire economy. This seems to work better through the well-known manufacturing business model. Total factor productivity contributions to the reasonable GDP growth in Germany between 2011 and 2018 ranged around 0.6 percent yearly--far ahead of comparable economies.</p><p>After introducing \"Industrie 4.0\" technologies, the German business model will shift even more strongly to the integration of services into the manufacturing sector. Hence, incentivizing manufacturing investment and research and development activity as well as enabling employees through adequate on-the-job training is going to accelerate productivity in Germany on a broader scale. By contrast, triggering productivity growth in the United States depends much more on fostering inter-company technology spillovers and creating a level playing field for competitors in platform markets.</p><p>STEFFEN ELSTNER</p><p>Senior Economist, RWI, and former Deputy Secretary General, German Council of Economic Experts</p><p>Since at least the mid-2000s, many advanced economies have experienced low productivity growth. This development is often related to declining productivity gains in the United States, often considered as the global technology frontier. Several studies show that the U.S. economy represents the technology frontier in finance, business, and personal services, whereas Germany for example represents the technology frontier in manufacturing.</p><p>Research concerning U.S. productivity spillovers on other industrial economies is primarily informed by the work of Wolfgang Keller, who documented that for most countries, foreign sources of technology are estimated to account for around 90 percent of domestic productivity growth. Furthermore, new technologies originate from a small number of countries that determine the pattern of worldwide technology transmission.</p><p>Since the United States is commonly regarded as the world technology frontier, my coauthor Svetlana Rujin and I tried to analyze the spillover effects of changes in U.S. technology on the aggregate productivity level in other advanced economies. Productivity is hereby defined as labor productivity, which means output per working hour.</p><p>Overall, we find positive but small spillover effects of U.S. productivity changes on other economies. The recent U.S. productivity slowdown, therefore, seemed to have a limited effect on productivity developments in advanced economies. Our research further suggests that institutional factors are not able to explain cross-country differences in the size of the productivity spillover effects. If any, regulation of the service sector seems to play a role. The latter finding nevertheless has some policy implications as, in particular, the German economy is characterized by a high degree of regulation in the service sector.</p><p>To understand why we have seen this contemporaneous decline in productivity growth despite low U.S. productivity spillovers, we studied more in detail the productivity development in Germany. Despite massive digitization efforts, the German economy has experienced a marked slowdown in its productivity growth. A major factor for this decline is the turnaround of the German labor market that commenced around 2005. The successful integration of five million predominantly low-productivity workers into the labor market induced an attenuating effect on productivity growth. This does not explain the slowdown entirely, however. As a potentially important countervailing force, technological advances associated with digitization would have had the potential to lift productivity growth more strongly, but they frequently translated into employment growth instead.</p><p>Often the point is made that the current innovations in the digital economy are poorly measured in the official national account statistics. This prominent explanation of measurement error that systematically underrepresents genuine productivity growth was analyzed by several studies focused on the U.S. economy. Measurement errors could arise for three reasons: First, quality changes aggravate price measurement, especially for information and communication technologies. Yet a study by David Byrne of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, John Fernald of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and Marshall Reinsdorf of the International Monetary Fund finds little evidence that such mismeasurement is driving the deceleration in estimated U.S. productivity growth. The information and communication technology sector is simply too small to create massive real productivity gains due to falling prices.</p><p>Second, recent productivity growth does not capture the costless services provided by large information and communication technology firms such as Facebook, which increases consumer benefits in a way not included in GDP. The University of Chicago's Chad Syverson argues, however, that these benefits are by far too small to explain the missing productivity gains since the mid-2000s.</p><p>Third, it is difficult to measure value-added in a large part of the economy comprising health care, education, financial services, and professional services. This point seems to be valid and it is difficult to argue against it.</p><p>Overall, a large part of the literature suggests that the slower pace of global productivity growth since around 2000 is due to two reasons. The first is a decline in the number of new disruptive innovations and hence a slower pace of growth of the productivity frontier. The second is a lack of diffusion of new technologies in all parts of the economy. The latter point is often associated with missing business dynamism and the effects of aging populations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-622371832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 622371832</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YT3-GS11-DYTM-90SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Economy Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>International Economy</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0898-4336</issn><volume>Vol. 33</volume><issueNumber>No. 4\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Banking, finance and accounting industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economic aspects</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economic conditions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economic conditions</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

A far more worrying one is 1860, which of course led directly to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc9c3d5d-1383-4a67-9816-98d541466436\">US civil war</url>.</p><p>A number of academics\u00a0have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/model-predicting-united-states-disorder-now-points-to-civil-war/12365280\"> warning</url> of the similarities between today and the eve of the American civil war. Stress indicators include mutual contempt between a factionalised elite, the inability of America\u2019s system to address a mounting backlog of deep-seated problems, and a popular tendency to view the other side as the enemy. Such conditions make the ordinary compromise of politics almost impossible. </p><p>Much like the 1840s and 1850s, today\u2019s stresses have been building up for a long time. Trump, like James Buchanan, did not invent America\u2019s democratic crisis, even though he has made it far worse. They pre-exist him. Eventually something has to crack. As Ernest Hemingway is said to have remarked about bankruptcy: \u201cIt happens slowly and then all at once.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>That crack could of course be a positive \u2014 the landslide defeat of Trump in November\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/us-presidential-election\"> election</url>. The bigger the margin of Joe Biden\u2019s victory the harder it would be for Trump\u2019s base to pick up the echo of the south\u2019s \u201clost cause\u201d that did so much to undo what it had lost on the battlefield. Recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ig.ft.com/us-election-2020/\"> polls</url>, including the New York Times/Sienna College poll that gave Biden a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/politics/trump-biden-poll-nyt-upshot-siena-college.html\"> 14-point lead</url> nationally and double-digit advantages in Midwestern swing states, lend credence to that possibility. But it still takes quite a leap of imagination. </p><p>Do not forget that Michael Dukakis had a 17-point lead over George HW Bush a few weeks before the 1988 election (for the record, I\u2019m glad Bush Snr won). Slightly likelier is that Biden either wins narrowly in November, or takes the popular vote but loses the electoral college. Each case is a recipe for US civil breakdown. </p><p>I recently participated in a four-hour \u201cwar games-style\u201d scenario helping to play the role of the media. Others included senior US political operatives, constitutional lawyers and scholars \u2014 who variously played the roles of the Trump and Biden campaigns, the parties, the governors and the courts. The Chatham House rule prevents me from specifying the organiser or its participants. But take it from me that it was a credible and disturbingly plausible exercise.</p><p>It started on the night of November 3 with the premise that Trump narrowly wins the electoral college on a historically low turnout in which the vote has clearly been suppressed in many states. Biden won 52 per cent of the popular vote, Trump 47 per cent. By the end of the game \u2014 in mid-January 2021 \u2014 the US system was at breaking point. </p><p>There is no precedent in American history, or provision in the US constitution, to rerun a presidential election, which would have been the obvious way out. Several states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, sent competing electoral college returns to the US Congress (the Democratic governor one result, the Republican legislature another). The Supreme Court saw no basis to interfere. The growing popular backlash on the streets, and Democratic calls for a do-over, and threats of Californian separatism, played into Trump\u2019s claim to be America\u2019s only hope for stability and continuity. At that point the game ended. </p><p>What worried the organisers is that they had arrived at the same result in early games with very different starting points (Biden narrowly winning the electoral college, for example). In each scenario, and to their surprise, America was plunged into a constitutional crisis.\u00a0</p><p>I thought this was a plausible threat beforehand. Now I am convinced it is. It is hard to believe the majority of Americans would accept another president having lost the popular vote. It has already happened twice this century \u2014 in 2000, when the Supreme Court simply halted the recount, and in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won 3m more votes than Trump. Yet there would be very little, if anything, the anti-Trump majority could legitimately do to make the popular verdict prevail within the parameters of the constitution. </p><p>Likewise, a narrow Biden victory would almost certainly trigger a Trumpian denial of the result (accusations that illegal immigrants had been drafted by the deep state to hijack the people\u2019s will, etc). That would be a particularly lethal moment as Trump would still be president for another 10 weeks with its awesome range of powers. William Barr would also still be US attorney-general. </p><p>I don\u2019t have any ringing conclusions to this jeremiad except to say I hope that I\u2019m being a Cassandra. The only thing I will confidently predict is that Trump will lose the popular vote in November. The larger his popular defeat the better. </p><p>Rana, do you share these concerns?</p><p>Recommended reading</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>While we\u2019re talking about the US civil war, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc9c3d5d-1383-4a67-9816-98d541466436\"> my column this week</url> is on how Confederate ghosts are still haunting America.\u00a0\u201cBy making the stakes so explicit, Trump is unwittingly offering America a once-in-a-generation chance to banish Confederate nostalgia,\u201d I write. \u201c\u2018We de-Nazified Germany,\u2019 says Karen Anderson. \u2018We never de-Confederalised the south.\u2019\u201d</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Ben Smith has an important \u2014 and very plausible \u2014 account in The New York Times of the burgeoning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/business/media/facebook-donald-trump-mark-zuckerberg.html\"> overlap of interests</url> between Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook and Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.

And until very, very recently I was a lot more worried about this happening. But I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say that I\u2019m feeling more optimistic than I ever have that Trump will lose not only the popular vote, but also the election \u2014 quite possibly by a landslide. I hardly write this for fear of jinxing it all. And of course, I don\u2019t want to be like one of those oblivious liberals from 2016 (though I will quickly defend myself by saying that back then, I was pretty sure Trump would win, particularly\u00a0after he killed Hillary on trade in the first debate). </p><p>But things have changed. For starters, Trump came to power in part because he was able to (rightly) accuse the other side of hypocrisy; you wrote one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0237568-0b30-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09\"> best columns ever</url> on this very topic. Now, as someone who has at every turn made it clear that he is governing only for himself and the 0.1 per cent, that will be a tough sell \u2014 though I'll caveat that point by saying that if       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f2c8952-a719-11ea-92e2-cbd9b7e28ee6\">Facebook</url> continues to be in cahoots with the president, he'll still get a lot of good free press.\u00a0Certainly he can still play the race card, though the \u201claw and order\u201d card never really worked as well as he\u2019d hoped, and Black Lives Matter protests have in any case been pushed off the front page by rising Covid-19 cases in red states. In places like Florida and Texas, you are seeing rising caseloads \u2014 which will eventually result in more deaths \u2014 in some poor, white, rural areas that Trump might ordinarily have carried. </p><p>Meanwhile, as the Paycheck Protection Program ends and the country begins to realise that the recovery won\u2019t be anywhere near V-shaped (see my Monday column for more on that), working class white women motivated more\u00a0by kitchen\u00a0table economics than ideology may turn on him. Yes, he can still resort to more and more draconian voter suppression and intimidation. But perhaps the president\u2019s greatest threat will be that some of the people he conned last time around won\u2019t be fooled again.

For this is now a political as much as a technological battle. \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">Duty of Care</url> \" is a phrase which today features as often on front pages as in the business pages. It has been the subject of a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">long campaign at The Telegraph</url> . Yet now that it is a matter of policy, cited 53 times in the white paper's 98 pages, there are questions within the industry about whether that policy has been fully considered, or is merely reflex reaction to growing public outrage.</p><p>\"People see tech as a political football to be kicked around,\" one disgruntled insider said yesterday after digesting the white paper. Not that its tone came as much of a surprise to him. He'd been briefed beforehand by Whitehall sources. \"I was told: 'The Home Secretary plans to thrash you.'\"</p><p>The potential sanctions are indeed draconian. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">Far from bland, mealy-mouthed proposals, here is red meat</url> - from making senior executives personally responsible, and blocking their services altogether. If Britain ever stopped Facebook reaching these shores, the legal basis would lie in this white paper. Not that Javid and Wright intend their formula for Britain alone. As they make clear, they want their proposals to become the basis of \"new, global approaches for online safety\".</p><p>That certainly does not lack ambition. Moreover, as well as targeting tech bosses and blocking their sites, they propose to ease the way for aggressive class-action suits, calling them \u00a0\"super-complaints\" with tech companies paying for the privilege. \"The regulator will be funded by industry,\" it notes. What is \"the industry\"? Answer: \"Companies that allow users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\". That is great swathes of the internet, from giant to start-up.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">Duty of Care white paper</url></p><p>The breadth and depth of such regulatory power is, understandably, creating powerful digital shockwaves. \"We are really concerned about the scope of this,\" says Dom Hallas, executive director of the Coalition for a Digital Economy. \"It really is very broad, it covers virtually everything.\"</p><p>He is referring not just to scale of companies affected, but the content they host. Acts of terror, such as the Christchurch mosque shootings last month, were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">broadcast on Facebook using its Live video service</url>, and initially spread       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">faster than it, and other sites such as YouTube, could remove them</url> .</p><p>But not all dangerous material is so easy to identify for suppression. Yet the white paper does not shy from clamping down on content that it deems \"unacceptable\". \"Other online behaviours or content, even if they may not be illegal in all circumstances, can also cause serious harm,\" it notes.</p><p>Unacceptable but not illegal? \"They want [tech companies] to ban material the Government dare not ban itself,\" says Jim Killock, president of the online advocacy Open Rights Group. \"If this material is harmful why isn't the Government banning it?\"</p><p>To some, like Mark Littlewood, Director General at the Institute of Economic Affairs, this is the beginning of the age of censorship. \"These draconian regulations will do more harm than good, ushering in new levels of censorship and killing innovation along the way,\" he said. \u00a0</p><p>And such fears of overreach are also being leapt on by big tech companies. \"We need proposals that are targeted and practical to implement... we also need to protect freedom of speech and the services consumers love,\" said a spokesman for the Internet Association, which represents 40 tech companies including Google and Facebook.</p><p>Why then, do such complaints ring a little hollow? Possibly it is because, while they may disagree on some of the terms, broadly the world's largest technology companies have recently supported calls for greater regulation. They want states to help them set the rules, recognising that, frankly, the networks of billions of users require a level of mature governance that organisations months and years old cannot muster.</p><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg last month called for a \"more active role for governments and regulators\", while Amazon, Google, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and others have all begun to nod along with the sentiment that policing the content on their sites is better left to governments. Yesterday, Javid and Wright obliged. \"Privately-run platforms have become akin to public spaces,\" the white paper suggested. \"Some of these companies now acknowledge their responsibility to be guided by norms and rules developed by democratic societies.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>Such harmony may seem odd. But there is good reason for the world's biggest tech companies to celebrate yesterday's announcement. It is not the fact of state intervention Zuckerberg et al favour, it is the manner of it.</p><p>Because any successful company \"that allow users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\" quickly generates vast amounts of data. Huge quantities of data to check - some of which, like text, may be reasonably simple to check, some of which like photos and videos, may present far greater problems.</p><p>The only possible solution is technology - automated vetting through sophisticated artificial intelligence. And guess which companies have the best AI?</p><p>Facebook and Google have not sat still in the face the threatened regulation. They have already worked on developing the most advanced software that can immediately detect and remove \"hashed\" - essentially digitally watermarked - illegal content like child pornography or terrorist videos.</p><p>\"We haven't waited for regulation, we've created new technology, hired experts and specialists and ensured our policies are fit for the evolving challenges we face online,\" Google's public policy manager Claire Lilley said yesterday.</p><p>Such dominance is legal as well as algorithmic. \"Most companies in the market, certainly small British companies, will not be able to compete with Facebook,\" says Hallas. \"The Government is accidentally entrenching the dominance of the largest internet companies that have the most lawyers.\"</p><p>Such unintended consequences would hit smaller companies, and consumers - indeed, almost everyone but the large tech companies many people currently view as the chief villains of the piece.</p><p>\"In its drive to make the internet 'safe', the government seems not to recognise its proposals don't regulate social media companies, they regulate social media users,\" Killock said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/07/britains-new-duty-care-laws-will-finally-make-tech-giants-accountable/\">Duty of Care campaign | Read more</url></p><p>And it is not just the white paper. The Cairncross review into journalism in the digital age and ongoing plans for a Digital Services Tax are helping to contribute to a sense that it is open season for other hosts of digital content.</p><p>Who will survive? As though he were poor and powerless, Mark Zuckerberg has reached out a trembling hand and asked for help. \"Every day, we make decisions about what speech is harmful, what constitutes political advertising and how to prevent sophisticated cyber attacks,\" he said last month. \"But if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn't ask companies to make these judgments alone.\"</p><p>For all its laudable intent, the Online Harms white paper has now given him precisely what he wants. It dilutes his company's responsibility while setting out rules, fees and fines that it is in an unrivalled position to meet. Rivals, however, may be less content. The regulator's dilemma is far from resolved. \u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-52830146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-V3F1-JCJY-G413-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1342\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Politicians who had collected millions of dollars in Big Tobacco bribes--oops, I mean campaign contributions--without any blowback were suddenly in the spotlight as enablers of an industry that had remorselessly killed millions of its customers while claiming that tobacco's health effects were still a matter of debate and/or choice.Practically overnight the political walls protecting Big Tobacco crumbled as all the lies and political complicity that had long been accepted as \"normal\" weredenormalized.Big Industry encountered little political resistance to its decades-long dumping of industrial waste into the nation's waterways and air until 1970.Images of American rivers catching fire changed public perceptions and eventually even Big-Business-friendly Republicans supported environmental regulations that cost Big Industry tens of billions of dollars in new costs.Turning our attention to hitherto invulnerable Wall Street: the masses are awakening to what insiders have known all along:Wall Street is nothing but a skimming machine for insiders, and this is generating a fulsome hatred of Wall Street, Big Tech monopolies and the billionaires who've added half a trillion dollars in wealth in the current stock market rally while the rest of America crumbles.When the political winds shift decisively, both parties quickly sense the change in weather.When social-economic tides change, politicos understand they face a binary choice--either get on board or cling to the past and lose elections.If the cultural tides have shifted against Wall Street and its politically protected skims and scams, every politico will have to get on board in one way or another, or they'll be left behind. </p><p>When the social tide shifted, politicos threw Big Tobacco and Big Industry overboard without hesitation.Two simple regulations would drive a stake through Wall Street's corrupt, evil heart:1. A substantial tax on every single transaction of any kind, whether it's on an exchange or off-exchange, and most importantly, whether the bid for a transaction was executed or not. This would kill high-frequency trading (HFT) and various other front-running games (spoofing the system with bids that are withdrawn in milliseconds, etc.).A transaction tax wouldn't affect Mom-and-Pop investors or mutual funds, as they trade infrequently. It would only kill the parasitic Wall Street predators.2. A ban or even limit on corporate share buybacks would kill the stock market's primary engine of relentless insider gains: corporations buying back their own shares to goose their stocks higher even as their sales and profits stagnate. It's estimated that up to 75% of all stock market gains can be traced back to the hundreds of billions of dollars corporations have borrowed to buy back their own shares.It's worth recalling that share buybacks were illegal not that long ago, so banning share buybacks would simply be a return to common sense limits on Wall Street's skims and scams.Two simple regulations would end Wall Street's most blatant insider scams.These regulations have now entered the mainstream and are poised to become actionable.When the social tides shift,politicos have to do something.To do nothing is no longer an option, and there is no creature on Earth more willing to jettison sacred cows than a politico fearful of being left behind as social trends abruptly change.The rising hatred of Wall Street, Big Tech monopolies and insider scams is not yet visible to the mainstream, but that doesn't mean the tides aren't shifting. It just means the corporate mainstream is as clueless as the politicos basking in the billionaires' bribes. source:Wolfstreet.com[1]<url normalizedValue=\"https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/number-of-people-on-state-or-federal-unemployment-insurance-jumps-to-32-1-million-second-highest-ever-week-20-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/number-of-people-on-state-or-federal-unemployment-insurance-jumps-to-32-1-million-second-highest-ever-week-20-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/Recent\">https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/number-of-people-on-state-or-federal-unemployment-insurance-jumps-to-32-1-million-second-highest-ever-week-20-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/number-of-people-on-state-or-federal-unemployment-insurance-jumps-to-32-1-million-second-highest-ever-week-20-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/Recent</url> Podcasts:[2]<url normalizedValue=\"https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/number-of-people-on-state-or-federal-unemployment-insurance-jumps-to-32-1-million-second-highest-ever-week-20-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/AxisOfEasy\">https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/number-of-people-on-state-or-federal-unemployment-insurance-jumps-to-32-1-million-second-highest-ever-week-20-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/AxisOfEasy</url> Salon #15: Toxic Tech Platforms and Disposable Social Media Stars[3]Charles Hugh Smith on the disconnect between the Markets and the Economy[4](51 min)My COVID-19 Pandemic Posts[5] My recent books:Audiobook edition now available: Will You Be Richer or Poorer?: Profit, Power, and AI in a Traumatized World[6]($13) (Kindle $6.95, print $11.95)[7]Read the first section for free (PDF)[8].Pathfinding our Destiny: Preventing the Final Fall of Our Democratic Republic[9]($6.95 (Kindle), $12 (print), $13.08 (audiobook[10]):Read the first section for free (PDF)[11].The Adventures of the Consulting Philosopher: The Disappearance of Drake[12]$1.29 (Kindle), $8.95 (print);read the first chapters for free (PDF)[13]Money and Work Unchained[14]$6.95 (Kindle), $15 (print)Read the first section for free (PDF).[15] If you found value in this content, please join me in seeking solutions bybecoming a $1/month patron of my work via patreon.com[16].NOTE: Contributions/subscriptions are acknowledged in the order received.

While the corporate media is focused on the presidential election, perhaps the more interesting question is: could Wall Street Lose the election? That is, could Wall Street face potentially fatal restrictions regardless of who wins? If this seems farfetched, consider the history of abrupt social-political-financial turn-arounds that surprised the mainstream. Off the top of my head I would point to Big Tobacco and environmental controls on Big Industry. For decades, Big Tobacco was politically invulnerable. Big Tobacco greased the political machinery with huge contributions to politicos and massive lobbying campaigns to deny the self-evident reality that smoking was hazardous to human health. Every effort to change this political dominance was thwarted with ease--and then suddenly, Big Tobacco fell out of favor. Politicians who had collected millions of dollars in Big Tobacco bribes--oops, I mean campaign contributions--without any blowback were suddenly in the spotlight as enablers of an industry that had remorselessly killed millions of its customers while claiming that tobacco's health effects were still a matter of debate and/or choice. Practically overnight the political walls protecting Big Tobacco crumbled as all the lies and political complicity that had long been accepted as \"normal\" were denormalized. Big Industry encountered little political resistance to its decades-long dumping of industrial waste into the nation's waterways and air until 1970. Images of American rivers catching fire changed public perceptions and eventually even Big-Business-friendly Republicans supported environmental regulations that cost Big Industry tens of billions of dollars in new costs. Turning our attention to hitherto invulnerable Wall Street: the masses are awakening to what insiders have known all along: Wall Street is nothing but a skimming machine for insiders, and this is generating a fulsome hatred of Wall Street, Big Tech monopolies and the billionaires who've added half a trillion dollars in wealth in the current stock market rally while the rest of America crumbles. When the political winds shift decisively, both parties quickly sense the change in weather. When social-economic tides change, politicos understand they face a binary choice--either get on board or cling to the past and lose elections. If the cultural tides have shifted against Wall Street and its politically protected skims and scams, every politico will have to get on board in one way or another, or they'll be left behind. When the social tide shifted, politicos threw Big Tobacco and Big Industry overboard without hesitation. Two simple regulations would drive a stake through Wall Street's corrupt, evil heart: 1. A substantial tax on every single transaction of any kind, whether it's on an exchange or off-exchange, and most importantly, whether the bid for a transaction was executed or not. This would kill high-frequency trading (HFT) and various other front-running games (spoofing the system with bids that are withdrawn in milliseconds, etc.). A transaction tax wouldn't affect Mom-and-Pop investors or mutual funds, as they trade infrequently. It would only kill the parasitic Wall Street predators. 2. A ban or even limit on corporate share buybacks would kill the stock market's primary engine of relentless insider gains: corporations buying back their own shares to goose their stocks higher even as their sales and profits stagnate. It's estimated that up to 75% of all stock market gains can be traced back to the hundreds of billions of dollars corporations have borrowed to buy back their own shares. It's worth recalling that share buybacks were illegal not that long ago, so banning share buybacks would simply be a return to common sense limits on Wall Street's skims and scams. Two simple regulations would end Wall Street's most blatant insider scams. These regulations have now entered the mainstream and are poised to become actionable. When the social tides shift, politicos have to do something. To do nothing is no longer an option, and there is no creature on Earth more willing to jettison sacred cows than a politico fearful of being left behind as social trends abruptly change. The rising hatred of Wall Street, Big Tech monopolies and insider scams is not yet visible to the mainstream, but that doesn't mean the tides aren't shifting. It just means the corporate mainstream is as clueless as the politicos basking in the billionaires' bribes. source: Wolfstreet.com Recent Podcasts: AxisOfEasy Salon #15: Toxic Tech Platforms and Disposable Social Media Stars Charles Hugh Smith on the disconnect between the Markets and the Economy (51 min) My COVID-19 Pandemic Posts My recent books: Audiobook edition now available: Will You Be Richer or Poorer?: Profit, Power, and AI in a Traumatized World ($13) (Kindle $6.95, print $11.95) Read the first section for free (PDF).

Following a silence procedure launched on 6 December 2019, delegations could agree to the text of the Council position as set out in Annex to this note.6. The Permanent Representatives Committee is accordingly invited to recommend that the Council adopts its position and findings on the application of the General Data Protection Regulation as set out in Annex. The Commission will be informed of the Council position.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 3ANNEX JAI.2 ENANNEX1. Introduction(1) The General Data Protection Regulation (\u2019GDPR\u2019)1 entered into application on 25 May 2018, repealing and replacing Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR aims to create a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement. The GDPR has a two-fold objective. The first one is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. The second one is to allow the free flow of personal data and the development of the digital economy across the internal market.(2) According to Article 97 of the GDPR, the Commission shall submit a first report on the evaluation and review of the Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council. That report is due by 25 May 2020, followed by reports every four years thereafter.(3) In this context, the Commission shall examine, in particular, the application and functioning of:\u2022 Chapter V on the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations with particular regard to decisions adopted pursuant to Article 45(3) of this Regulation and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC; and\u2022 Chapter VII on cooperation and consistency.(4) The GDPR requires that the Commission take into account the positions and findings of the European Parliament and the Council, and of other relevant bodies and sources. The Commission may also request information from Member States and supervisory authorities.1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 4ANNEX JAI.2 EN(5) In order to prepare the aforementioned Council positions and findings, delegations were requested to send written comments2. Member States\u2019 comments were discussed by DAPIX Working Party in its meetings of 21 October, 11 November and 5 December 2019. The Council positions and findings based on that preparatory work are outlined and summarised in this document. The Council has also taken note of the Commission\u2019s \u2018Communication on data protection rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond \u2013 taking stock\u20193 (the Communication) that was adopted in July 2019. The Communication looked at the impact of the EU data protection rules and at the possibilities for improving their implementation further. While the new data protection rules have, according to the Commission, achieved many of their objectives, the Communication also sets out concrete steps to further strengthen these rules and their application.(6) The Council takes the view that its positions and findings should not be limited to the topics specifically mentioned in Article 97(2) of the GDPR. Therefore, the Council also encourages the Commission to evaluate and review in its upcoming report the application and functioning of the GDPR beyond what is specifically mentioned in that article. Furthermore, the Commission should take into account the experiences and input of relevant stakeholders. This will help to ensure that the evaluation is as comprehensive as possible. Given the importance and impact of the GDPR in an ever-developing digital society, there are strong arguments supporting a broader review and ongoing discussion on the topic.(7) At the same time, the Council highlights that the GDPR has only been applied since May 2018. Therefore, it is likely that most of the issues identified by Member States will benefit from more experience in the application of the GDPR in the coming years. Further guidance, especially by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and a possibility to exchange information on national practices, interpretations and court decisions would also be useful for Member States.2 12756/19 REV 13 11535/1914994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 5ANNEX JAI.2 EN(8) The Council has made a number of detailed observations on the application of the GDPR. In this document, the Council outlines certain topics that have been considered particularly relevant by the Member States. Those issues should also be reflected in the upcoming report by the Commission in an appropriate manner.2. General remarks(9) In the view of the Council, the GDPR has been a success. It is undoubtedly an important milestone and an instrument that strengthens the right to the protection of personal data and fosters trust-enabling innovation in the EU. The GDPR has also further increased awareness of the importance of data protection both in the EU and abroad.(10) The Council acknowledges the important role of national supervisory authorities in the functioning and consistent application of the GDPR. The Council also notes the significant increase in the activities of the supervisory authorities, linked to the exercise of their new tasks and powers, and the positive developments as regards the significantly increased allocation of resources to them in many Member States. The Council shares the view of the Commission on the importance of cooperation among the supervisory authorities of the Member States, particularly within the EDPB. This cooperation should be further strengthened as it is particularly relevant for the supervision of cross-border processing involving risks or for the processing concerning many Member States, for instance as regards so-called big tech companies.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 6ANNEX JAI.2 EN(11) The Council also supports the idea presented by the Commission in its Communication that competition, consumer, and data protection authorities should cooperate when appropriate, for instance, as regards supervising big tech companies. The Council notes that the extensive influence of those companies and their business models have raised some concerns. It would be worth examining and monitoring, for instance, how data subjects can sufficiently exercise their rights against big tech companies. Coordinated efforts to examine the scope of the challenges as well as to create a vision of how to tackle them are therefore needed at the EU level.(12) Furthermore, the Council deems that controllers and processors need more clarification and guidance from the supervisory authorities and the EDPB. The Commission\u2019s upcoming evaluation report should also highlight the broad need for practical guidelines and other suitable means to meet this need.(13) Drafting sector-specific codes of conduct in accordance with Article 40 of the GDPR could be a suitable way to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR. Such codes of conduct could pay particular attention to issues such as the protection of children\u2019s personal data or the processing of health data. A list of codes of conduct, which is being agreed with the supervisory authorities, could help improve coordination and support for such projects. Measures to encourage the drafting of such codes of conduct should be increased and further developed.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 7ANNEX JAI.2 EN(14) At the same time, the Council notes that new phenomena, particularly emerging technologies, also provide new challenges for the protection of personal data as well as for the protection of other fundamental rights such as the prohibition of discrimination. Those challenges relate to topics such as the use of big data, artificial intelligence and algorithms, as well as the internet of things and block-chain technology. The same applies for the use of technologies such as facial recognition, new types of profiling, and the \u2018deep fake\u2019 technology. The development of quantum computing can also pose a challenge to the protection of personal data. On the other hand, the Council notes that certain applications of those technologies can also be a great advantage and potentially enhance the privacy of European citizens. In order to keep up with emerging technologies, the Council deems it necessary to monitor and assess the relationship between technological development and the GDPR at EU level on a continuing basis.(15) The Council underlines that the GDPR was drafted to be technologically neutral and that its provisions already address these new challenges. The Council finds it essential to consider that the GDPR, and more generally the EU\u2019s legal framework for the protection of personal data, is a prerequisite for the development of future digital policy initiatives. However, in light of the above, the Council deems that it is necessary to clarify as soon as possible how the GDPR applies to the aforementioned new technologies.3. International transfers(16) In its Communication, the Commission notes the positive trend of data protection rules developing at a global level. There is an increasing number of parties to Council of Europe Convention 108, which has recently been revised. At the same time, countries across the world are adopting new data protection legislation or modernising their regulatory frameworks on data protection.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 8ANNEX JAI.2 EN(17) The Council finds that adequacy decisions are an essential tool for controllers to transfer personal data safely to third countries and international organisations. In this respect, the Council also considers it crucial that the adequacy decisions are based on compliance with all the criteria set for such decisions, including for onward transfers. Adequacy decisions must also be subject to ongoing monitoring and periodic review, as required by Union law, which is essential to ensure effective protection of the rights of the data subject. The Council supports the Commission\u2019s intention, expressed in its Communication, to further intensify its dialogue on adequacy with qualifying key partners. The Council encourages the Commission to look into the possibility, when adopting new adequacy decisions, of specifically addressing transfers to and between public authorities. The Council also welcomes the Commission\u2019s plan to report in 2020 on the review of the 11 adequacy decisions adopted under Directive 95/46/EC.(18) The Council notes that for the time being, there are only 13 adequacy decisions in force, including the Privacy Shield for the United States. Consequently, the controller needs to resort to other tools offered by Chapter V of the GDPR in many situations when transferring personal data to third countries and international organisations. Therefore, the Council shares the view that it is also important to address the application of other tools for international transfers under Chapter V of the GDPR, which sometimes may also better meet the needs of individual controllers and processors in a specific sector. The Council underlines the advantages of those tools, which include legally binding and enforceable instruments between public authorities or bodies, binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission, as well as approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms together with binding commitments by the controller or processor in the third country.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 9ANNEX JAI.2 EN(19) The Council further notes that the standard contractual clauses for data transfers to third countries developed under Directive 95/46/EC have not been updated in light of developments since they were originally adopted, including the entry into force of the GDPR. The Commission is encouraged to review and revise them in the near future to take into account the needs of controllers and processors.(20) Member States have noted that the application of some of the aforementioned tools would benefit from further clarification and guidance. For example, some Member States have pointed out that, in the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller may find it difficult to determine what may be considered appropriate safeguards of data protection as referred to in Article 46 of the GDPR. In the Council\u2019s view, clarification and guidance would be welcome, particularly from the EDPB. The Council notes the guidance already issued by the EDPB on binding corporate rules. Moreover, it would be necessary to clarify the minimum standards for transfers subject to appropriate safeguards between public authorities. This is important as the public authorities of the Member States constantly need to cooperate and exchange personal data with the authorities of third countries whose legal frameworks differ from that of the EU.4. Cooperation and consistency mechanisms(21) The cooperation and consistency mechanisms are, in the Council\u2019s view, key instruments to ensure a high and consistent level of protection of personal data throughout the EU. It is expected that the application of those mechanisms will result in a number of important common decisions and guidance documents at the European level in the near future, thereby contributing to a clearer understanding and consistent application of the GDPR as well as reducing discrepancies in its application.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 10ANNEX JAI.2 EN(22) However, while the cooperation and consistency mechanisms are considered key elements of the new regulatory framework, and the supervisory authorities are required to cooperate, Member States have mentioned that their supervisory authorities have faced some challenges in using them. Furthermore, attention has been drawn by some Member States to the administrative burden and human resources implications of the new mechanisms, particularly the implications of the deadlines under Article 60 of the GDPR. Some Member States have also mentioned challenges relating to the lack of more detailed provisions in the GDPR on the applicable procedures in cross-border situations as well as the different criteria, in particular for the processing of complaints under national procedural laws. However, while recognising the challenges faced by the supervisory authorities in meeting those deadlines and in complying with the requirements of national procedural laws, the Council finds it important for the effective enforcement of the GDPR that the conditions of Article 60 are met.(23) In the view of the Council, it is still early to assess the functioning of the cooperation and consistency mechanisms, given the short experience of their application. The Council therefore encourages the Commission to consult the supervisory authorities and the EDPB in the context of this review. The Council also encourages the EDPB to look into the question of finding efficient working arrangements in cross-border cases.5. Margin left for national legislators(24) The GDPR is directly applicable in all Member States. As pointed out by the Commission in its Communication, one key objective of the GDPR was to move away from the fragmented landscape of 28 different national laws that existed under Directive 95/46/EC and to provide legal certainty for individuals and businesses throughout the EU. The Council considers that the GDPR has to a large extent contributed to this objective.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 11ANNEX JAI.2 EN(25) However, the GDPR leaves a margin for a national legislator to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of certain rules of the GDPR. The margin is included in several articles of the GDPR. The Commission indicated in its Communication that it would pay particular attention to the national measures relating to the use of this margin for specification. According to the Commission, the national legislation should not introduce requirements going beyond the GDPR when there is no margin for specification, such as additional conditions for processing. The Council recalls that an adequate margin for national legislators was deemed necessary in many respects when the GDPR was negotiated. For example, Articles 6(2) and (3) of the GDPR allow the Member States to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of certain legal bases for the processing of personal data. A certain fragmentation caused by this margin was thus foreseen and is justified. The same applies, for instance, to Articles 85 and 86.(26) However, a number of Member States have pointed out that the national margin has possibly resulted in some unintended consequences as it has, to some extent, contributed to a more fragmented legal landscape than was originally foreseen. For instance, a margin for national legislators has also been included in Article 8 of the GDPR, which provides for the age of consent of a child in relation to information society services ranging from 13 to 16 years. This has resulted in Member States adopting differing age limits.(27) While a majority of Member States did not raise the differing age limits as an issue, a couple of Member States thought that this was problematic and suggested considering the introduction of a uniform age limit. The Council notes that this fragmentation with respect to the different age limits was foreseen when the decision to allow flexibility regarding the age limit was taken at the end of the negotiations of the GDPR. However, the possibility to choose different age limits as provided by Article 8 has given rise to legal uncertainty concerning the applicable law among the Member States in situations where the national laws of two Member States are applicable to a single processing activity.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 12ANNEX JAI.2 EN(28) However, the Council notes that the GDPR and the national rules complementing it have only been applied for a short while. Sector-specific legislation is still being revised in many Member States. Therefore, it might be too early to draw definite conclusions about the overall level of legal fragmentation in the EU. It would be useful to get a better understanding of how the issue of overlapping territorial scopes of national laws implementing the GDPR has affected controllers and processors and how they are dealing with such situations.(29) The Council also stresses the need to prevent the EU legal landscape from fragmentation as regards the protection of personal data. EU directives and regulations that contain provisions on the processing of personal data should be consistent with the GDPR or, if applicable, Directive (EU) 2016/6804 or Regulation (EU) 2018/17255. The right to data protection should also be taken into account in an appropriate manner when creating policies that affect the processing of personal data.6. New obligations for the private sector(30) While the GDPR has to some extent reduced the administrative burden on controllers, it has also created certain new obligations. The increased workload that has resulted from this has in particular affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). According to the Communication, although the situation varies between Member States, SMEs have been among the stakeholders with the most questions about the application of the GDPR. Similarly, a few Member States have pointed out that some charitable or voluntary associations have been among those who have faced challenges with the documentation requirements.4 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA.5 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 13ANNEX JAI.2 EN(31) According to information from some Member States, SMEs are dissatisfied, for example, with the limited derogation from the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities. Article 30(5) of the GDPR exempts enterprises or organisations employing fewer than 250 persons from the requirement to maintain a record of processing activities, but under a set of conditions that only seldom apply. While recognising that the risk-based approach of the GDPR was a choice made by the legislator, the Council considers that it would be important to try and assess how the intended balance between the risk-based-approach, on the one hand, and the need to take into account the special needs of SME\u2019s (recital 13), on the other hand, works in practice.(32) Another example of new obligations is the obligation to notify the supervisory authorities of personal data breaches and to document such breaches (Article 33 of the GDPR). According to information received from Member States, the number of notifications made so far at the EU level under Article 33 is significant. Therefore, it seems that this obligation has caused additional work for both the controllers and the supervisory authorities.(33) Although under recital 13, Member States and their supervisory authorities are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation, the Council agrees that some further guidance and support for SMEs from national supervisory authorities or the EDPB could be useful. Some supervisory authorities of Member States have already developed targeted guidance and tools for SMEs, to respond to their questions and needs. The Council underlines the role of those authorities and the EDPB in providing advice for SMEs and charitable or voluntary associations, and encourages them to be more active in this respect. Practical tools could also be developed by the supervisory authorities in order to help and facilitate SMEs in their compliance with the GDPR, such as a harmonised form for controllers and processors to notify the supervisory authorities of personal data breach, or a simplified record of processing.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 14ANNEX JAI.2 EN7. Representatives of controllers or processors not established in the Union(34) Member States have drawn attention to the possibility that controllers or processors not established in the Union might not comply with their obligations set out in the GDPR. One of those obligations is the requirement under Article 27 for controllers and processors to designate a representative in the Union. It is uncertain to what extent controllers established in third countries have complied with that obligation but according to information from Member States, there are cases where a representative has not been designated. It would be helpful to have information on the extent to which controllers or processors not established in the Union have designated a representative as required by Article 27 and what steps supervisory authorities are taking to ensure compliance with this obligation.(35) Furthermore, under Article 30(2), the processor\u2019s representative shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, which shall be made available to the supervisory authority on request. It is not entirely clear what the supervisory authority can do in situations where the representative does not comply with its obligation. Another aspect that may require further reflection is the scope of responsibility of a representative for non-compliance by the controller or the processor. The newly-updated guidance from the EDPB in this regard is therefore welcome.8. Conclusions(36) The Council calls for the Commission to take a broad view in its upcoming report going beyond Chapters V and VII which are explicitly mentioned in Article 97 of the GDPR. Given the importance and impact of the GDPR, there are strong arguments supporting a broader review and discussion on the topic, carefully taking into account the contributions from the Council, the European Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders such as the supervisory authorities.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 15ANNEX JAI.2 EN(37) This document outlines those issues of application and interpretation of the GDPR that have raised most concerns in the Member States so far. The concerns relate, in particular, to: 1) the challenges of determining or applying appropriate safeguards in the absence of an adequacy decision; 2) the additional work for the supervisory authorities resulting from the cooperation and consistency mechanisms under Chapter VII of the GDPR, as well as the resource implications of those mechanisms; 3) the unforeseen fragmentation of legislation; 4) new obligations for controllers and processors in the private sector introduced by certain provisions of the GDPR; and 5) the steps to be taken by the supervisory authorities to tackle situations where controllers established in third countries fail to designate a representative in the Union.(38) However, there are also a number of issues relating to other provisions of the GDPR that have been raised by individual Member States. While the Council acknowledges that the number of questions is mainly due to the fact that GDPR has only been applied for a short time, the Council considers that they need to be addressed in one way or another. The Council agrees that many of the issues raised by the Member States are questions of interpretation that could be resolved for example through further guidance, although some materials are already available. The Council acknowledges the role of the EDPB and national supervisory authorities in the provision of guidance. Attention should be paid, in particular, to:\u2022 the application of the GDPR in the field of new technologies as well as the issues related to big tech companies;\u2022 practical tools for SMEs and charitable or voluntary associations, such as a harmonised form for controllers and processors to notify the supervisory authorities of personal data breach, or a simplified record of processing, as well as other appropriate tools for SMEs to apply the GDPR in view of their specific needs;\u2022 efficient working arrangements of supervisory authorities in cross-border cases; and\u2022 the issues relating to the situations where a representative of a controller or a processor established outside the EU does not comply with its obligations.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 16ANNEX JAI.2 EN(39) Furthermore, many of these issues and topics, especially those within the field of competence of national legislators and the challenges related to emerging technologies, deserve further discussions and sharing of experiences between the Member States and the Commission. It should be explored what would be the appropriate forum for such discussions, which should not overlap with the work of the EDPB.(40) As regards Chapter V, the Council encourages the Commission not only to review the existing adequacy decisions but also to examine the possibilities to adopt new adequacy decisions according to the requirements set by Union law, and to explore the possibility to specifically address transfers to and between public authorities when adopting such decisions. At the same time, the Council shares the view that it is equally important to address the application of the other tools available under Chapter V to provide controllers with more clarity on when appropriate safeguards could be considered to exist in the absence of an adequacy decision.(41) As regards Chapter VII, the Council notes that some concerns have been raised as described in the foregoing. The Council considers that the cooperation among the supervisory authorities should be further strengthened. In this context, the relevance of the resources of the national supervisory authorities and of the EDPB should be addressed in the Commission\u2019s upcoming report. The Council considers that the procedural challenges relating to the application of Chapter VII should also be addressed. The Council encourages the Commission to consult the supervisory authorities and the EDPB.(42) The Council notes the risk of fragmentation of legislation relating to the margin the Member States have to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of the GDPR. While that margin has been intentional for the specification of certain provisions of the GDPR and a certain fragmentation is therefore justified, the Council considers that the developments in this respect should be followed closely. In addition, the Council considers it necessary to take data protection aspects and the GDPR fully into account in relevant fields of EU policy and law-making.14994/1/19 REV 1 CHS/np 17ANNEX JAI.2 EN(43) In the view of the Council, it is important to promote the European model established by the GDPR and to ensure legal certainty for all stakeholders in the forthcoming years. The Commission should therefore address in its report the issues relating to the aforementioned topics, and suggest appropriate means to resolve them. Furthermore, with a view to preparing for subsequent reports under Article 97, the Commission should continue monitoring and analysing experiences of application of the GDPR, particularly as regards the issues outlined in this document. The Council also stresses the importance of examining and clarifying how the GDPR is applied to and is able to respond to challenges posed by new technologies as soon as possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2761804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSS-PXJ1-JDG9-Y32N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5344\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced Directive 95/45/EC. It has a two-foldaim, namely to enhance data protection rights of individuals and to improve business opportunitiesby facilitating the free flow of personal data in the digital single market.2. The GDPR entered into force in May 2016 and applies from 25 May 2018.3. According to Article 97 of the GDPR, the Commission shall submit a report on the evaluationand review of the GDPR to the European Parliament and the Council. The first report is due by25 May 2020. For that purpose, the Commission shall take into account the positions and findingsof the European Parliament and the Council, and of other relevant bodies and sources. TheCommission may also request information from Member States and supervisory authorities.In the context of this evaluation and review, the Commission shall examine, in particular, theapplication and functioning of:14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 2JAI.2 EN\u2022 Chapter V on the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations with particular regard to decisions adopted pursuant to Article 45(3) of this Regulation and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC; and\u2022 Chapter VII on cooperation and consistency.4. With a view to preparing the Council position the Presidency drew up a text on the basis of comments provided by the Member States. The Council Working Party on Information Exchange and Data Protection (DAPIX) met on 3 September, 21 October, 11 November and 5 December 2019 to discuss the Council position.5. Following a silence procedure launched on 6 December 2019, delegations could agree to the text of the Council position as set out in Annex to this note.6. The Permanent Representatives Committee is accordingly invited to recommend that the Council adopts its position and findings on the application of the General Data Protection Regulation as set out in Annex as an 'A' item of the agenda of one of its forthcoming sessions, with the UK abstaining. The Commission will be informed of the Council position.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 3ANNEX JAI.2 ENANNEX1. Introduction(1) The General Data Protection Regulation (\u2019GDPR\u2019)1 entered into application on 25 May 2018, repealing and replacing Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR aims to create a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement. The GDPR has a two-fold objective. The first one is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. The second one is to allow the free flow of personal data and the development of the digital economy across the internal market.(2) According to Article 97 of the GDPR, the Commission shall submit a first report on the evaluation and review of the Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council. That report is due by 25 May 2020, followed by reports every four years thereafter.(3) In this context, the Commission shall examine, in particular, the application and functioning of:\u2022 Chapter V on the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations with particular regard to decisions adopted pursuant to Article 45(3) of this Regulation and decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC; and\u2022 Chapter VII on cooperation and consistency.(4) The GDPR requires that the Commission take into account the positions and findings of the European Parliament and the Council, and of other relevant bodies and sources. The Commission may also request information from Member States and supervisory authorities.1 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 4ANNEX JAI.2 EN(5) In order to prepare the aforementioned Council positions and findings, delegations were requested to send written comments2. Member States\u2019 comments were discussed by DAPIX Working Party in its meetings of 21 October, 11 November and 5 December 2019. The Council positions and findings based on that preparatory work are outlined and summarised in this document. The Council has also taken note of the Commission\u2019s \u2018Communication on data protection rules as a trust-enabler in the EU and beyond \u2013 taking stock\u20193 (the Communication) that was adopted in July 2019. The Communication looked at the impact of the EU data protection rules and at the possibilities for improving their implementation further. While the new data protection rules have, according to the Commission, achieved many of their objectives, the Communication also sets out concrete steps to further strengthen these rules and their application.(6) The Council takes the view that its positions and findings should not be limited to the topics specifically mentioned in Article 97(2) of the GDPR. Therefore, the Council also encourages the Commission to evaluate and review in its upcoming report the application and functioning of the GDPR beyond what is specifically mentioned in that article. Furthermore, the Commission should take into account the experiences and input of relevant stakeholders. This will help to ensure that the evaluation is as comprehensive as possible. Given the importance and impact of the GDPR in an ever-developing digital society, there are strong arguments supporting a broader review and ongoing discussion on the topic.(7) At the same time, the Council highlights that the GDPR has only been applied since May 2018. Therefore, it is likely that most of the issues identified by Member States will benefit from more experience in the application of the GDPR in the coming years. Further guidance, especially by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and a possibility to exchange information on national practices, interpretations and court decisions would also be useful for Member States.2 12756/19 REV 13 11535/1914994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 5ANNEX JAI.2 EN(8) The Council has made a number of detailed observations on the application of the GDPR. In this document, the Council outlines certain topics that have been considered particularly relevant by the Member States. Those issues should also be reflected in the upcoming report by the Commission in an appropriate manner.2. General remarks(9) In the view of the Council, the GDPR has been a success. It is undoubtedly an important milestone and an instrument that strengthens the right to the protection of personal data and fosters trust-enabling innovation in the EU. The GDPR has also further increased awareness of the importance of data protection both in the EU and abroad.(10) The Council acknowledges the important role of national supervisory authorities in the functioning and consistent application of the GDPR. The Council also notes the significant increase in the activities of the supervisory authorities, linked to the exercise of their new tasks and powers, and the positive developments as regards the significantly increased allocation of resources to them in many Member States. The Council shares the view of the Commission on the importance of cooperation among the supervisory authorities of the Member States, particularly within the EDPB. This cooperation should be further strengthened as it is particularly relevant for the supervision of cross-border processing involving risks or for the processing concerning many Member States, for instance as regards so-called big tech companies.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 6ANNEX JAI.2 EN(11) The Council also supports the idea presented by the Commission in its Communication that competition, consumer, and data protection authorities should cooperate when appropriate, for instance, as regards supervising big tech companies. The Council notes that the extensive influence of those companies and their business models have raised some concerns. It would be worth examining and monitoring, for instance, how data subjects can sufficiently exercise their rights against big tech companies. Coordinated efforts to examine the scope of the challenges as well as to create a vision of how to tackle them are therefore needed at the EU level.(12) Furthermore, the Council deems that controllers and processors need more clarification and guidance from the supervisory authorities and the EDPB. The Commission\u2019s upcoming evaluation report should also highlight the broad need for practical guidelines and other suitable means to meet this need.(13) Drafting sector-specific codes of conduct in accordance with Article 40 of the GDPR could be a suitable way to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR. Such codes of conduct could pay particular attention to issues such as the protection of children\u2019s personal data or the processing of health data. A list of codes of conduct, which is being agreed with the supervisory authorities, could help improve coordination and support for such projects. Measures to encourage the drafting of such codes of conduct should be increased and further developed.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 7ANNEX JAI.2 EN(14) At the same time, the Council notes that new phenomena, particularly emerging technologies, also provide new challenges for the protection of personal data as well as for the protection of other fundamental rights such as the prohibition of discrimination. Those challenges relate to topics such as the use of big data, artificial intelligence and algorithms, as well as the internet of things and block-chain technology. The same applies for the use of technologies such as facial recognition, new types of profiling, and the \u2018deep fake\u2019 technology. The development of quantum computing can also pose a challenge to the protection of personal data. On the other hand, the Council notes that certain applications of those technologies can also be a great advantage and potentially enhance the privacy of European citizens. In order to keep up with emerging technologies, the Council deems it necessary to monitor and assess the relationship between technological development and the GDPR at EU level on a continuing basis.(15) The Council underlines that the GDPR was drafted to be technologically neutral and that its provisions already address these new challenges. The Council finds it essential to consider that the GDPR, and more generally the EU\u2019s legal framework for the protection of personal data, is a prerequisite for the development of future digital policy initiatives. However, in light of the above, the Council deems that it is necessary to clarify as soon as possible how the GDPR applies to the aforementioned new technologies.3. International transfers(16) In its Communication, the Commission notes the positive trend of data protection rules developing at a global level. There is an increasing number of parties to Council of Europe Convention 108, which has recently been revised. At the same time, countries across the world are adopting new data protection legislation or modernising their regulatory frameworks on data protection.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 8ANNEX JAI.2 EN(17) The Council finds that adequacy decisions are an essential tool for controllers to transfer personal data safely to third countries and international organisations. In this respect, the Council also considers it crucial that the adequacy decisions are based on compliance with all the criteria set for such decisions, including for onward transfers. Adequacy decisions must also be subject to ongoing monitoring and periodic review, as required by Union law, which is essential to ensure effective protection of the rights of the data subject. The Council supports the Commission\u2019s intention, expressed in its Communication, to further intensify its dialogue on adequacy with qualifying key partners. The Council encourages the Commission to look into the possibility, when adopting new adequacy decisions, of specifically addressing transfers to and between public authorities. The Council also welcomes the Commission\u2019s plan to report in 2020 on the review of the 11 adequacy decisions adopted under Directive 95/46/EC.(18) The Council notes that for the time being, there are only 13 adequacy decisions in force, including the Privacy Shield for the United States. Consequently, the controller needs to resort to other tools offered by Chapter V of the GDPR in many situations when transferring personal data to third countries and international organisations. Therefore, the Council shares the view that it is also important to address the application of other tools for international transfers under Chapter V of the GDPR, which sometimes may also better meet the needs of individual controllers and processors in a specific sector. The Council underlines the advantages of those tools, which include legally binding and enforceable instruments between public authorities or bodies, binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission, as well as approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms together with binding commitments by the controller or processor in the third country.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 9ANNEX JAI.2 EN(19) The Council further notes that the standard contractual clauses for data transfers to third countries developed under Directive 95/46/EC have not been updated in light of developments since they were originally adopted, including the entry into force of the GDPR. The Commission is encouraged to review and revise them in the near future to take into account the needs of controllers and processors.(20) Member States have noted that the application of some of the aforementioned tools would benefit from further clarification and guidance. For example, some Member States have pointed out that, in the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller may find it difficult to determine what may be considered appropriate safeguards of data protection as referred to in Article 46 of the GDPR. In the Council\u2019s view, clarification and guidance would be welcome, particularly from the EDPB. The Council notes the guidance already issued by the EDPB on binding corporate rules. Moreover, it would be necessary to clarify the minimum standards for transfers subject to appropriate safeguards between public authorities. This is important as the public authorities of the Member States constantly need to cooperate and exchange personal data with the authorities of third countries whose legal frameworks differ from that of the EU.4. Cooperation and consistency mechanisms(21) The cooperation and consistency mechanisms are, in the Council\u2019s view, key instruments to ensure a high and consistent level of protection of personal data throughout the EU. It is expected that the application of those mechanisms will result in a number of important common decisions and guidance documents at the European level in the near future, thereby contributing to a clearer understanding and consistent application of the GDPR as well as reducing discrepancies in its application.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 10ANNEX JAI.2 EN(22) However, while the cooperation and consistency mechanisms are considered key elements of the new regulatory framework, and the supervisory authorities are required to cooperate, Member States have mentioned that their supervisory authorities have faced some challenges in using them. Furthermore, attention has been drawn by some Member States to the administrative burden and human resources implications of the new mechanisms, particularly the implications of the deadlines under Article 60 of the GDPR. Some Member States have also mentioned challenges relating to the lack of more detailed provisions in the GDPR on the applicable procedures in cross-border situations as well as the different criteria, in particular for the handling of complaints under national procedural laws. However, while recognising the challenges faced by the supervisory authorities in meeting those deadlines and in complying with the requirements of national procedural laws, the Council finds it important for the effective enforcement of the GDPR that the conditions of Article 60 are met.(23) In the view of the Council, it is still early to assess the functioning of the cooperation and consistency mechanisms, given the short experience of their application. The Council therefore encourages the Commission to consult the supervisory authorities and the EDPB in the context of this review. The Council also encourages the EDPB to look into the question of finding efficient working arrangements in cross-border cases.5. Margin left for national legislators(24) The GDPR is directly applicable in all Member States. As pointed out by the Commission in its Communication, one key objective of the GDPR was to move away from the fragmented landscape of 28 different national laws that existed under Directive 95/46/EC and to provide legal certainty for individuals and businesses throughout the EU. The Council considers that the GDPR has to a large extent contributed to this objective.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 11ANNEX JAI.2 EN(25) However, the GDPR leaves a margin for a national legislator to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of certain rules of the GDPR. The margin is included in several articles of the GDPR. The Commission indicated in its Communication that it would pay particular attention to the national measures relating to the use of this margin for specification. According to the Commission, the national legislation should not introduce requirements going beyond the GDPR when there is no margin for specification, such as additional conditions for processing. The Council recalls that an adequate margin for national legislators was deemed necessary in many respects when the GDPR was negotiated. For example, Articles 6(2) and (3) of the GDPR allow the Member States to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of certain legal bases for the processing of personal data. A certain fragmentation caused by this margin was thus foreseen and is justified. The same applies, for instance, to Articles 85 and 86.(26) However, a number of Member States have pointed out that the national margin has possibly resulted in some unintended consequences as it has, to some extent, contributed to a more fragmented legal landscape than was originally foreseen. For instance, a margin for national legislators has also been included in Article 8 of the GDPR, which provides for the age of consent of a child in relation to information society services ranging from 13 to 16 years. This has resulted in Member States adopting differing age limits.(27) While a majority of Member States did not raise the differing age limits as an issue, a couple of Member States thought that this was problematic and suggested considering the introduction of a uniform age limit. The Council notes that this fragmentation with respect to the different age limits was foreseen when the decision to allow flexibility regarding the age limit was taken at the end of the negotiations of the GDPR. However, the possibility to choose different age limits as provided by Article 8 has given rise to legal uncertainty concerning the applicable law among the Member States in situations where the national laws of two Member States are applicable to a single processing activity.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 12ANNEX JAI.2 EN(28) However, the Council notes that the GDPR and the national rules complementing it have only been applied for a short while. Sector-specific legislation is still being revised in many Member States. Therefore, it might be too early to draw definite conclusions about the overall level of legal fragmentation in the EU. It would be useful to get a better understanding of how the issue of overlapping territorial scopes of national laws implementing the GDPR has affected controllers and processors and how they are dealing with such situations.(29) The Council also stresses the need to prevent the EU legal landscape from fragmentation as regards the protection of personal data. EU directives and regulations that contain provisions on the processing of personal data should be consistent with the GDPR or, if applicable, Directive (EU) 2016/6804 or Regulation (EU) 2018/17255. The right to data protection should also be taken into account in an appropriate manner when creating policies that affect the processing of personal data.6. New obligations for the private sector(30) While the GDPR has to some extent reduced the administrative burden on controllers, it has also created certain new obligations. The increased workload that has resulted from this has in particular affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). According to the Communication, although the situation varies between Member States, SMEs have been among the stakeholders with the most questions about the application of the GDPR. Similarly, a few Member States have pointed out that some charitable or voluntary associations have been among those who have faced challenges with the documentation requirements.4 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA.5 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 13ANNEX JAI.2 EN(31) According to information from some Member States, SMEs are dissatisfied, for example, with the limited derogation from the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities. Article 30(5) of the GDPR exempts enterprises or organisations employing fewer than 250 persons from the requirement to maintain a record of processing activities, but under a set of conditions that only seldom apply. While recognising that the risk-based approach of the GDPR was a choice made by the legislator, the Council considers that it would be important to try and assess how the intended balance between the risk-based-approach, on the one hand, and the need to take into account the special needs of SME\u2019s (recital 13), on the other hand, works in practice.(32) Another example of new obligations is the obligation to notify the supervisory authorities of personal data breaches and to document such breaches (Article 33 of the GDPR). According to information received from Member States, the number of notifications made so far at the EU level under Article 33 is significant. Therefore, it seems that this obligation has caused additional work for both the controllers and the supervisory authorities.(33) Although under recital 13, Member States and their supervisory authorities are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation, the Council agrees that some further guidance and support for SMEs from national supervisory authorities or the EDPB could be useful. Some supervisory authorities of Member States have already developed targeted guidance and tools for SMEs, to respond to their questions and needs. The Council underlines the role of those authorities and the EDPB in providing advice for SMEs and charitable or voluntary associations, and encourages them to be more active in this respect. Practical tools could also be developed by the supervisory authorities in order to help and facilitate SMEs in their compliance with the GDPR, such as a harmonised form for controllers and processors to notify the supervisory authorities of personal data breach, or a simplified record of processing.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 14ANNEX JAI.2 EN7. Representatives of controllers or processors not established in the Union(34) Member States have drawn attention to the possibility that controllers or processors not established in the Union might not comply with their obligations set out in the GDPR. One of those obligations is the requirement under Article 27 for controllers and processors to designate a representative in the Union. It is uncertain to what extent controllers established in third countries have complied with that obligation but according to information from Member States, there are cases where a representative has not been designated. It would be helpful to have information on the extent to which controllers or processors not established in the Union have designated a representative as required by Article 27 and what steps supervisory authorities are taking to ensure compliance with this obligation.(35) Furthermore, under Article 30(2), the processor\u2019s representative shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, which shall be made available to the supervisory authority on request. It is not entirely clear what the supervisory authority can do in situations where the representative does not comply with its obligation. Another aspect that may require further reflection is the scope of responsibility of a representative for non-compliance by the controller or the processor. The newly-updated guidance from the EDPB in this regard is therefore welcome.8. Conclusions(36) The Council calls for the Commission to take a broad view in its upcoming report going beyond Chapters V and VII which are explicitly mentioned in Article 97 of the GDPR. Given the importance and impact of the GDPR, there are strong arguments supporting a broader review and discussion on the topic, carefully taking into account the contributions from the Council, the European Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders such as the supervisory authorities.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 15ANNEX JAI.2 EN(37) This document outlines those issues of application and interpretation of the GDPR that have raised most concerns in the Member States so far. The concerns relate, in particular, to: 1) the challenges of determining or applying appropriate safeguards in the absence of an adequacy decision; 2) the additional work for the supervisory authorities resulting from the cooperation and consistency mechanisms under Chapter VII of the GDPR, as well as the resource implications of those mechanisms; 3) the unforeseen fragmentation of legislation; 4) new obligations for controllers and processors in the private sector introduced by certain provisions of the GDPR; and 5) the steps to be taken by the supervisory authorities to tackle situations where controllers established in third countries fail to designate a representative in the Union.(38) However, there are also a number of issues relating to other provisions of the GDPR that have been raised by individual Member States. While the Council acknowledges that the number of questions is mainly due to the fact that GDPR has only been applied for a short time, the Council considers that they need to be addressed in one way or another. The Council agrees that many of the issues raised by the Member States are questions of interpretation that could be resolved for example through further guidance, although some materials are already available. The Council acknowledges the role of the EDPB and national supervisory authorities in the provision of guidance. Attention should be paid, in particular, to:\u2022 the application of the GDPR in the field of new technologies as well as the issues related to big tech companies;\u2022 practical tools for SMEs and charitable or voluntary associations, such as a harmonised form for controllers and processors to notify the supervisory authorities of personal data breach, or a simplified record of processing, as well as other appropriate tools for SMEs to apply the GDPR in view of their specific needs;\u2022 efficient working arrangements of supervisory authorities in cross-border cases; and\u2022 the issues relating to the situations where a representative of a controller or a processor established outside the EU does not comply with its obligations.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 16ANNEX JAI.2 EN(39) Furthermore, many of these issues and topics, especially those within the field of competence of national legislators and the challenges related to emerging technologies, deserve further discussions and sharing of experiences between the Member States and the Commission. It should be explored what would be the appropriate forum for such discussions, which should not overlap with the work of the EDPB.(40) As regards Chapter V, the Council encourages the Commission not only to review the existing adequacy decisions but also to examine the possibilities to adopt new adequacy decisions according to the requirements set by Union law, and to explore the possibility to specifically address transfers to and between public authorities when adopting such decisions. At the same time, the Council shares the view that it is equally important to address the application of the other tools available under Chapter V to provide controllers with more clarity on when appropriate safeguards could be considered to exist in the absence of an adequacy decision.(41) As regards Chapter VII, the Council notes that some concerns have been raised as described in the foregoing. The Council considers that the cooperation among the supervisory authorities should be further strengthened. In this context, the relevance of the resources of the national supervisory authorities and of the EDPB should be addressed in the Commission\u2019s upcoming report. The Council considers that the procedural challenges relating to the application of Chapter VII should also be addressed. The Council encourages the Commission to consult the supervisory authorities and the EDPB.(42) The Council notes the risk of fragmentation of legislation relating to the margin the Member States have to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of the GDPR. While that margin has been intentional for the specification of certain provisions of the GDPR and a certain fragmentation is therefore justified, the Council considers that the developments in this respect should be followed closely. In addition, the Council considers it necessary to take data protection aspects and the GDPR fully into account in relevant fields of EU policy and law-making.14994/2/19 REV 2 CHS/np 17ANNEX JAI.2 EN(43) In the view of the Council, it is important to promote the European model established by the GDPR and to ensure legal certainty for all stakeholders in the forthcoming years. The Commission should therefore address in its report the issues relating to the aforementioned topics, and suggest appropriate means to resolve them. Furthermore, with a view to preparing for subsequent reports under Article 97, the Commission should continue monitoring and analysing experiences of application of the GDPR, particularly as regards the issues outlined in this document. The Council also stresses the importance of examining and clarifying how the GDPR is applied to and is able to respond to challenges posed by new technologies as soon as possible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2846573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0G-TB21-F0YC-N4C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5359\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) and audiovisual industries, in particular, are at the core of the Digital Single Market. The competition context currently faced by these industries is a race with global players, in a landscape that is in constant evolution.CCIs play a crucial role in the discussions on sustainable competitiveness and innovation potential in Europe. As highlighted by the Council1, the content-producing and content-distributing sectors, which include content and works from the media (with audiovisual, print and online content) as well as from other cultural and creative sectors, are essential to Europe\u2019s social and economic development. Given that they draw on cultural values and cultural diversity - as well as on individual and collective creativity, skills and talent - the cultural, creative and audiovisual industries have immense potential. These industries can generate innovation, wealth and jobs, in particular because they generate non-material value. Cultural, creative and audiovisual sectors build bridges between art, culture, business and technology. They help develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as the ability to take a creative approach towards problems, which are key competences in tomorrow\u2019s society.At the same time, cultural, creative and audiovisual industries are indispensable to a free, democratic European society. They represent a crucial foundation for our democratic system as they do not only provide a stage to express culture, views and ideas, but also access to information and a wide variety of content. Furthermore, they are a vital part of our shared heritage, preserve and promote our cultural diversity, and encourage an appreciation of our common values and identity.1 Council conclusions on the strengthening of European content in the digital economy (OJ C 457, 9.12.2018, p. 2).13341/19 CC/np 3ANNEX TREE 1.B ENCurrently, audiovisual content is created, distributed and consumed in a way that is increasingly different from the traditional business model that is based on linear consumption. The roles of creator, distributor and consumer have become less distinct and this has led to changes across the whole value chain. The digital shift has seen the rise of new powerful media content players (Internet and mobile platforms, Internet service providers, and more generally, the big tech companies) established outside the EU. From a position of economic and financial strength, these have started to define the rules of the game within the EU market.The change in market structure is accelerating as the VOD sector, which is dominated by a few global players that are mostly non-European, has been growing at over 40% per year. Given the global scale on which major online platforms operate, this has made it increasingly difficult for content from small markets to be discoverable and to make an impact not only globally but also locally.In an interconnected world in which interactivity plays a key role in content production, we have seen a rising demand for new immersive AV experiences, the rapid growth of gaming content, new opportunities for European audiovisual heritage through technology and an increasing role of artificial intelligence in targeting audiences.As stated in the new Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, ?A strong economic base is of key importance for Europe\u2019s competitiveness, prosperity and role on the global stage and for the creation of jobs, and we need to renew the basis for long-term sustainable and inclusive growth and strengthen cohesion in the EU.?It is essential to discuss how the competitiveness, visibility and innovation capacity of the European CCIs and the audiovisual sector, in particular, can be improved. We need to make sure that we reap the full benefits of their potential for sustainable growth, which is fundamental for the strong economic base that the EU needs. The European Union must be able to shape its own digital future. At the same time, we should be outward looking and aim to increase Europe\u2019s presence at a global level. To this end we need to further promote our cultural cooperation, increase our market share and promote Europe\u2019s values.13341/19 CC/np 4ANNEX TREE 1.B ENChallenges in the CCIsThe European cultural and creative industries (CCIs) employ 12 million people and create around 5.3 % of total EU Gross Value Added. The CCIs\u2019 economic weight is comparable to that of the ICT and the accommodation and food services sectors, yielding over 4 % of EU GDP. Furthermore, the surplus in the EU trade balance for cultural goods indicates an increased demand for EU cultural goods2.The digital media sector3 is a critical component of the growing CCIs in Europe. Digital media is one of the fastest growing sectors in the world 4. It is estimated5 that total entertainment and media spending will rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4 % by 2022, the strongest segment being e-sports and video games6.Despite their growing importance for the European economy and competitiveness in the digital single market, the CCIs and the audiovisual industry face major challenges such as access to funding for R&amp;I and market uptake initiatives 7. R&amp;I is key to CCIs\u2019 ability to create value, while it is by nature the riskiest form of investment.2<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eif.org/what_we_do/guarantees/cultural_creative_sectors_guarantee_facility/ccs-market-analysis-europe.pdf3Digital\">https://www.eif.org/what_we_do/guarantees/cultural_creative_sectors_guarantee_facility/ccs-market-analysis-europe.pdf3Digital</url> media (DM) sector is a sector that includes all activities linked to cinema, television, news and information, production, distribution and storage of content and video games. (KEA European Affairs: Towards an integrated visionfor the European Digital Media Sector. Mapping of other existing EU programmes targeting Creative and CulturalSectors in the Audiovisual field, 31.10.2018). 4It is estimated that overall global media spending will rise from $1.6 trillion in 2015 to $2.1 trillion in 2020. Digital spending is expected to account for more than 50 % of overall media spending by 2019, fuelled by the expansion of mobile telephony and the improved ICT infrastructures (idem).5       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pwc.com/outlook6The\">https://www.pwc.com/outlook6The</url> video games sub-sector is predicted to be the fastest growing segment of digital media industries, risingfrom $85.154 million in 2015 to $132.425 million in 2020 (9.2% CAGR).

Mapping of other existing EU programmes targeting Creative and Cultural Sectors in the Audiovisual field, 31.10.2018 13341/19 CC/np 5ANNEX TREE 1.B ENThis limit to CCIs\u2019 access to funding is compounded by the traditional perception of CCIs as distinct economic sectors that are not interconnected. This \u201csilos\u201d perception locks down investment resources and is limited in terms of sustainability. It does not pool risks and profits for the benefit of the whole CCI sector. This is especially true for the audiovisual and content industries.Other gaps that hinder competitiveness in CCIs include:\u2022 Insufficient knowledge and uptake of technology, which weakens the capacity of the sector to embrace the digital shift and exploit new forms of content creation, promotion and distribution;\u2022 Limited access to data, which are largely owned by major global content platforms, and a lack of transparency with regard to the criteria used by these platforms to classify and promote content;\u2022 Limited scale and capacity to operate across borders, which can translate into weak market share of European content in the international market;\u2022 Insufficient focus on the industry\u2019s demands in the arts and higher education;\u2022 Insufficient grasp of new consumption patterns and trends especially among young audiences;\u2022 Lack of investment in developing ambitious production and distribution initiatives with worldwide potential capable of branding European players as a source of quality content;\u2022 The weak market share of European content in international markets.While some of these problems are sector-specific, many of them also apply to other sectors of European policy. The need to speed up and catch up with global competition is felt in many fields, such as research and innovation, higher education and trade. Even with challenges ahead, Europe can and should adopt a proactive mindset in promoting its competitiveness comprehensively across different sectors.To promote the competitiveness and cultural and linguistic diversity of the audiovisual industry, the EU has used several instruments, combining legislation, policy support and13341/19 CC/np 6ANNEX TREE 1.B ENfunding. In addition to the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive8, the legal framework has been modernised by Directive (EU) 2019/7899, which has also strengthened the promotion of European audiovisual content, as well as by the Copyright Directive10, which ensures a fair remuneration of rights holders for any use of their works online, without overlooking users\u2019 freedom of expression. These three legal acts represent a major step forward in the promotion of cultural content in response to the challenges related to fair remuneration of rights holders, transparency, access to content and the promotion of cultural diversity in the digital environment.Regulation is important and necessary in order to secure a level playing field. There is a need for a regulatory framework that encourages investment and allows European operators, and in particular through independent European companies, to be able to generate the revenue needed to fund content creation and distribution, in particular through increased transparency on the data owned by major platforms. To remain competitive, European media and audiovisual companies must be able to adopt innovative business models.However, it is equally essential to investigate and enhance other means of boosting competitiveness and innovation in the European audiovisual sector. In this regard, the Commission has put forward ambitious proposals for the future generation of funding programmes such as Creative Europe, InvestEU and Horizon Europe. These programmes will fund specific support measures to help industry to adapt and seize the opportunities of the new audiovisual landscape. The synergies between the EU Programmes should be further developed, in particular to promote collaboration between content and tech communities.8Directive (EU) 2018/1808 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 amending Directive 2010/13/EU on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) in view of changing market realities, OJ L 303, 28.11.2018, p. 69.9Directive (EU) 2019/789 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes, and amending Council Directive 93/83/EEC, OJ L 130, 17.5.2019, p. 82.10Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market and amending Directives 96/9/EC and 2001/29/EC, OJ L 130, 17.5.2019, p. 92.13341/19 CC/np 7ANNEX TREE 1.B ENBased on recent observations11, the Presidency believes that solutions at the European level could be found by enhancing Europe\u2019s innovation potential and by promoting cooperation and partnerships. Creativity is a prerequisite for innovation. To enhance the innovation potential of Europe, creativity could be promoted by investing in skills development and competence building, as well as through cross-innovation and creative ecosystems to attract talent to Europe and retain it. It should be possible for players active in the creative and audiovisual industries to engage in new forms of consolidation, cooperation and alliances in order to address the competitive challenges that Europe is facing.Creative Europe MEDIA will focus on promoting co-creation, co-distribution and co-promotion in order to help industry to scale up at the European level. In this respect, the Council also recognised the importance of co-productions in promoting Europe\u2019s cultural and linguistic diversity.12Research and innovation cut across our whole society, and across different players, sectors and policies. In order to promote innovation across the EU, it is necessary to bring together the drivers of innovation, including the creative industries. It is also important to help dismantle silos between sectors in the interests of benefiting from market developments.11Outcomes of the Conference Creation, Innovation, Promotion \u2013 Competitiveness of the EuropeanAudiovisual Industry, 10\u201311 September 2019, Helsinki, Finland.12Council conclusions on improving the cross-border circulation of European audiovisual works, with anemphasis on co-productions (OJ C 192, 7.6.2019, p. 11).13341/19 CC/np 8ANNEX TREE 1.B ENThe Commission\u2019s proposal for a new Knowledge and Innovation Community at the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, dedicated to the Cultural and Creative Industries13, is an excellent example of promoting cross-sectoral approaches to innovation. Equally, the Creative Innovation Lab under the future Creative Europe programme will support projects drawing on different cultural and creative sectors, which in turn will promote innovative cross-sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate new forms of content, access, distribution, promotion and the monetisation of culture and creativity.A genuine European strategy for cultural and creative industries needs to span across sectors and be geared towards impact and sustainability so that the sectors can expand together and can make our culture more available worldwide. In addition, a greater cooperation and interconnection between sectors enables stakeholders to benefit more from investment and growth.In the current phase of institutional transition and in the context of the forthcoming preparation of the comprehensive long-term strategy for Europe\u2019s industrial future, the Presidency would like to submit the following questions in view of the ministerial policy debate which will take place on 21 November:13Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Strategic Innovation Agenda of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) 2021-2027: Boosting the Innovation Talent and capacity of Europe, COM (2019) 330 final.13341/19 CC/np 9ANNEX TREE 1.B EN?

GUFF:  -- in Moscow and across the country?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Right.  I think most likely what will happen Sunday is that Sunday night, Putin will declare victory without waiting for the final official results to come in.  And what will happen on Monday, which I think is more interesting, is that there will be protests on an unprecedented scale that will make protests that we saw in December actually look small.  That's my prediction.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Mmm hmm.  OK.</p><p>Q:  Can we boost -- boost her audio, please?  We can't hear --</p><p>(Cross talk.)</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  OK.</p><p>Q:  Also, would you mind repeating what you just said?</p><p>Q:  Yeah.  (Cross talk.)</p><p>Q:  Yes.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Oh, OK.</p><p>Q:  Yeah -- (off mic).</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Can you hear me now?  Yes?</p><p>MS. GUFF:  Good.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  OK.  What I said was that I think that Putin will declare victory on Sunday night and that there will be huge protests on Monday, probably larger than the protests we saw in the winter.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  So do you -- do you think that Putin -- will he win on the first ballot, according to polls?  And do you think it's more important to <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>to win on the first ballot?  Or does he care more about public reaction to winning on the first ballot if it's disputed?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Right.  Well, there are a couple of issues here. One is, yes, I think it's likely that he would get the largest number of votes of the five candidates on the ballot on Sunday.  I think if the votes were counted accurately, he wouldn't get over 50 percent of the vote, right, which is what's needed to win on the first round.</p><p>I also think it's -- you know, it's sort of confusing the issue a little bit to just about what happens to this particular ballot, because this particular ballot is the product of Putin election laws and Putin election practices.  So the ballot itself is rigged.  And what he -- what he gets out of that ballot is, by definition, a rigged victory.</p><p>I think that everything that he has done and that his administration has done in the last couple of months has actually been geared toward not just winning the election but winning it decisively in the first round.  And I'm sure that that's what territorial election officials have been instructed to provide.</p><p>STEPHEN SESTANOVICH:  Drew, just a couple of numbers.  He is -- for Putin to be denied a victory in the first ballot, you got to have -- just to be really babyish about this, you got to have one guy who gets 20 (percent) and three guys who get 10 (percent).</p><p>MS. GUFF:  (Chuckles.)</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  And --</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  No, actually, no.  No, you don't --</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, I add it up to 50 percent.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Right.  But you're forgetting about all the people who are going to invalidate their ballots.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Yeah.  It's -- right.  Or some other --</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Right.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  -- something else that add -- that adds up to 50 (percent).  But that's sort of -- those are the basic ingredients.</p><p>And right now, most of them are well short of that.  Zyuganov is polling at about 14 (percent), 15 (percent), the Communist leader. The others are more in the 6 (percent) to 8 (percent)-plus range.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Right.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Now, all of those could, under other circumstances, be expected to get 20 (percent).  Zyuganov's party got 20 (percent) in the -- in the December elections.  The other candidates could get -- could get 10 (percent).  But that would represent a kind of surge for them -- not to be excluded, but it is still a kind of remote prospect at this point.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Yeah, but wait a second.  I take issue with the polls that were read -- I mean, what we have is three polling organizations, two of which are openly controlled by the state and one of which is nominally independent.  But --</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Maybe -- just a second on that, if you could describe VTsIOM, Levada, for all of those who are not familiar with the polling companies.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  OK.  They're two organizations, the Fond Obshchestvennoe Mnenie, meaning the Foundation for Public Opinion, which is controlled by the state.  There's VTsIOM, the Old Russian Center for Public Opinion, which was taken over by the Kremlin, what -- about seven years ago?  And you know, the people who used to run kicked out on the street.</p><p>Those people ended up forming an organization of their own called the Levada Center -- it bears the name of their founder -- which has a weird structure.  They basically -- it's not a single polling organization.  It's actually an organization that consists of several independent polling operations.  And the political operation, the arm of the organization that does electoral polling, is, to my mind, highly suspect or at least it always yields exactly the same results, to the percentage point, as the -- as the two state-controlled ones.</p><p>And the thing is -- you know, I've talked to the people who do these polls, and their goal is to predict election results.  Their goal is not to take a measure of public opinion.  It is actually to get as close as possible to the result that we're going to hear back from the Central Election Commission at the -- at the -- at the end of the first week of March.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  And you feel that's true even of Levada, that Levada's numbers would be statistically inaccurate?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Well, they are statistically indistinguishable from all the other numbers historically.  But also that's -- I've asked -- Grazhdankin (ph) who runs the poll -- their electoral arm of Levada what the goal is.  The goal is to predict election results.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  OK, we'll leave it at that.</p><p>Steve, the Russian economy, over the last 10 years, grown tremendously.  2011 also not a bad year at all by world standards. Russia grew third fastest among all major countries.  Disposable income up 10 times in 12 years.  Arguably the cleanest balance sheet of any major country.  Half a trillion dollars of reserves.  The list goes on and on.  Forty percent of households connected to the Internet.  Cheaper Internet in Russia than there is in the U.S., et cetera.  To what extent is the protest movement a result of the economic progress of the last 10 years?  And to what extent is it despite in search of more progress -- economic, political and social liberalization?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, I think it is to some extent, although a Russian friend of mine was explaining to me not so long ago that, you know, Russian politics is not about economics.  It's about, you know, popular rule and that -- and that is the desire of the -- of the protesters.</p><p>I think it is true that Putin does deserve some of the credit for this movement in the following sense:  It's not really about economic progress.  It's about -- what the polls show is a popular attitude that it's -- there's not a risk of revolution and of tremendous instability in pushing for reform, for fairness, for the rule of law. The polls show people don't want revolution and they fear instability. But they don't fear that what they're doing is going to cause revolution and instability.  And I think that creates a kind of boldness that it -- go -- that is separate from just the fact that they don't fear repression.  They think that they're -- the country is ready for -- to be ruled in a different way.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Putin's wasted no time in writing a series of articles and manifestos that have -- that have shown up in Russian-language press.  And if you read them, they are -- they're incredibly progressive, very rational.  The economic portion is -- you would -- you would -- you would say taken right out of the playbook of Kudrin or Dvorkovich.  To what -- to what degree do we think those highly rational, attractive policies will actually be implemented after the election?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  I'm not sure that Putin has seen any of those. (Laughter.)  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't take it for granted at least that he has.  I mean, that's campaign promotional material, and I don't say that really to disparage him.  He has been given a lot of advice, starting in December, that he had to adopt the rhetoric of modernization and of liberalization.</p><p>On the stump, he hasn't really talked that way.</p><p>He's had a different kind of rhetoric for the -- for the public. People thought in December that the choice was between liberalization and repression.  But actually, Putin has a run a pretty vigorous campaign, and the theme of that campaign is the one that people thought was going to be a certain loser in December, when it was Putin's first response.  He's actually carried through with it.  That is painting opponents as traitors, as paid agents of the West, and trying to marginalize them and saying that the issue is really about Russia's future and independence and, you know, invoking Napoleon and the like.  So if you -- if you listen to Putin as opposed to read Putin, you hear a somewhat different explanation of what the election's all about.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Mmm hmm.  OK.</p><p>And on social and political, I can't speak to that as much as I can say, having been part of a round table that Putin was at back in September, before the flip was announced, he was already espousing the modernization program with some forcefulness.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Yeah.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  But that was strictly an economic crowd.</p><p>Masha, the protest movement has been called the -- in the Financial Times, the Jean-Jacques protest movement after the fancy restaurant in Moscow where a number of the protest leader have been known to gather, indicating this is a -- this is a liberal intelligentsia middle-class urban protest movement.  Is that a fair characterization?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  OK.  Well, first of all, Jean-Jacques is not a fancy restaurant.  (Chuckles.)  It's a -- it's a French-style cafe in central Moscow where I've gone for years, working out of that cafe during the day --</p><p>MR. GUFF:  OK.  But it's not (pirozhki ?).</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Yeah, it's not (pirozhki ?), no.</p><p>MS. GUFF:  OK.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  But it's a -- it's this little bistro.</p><p>But I think -- I'm actually kind of angry about all of this coverage portraying the protest movement as the middle-class protests or the Jean-Jacques protests, because I think the only reporters who can write those kinds of stories are reporters who are too lazy to leave Jean-Jacques and actually go out and see what's going on.</p><p>And what's going on is that -- there was actually a poll conducted, commissioned by the organizers, during the December 24th protest on Sakharova.  And a it's fascinating poll, if you read the results.  First of all, it showed that 50 percent of the -- of the people who came to the protest did not learn about the protest from the Internet, right?  Also, only 5 percent of them said that they -- their income allowed them to have whatever they needed, right?  So 95 percent certainly do not identify themselves with the -- as most affluent.  Most people said that they can't afford a car, right?  This is -- this is not a protest of affluence.  This is -- what we found in that poll was really a representative sampling of working-age Muscovites.  And that seems to be the case in other cities as well.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  One qualification of that:  I think the working class is underrepresented here, hardly represented.  The Levada poll that Masha mentioned has 8 percent of people saying they're workers. Contrast that with Tahrir Square.</p><p>And this has been Putin's theme.  He is trying to appeal to the silent majority.  He does not want the protesters to be able to identify themselves as the Russian electorate.  It's not just lazy Western journalists who have done this; this is Putin's strategy is to treat this as a marginal phenomenon.</p><p>But he's not totally wrong about it.  And it's a challenge to the protesters, I think, to broaden their base after the election and pointing forward to other elections to come.  If they want to turn the demonstrations into political movements and parties, they're going to need broader support demographically than they now have.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  So following that logic, are we going to see, post- election, the rise of new parties, the rise of independent candidates after Sunday?  To what extent will we see new faces and new parties?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, you're going to see some new parties, maybe not right away, although some of them are appearing now.</p><p>Prokhorov, the billionaire best known as the -- here as the owner of the New Jersey Nats --</p><p>MR. GUFF:  (Inaudible.)</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  -- has announced that he's going to have some kind of party. It was a little unclear what it is.  He said it would it would be --</p><p>MR. GUFF:  That's the party in -- (inaudible).  That's where he's having his party.  (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  He does like those parties, too, at least as much.  There's talk of Kudrin trying to form a new liberal technocrat party.  That's a great label for a mass movement.  There will be probably be efforts in some of the -- even the current opposition parties to come up with new leadership.  It is not known whether Navalny intends to -- he's the blogger, anti-corruption spokesman -- whether he intends to form a party.</p><p>I think you're going to find a lot of people running in the regional and local elections in the next six months without party affiliation.  It looks as though it will be easier to form parties, but a lot of people will just run on their own.  And that will throw up new figures and new leaders.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Well, actually, I think it's important to state that at this point it's impossible to form a party, right?  I mean there has to be party-law reform in order for people to be able to form parties at all. Medvedev has promised the reform, but Medvedev hasn't really been seen or heard from in a c couple of months, so --</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, there was the first reading of it in the --</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  There was a first reading.  I wouldn't be surprised if it died in the Duma in the spring.  Might not.  Right?  But, I mean it's too early to talk about parties when you still can't form parties.</p><p>But what is happening, and it's happening already, is that people are running in the local elections; you know, the elections that they forgot to cancel, the tiny little municipal elections.  There are people all over Moscow, independent candidates, dozens of them, people that no one had heard of, you know, until about a month ago.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Masha, can we talk about the two Alexeis?  Can we talk about your impressions of Alexei Navalny and Alexei Kudrin, two figures in the opposition right now?</p><p>MS. GESSEN: Right.  I mean, I wouldn't actually call it an opposition.  I think it's a -- again, you know, until we have political institutions, it's kind of not really accurate to talk about the opposition.  There's a protest movement.  And Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption blogger, and Alexei Kudrin, the former finance minister, are interesting figures in the protest movement.</p><p>Kudrin, I think, has great potential as a negotiator if the regime ever decides to negotiate.  In fact, I mean, I think he can be an incredible asset, actually, to both sides.</p><p>Navalny, he is an incredible organizer.  This is somebody who has run a one-person campaign over the last several years exposing corruption in Russian state institutions.  And he's the man who came up with the phrase \"the party of crooks and thieves,\" which is probably the greatest catch phrase in Russian politics in a dozen years.</p><p>He's got the kind of political views that one develops when one comes of age in a political-cultural vacuum.  On the one hand he's kind of nationalist, on the other hand he's a libertarian, and it's not quite clear how these things mix.  What's clear is that he lacks the education, the exposure to actual politics to have formed coherent political views.  I'm sure that it will happen.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  How long can protests go on after the elections?  Is this going to be a ground war?  Monthly?  Quarterly?  How -- one can paint a scenario where Putin is elected, first or second ballot, protests happen, pro-Putin protests, anti-Putin protests.  This is a scenario that could be a war of attrition.  And is there potential for a violent flash point somewhere along the way?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Yes, I think there's potential for -- I mean, I think that that will be the day that the fate of the protest movement, the fate of Russia is decided, is when Putin considers using force and possibly gives an order to use force against the protesters.</p><p>We're getting ominously close to that point actually -- in (advance ?) of Monday's protests until Moscow authorities finally decided to issue a permit for large-scale protest right in the center in Pushkin Square.</p><p>There's a lot of back and forth between local authorities and the Kremlin.  And that seems to be one of the ways in which -- in which this is being regulated.  The -- we saw this at -- with the earlier protests as well.  It was clear that the police on the ground are actually disposed toward cooperation with the protesters, and the brass gets completely different information from a completely different source and has a weirdly warped view of the protest movement.</p><p>Just to give you an example.  On December 24th, the brass thought that  there would be 10,000 people because they had leaked Boris Nemtsov's phone conversations.  And they had -- they assumed that they had discredited the protest movement sufficiently.  The lower-level officers, you know, from colonel on down, knew there would be tens of thousands of people, expected more than a 100,000, and basically did everything that was necessary for effective crowd control.  So (there is ?) that chasm between the police that actually deal with the protesters and the people who are giving them orders.</p><p>At some point or another probably, there's going to be an order to use force, and my big hope is that, at that point, the police refuse to use force.</p><p>We've already seen precedent.  There's the town of Lermontov (ph) in the south of Russia.  A week and a half ago, some local -- the (potential ?) local independent candidates who'd been denied a place on the ballot in the local elections, barricaded themselves in City -- Lermontov (ph) City Hall and declared a hunger strike.  And the police were called and refused to storm the building, and then the SWAT team, the OMON (ph), was called and refused to storm the building.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Drew, I'm a little more skeptical than Masha that Putin is going to give an order to use force because I think this is something that the regime fears as the ultimate discrediting moment, where precisely because soldiers and police may not obey and because they fear the popular reaction, they don't want to go there.</p><p>I think, for a lot of people, the day in which there are, you know, innocent protester -- innocent people -- protesters shot in downtown Moscow is the day that all hell breaks loose, that the regime collapses, that people defect en masse and call for a new order.</p><p>I think that's a -- that's a fear that Putin has.  Putin is not a soldier, and he's not a policeman.  He's a KGB guy, and the KGB tries to manage situations a little bit differently.  I would say he probably looks back on the past couple of months and thinks, you know, I've come out of this better than a lot of people thought.  Looked pretty terrible -- (chuckles) -- first week of December.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Yep.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  But he's managed to stir up his base.  He is probably going to have a, you know, messy-looking victory on Sunday with whatever the margin -- some amount of padding and falsification that will give people something to complain about.  But, all in all, he may well feel pretty confident about his ability to ride this out now, more confident than a couple months ago.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Is what we're seeing a -- almost a natural progression for a system that doesn't have deeply rooted democratic institutions? In other words, this is the only somewhat crude language of the relationship between the government and its people.  Is that what we're seeing?  Is this a natural evolution?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Is the protest movement a natural evolution or is the whole situation -- (inaudible)?</p><p>MR. GUFF:  In Western democracies, people can vote freely in a local election, state election, regional elections, federal elections, and that cycle can turn very quickly.</p><p>Here, we don't have that, and we don't have the institutions backing and traditions backing that.  So is what's happening --</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  We've had big protest movements, and European societies are full of, you know, the history of progress towards democratization coming about through urban violence, intense confrontation between the authorities and the crowds.  So that's not so unusual.</p><p>It's unusual in Europe now because most -- almost all the other countries of the Soviet Communist system have made the transition more peacefully and successfully and without this kind of new line of division being drawn that makes people feel that you -- you know, something outside of elections is necessary in order to move the country forward.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  So one more question before we turn to members for their questions.  Masha, Alessandra Stanley wrote a very interesting piece on Russian -- on the state of Russian television recently for The New York Times.  And she talked about a show on state television on NTV.  And the topic was \"Putin or not Putin?\"  And the interviewer himself was somewhat giddy about the fact that six months ago, it -- that just -- that topic could just not have been discussed.  And even Boris Nemtsov has been in the NTV studios, and he was in wonder that he hadn't been there for five years; now he could go in.</p><p>What's changed?  What's changed in a bigger sense?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  What's changed is that the balance of fear and money and personal connections that hold up this system -- that balance has shifted.  Nobody quite knows what the right amount of fear is anymore. So -- and you can -- you can really see that on television.  Somebody goes out on a limb, shoots a great report on the protest movement. Everybody watches it, is amazed.  Two weeks later, the whole team gets fired.  But then somebody else does the same thing and they don't get fired.  And there's no consistent editorial policy on Russian television, any of it -- you know, all of -- all of it being controlled by the state.  There's no -- there's no apparent consistent editorial policy.  What's striking about it is its incredibly inconsistency, and I think that really spells trouble for the regime.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  If I could just add one sentence, I think that Masha's exactly right, but it -- that's only part of the kind of deeper crisis of the elite.  The elite is shot through with unhappiness with Putin and with Putinism.  And you don't have to -- you don't have to go very far to encounter people who are thinking about different kinds of opposition, who are unhappy with the status quo and ready to do something about it.  All the action is not in the streets.  It is throughout the elite that has benefited from Putinism but just don't any longer see that this is a guy who can lead the country forward.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  OK.  Great.</p><p>So on that note, we will -- in true council fashion, we will end on time at 2:30.  We've got approximately 30 minutes for questions from members.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Q:  Thank you for a very interesting -- oh, Kati Marton.  Thank you for a very interesting conversation.  Could you two address Putin and Moscow's foreign policy?  Which seems to plunge us back into the Cold War -- their willingness to exercise a veto at the U.N., their willingness to basically encourage Assad to do a Chechnya in Syria. What does this mean going forward?  What does it mean for our foreign policy?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, what Russian officials say is, oh, look, this is just the campaign season; we have a lot of silliness like this in all countries, and don't pay too much attention to it.  There's surely something to that.</p><p>On the other hand, we have -- we've experienced Putin's kind of anti-American rhetoric before.  It does seem to be something he keeps coming back to and to feel.</p><p>On the question of Syria, there is -- there are all kinds of commercial explanations for why he has taken such a tough line.  But I think the one that he feels is, it is not right for the world to be run in such a way that a bunch of governments can tell some country whether or not they can put down demonstrations and put down opposition.</p><p>He resists that idea and doesn't want to subscribe to it.  And he's found with the Chinese one of his few allies on that issue.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  And Steve, can you also address what you think the state of the reset will be after the elections?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, again, the foreign ministry line -- maybe more hopeful than completely realistic -- is, after the elections, we'll just -- we'll try to put things back together again.  They probably underestimate a little bit of the damage that's been done by the drawing of lines on issues like Syria in particular.  When you've got the secretary of state calling Russian actions \"despicable,\" you've gone pretty far down the road toward saying we just see the world differently.</p><p>My guess is Putin wants to patch things up in some -- in some way.  Every new Russian president -- new Russian or Soviet leader of the past 25 years has begun by wanting to have a good relationship with the United States.  And I think you could -- you could make the case for why Putin does.  He may, for domestic reasons, think that a tougher line is -- needs to be continued longer.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Good.  Yes.</p><p>Q:  Thanks.  Ted Schell.  Do you think -- how do you think Putin views his legacy?  Or does his -- does he think in terms of what his legacy will be?  And if so, how do you think that will shape the next six years?  How does he want to be remembered?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  I don't think he plans to have a legacy.  I think he actually plans to run Russia forever.  (Laughter.)</p><p>Q:  (Off mic.)</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Well, actually, no.  I mean, one of the distinguishing characteristics of this man and of his government is this incredibly short horizon that they have.  I mean, they really do not plan past tomorrow.  And his -- he has made that very clear in his actions.  And I'm perfectly serious:  I don't think he plans to have a legacy.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Does he tell himself that -- whether it's forever or as long as I can get up in the morning -- that he is the author of the stability without which Russia cannot exist?  I think he probably does have a narrative for himself that is not quite as -- that is not purely, I want to be president so that I can continue to amass a great fortune and have people -- now every Western journalist seems to have this story of somebody putting on a sport coat,  Is there no one -- for him as he enters the restaurant.  Is there no one that's ever seen a Western leader get helped on with a sport coat?</p><p>MR.    :  (Inaudible) -- off the sport coat.</p><p>MR.    : He likes -- he likes the -- he likes the perks, but I think he's got a grander sense of himself that he is the indispensable guy.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Sure.  No, that's true.</p><p>Q:  Ralph Buultjens, New York University.  The impression one gets from your comments is that this is a situation waiting to explode, that Putin is on the brink, doesn't quite know which way to go.  But is it not possible that Putin has some real strength among the Russian people and that there are a lot of support for Putin's policies and that it's not really as bad as you make it sound?  Could you assess Putin's strength, actual strength?</p><p>MR.   :  Do you want to --</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, I -- when I said that the silent majority, when I gave that -- gave his strategy that Nixonian name, I meant to suggest that he does have some support.  And in fact, a lot of people who are unhappy with Putin now give him a lot of credit. There is -- some of the opposition is just people who hated him from the very beginning.  But a lot of them have thought he contributed something real to the country, that stabilization after the '90s, but he just -- he's a spent force, can no longer contribute anything and, in fact, is holding the country back.</p><p>And you could say that there is this -- and I don't want to give it a number -- the swing factor in Russian politics and in the Russian electorate and Russian opinion is among those people who used to be supporters and who have a certain appreciation of what he's done but have just figured this has played out.</p><p>You see that in the growth of disapproval of Putin, which -- people who say they've had no -- they don't have confidence in Putin was at only 8 percent in 2008.  This is one of these questionable polls, but this organization tells an interesting story.  That group, people who don't have confidence in Putin, has tripled in that period.  It's gone to 24 percent.  That's a significant minority that makes it difficult for -- if mobilized, will make it difficult for Putin to run the country as he has.</p><p>MS. GESSEN: I would add -- I agree with everything that Steve just said.  I would also add that a lot of the support that Putin does have is based on fear, just like everything else.  And fear is something that has been an integral part of his platform the entire time that he has led the country.  The message is basically, if not Putin, then everything will fall apart.  That is also an unpredictable factor.  I mean, fear just has a way of evaporating at some point.</p><p>Q:  (Off mic.)</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  I'm sorry?</p><p>Q:  Or increasing.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Or increasing.  Right.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Carroll.</p><p>Q:  Hi.  I'm Carroll Bogert from Human Rights Watch.  In Putin's last presidential campaign essay that he published on Monday in Moskovskie Novosti, he uses what I think is a new term, which is \"illegal soft power.\"  And it seems to be a kind of ominous term referring to Western support, for example, for NGOs inside Russia. There are two schools of thought that I've heard about what Putin will do about civil society post-election.  One is that he will recognize this protest movement and see that he must accommodate in some ways a new Russia in order to govern successfully, and the other is that the gloves will come off and he will crush everyone.</p><p>What do you think, Masha?  is Russian civil society crushable? There's been a huge growth in nongovernmental organizations inside Russia in the Medvedev years.  Can it be crushed?</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Well, it always depends on the amount of force that he's willing to use.  I have to say I certainly don't believe in the Putin-recognizes-civil-society scenario.  There was an indication back in December that there was the idea of playing out -- again, playing the Medvedev part and the Putin part, where Medvedev would sort of coddle civil society and play to that audience, and Putin would continue to play to his audience.  That scenario seems to have been given up with the appearance of Moluzin (ph) as the -- sort of the main puppet master in the Kremlin.</p><p>But obviously, organizations -- it's possible to shut down organizations.  It's possible to intimidate a lot of people into doing less.  I don't think at this point that the protest movement can be crushed by anything but brute force.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Masha has said something important in another conversation about what Putin's strategy has been so far, and it's neither of the ones that you mentioned, Carroll, and that is imitation.  There is a -- there has been a tremendous mobilization of civil society in opposition to Putinism.  Putin is in the process of generating his reaction formation to that, the rival groups, and I think that has considerable potential to produce confrontation, to actually divide the society in a, you know, way that risks violence.</p><p>The most obvious example of this has been this dispute about where the rallies could be held on Sunday -- on Monday, with Navalny saying, we're going to Lubyanka Square, where the other guys have been given the permit.  Well, you know, there you see the competing civil societies (ready to fight ?) with each other.</p><p>MS. GESSEN: Oh, I saw those competing civil societies first-hand. It wasn't just Navalny saying, we're going where the other guys were given a permit.  Basically, the two groups -- well, actually, the protesters showed up to file their application for a permit the night before, because if our application is not filed by 8:00 in the morning the day that they begin accepting applications, at 8:01 there will be a different application in there.</p><p>So there's a group of people who showed up the night before to spend the night at the -- in the mayor's office, and then a group of Nashis showed up and started shoving people away from the door, and there was -- there was an actual brawl.  Several people had to have medical care.  I mean, yeah, it's that sort of thing.  And then eventually the Nashi got in -- got in a little bit before 8:00 and got their permit before the anti-Putin protest movement representatives were even allowed to enter the building.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  That kind of confrontation and violence gives Putin an opportunity to say he's restoring stability, imposing peace, bringing the country back from the precipice.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  There's been a lot of talk about Russian NGOs.  Could you just, Steve, say a few words about what's been written in the Russian press about instituting more Russian NGOs?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  You mean, about delegitimizing foreign ones? Or are you --</p><p>MR. GUFF:  No, no --</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  No?</p><p>MR. GUFF:  -- actually as a sort of counterpart or -- instituting NGOs -- Russian-based NGOs a la Western NGOs, in other words, the -- you know, the purely domestic version of NGOs to perform (civil ?) functions that government cannot perform itself.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Yeah, then -- that's a -- that's the sort of the depoliticized version of civil society --</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Right.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  -- that Putin completely approves of, you know, where you're finding organic solutions to society's ills.  But this is a different kind of civil society that Putin is -- seems to be generating, this -- the rival street movements, and that's more dangerous.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  OK.</p><p>Esther.</p><p>Q:  Esther Dyson.  I'm -- it's completely unpredictable what's going to happen in the next couple of years.  What I'm curious about is whether you think it's more predictable what will be the case after 20 years.  In other words, Putin, the NGOs, the fake NGOs -- how much do they really matter in the sweep of the actual Russian people, demographics?  Is the Russian Party still going to be a part of Russia?  Just speculate a little farther out.  And you may think that I'm wrong, that it matters terribly what happens with Putin in the next year, but maybe it doesn't.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  I haven't even thought that far.</p><p>You know, we don't have a habit of thinking that far ahead in Russia.  I do, actually, think it's terribly important what happens, not just in the next couple of years, but in the next couple of months.  And I think the trajectory of the country's development will, in many ways, be determined in the next couple of months.  So it all depends on what happens in the couple of months.  (Chuckles.)</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, I would -- I agree that how this confrontation between Putinism and the people or the popular -- the protesters that are mobilized is important.  I'm not sure it's just in the next couple of months that the -- that the decisive moments will occur.  But I do think that crises do then shape what comes afterwards because people are reacting against what they've seen.  The whole course of Putinism was really a reaction to the '90s.  And so what we have over the next couple of years is going to produce some kind of reaction to that.</p><p>And -- or -- that is if it doesn't open up new possibilities for, you know, a different kind of more participatory, pluralist, rule-of- law system, if it doesn't succeed.  And I -- so I think that how the two sides handle this will create -- will determine the crisis that people look back on in the way that they look back on the '90s.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  I will add some of those big arc-of-history questions that we will see or are likely to see, given how slow growth is in Europe and the U.S.:  The new prediction is that by 2018 Russia becomes a larger economy than Germany, and the Internet market is already bigger in Russia than it is in any European country.</p><p>So, you know, the two largest tech Internet companies are Russian today.  So -- and you know one of them very well, sitting on the board.  So these -- these are some of the facts that may sweep aside some of the smaller skirmishes going on on a political level if Russia keeps its economic, you know, wheels on the wagon.</p><p>Q:  Tim Frye.  Steve, I think you're exactly right that one of the stories that's been under-reported is the extent to which, among the elite groups, there's also a lot of dissatisfaction with Putin. And we've seen Kudrin come out from under his previous position.  Do you think there will be others to follow his example?  And in the future going forward, what would it take to see some shift among the elites that would cause a real change in Putin's strategy?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Well, I think you can imagine defections from the elite taking place both in response to liberalization and to repression -- liberalization because there are going to be more opportunities for party formation, I would predict.  I think this law will go forward.  It will be easier to form parties.  It will be easier to form blocs of parties in elections.</p><p>And I think it's going to be harder for Putin precisely because of the reason Masha mentions, lack of fear, to keep people from supporting those parties.  You've got a pent-up demand within the elite for vehicles to express their political interests.  And I think Putin is going to find it difficult to resist that.  Repression will produce the same result, though.  I think you will find an accelerated -- accelerated defection from the elite if there is repression.  It will really crack up in a visible way, so that it won't be under- reported any longer.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Padma.</p><p>Q:  Thank you.  I'm Padma Desai, Harriman professor at Columbia. I want to bring in some -- your judgment on economic issues, if I may. Despite the protests in Moscow and despite Syria and despite the anti- American electioneering, the rhetoric, as the newly elected President Putin settles down is it possible that economic cooperation between us and them may (come ?) more, in the sense that we need to export to Russia?  Our economic growth is very weak and fragile.  Our exports to Russia in 2011 were $8 billion, in comparison to our exports to China of $100 billion.</p><p>MR. GUFF (?): Just ahead of the Dominican Republic -- (inaudible).</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH (?): (Inaudible) -- Peru.</p><p>Q:  That's one number.  And they need our investment and our investors to beef up their infrastructure and all that.  I mean, how important are -- I mean, can't we just put behind all this talk about the protests and everything and talk about economic collaboration and the prospects for that under <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>once more?</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH (?):  I try never to have an opinion about Russian economics without first checking with Padma Desai, so I hesitate to answer a question that I figure must have a trick in it. (Laughter.)  But Padma, what I would say is the obstacle to -- the reason I kind of challenge the premise of your question is I don't think the obstacles to the kind of increased economic interaction that you describe are the ones you describe.</p><p>It's not protests in the streets.  It's not Syria.  It's not -- it's not anything other than the sheer difficulty of doing business in Russia.  If you had to pick one big, big, obstacle, and if you ask American businessmen what that obstacle is, it's -- you know, this is a system that is deeply, deeply corrupt, hard to do business in.</p><p>And so the area where you need to see progress -- and this is what a lot of Putin's critics have said -- is in corruption, rule of law, you know, the traditional agenda of modernizers.  They are talking about measures that will actually do exactly what you said.</p><p>Without that, I kind of wonder whether you'll actually be able to benefit both sides in the way you're talking about.</p><p>Q:  (Inaudible) -- and everything is worse than in China, India, elsewhere?  (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  You know, I can tell you that around the U.S.- Russia Business Council round table, CEOs are asked how they're doing. And most around the table will tell you that their profits and profit margins in Russia are better than they are in most other emerging markets, certainly better than in China.  And with Russia's entry into the WTO, Russia is not a great economic competitor of the U.S.;  It's a natural trading partner.</p><p>So products and services that Russia exports -- very different than what they will import from Microsoft and Cisco and Intel, et cetera.  I mean, there probably won't be a Russian Intel or a Russian Cisco.  There are Chinese -- you know, Huawei is a great competitor and finding a hard time getting into the U.S. as a -- as a -- as a direct competitor to a U.S. flagship technology company.</p><p>So I think that natural relationship, given the WTO entrance, is probably only going to increase most Silicon Valley and big tech companies.  They've already formed big groups to come over, organized -- U.S. trade rep's office is putting more people in Moscow.  Chamber of Commerce is putting three more people in Moscow specifically to address it.</p><p>So I think the WTO entry is going to change a lot.  And again, I think those wheels turn almost independent of what's going on politically.  And the bigger the relationship gets and the bigger the economy gets, the easier it is for some of these criticisms to get brushed aside.</p><p>Q:  Byron Wien, Blackstone.  Just building on this economic issue, you know, people refer to the emerging markets as the BRICs -- Brazil, Russia, India and China.  But in terms of valuation, considering the economic strength and growth of Russia, the valuations are low, and they're low because of the rule-of-law issue and the -- and they're low because of the political risk.  Does Putin care about that?  Does he really want Russia to be a more formidable force among the BRICS?</p><p>MR. GUFF:  I'll just -- before you start --</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH (?):  Yeah, go.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  -- point out on the issue of valuations, the market is -- has low valuations compared to the rest also because the big-cap companies are extractive industry companies, and they trade at much lower P/E multiples and EBITDA multiples than a Procter &amp; Gamble does in higher value-added consumer products.  So it's a -- it's a big anchor on the -- on the P/E of the market, in addition to those issues.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  I guess the only thing I'd add to that -- the other person I try not to have an opinion about the Russian economy without consulting is Drew Guff, so you know, we're well-served here.</p><p>Putin may figure that, you know, valuation is something that might be important if I'm going to be trading now, but I'm going to be holding -- (chuckles) -- these assets for 20 to 40 years, the valuation problem will correct itself as long as I hold onto it.</p><p>And that's sort of -- that has been a kind of underlying theme of the resurgence of state capitalism there is these are undervalued assets that foreigners have been able to get, and we don't want that. We want to restore control and -- so that, you know, 20, 40 years down the road, these will be an addition to Russian wealth -- to Russians' wealth.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  And those consumer product companies that are listed on the market trade at -- Esther (sp), what's Yandex's P/E?  It's unapproachable; it's a 50 P/E.  So when you do have those rare companies that do make it to a kind of global status in consumer products, given that supply demand, they're often more expensive than their Western counterpart.</p><p>Q:  And in more transparent sectors of the economy.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Run by younger entrepreneurs and younger managers who are out on the streets, generally demonstrating after they have coffee at Jean-Jacques.  (Laughter.)</p><p>We have time for one more question before we -- before we wrap up.</p><p>Q:  Steve Hellman (sp).  A quick electoral -- back to the electoral politics, the discussion has a bit of a sour-grapes tone to it, some measure.  Is there a politician -- is there any name that you can think of that would beat <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin </nameText></person>in an open election?  And the other side of that question would be under the circumstances, if you were sitting where he's sitting, would you just let the election play itself out, have it be completely fair and square, maybe even lose on the first ballot and go ahead and win in triumph and put the whole thing behind you?</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Do you want to --</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Sure.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  Go ahead.  (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  We've had 12 years of the systematic destruction of democratic institutions, the independent media, the judiciary and public space in general.  In those circumstances, you can't have politicians.  You can't have politicians in the absence of politics.</p><p>So it's no surprise that you can't point to a single figure and say, this person could beat Putin.  Nobody has the resources, including the name recognition that's needed to beat Putin, because Putin has created the system that way, right, which is why the protest movement is not a political movement; it's a movement for political institutions.  It's a movement for fair elections, for the institutions that could bring us fair elections, but not for any particular politician because we don't actually have the politicians yet.</p><p>Now, if I were Putin, would I let the election play out?  Sure, if I were Putin, I -- but I wouldn't be Putin, right?  (Laughter.) And then the thing about Putin's decisions on how to conduct this election is how it relates to what happened December 4th and in the aftermath of December 4th, right?  There is a very strong sense in Putin's circle that they has -- they had mismanaged the democracy, right?  They had a managed democracy, and they had mismanaged it. They had allowed too much unrest, too much protest, and look what it turned into.  And -- which is why Sidikov (ph) was fired and (Voloshin ?) was brought in to manage the democracy better, give less freedom, you know, not play those silly games with second rounds of the election and that sort of thing, just in a safer way so that the democracy is properly managed.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  I agree with that, but I think you can also imagine this election having turned out somewhat differently, with the players who were able to pursue a strategy that says, look, you don't like any one of us necessarily better than Putin, but we're offering you a government of national unity, and do you like that better? Putin did not have to worry about that, having chosen his opponents, essentially.  He knew that none of those people were able to pursue that strategy or present themselves to the people in those terms.</p><p>But there are new leaders in the Communist Party, in the Just Russia Party, even among nationalists, who do have the potential to step forward, and they are actually -- were kept out of -- kept out of this race.  If you'd had an opportunity for lots of people to get in and not -- and no interference by the Kremlin in the way the candidates were chosen, you could have ended up with an unpredictable situation in which the choice that people made was not Putin.</p><p>Putin doesn't like circumstances like that.  (Chuckles.)  He doesn't take a lot of chances.  He wants to -- I don't know how he envisions things going forward six, 12 years, but for now he's kind of stuck with what he's got.  He thinks he can surely win a majority.  He doesn't want it to be too narrow a majority because he knows people are going to say, well, it was falsified.  So he's got to have it -- it's got to run up a bit.  He's got to run up the score, but he can't look as though it's hopelessly falsified.  He is facing a day-after prospect that is partly the result of what he's done, in which he's -- it's going to be hard for him to make this victory look good, maybe even harder than it has to be given that -- the core support that he has among significant sectors of the -- of the Russian population.</p><p>It's a -- we're looking at a prospect, I think, of political turbulence and of delegitimized government increasing over the next couple of years.</p><p>MR. GUFF:  OK.</p><p>Well, we did our hard stop.  I want to thank -- if we could show our panelists -- (applause).</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Drew, can I say one thing, in case you forget?</p><p>MR. GUFF:  OK.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  There are books for sale outside.  (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. GUFF:  That's right.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Thank you.</p><p>MR. SESTANOVICH:  Masha, good luck with -- good luck with your book.</p><p>MS. GESSEN:  Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-20120302t7597</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5546-GVJ1-DY7X-Y2TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Federal News Service, Inc.

In a matter of weeks, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the 2020 presidential election. It will be a unique experience, with fewer people casting votes in person, and those who do wearing masks and maintaining social distance.    Even before Covid-19, the stakes for this election were high.  In 2016, Russia deployed disinformation tactics on social media, infiltrated voter registration databases, and breached campaign systems to undermine the electoral process. Reeling from foreign interference in that election, federal and state governments have spent much of the past 4 years preparing defenses for 2020.     This year, intelligence professionals expect Iran and China to join Russia in their interference efforts. S ome researchers also cite the growing threat of domestic political groups leveraging disinformation to affect the outcome of the vote.     Aware of the threats, Congress has granted states more than $800M in funding to improve election security. Furthermore, in 2018, the US Cyber Command initiated a new strategy to proactively disrupt foreign cyber threats and harden government systems. In partnership with the NSA, these endeavors reportedly thwarted a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d to compromise the 2018 midterm elections.     The battle to ensure US election integrity persists. In this report, we examine the risk, potential impacts, and solutions for 11 vulnerability points in the upcoming election.      Table of contents  Disinformation    Disinformation is the use of false information to mislead or deceive.  Purveyors of disinformation typically aim to erode faith in institutions like the media and government, sow discord among different groups, or change public perception of specific figures, countries, ideas, etc.    Online platforms like YouTube and Facebook enable the efficient creation and distribution of disinformation, while artificial intelligence (AI) tech fuels its effectiveness, allowing the use of deepfakes \u2014 hyperrealistic artificially generated media \u2014 and bots.    Risk level: High   Disinformation is a threat with a proven track record, having played a role in the 2016 US presidential election.    Highlighting the imminent risk to the November 2020 elections, National Counterintelligence and Security Center director William Evanina has stated ,     \u201c[F]oreign nations continue to use influence measures in social and traditional media in an effort to sway US voters\u2019 preferences and perspectives, to shift US policies, to increase discord and to undermine confidence in our democratic process.\u201d   Impact: Unknown   An investigation by a US Senate committee into 2016 efforts to influence the presidential election found no evidence suggesting voter tallies were changed or manipulated.      While there is no clear causal link between disinformation and voting behavior, concern about the proliferation of disinformation is well-founded. A 2018 study by MIT\u2019s Media Lab found that false information spread faster on Twitter than the truth:     \u201cFalse news reached more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1,000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1,000 people.\u201d    This virality has been evident in the spread of Covid-19-related disinformation \u2014 a potential harbinger of what is to come in November. An April 2020 poll by Pew Research found that more than 60% of Americans were exposed to news about the virus that seemed completely made up.   Cyber defenses: companies aim to spot bots &amp; deepfakes and improve media quality   To defend against disinformation, federal and local governments are aiming to educate the public about this threat. The federal government has also made moves to disrupt foreign actors\u2019 malicious activities.     Online platforms and startups also have a role to play in mitigating the spread of false information.     Technology companies \u2014 specifically Google , Twitter , and Facebook \u2014 have enacted measures to prevent the type of abuse that took place on their platforms during the 2016 presidential election.     To identify and remove false information, some companies employ content moderators, which, in the case of Facebook, number around 15,000 and are mostly contractors.    Others also use artificial intelligence technology.  Google built a dataset of deepfakes to support researchers\u2019 attempts to construct deepfake detection tools. Facebook joined with Microsoft and Amazon to sponsor a deepfake detection challenge in 2019-2020.    To promote factual information, Google, Facebook, and Twitter have donated more than $100M to outside fact-checking and journalism organizations since March 2020. These companies also joined or created initiatives (such as the News Integrity Initiative and Google News Initiative) to support quality journalism through investments, training, and partnerships. Facebook and Twitter both provide verified resources on voting in the 2020 election.    Startups tackling the challenge of disinformation are also seeking to identify bots and false information, as well as to raise awareness of the threat and promote media literacy.     Yonder and Astroscreen detect false information on online platforms. Yonder uses machine learning algorithms to monitor online conversations, while Astroscreen analyzes Twitter account behavior to identify bots.     NewsGuard  seeks to inform the public\u2019s consumption of information by providing a browser extension that indicates the quality of news sources found online. Quality scores are based on the news source\u2019s trust ratings.   Political campaigns\u2019 systems     Campaigns are often run by a small, full-time staff working with a large number of volunteers, who help with fundraising, messaging, events, and more. Members of these groups often have access to sensitive information about candidates and lists of potential voters and donors.     An attack on a campaign\u2019s IT infrastructure can disrupt operations and release confidential information regarding candidates and their supporters.   Risk level: High   There is a precedent for this kind of threat. I n 2016 , hackers used a spear-phishing campaign to infiltrate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s email and release the collected information to the public.    With regard to the 2020 election cycle , in 2019, Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence team identified similar malicious actions by foreign agents, stating, \u201cWe are seeing activity by the same Russian actors that we saw target 2016 and 2018.\u201d   Impact: High   The release of sensitive information to the public can alter public perception and influence voting behavior. Further, the disclosure gives opposing candidates and campaigns an advantage by revealing strategies and messaging.     Infiltration of a campaign\u2019s systems can also imperil operations such as fundraising, logistics, and communications.   Cyber defenses: Cybersecurity advisory services   Political campaigns are increasingly aware of the cyber threats they face, but many still struggle with the same challenges: a reluctance to share threat information, limited budgets, and a transitory volunteer workforce.      Several nonprofit organizations, including Defending Digital Campaigns and US Cyberdome, offer cybersecurity advisory services and vendor solutions for free or at reduced costs to campaigns. In March 2020, US Cyberdome created a threat information sharing network for political campaigns.    In 2019, the Federal Elections Commission granted Defending Digital Campaigns special approval to provide cybersecurity services to congressional and presidential campaigns. Since then, the organization has developed an ecosystem of cybersecurity partners offering free or discounted services.     The solutions available to campaigns cover a range of defenses, from email to cloud to endpoint protection.      Voter registration systems    In every state except for North Dakota, voters must register to vote. These records are managed at the state level and typically include a voter\u2019s name, address, date of birth, and other identifying information.     While this decentralized system makes a nationwide attack more difficult, it also expands the attack surface. Each state updates its voter records with numerous sources, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, online registration websites, and local officials\u2019 computers.    If hackers manage to access these voter registration systems, they can alter, delete, or lock down records, causing confusion on election day and harming the integrity of electoral results.   Risk level: High   In the 2016 US presidential election, Russian hackers probed at least 18 state voter registration databases . In some of these states, they managed to access voter registration systems, placing them in a position to alter the information.     While there\u2019s no evidence to suggest hackers made changes to these databases, they likely gained a significant amount of information on state IT systems and security practices. This knowledge could place the US at risk of foreign interference as it heads into the November 2020 elections.     Hackers also frequently target state and local governments with ransomware. These attacks lock entities out of their systems with encryption, at which point hackers demand payment to provide a key to unlock them. Since 2019, local and state governments have experienced over 200 ransomware attacks .   impact: Moderate   Altering or locking voter registration databases with ransomware could create confusion and impact voters\u2019 ability to participate in elections. However, executing this attack at scale would be a challenge.    Meaningful changes to voter records are easier to detect, and state systems are isolated and unique, making widespread attacks more difficult. Furthermore, most databases are backed up, and the provisional balloting process in most states allows individuals to vote even if an administrative error leaves them off the voter rolls.     That said, if there is evidence of voter registration database manipulation, it could jeopardize the legitimacy of election outcomes, resulting in uncertainty.    Cyber defenses: sensors for early detection and data backup solutions   States and the federal government have taken numerous steps since 2016 to improve voter registration databases. They\u2019ve allocated funding for the issue, modernized systems, established processes for communicating threats, and hired additional cybersecurity personnel to focus on elections.     At least 36 states have worked with the Center for Internet Security, a not-for-profit IT security company, to add network intrusion sensors (known as Albert sensors) that detect and report malicious activity on networks. Early detection shortens state and federal authority response times, limiting hackers\u2019 ability to impact voter registration databases.    To protect the sensitive information housed in voter registration databases from ransomware attacks and ensure availability, states should also consider data backup solutions. When databases are frequently updated from online sources, they also require frequent syncing to backup solutions. Cohesity , Druva , and Rubrik provide such solutions, ensuring data availability during disasters such as ransomware attacks.   Voting machines    Though an unusually large portion of the voting in November is expected to occur through the mail, voting machines will still collect a meaningful share of votes cast. These voting machines provide voters with a list of candidates, record their selections, and tally votes.    Many voting machines are digital and thus vulnerable to manipulation . While state governments are working to replace vulnerable machines, many will still be used in November 2020.     An attack on these machines could impact an electoral outcome by manipulating vote tallies or altering the ballot to deceive voters.   Risk level: Moderate   At the 2019 information security DefCon conference, hackers tested and successfully breached the security of 100 different voting machines certified for use in at least one US jurisdiction.      Furthermore, a Senate Committee report looking into election infrastructure following the 2016 election found:    \u201cAging voting equipment, particularly voting machines that had no paper record of votes, were vulnerable to exploitation by a committed adversary. Despite the focus on this issue since 2016, some of these vulnerabilities remain.\u201d   Impact: Moderate   The decentralization of America\u2019s voting system insulates it from a widescale attack on its voting machines. Nevertheless, a mere few precincts can have an outsized impact on the election result, making their voting machines especially important to secure.     Further, if posted online, evidence of the successful tampering of voting machines, even at a small scale, could cast doubt on election results.   Cyber defenses: updating machines and verifying votes   Many states are replacing older voting machines and those that do not produce a paper copy of the results. These paperless machines prohibit a paper audit, which analyzes a sample of the votes to verify the electronic results. The Brennan Center estimates that only 12% of votes will be cast on paperless machines in 2020, down from 20% in 2016.    Further, Microsoft piloted its open-source ElectionGuard product in a local election in Wisconsin in early 2020. The product does not fix the numerous challenges associated with voting machines, but instead provides voters with a means of verifying their vote. By printing 2 copies of the vote \u2014 one for the ballot box and one for the voter \u2014 it allows voters to identify discrepancies that would indicate an issue with the machine.     ElectionGuard, which leverages homomorphic encryption to ensure security and anonymity, will not be ready for the 2020 elections. Nevertheless, its approach to the challenge highlights the importance of having a verifiable record of votes.   Candidate personal accounts       If campaigns for political office were a business, then candidates would be the product. For candidates, this may blur the lines between personal and public life and the technologies that support both.     Candidates often prioritize security for work email and applications while neglecting personal email and social media accounts. Unsecured personal accounts, however, represent a threat to elections, especially when the public does not discriminate between a candidate\u2019s personal and public accounts or remarks.     Hackers targeting a candidate\u2019s personal accounts could capture and release sensitive information as well as impersonate the candidate on social media or in other communications.   Risk level: Moderate   In July 2020, a hack of Twitter resulted in the hijacking of several high-profile figures\u2019 accounts, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, and businessman Elon Musk. The attacks serve as a proof of concept of taking over accounts and using them for malicious purposes.     Since 2016, several instances of phishing attacks \u2014 impersonations, often conducted via email, to deliver malware or solicit information \u2014 against political candidates have surfaced. Microsoft\u2019s VP of customer security and trust, Tom Burt , has highlighted how his team identified 3 phishing attacks against candidates running for office in 2018.   Impact: Moderate   Access to a candidate\u2019s personal accounts represents a multi-sided threat: It allows hackers to collect and disclose information publicly or to rival candidates; use information to access other sensitive systems; or impersonate a candidate.     In all these instances, the potential to damage a candidate\u2019s public perception represents a threat to a fair election.    Cyber defenses: email security and deeper authentication   To support high-risk individuals, Google launched its Advanced Protection Program as an extension of its popular email service. The solution provides an added layer of security to personal email accounts by limiting third-party access to email and requiring physical security keys for authentication.     Multi-factor authentication \u2014 where a second source of identification (such as a code sent via phone or email) is required to access an application or account \u2014 dramatically reduces the risk to personal account hacking.    However, hackers can intercept these authentication messages. A physical key (like a USB, Smart Card, etc.) such as those offered by Yubico eliminates this threat, removing the opportunity to intercept authentication messages.    Companies such as LastPass also offer protection to individuals by using encrypted password managers that support advanced two-factor authentication (e.g. fingerprint and face ID). Both Yubico and LastPass offer their services through Defending Digital Campaigns.    Election systems vendors    Local and federal governments rely on vendors to execute and support elections, from communications via email, to machines for vote collection, to election websites. Some vendors play a larger role than others: For example, a single vendor provides a system that more than 60% of Americans use to vote.         Source: Cisco    An attack on these vendors or one of their many suppliers could hamper election processes or result in the loss of sensitive information.    Risk level: Moderate   A report by the FBI found that Russian hackers breached a US election software provider in 2016. Posing as the same vendor, these hackers sent more than 100 spear-phishing emails to election administrators in several Florida counties.     Election management vendors with low margins, limited federal oversight, and high barriers to entry face complaints of severely under-investing in cybersecurity .    In 2017, for instance, a California-sponsored security audit of Election Systems and Software (ES&amp;S), an election management vendor, uncovered multiple vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to manipulate operating system configurations, even to the point of erasing votes .   Impact: Moderate   Vendors support critical portions of the election process and often have access to personally identifiable information, making them sizable points of failure. In a highly concentrated market where just 3 companies (including ES&amp;S) account for more than 90% of the US voting equipment, an attack on a vendor could cause significant disruption.     Cyber defenses: vulnerability disclosures &amp; Testing   In 2020, ES&amp;S announced a vulnerability disclosure program . This announcement follows a long history of election equipment and software vendors shunning vulnerability testing and disclosure activities.     Synack , a crowdsourced vulnerability testing platform, will support the program. This initiative follows on Synack\u2019s push into election security, which began in 2018 with its Secure the Election program . Reaching out to each state\u2019s Secretary of State, the company offered pro bono crowdsourced security testing of their election systems.     Crowdsourced vulnerability platforms such as those offered by Synack, HackerOne , and Bugcrowd can identify vulnerabilities in election technology before malicious actors have the chance to exploit them.   Election administrators     More than 10,000 local administration officials execute election processes, from the storing and testing of voting machines to the tabulation of results. Chief among their responsibilities is the transfer of information from the polls to state officials.     An attack on these administration officials and the systems they rely on could hamper voting, the tallying of results, or the transfer of these results.   Risk level: Moderate   A 2020 study by cybersecurity company Area 1 Security found that just over half of election administrators have \u201conly rudimentary\u201d technologies to protect against phishing attacks.     Hackers employed phishing attacks in 2016 with some success, breaching 2 county elections\u2019 systems in Florida and gaining access to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman\u2019s email.   Impact: Moderate   With phishing attacks, email serves as the entrance to a user or corporation\u2019s systems and data, placing electoral systems at risk.     Phishing success rates, however, are often in the single digits. Smaller jurisdictions are most susceptible, and with the patchwork of electoral systems across the country, the impact of such an attack could be contained.   Cyber defenses: PRIVILEGED access MANAGEMENT   Anti-phishing tools flag or redirect malicious emails, closing the door to hackers. Privileged access management solutions, meanwhile, limit the damage a hacker can do from within the network by controlling access to data and systems.     Area 1 Security and Agari are 2 anti-phishing companies providing their services at no cost or reduced cost through the Defending Digital Campaigns initiative. Centrify , a privileged access management provider, has offered its solution to the US Election Boards at a 50% discount through its \u201c Secure the Vote 2020\u201d initiative .    In addition to support from the private sector, federal agencies and state officials have worked to increase election administrators\u2019 awareness of security threats, develop reporting processes, and improve cybersecurity training over the past 4 years.    For example, Texas now  requires all employees with access to the Statewide Voter Registration and Election Management System to complete annual security training. The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) supports these efforts by providing training materials  to state and local agencies.    State and local websites     State and local governments provide important information about how and where to vote in the days leading up to an election. This information, along with electoral results, is often hosted on government or news websites.    Hackers attacking the web assets of local governments and the media could provide false information or prevent important logistical information from reaching potential voters.   Risk level: Moderate   In 2018, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack took the Knox County Election Commission website offline during a local election in Tennessee. The website was used to provide the public with the election results.     Research by cybersecurity firm McAfee found that the majority of county and county election administration websites in 13 battleground states lacked security measures such as secure https encryption or a . gov validation. These shortcomings make website impersonation even easier for hackers.   Impact: Low   Manipulating or taking down government websites supporting elections could sow confusion and impact voter turnout. Such attacks could also cast doubt on the integrity of the election.     That said, with alternative means of communication available (such as media, social media, and other government websites) and a decentralized voting system, an attack limited to electoral websites is unlikely to meaningfully impact the electoral outcome on a widespread level.      Cyber defenses: free website security services   With often limited budgets and IT resources, many election jurisdictions lack the tools to secure their web assets properly.    Recognizing this need, Cloudflare , a website security company, announced its Athenian Project in 2018. This initiative provides Cloudflare\u2019s security products \u2014 web application firewall, DDoS protection, and website analytics \u2014 for free to state and local governments. As of December 2019, 156 local or state websites in 26 states had taken advantage of the offering.     Through its Jigsaw subsidiary, Google created Project Shield , a free service that protects the websites of human rights, news, and election monitoring organizations. Project Shield filters malicious traffic to keep sites up and running.   Critical infrastructure    CISA defines critical infrastructure as the physical and virtual assets, systems, and networks that \u201car e considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, [or] national public health or safety.\u201d    Critical infrastructure spans 16 sectors and, in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security added election infrastructure to the list of government facilities.        Source: CISA    A cyber attack on America\u2019s critical infrastructure \u2014 such as power grids or transport systems \u2014 on election day could reduce voter turnout, incapacitate voting systems or facilities, and diminish trust in electoral results.   Risk level: Low   An attack on America\u2019s critical infrastructure would likely incite swift and aggressive retaliation by the US, acting as a deterrent to countries such as Iran, Russia, and China.     However, the precedent for such attacks exists. In 2020, Israel experienced an attack on its water supply, and a ransomware attack in the US took a natural gas operator offline. In the past, Russian hackers have compromised Ukraine\u2019s power grid, and more recently have targeted German critical infrastructure .     The Council on Foreign Relations identified \u201ca highly disruptive cyber attack on US critical infrastructure, including its electoral systems,\u201d as a top threat in 2020.    Impact: High   Critical infrastructure attacks pose a significant threat to health and safety \u2014 an attack on the power grid, for example, could take vital systems like traffic and internet offline. An attack\u2019s intangible impact, however, could be even more meaningful and lasting.     For example, taking the power grid offline could cause traffic congestion and confusion, reducing voter turnout in affected jurisdictions. This regional impact on turnout could pale in comparison to the broader impact that news of the interference would have on the country, potentially undermining trust in the electoral outcome.   Cyber defenses: protecting IT &amp; ot Systems   The federal government has devoted resources and oversight to critical infrastructure, while startups and incumbents alike provide cyber defenses to thwart evolving threats.     A wide range of companies aim to protect critical infrastructure, including defense contractors (e.g. Lockheed Martin , BAE Systems ), technology companies (e.g. Cisco , Tenable ), and industrial equipment providers (e.g. Siemens , General Electric ). These companies typically focus on protecting either a company\u2019s IT systems or its operational technology (OT) systems \u2014 the machines and equipment conducting critical operations.     Focusing on protecting these industrial systems, Cisco acquired industrial internet of things (IIoT) cybersecurity company Sentryo in 2019. Siemens, an equipment manufacturer, is building security into its products and purchased UltraSoC in June 2020 to, in part, detect malicious attacks.     Many cybersecurity startups also focus on the critical infrastructure market:     Mission Secure provides a control system protection solution for OT environments, specifically within the energy, chemicals, maritime, and defense industries.   Nozomi Networks helps companies identify vulnerabilities on their network from OT and IoT devices.   Tempered Networks rolled out an updated IIoT security platform in September 2019 that isolates and segments industrial systems from IT networks.    Mail-in ballots (USPS)    Mail-in voting will play a prominent role in the November 2020 collection as the country largely avoids in-person activities amid the pandemic.     The facilitator of this voting process, the United States Postal Service (USPS), will introduce an element of centrality to a customarily distributed voting system with its national presence.     Like any large logistics organization, the USPS relies on technology to enable its operations and workforce. Therefore, an attack on its IT systems could disrupt its operations, delaying an electoral outcome.    Risk level: Low   The USPS relies on a workforce of 500,000+ workers and a host of technologies from barcode readers to tray sorters to support a mail volume that surpassed $ 142B in 2019 . This breadth of operation creates a large attack surface.        Source: CISA    In July 2020, CISA released a note outlining specific threats to mail-in voting and steps to mitigate them. The potential for delays exists at several phases of the voting process, such as inbound and outbound ballot processing.   Impact: Moderate   An attack on the USPS\u2019 IT systems could impact the organization\u2019s ability to support voting by mail in a timely fashion. This tampering could delay the collection and tabulation of results, creating uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the election on election night.     Delays, however, are expected , and therefore may pose a reduced risk to the integrity of the election.   Cyber defenses: incident response   Following a breach in 2014, the USPS took numerous steps to improve its cybersecurity, creating a Corporate Information Security Office, establishing a Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC), and receiving funding to develop its threat monitoring and incident response capabilities.     In March 2020, the Office of Inspector General conducted a test of USPS\u2019 incident detection and response capabilities. The redacted report detailing the outcome of the test indicated areas of improvement, including developing key performance metrics, establishing a process to review incident response tickets, and completing the implementation of certain detection capabilities.     Many cybersecurity companies offer incident response solutions, including BlueVoyant , which seeks to support election security by providing services at a reduced cost to political campaigns and parties. Exabeam and Securonix also support incident response by leveraging data science techniques.   Foreign campaign finance    Candidates for public office and their campaigns often rely on fundraising to support their operations (e.g. renting office space, hiring campaign staff, etc.) and finance advertisements. These activities encourage voter participation, increase awareness for the candidate, and help craft the candidate\u2019s public image.     Campaign financing comes from numerous sources, including individual donations, corporations, and labor organizations, as well as through various organizations or financial structures like political action committees (PACs) and political parties. However, foreign entities \u2014 individuals, corporations, and governments \u2014 are prohibited from donating to a candidate\u2019s campaign, directly or indirectly.    An attack that circumvented financial safeguards to deliver foreign funds could provide one candidate with an unfair advantage in the election, sidestepping the will of the American people. Alternatively, the inappropriate receipt of foreign funds could taint a candidate\u2019s reputation.   Risk level: Low   There has historically been little evidence of foreign money in US elections.  To meaningfully influence an electoral outcome, a foreign entity would need to inject a substantial sum of money into a candidate\u2019s campaign. This requirement applies both for impacting an electoral outcome or tainting a politician\u2019s credibility.     Funneling such a significant sum of money into a campaign without detection poses a technical challenge. Further, many foreign entities may deem such an investment unworthy of the uncertain outcome.   Impact: Low   In the 2015-2016 election cycle, presidential candidates raised and spent $1.5B on campaign expenditures, while affiliated entities (PACs and party committees) spent an additional $5.6B . Moving the needle would require a foreign entity to spend big without detection.     Further, researchers have not identified a causal link between spending and electoral outcome \u2014 so even vast sums of foreign money would not necessarily ensure a candidate\u2019s victory. However, if a candidate receives foreign funds, it could hurt their reputation, depending on whether it was an intentional or unintentional receipt.   Cyber defenses: compliance and regulatory tech to monitor fraud   Corporations across the globe employ complicated legal structures that can obfuscate the origin of funding. Online donations have further introduced the ability to scale small donations into significant sums.     To protect elections from the influence of foreign money, fundraising organizations can apply compliance technology to identify and mitigate financial risks. Financial technology companies acquainted with regulatory frameworks and financial systems increasingly employ machine learning algorithms to identify unusual activity.     ComplyAdvantage , for example, monitors transactions with artificial intelligence to identify and flag those that are non-compliant (i.e. come from a sanctioned country). Trulioo , meanwhile, offers an identity verification solution to ensure compliance with regulations and reduce fraud.     Many of the solutions employed by financial institutions to ensure financial systems\u2019 integrity could modernize campaign fundraising tracking.   Countdown to the election    In a matter of weeks, Americans will head to the polls to vote, capping an impressive 4 years of collaboration among big tech companies (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Facebook), startups (e.g. Area 1 Security, Synack, NewsGuard), and federal and local governments. The results on election day will ultimately determine the effectiveness of these entities\u2019 efforts, from network monitoring to cyber training to anti-phishing tools.     Attempts to influence the 2020 election, however, are already underway. Disinformation traffics the internet and foreign hackers attempt to infiltrate campaign and governmental systems with phishing and brute-force (e.g. automated password guessing) attacks. In just the past few weeks, Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence team uncovered attempts to infiltrate at least 200 organizations  connected to the upcoming election.    While the foreign actors targeting the election may pursue different ends, they are united in casting a shadow on the integrity of the voting process and of democracy as a whole.    America\u2019s greatest defense in the 2020 election, therefore, will be its citizens. On election day, every citizen can make a choice to vote and place their trust in verified sources of information.

The Knight Foundation received over 100 applications for funding.</p><p> Philanthropic organization Luminate and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation donated $750,000 and $600,000, respectively.</p><p> Kreiss said a decline of trust in institutional journalism has led the public to seek out information in other areas of the internet. Pew Research reported in 2018 that social media sites have surpassed print journalism as a news source for Americans.</p><p> Kreiss said the rabbit-hole of the social media world leaves troublesome questions unanswered.</p><p> \"Strategic actors can do things like buy targeted advertisements and it's entirely impossible for citizens to see who gets targeted with that information and how it's targeted,\" he said. \"It turns out that Google and Facebook are getting data from porn websites too.\"</p><p> Companies like Facebook and Google mine internet users' data from websites across the internet, and Kreiss said they're financially inclined to engage with salacious and sensational content, as it often gets the most engagement from users.</p><p> \"What gets so complicated about this is that many consumers have made the decision that they're willing to trade their data for free content, or at the very least, for the convenience of being able to surf the web or have it personalized,\" Kreiss said.</p><p> Gary Marchionini is the dean of the School of Information and Library Sciences, the official home of the new center. He researches human-computer interactions, and thinks people should be aware of how their online behavior rakes in cash for big tech.</p><p> \"It's buying something on Amazon and then being almost stalked with similar kinds of products. It's looking at a Youtube video for some casual interest that takes you off in a direction you may or may not want to go in,\" he said. \"Ultimately people really are affected by these things and if we're not being a little more critical about these behaviors we're going to be disappointed down the road.\"</p><p> The leaders of UNC's new center plan on drawing in faculty from all over campus, as well as undergrads and graduate students, to help brainstorm answers to the pervasive, existential questions that have come along with the massive growth of social media platforms.</p><p> They plan on gathering empirical data that will benefit the public, lawmakers and academics \u2014 providing context for the social media universe in a time when consumers are wholeheartedly engaging with the platforms, despite the already-clear privacy drawbacks.</p><p> \"It's really hard to opt out,\" Kreiss said. \"If you're not opting out, then you're basically buying into this ecosystem that you don't have a ton of control over, and the only way to not be tracked is to give up your free porn or give up your free movies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Counteracting fake news and privacy invasions: UNC center set to examine digital life</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNC-746bbd36a9f119a87dc2caf77e64dc6243808b61</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E55D4770768 NWBKNC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-DBT1-JBCN-4297-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The Counter Extremism Project (CEP) congratulates President Juncker and the Commission staff who have managed to carry this legislation over the line. </p><p>CEP has worked hard to highlight the lack of accountability and responsibility that tech companies take for extremist content, and is delighted that this work has been vindicated by this legislation.The Commission has set itself as an example to the world by recognising the dangers of online extremism and acknowledging the need for legislation. Commissioner King and Commissioner Gabriel are forging a path to hold these digital platforms accountable for their lack of action. The legislation's emphasis on transparency, accountability and increased cooperation signal the Commission's courage in taking control of a complex issue and fighting online extremism into the future.At a press conference held by the Commission, Commissioner King confirmed that 'if it is illegal offline, it is illegal online'. The penalty for big tech companies that do not comply with the legislation is significant. The largest companies face fines of approximately \u20ac6.1 billion for Amazon, \u20ac3.8bn for Google and \u20ac1.4bn for Facebook.Lucinda Creighton, senior advisor to CEP and former Irish Minister for European Affairs: 'This legislation is badly needed in the fight against terrorist propaganda and recruitment, and today marks a step forward in how Europe fights extremism online. By threatening fines of 4% of global turnover, the Commission has shown that it will not let itself be bullied by large US tech companies. CEP looks forward to continuing to work with the Commission to optimize the legislation and to bring an end to extremist content online once and for all.'The post #CounterExtremismProject congratulates Commission on #TerroristContent legislation[1] appeared first on EU Reporter[2].

CEP has long-advocated for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to hold tech companies accountable for their actions, including the proliferation of extremist content online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As the flagship of the Silicon Valley armada, Facebook has used its leadership role in the tech consortium they've created, along with the extensive resources at their disposal, to forestall legislative attempts to regulate the entire tech industry for years,\" said CEP Executive Director David Ibsen. \"From the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the private data of more than 50 million Americans was abused, to the proliferation of fake and manipulated media content, to the promulgation of terrorist and extremist propaganda, Facebook's predictable pattern of denial and half-measures are no longer enough. We call on members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to finally get answers and hold Facebook accountable for the misuse of its platform.\"</p><p>While lawmakers on Capitol Hill have worked to hold tech companies accountable in the recent past, such as during the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Hearing \"Terrorism and Social Media: Is Big Tech Doing Enough?\", the House Energy and Commerce Committee must now go farther in its upcoming hearing. Facebook is failing at protecting the privacy of its users. Similarly, it is not doing enough to curb the extremist content that incites violence against innocent Americans on its platforms. When called out for its actions, Facebook's responses demonstrate a complete lack of transparency and deliberate obfuscation - hallmarks of an industry that fosters an attitude that it is somehow above or immune to the same laws and regulations governing others.</p><p>BACKGROUND</p><p>Facebook Is Considered By Many To Have Unrivaled Influence &amp; Success Within The Tech Industry &amp; Silicon Valley:</p><p>* Facebook Is An \"Undisputed Ruler\" In Silicon Valley And Consumer Technology Industry.

During the first quarter of 2019, Google spent nearly $3.53 million, Facebook spent $3.4 million and Twitter spent $420,000. In that same period, the Christchurch, New Zealand shooter was able to share his manifesto online and broadcast his attacks on Facebook Live.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are repeating our call for tech companies to cease all lobbying against potential government regulation that is clearly needed to protect citizens from online terrorists and extremist threats,\" said CEP Executive Director David Ibsen. \"Tech's ongoing lobbying efforts prove, once again, that its public statements in favor of government oversight is simply a ploy to generate public goodwill and thwart punitive regulatory measures. Once again, tech's promises to be responsible stewards of the Internet ring hollow as they continue doing business as usual. The media, lawmakers, and the public must demand transparency from tech and compare what they're doing in practice to their public posturing.\"</p><p>Between January and March 2019, Google SVP of Global Affairs Kent Walker wrote a blog supporting \"government-overseen systems of accountability,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed advocating \"a more active role for governments and regulators\" and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in an interview, \"[g]enerally, I think regulation is a good thing.\" Their lobbying disclosures, however, suggest the companies were pushing a different agenda to lawmakers and regulators.</p><p>While tech was lobbying on regulation, terrorists were using their platforms unabated. Facebook and YouTube's much-publicized artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities were powerless during and after the New Zealand Christchurch shootings on March 15, 2019. The terrorist was able to livestream the shooting without Facebook taking any action until law enforcement informed them of the livestream, and identifiable copies of the video and audio were found on Facebook and YouTube more than a month following the attack.</p><p>During the first quarter of 2019, prior to the New Zealand shootings, CEP spotlighted several notorious propagandists and pieces of content that the industry failed to keep off its platforms:</p><p>* Yusuf al-Qaradawi (January 18, 2019): Yusuf al-Qaradawi is a Muslim Brotherhood leader who has supported attacks on American and Israeli civilians and troops, and the execution of gay people. Despite this, Qaradawi has a presence on Facebook and YouTube, on which his videos are widely available.</p><p>* Siege (January 28, 2019): Siege is a neo-Nazi book beloved by various white supremacist groups in the United States. The book advocates for terrorism to bring down the U.S. government and the creation of a violent neo-Nazi guerilla movement. Despite this, Siege is widely available on YouTube, WordPress, Scribd and the Internet Archive, among other websites.</p><p>* Abdullah al-Faisal (February 4, 2019): Abdullah al-Faisal is classified as a global terrorist by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and a \"violent extremist ideologue\" by the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. Among other things, he has advocated that his followers train and carry out terrorism. Despite this, his essays, lectures and videos are widely available on YouTube, Twitter and the Internet Archive, among other online forums.</p><p>* Ahmad Musa Jibril (February 5, 2019): Ahmad Musa Jibril is a U.S.-based Salafist preacher who U.S. prosecutors said, \"encouraged his students to spread Islam by the sword, to wage a holy war [and] to hate and kill non-Muslims.\" He is reported to have inspired one of the 2017 London Bridge terrorists. Despite this, his lectures and videos are widely available on Apple iTunes, YouTube and the Internet Archive.</p><p>* The Turner Diaries (February 12, 2019): The Turner Diaries is a white supremacist \"bible\" that describes a revolution by white supremacists in the U.S. who perpetrate acts of terrorism against the U.S. government, culminating in a race war, and the global genocide of Jews and non-whites. It is well-known to have inspired several terrorists, including Timothy McVeigh and Norway's Anders Behring Breivik. Despite this, it is still widely available on YouTube, Google Docs, Google Drive and the Internet Archive.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6723476 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6723476</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2R-Y8W1-JC11-12D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><timeReceived>7:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The new regulation would allow EU member states to impose fines on tech firms of up to four percent of their revenue for failure to consistently remove extremist content from their platforms. It would also require a takedown of said extremist content within one hour of receiving notice from public authorities. Given tech companies' consistent inability to enforce their own terms of service, the EU's proposal is part of a growing trend by legislative bodies to prescribe content moderation policies in an effort to stymie the spread of extremist and terrorist material online. The Terrorist Content Regulation builds upon Germany's pioneering 2018 Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG).</p><p>\"The EU's counterterrorism legislation sets a reasonable standard of one-hour to takedown extremist content. The longer terrorist propaganda and recruiting materials remain online, the more its viewership will increase and the higher the likelihood that it will be viewed, copied, and uploaded elsewhere,\" said Counter Extremism Project (CEP) Executive Director David Ibsen. \"It is therefore only sensible that governments are seeking to instill a duty of care for tech companies to ensure the failure to remove content online does not translate to real world harm. Instead of lobbying against such sensible public policy, major tech companies should harness their extensive resources and capabilities to work towards achieving the one-hour takedown goal. Moreover, tech firms should proactively utilize industry consortiums such as the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) to better leverage technological expertise and share information and best practices between large and small firms, as its founders claim it was originally created to do. Doing so will help keep extremist and terrorist material permanently off the open web.\"</p><p>When NetzDG first entered into law, similar to the EU proposal, critics argued that it would lead to both overreporting and the suppression of free speech, but also the stifling of innovation, because smaller companies would not have the resources needed to comply with the law. A joint report by CEP and the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) released in November 2018 showed these arguments were baseless and the concerns unfounded. NetzDG did not result in a flood of reports or over-blocking, and the expense of implementing NetzDG was minimal at one percent of total revenue.</p><p>This March, CEP Berlin released a follow-up NetzDG study that tested the tech industry's compliance with the law between January 31 and February 14 of this year. The law in its current form requires online platforms to remove \"manifestly illegal\" content within 24 hours only after it has been reported by users. CEP's study revealed that YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram removed a mere 43.5 percent of clearly extremist and terrorist content, even after that material was reported for their illegal nature under the NetzDG. CEP Berlin's findings suggested that this \"notice and takedown\" method for removing illegal content can only be effective if platforms are being searched continuously and systemically for such material.</p><p>[Category: International]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7145939 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7145939</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-3XY1-JC11-14RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><timeReceived>7:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That doesn't count bills still in committees and measures passed by both chambers with differences that have to be sorted out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Legislative leaders have their fingers crossed, hoping to wrap up this week. A lot of people, businesses, local governments, lobbyists and others are nervously watching to see what lives and what dies.</p><p>Here's a rundown on what's coming up:</p><p>* Abortion restrictions: The House is expected to take final action on a previously passed Senate bill that imposes 48-hour waiting period and mandatory informed consent by a physician for women seeking an abortion. Virtually every one of the 73 Republicans in the GOP-controlled House back the bill, as do some of the 26 Democrats.</p><p>* School vouchers: The Republican-controlled Senate has already passed this bill, just as it does every session. But it awaits action in the House Finance Subcommittee, where its prospects are unclear. The bill allows low-income parents to use tax dollars to send their children to private or religious schools -- Protestant, Catholic, Jewish or Muslim -- provided the student's zoned public school is in the bottom 5 percent for achievement statewide.</p><p>The bill would affect Hamilton County and four other systems with failing schools. It starts with 5,000 students, rising to 20,000 within a few years. If not enough parents use the vouchers, they could go to other low-income students attending nonfailing schools if their districts have even just one failing school.</p><p>* Auto insurance: Decades in the making, this bill finally puts teeth into enforcing the current mandatory insurance law. The bill, which passed the House last week, could affect one of every five vehicle registrations in Tennessee, or about 1.1 million vehicles and their owners who have no insurance.</p><p>The state's 95 county clerks will be required to check a computer to see if vehicle owners have insurance, and reject registrations if they don't. And they can revoke registrations if insurance is dropped.</p><p>* Common Core education standards: Action is expected in the House and Senate on a compromise on the state's Common Core standards for math and English language arts. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam hoped to stall an attack by conservatives on the states-initiated standards aimed at ensuring students know what they should.</p><p>The compromise retains Haslam's current review process. But it officially repeals Common Core standards. And it adds a 10-member commission with four gubernatorial appointees and three each by the House and Senate speakers. The commission would have to OK the new standards before passing them along to the state Board of Education for final approval. Proponents say it will retain high standards. Critics contend it's simply a rebranding of Common Core.</p><p>* Municipal de-annexation: Rep. Mike Carter, R-Ooltewah, and Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson, have a bill letting some city residents initiate referendums to \"de-annex\" their properties. If a majority of voters in the territory approved, the municipality still could levy taxes to pay for improvements like sewers incurred before the de-annexation.</p><p>Watson's version is ready for floor action. Carter's bill, a follow-up to his 2014 bill eliminating annexation by ordinance and requiring public votes, is up in the House Finance Committee on Tuesday.</p><p>Cities are opposed to de-annexation referendums. \"We believe these matters are best handled locally,\" said Lacie Stone, a spokeswoman for Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke.</p><p>If the bill passes, Watson thinks some areas forcibly annexed into Chattanooga, such as Hixson, \"will look at it.\"</p><p>\"But remember,\" he added, \"when you get de-annexed your financial responsibilities to whatever improvements that were made don't go away. I think it's a reasonable process to remove without undue [burdens] on cities.\"</p><p>* Undocumented students: After passing the Senate 21-12 last week, Sen. Todd Gardenhire's bill granting in-state college tuition rates to some undocumented students living in Tennessee faces its next big test in the House Finance Subcommittee this week.</p><p>As amended, the bill affects would-be students who have been designated \"lawfully present\" under a 2012 federal program.</p><p>\"I was surprised at the [Senate vote] margin,\" the Chattanooga Republican said. \"That's pretty remarkable. I think this margin gives it a real boost in the House. They were sort of waiting to see what we did.\"</p><p>* App-based rideshare services: Popular online transportation networks like Uber and Lyft are bypassing cities and lobbying legislatures to authorize their operations.</p><p>A bill by Watson strips cities' authority to license and regulate rideshare services and makes them self-regulating. The companies would be required to conduct criminal background checks on drivers.</p><p>While traditional taxi services have complained, the battle over the bill has involved Big Tech and Big Insurance. But Uber and Lyft and the major auto insurers compromised, and the bill is on the House and Senate floors this week.</p><p>\"Uber and Lyft is a whole new concept in legislation and we're trying to build a model that's new,\" Watson said, who added the bill was \"crafted, really, from a national perspective.\"</p><p>That's not making Chattanooga happy, since the city set up its own rideshare regulations earlier this year.</p><p>Stone said, \"As you know, Mayor Berke fought for local control during his time in the legislature. We believe Chattanooga came up with a good, common sense solution to ride sharing and we would like to see our local legislation protected.\"</p><p>* Revenue reform: Senators are expected to take final action on Haslam's proposed Revenue Modernization Act. Haslam says the bill, passed last week by the House, brings fairness to Tennessee-based companies.</p><p>The state could collect its 7 percent sales tax on the online licensing of software by business as well as the purchase of video games.</p><p>A major change in state business franchise and excise taxes will benefit local-area companies such as Volkswagen and McKee Foods, with large workforces and major capital investments in plants and machinery. Changes increase the weight given to sales in the tax formula and decrease the portion for personnel and equipment.</p><p>The bargaining and negotiations on the bill were conducted secretly by the Haslam administration and various companies. The bill that originally would have raised some $45 million a year now will bring in about $17 million, according to the state Revenue Department.</p><p>Those changes are important, Carter told colleagues last week, citing McKee as an example.</p><p>\"Let me explain something for all of us in Hamilton County and all of us in Tennessee,\" Carter said. \"McKee family bakery is a huge employer in the state of Tennessee. Do you realize that without this modernization act, they are paying franchise and excise tax on more than 100 percent of their business, literally because payroll and plant and those things are more weighted?</p><p>\"So why would they continue to bring more jobs to Tennessee?\" he asked. \"Why would they continue to build plants in Tennessee when they can go to their other regions throughout the country and not pay that tax.\"</p><p>The bill is \"the first step in a process to correct [that inequity].\"</p><p>* Transportation Equity Fund: A bill makes major changes to the 4.5 cents-per-gallon aviation fuel tax that helps pay for improvements at dozens of Tennessee airports, including Chattanooga's.</p><p>The bill delivers a tax break to Memphis-based FedEx, capping its aviation-fuel tax liability at $10.5 million annually. As a result, the Transportation Equity Fund -- now $41 million to $48 million -- would shrink by two-thirds.</p><p>FedEx pays an average 66 to 75 percent of the fund's annual revenues, which provide an estimated $32 million in annual grants to airports. In the last three fiscal years, the Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport has received $7.35 million from the fund, according to state Transportation Department figures.</p><p>Proponents note the state has pumped hundreds of millions into incentives to lure and expand companies like Volkswagen, and say the break will help keep FedEx from moving refueling operations to other states.</p><p>Contact staff writer Andy Sher at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:asher@timesfreepress.com\">asher@timesfreepress.com</email> or 615-255-0550.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FT0-86G1-DY58-F15K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 19, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>Boundaries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDEyQzA0NjVBQjA3NDRDOUJDNkExQkIzRkEzNzE2MTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Funding</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUQxQUJFQjMzOTU4NDk0QkExMTREN0NDREYzODlGNDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzdDOUIxNEQzQzA5NEM0Q0E5RjlERDVFNzIzNEQyQzA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjQwNzg3MTkwNEExNEY4MUE5NjVGMjM5NTFCRTk4OTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUE5RTcxOUU3RDczNDlDNjgzMkJCMTQwQTkxQzdFNUU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000002</classCode><className>ABORTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DE2E</classCode><className>ABORTION LAWS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJERTczQzQxNDBENEQ4RDlCRjNGNUMyMjg0NEI0NjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjM2NTg4ODQ2MEU0NENDOUE4NzlDN0E2QjM5MjJFQjg</classCode><className>Abortion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again. </p><p>  Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by <person><nameText>Richard Cordray, </nameText></person>the head of the agency, who was appointed by former President <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>Mr. Cordray argued that consumers needed protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged.

That will make life hard for the tech giants</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IN 2016 THE World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Britain to be officially free from measles, a highly infectious illness that killed about 110,000 people around the world in 2017. The success was short-lived. After 991 infections were recorded in England and Wales in 2018, the WHO revoked Britain's disease-free label. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cases of measles are rising in many countries, fuelled in part by conspiracy theories claiming that vaccines given to children cause autism (they do not). \"Anti-vaxxers\" have long used internet forums and social media to spread their nonsense. Matt Hancock, Britain's health minister, would like to see that stopped. In March he said that internet giants such as Facebook and Google should have a \"duty of care\" to their users, putting them in the same legal position as schools or doctors. If firms would not stop the spread of anti-vaccination messages voluntarily, said Mr Hancock, he would consider changing the law to force them to do so. </p><p>An election is due in December, so Mr Hancock may not get his way\u2014though the opposition Labour Party is also keen. But Britain is far from alone. In recent months attention has focused on the threat to big internet companies from trustbusting politicians in America. Now they face a second regulatory assault elsewhere. Citing reasons ranging from combating terrorism to safeguarding elections to discouraging self-harm, politicians around the world are increasingly eager to censor the material that appears on the tech giants' platforms. </p><p>Many authoritarian governments already restrict what their citizens see online. China has heavily censored the internet since its early days; Twitter and Facebook are banned outright. Iran also outlaws Facebook. Saudi Arabia restricts access to information on everything from gay rights and evolution to Shia Islam. Attitudes are hardening in democracies, too. Rather than simply being blocked, big tech firms face a raft of new laws controlling what they can host on their platforms.</p><p>This marks a big change for a global industry that has, until now, been run on techno-libertarian assumptions. \"Most of the big internet companies come from an American speech tradition,\" says Owen Bennett of the Mozilla Foundation, which campaigns for an open internet. There was, he says, an assumption that the liberal attitude to speech embodied in the First Amendment to America's constitution would spread as the internet did. When the internet was young and unimportant, the frictions that it caused in countries with other ideas about free speech could mostly be ignored. Now that it is enormous and vital, they are pushing back. </p><p> In June, for instance, Singapore passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. The city-state's bossy government presented it as an anti-\"fake news\" bill. It bars the dissemination of online lies deemed to be against the public interest, on pain of fines of up to $1m or ten years in jail. Singapore's government defines the public interest expansively. The law penalises falsehoods that would interfere with \"public tranquillity\" or \"diminish public confidence in the performance of any duty or function of?the Government\". Firms can be required to block access to content found to be in breach of the law, and to tell users that such content is false, even to the point of getting in touch with them after they have already seen it. </p><p>Britain's proposed laws are notable for their focus on things that are merely undesirable, rather than downright illegal. Besides demanding more effort to combat child pornography and the promotion of terrorism, they take aim at hard-to-define things such as hate, abuse and misogyny, as well as the glamorisation of suicide. The government envisages a new regulator, paid for by the tech firms, with the power to block offending websites, force other companies\u2014such as payment processors or search engines\u2014to sever ties with offending firms, and perhaps even to hold senior managers legally responsible for their companies' failings. </p><p>Australia's Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material bill was rushed through in April following a live-streamed terrorist attack on mosques in New Zealand. Western technology firms fiercely opposed the bill. It requires companies (no matter where they are based) to ensure that anything on their servers depicting such things as terrorism, murder or kidnapping is swiftly made unavailable in Australia (potentially within less than an hour). The penalties for failing to do so include fines of up to a staggering 10% of global turnover and, in theory at least, jail time for executives. </p><p>One of the most influential jurisdictions will be the European Union (EU), a market of 500m rich consumers which restricts speech more than America does. Until now, individual member states have done much of the work. Germany passed its \"Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz\" law in 2017, which gives social-media firms 24 hours to remove fake news and hate speech or face fines of up to ?50m ($56m). In July France passed similar legislation.</p><p>But Rasmus Nielsen, who runs the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, says one priority of the new European Commission, which takes office in December, will be to beef up such laws and put Brussels, rather than individual countries, in charge. Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician who made her name levying multi-billion-dollar fines on big tech firms as the previous Commission's competition enforcer, will probably lead the effort. The Commission's planned Digital Services Act is likely to contain rules governing everything from political advertising to terrorist content, all of which would be enforced by a new regulator. </p><p>Still more consequential will be India's efforts. It has around half a billion internet users\u2014second only to China\u2014and is adding to that number rapidly. In February its government proposed new powers that would weaken the encryption that protects messages on apps such as WhatsApp, force internet-service providers to install automatic filtering software to prevent users from seeing unlawful information, and require firms to remove posts or videos deemed hateful or deceptive, or which invade someone's privacy. India's size means the new rules have caught the attention of Western giants. In September Nick Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook's chief PR man, made a speech in Delhi urging the government to reconsider. </p><p>Even in America, disquiet is growing about the wisdom of letting internet giants police themselves. Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate, has accused Facebook of \"taking money to promote lies\", referring to the social network's decision to exempt politicians from its internal guidelines governing what can be posted. \"We do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers,\" said Mr Clegg recently. \"And we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\" Facebook points out, with some justification, that it would look odd for a democracy to rely on a private company to referee what politicians say\u2014although the firm does decide who counts as a politician. The policy is not limited to America: Facebook has said it would also apply in Britain's coming election. By contrast, Twitter last month banned political ads entirely.</p><p>To grasp the impact of these changes, one useful analogy, suggests an industry insider, is with big banks. Both industries operate in many countries, and both control the flow of vital things\u2014money in one case, information in the other. Banks' systemic importance means they are hedged about with tough, detailed laws that differ between jurisdictions. That requires vast compliance departments, stuffed with lawyers, accountants and box-tickers. Tech firms, used to having limited staff and to being able easily to operate across borders, are being ushered down the same path. </p><p>Monitoring the torrent of content that passes through their servers is a huge task. More than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute; thousands of tweets are posted every second. For all the hopeful chatter about artificial intelligence (AI), Alex Stamos, a former chief security officer at Facebook, argues that, in the end, human labour\u2014and lots of it\u2014is the only solution. Algorithms already struggle to make relatively straightforward decisions. YouTube, for instance, spent $100m developing ContentID, an algorithm designed to block pirated content. But pirated videos are still available, and legitimate users sometimes see their posts wrongly flagged. </p><p>And policing copyright infringements is a cinch compared with other forms of content. An algorithm to regulate political speech would have to master sarcasm and irony. It would need tailoring to local sensitivities in individual countries, and to be made invulnerable to deliberate attempts to exploit its weaknesses. \"Regulating political speech basically requires AI that's as smart as humans,\" says Mr Stamos. If that ever comes, it will not be for decades.</p><p>Social-media firms do use AI to flag posts for humans' attention. Exact figures are scarce, but in 2017 Accenture, a consultancy, reckoned tech firms already employ around 100,000 human content-moderators worldwide. Each new law will require more people to enforce it. Facebook doubled the number of moderators from 7,500 to 15,000 between August and December 2018. Its internal guidelines even now run to tens of thousands of words. </p><p>Such burdens risk entrenching big existing players, says Mr Bennett, since they can afford to absorb the costs of compliance. And harsh penalties will create incentives for firms to err on the side of heavy-handedness. \"You might even see companies thinking carefully about where they want to operate because it's just not worth the risk of getting it wrong.\" </p><p>In the long run, though, perhaps the biggest effect of the new laws will be the further splintering of the internet. The idea of the internet as a single global network that looks the same no matter where you are when you log on, is central to its founding mythology. Yet it looks increasingly outdated. Whether that is good or bad is the subject of debate. \"It is entirely legitimate for countries to formulate policies that govern their own media environments,\" argues Mr Nielsen. However, \"at the moment, people in India who can afford phones can see broadly the same things as people in the West,\" says Mr Stamos. \"The end of that would be sad.\"</p><p>It is happening regardless. China's pervasive censorship has long split its internet users off from those elsewhere in the world. Cracks are spreading in the West, too. Some American firms already find it easier to block European users rather than comply with EU privacy laws. \"Right to be forgotten\" laws compel search engines to remove certain results for European users. Censorship laws will mean another set of walls dividing the global village. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-2L86AM1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFM-62P1-JBKN-B01G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge \u2014 and not a moment too soon.</p><p> In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p> That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p> The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p> This is a big change. So far the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p> And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p> An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility \u2014 especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p> With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p> The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p> And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p> The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p> The coming election campaign will be an ideal time for the federal parties to spell out how they would meet that challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIN-43bbc7d33898c447d8abe233cfa0673a8aefc3aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">15737E52F35D0088 NWBKIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-1351-DXVP-V34N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Journal, AIM Media Indiana, LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The way that Facebook structures its site influences the news we are exposed to, and this shapes our political and social lives.</p><p>Even a decision by Facebook to do nothing - to not intervene to delete certain content or shift content up or down in the newsfeeds - is a decision about the information its users see.</p><p>We used to talk about Facebook as a gatekeeper to online participation - like a bouncer who decides whether to admit a patron.</p><p>Facebook has far surpassed that.</p><p>It facilitates, channels, shapes and censors the information we consume.</p><p>This gives Facebook a whole lot of power and regulators need to examine what kind of responsibility this should invite It is because of Facebook's power that the privacy invasions of Cambridge Analytica (and indirectly Facebook) are so egregious.</p><p>Facebook is like a town square, but one where only opinions that we want to hear are heard.</p><p>This impoverishes us. News and opinion is balkanized, self-serving and fake.</p><p>We get our dopamine hit of likes, reassure ourselves that everyone thinks exactly like us, and scroll on.</p><p>And there is the rub. Facebook has the capacity to impact democracy in a way traditionally reserved for public institutions, but without any similar public accountability.</p><p>The idea of a company with public functions is not new, with debates in such areas as transportation, the media and telecommunications.</p><p>Transportation provides an important public service, shuttling goods and people.</p><p>The media are critical institutions in the public sphere.</p><p>Internet Service Providers connect users to the Internet, which is increasingly important to thrive in the modern world.</p><p>If we understand the public function of the Facebooks of the world, we understand that they have power and can think differently about how to regulate them.</p><p>What is concerning with the Facebook scandal is its influence on the rights of free expression and privacy, which is normally the preserve of government.</p><p>This creates an accountability gap.</p><p>Global Science Research breached Facebook's Terms and Conditions by selling the data collected for research to Cambridge Analytica, which in turn used it to micro-target U.S. voters.</p><p>We now know that Facebook did not audit or otherwise provide oversight to ensure contractual compliance.</p><p>The question is whether Facebook should have provided this oversight, or arranged for independent audits, both legally and ethically.</p><p>At a basic level, Facebook failed to protect its users privacy.</p><p>More than that, we were dependent on Facebook to be our privacy champions, because we did not know what we needed to protect ourselves from.</p><p>The question for the federal government is how to protect users from Facebook.</p><p>Yes, this invites scrutiny of our privacy laws, but it also invites a much broader question about how we regulate Internet companies with such power.</p><p>The federal government has two tasks ahead of it.</p><p>It needs to prioritize reform of federal privacy laws.</p><p>The Facebook scandal is a good stress test of privacy laws, and is safe to say all the system failed along the way.</p><p>The federal government should also examine how technology companies like Facebook are and should be regulated in Canada, given their power.</p><p>There is an attitude around technology companies and the Silicon Valley that any regulation will break their stewardship of a free and open Internet.</p><p>It won't. However, blunt, illconsidered regulation of technology companies will isolate Canada and fail to deliver the protections we seek.</p><p>We must tread thoughtfully but swiftly, and this requires more than an overhaul of our privacy laws.</p><p>Laidlaw is an associate professor in the faculty of law at the University of Calgary and author of Regulating Speech in Cyberspace: Gatekeepers, Human Rights and Corporate Responsibility @emilylaidlaw !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Sun Media Corporation.

But it also shows that the way to do this is you need government to take a firm hand and to show some leadership on this,\" Hinds told the Financial Post. \"This happened because the EU and the national governments in Europe enacted legislation to make it happen; I think that's one of the lessons we have to take from this.\"</p><p>The Competition Bureau, the regulatory agency that would have direct remit over this issue in Canada, said in an emailed statement that it is aware of the French ruling.</p><p>\"We closely follow developments and enforcement actions related to the investigations of our international counterparts, particularly those related to the digital economy which is a priority for the Bureau,\" the agency said. \"In doing so, we remain mindful of the different legal regimes in each jurisdiction. Regarding the conduct in question, it would be inappropriate for the Bureau to speculate as to whether it may represent a contravention of the Competition Act. The Bureau must conduct a thorough and complete examination of the facts before deciding whether to challenge any type of alleged conduct.\"</p><p>In response to a request for comment, Google addressed the French ruling but did not say how the decision would affect how they do business with news publishers globally.</p><p>\"Since the European copyright law came into force in France last year, we have been engaging with publishers to increase our support and investment in news,\" Richard Gingras, vice-president for Google News, said in a statement. \"We will comply with the FCA's order while we review it and continue those negotiations.\"</p><p>The French ruling concluded that because news publishers are so heavily reliant on traffic from Google, they do not have a choice about accepting Google's terms when it comes to displaying news content.</p><p>European regulators have been particularly aggressive when it comes to enforcement action against big tech, and Google in particular.</p><p>In 2018, Google was fined 4.3 billion euros for bundling its Google Chrome browser with its Android operating system, and last year the company was fined 1.5 billion euros for abusing its market dominance with its AdSense business.</p><p>Hinds said that he's hopeful regulators will take action to address Google's dominant position in North America as well.</p><p>He said that is essential for news publishers to find meaningful revenues online.</p><p>Hinds said the collapse in advertising rates in the face of the COVID-19 global pandemic, at a time when people are reading news sites at higher rates than ever, highlights the problem.</p><p>\"I think it's a fundamental thing: We need to be paid for our content. We need to be compensated,\" Hinds said. \"You've seen advertising drop 60 or 70 per cent, and who knows when those revenues are going to come back. So now more than ever I think there's a need to transition to the digital world, and if you can't secure a revenue source in a digital world, it doesn't bode well for the future of the medium.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
