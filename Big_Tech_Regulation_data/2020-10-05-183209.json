But the value of those advantages will shrink as innovators find new ways to attack banks' business models.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the rapid customer adoption of mobile banking - which represents the culmination of the industry's decades-long march toward nationwide scale - will further erode the value of local franchises. Smaller banks that fail to establish niches other than those based on geography will be at risk of getting bought out by more savvy competitors.</p><p>\"We're in the beginning of a digital disruption wave that will challenge banks at their very core,\" said Nigel Morris, a venture capitalist at QED Investors who co-founded Capital One Financial in 1994.</p><p>As the speed of technological change increases, banks' biggest advantage over competitors lies in one of their principal complaints - their high level of regulation. That barrier has made it difficult for the Amazons and Facebooks of the world to break through. It has also led some tech firms, including Google, to partner with banks, rather than try to displace them entirely.</p><p>But even these types of arrangements may not necessarily be advantageous to banks.</p><p>Citigroup is \"very conscious around not being the dumb utility,\" Chief Executive Michael Corbat said at an industry event in November, speaking of Citi's new partnership with Google on consumer checking accounts. He said the company is intent on \"not giving away unconsciously the client-customer ownership that's there.\"</p><p>Corbat's comment aptly sums up the risk as banks move forward. In trying to adapt and survive in an increasingly tech-dominated world, they may unintentionally give up their most valuable commodity - their relationship with the consumer and the data that comes with it.</p><p>The battle over big data</p><p>The acclaimed economist Nouriel Roubini was recently asked for his views on the potential of big data to transform the financial services industry. Roubini, who rose to fame for calling the U.S. housing bubble, has drawn a lot of attention over the last few years for his blunt skepticism about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.</p><p>But during an onstage interview in October, Roubini made clear that he believes big data, along with machine learning and artificial intelligence, are revolutionizing everything from lending to asset management to fraud detection.</p><p>\"The question is not whether, but how long is it going to take,\" he said.</p><p>Roubini noted that in the run-up to the financial crisis, mortgage underwriters were subject to biases, had bad incentives and lacked the right data. He suggested that big data will help address all three problems. \"There's billions and billions of transactions,\" he said, \"and there is no human being that can just monitor all these transactions and make the right decisions.\"</p><p>Banks are of course awash in data that holds insights about their customers. \"We're sitting on over 28 Libraries of Congress,\" Wells Fargo's chief data officer, Zac Maufe, said at a recent conference.</p><p>But traditional financial institutions are, by and large, poorly equipped to exploit the mountains of data that they possess. The data often sits in silos. Cleaning it up and combining it in ways that enable deep learning both present big challenges.</p><p>Banks are typically hamstrung by aging technology, cobbled together over many decades. Very few U.S. financial institutions have been willing to make the massive, multiyear investments that would be necessary to install a modern technological core.</p><p>Moreover, luring the best tech talent is an ongoing struggle, particularly for banks that are outside of the industry's top tier and in cities that highly compensated workers find less attractive.</p><p>At the same time, banks are facing increasing pressure to accommodate customers who want to share their own banking data with other companies. Banks have pushed back on those demands in recent years, which has led to friction with data-hungry fintechs.</p><p>But as more banks have begun to embrace application programming interfaces, which enable different kinds of software to talk to each other, the dynamic is changing.</p><p>In the U.K., the government has mandated that banks enable open banking, which means that customers can access other companies' products from their primary bank's app. Though a similar regulatory fiat seems unlikely in the U.S., technological and market forces are pushing banks on this side of the Atlantic in the same direction, whether they like it or not.</p><p>\"Customers should be able to make an informed decision about what data they're sharing,\" Don Cardinal, managing director of the Financial Data Exchange, which is promoting a common interoperable data standard, said at a recent congressional hearing. \"At the end of the day, it's their data.\"</p><p>More incursions from fintech and big tech</p><p>Banking profits remain robust - last year, industrywide net income totaled $237 billion - in large part because of what amounts to the government's stamp of approval on the companies allowed to engage in that business. This advantage is often called the moat - a metaphor that casts regulators as sharp-toothed crocodiles who keep invaders at bay.</p><p>The most important edge that banks have over less regulated companies is probably their right to accept deposits backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., since it gives them the exclusive ability to offer the product that remains at the center of people's financial lives, the checking account.</p><p>As a result, startups have often chosen to target more peripheral parts of the banking business. Consider the example of credit cards, which have historically been a high-margin product for banks, but have faced new competition in the post-crisis era.</p><p>The initial competitive threat came from companies like LendingClub and Prosper Marketplace, which allowed U.S. consumers to refinance their credit card debt in less expensive personal loans. More recently, firms such as Affirm and Klarna have launched more direct attacks on credit cards by offering lower-cost loans to shoppers at the moment they make a purchase.</p><p>Still, banks enjoy a degree of protection from these startups, which generally spend a lot of money to acquire new customers, struggle to sell multiple products to those customers, and borrow at higher interest rates than banks.</p><p>In the coming years, bigger, better established tech companies pose a more substantial threat. These firms, built in the internet age, are expert at monetizing consumer data. They are masters at designing intuitive, pain-free customer experiences. They already have large user bases, so they don't have to spend a lot to acquire customers. And some are now eyeing the checking account, which could offer a base from which to offer more financial products to customers.</p><p>\"They're all after that customer relationship,\" said Todd Baker, a senior fellow at the Richman Center for Business Law and Public Policy at Columbia Business School.</p><p>Both Google and Uber announced new checking products this fall. Uber Money is aimed at the company's large army of U.S. drivers. A big selling point is that a driver's bank balance will go up immediately after the passenger gets out of the car. \"It's free, it's real time and it's fast,\" Peter Hazlehurst, Uber's head of payments, said in a speech when the product launched.</p><p>Google's product is still under development, and its value proposition is less clear. But the search giant's checking account will be integrated into the Google Pay mobile wallet and will likely incorporate money-management features.</p><p>Both Google and Uber have no choice but to work with banks, since they lack their own charters. But over time, the tech giants' strategy should dilute the value of a bank license. Customers will increasingly believe they're banking with a tech company, which will give the tech firm leverage in negotiations with potential bank partners. Certain depositories that specialize in banking-as-a-service may still benefit, but the industry as a whole will suffer as they lose control of customer relationships.</p><p>\"Banks will be around,\" said Asheet Mehta, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. \"But unless they evolve, I think it's going to be difficult to earn returns significantly above the cost of capital, which makes you a utility-type industry.\"</p><p>It is possible that the U.S. government will prevent the tech industry from expanding further into financial services. Distrust of the tech sector has been surging. Libra, Facebook's proposed digital currency, got an icy reception in Washington. A bill from Rep. Jess \"Chuy\" Garcia, D-Ill., would bar online platforms with at least $25 billion in annual revenue from functioning as financial institutions.</p><p>But the government can only do so much to restrain technological trends. And it's not just the tech industry's behemoths that are expanding into financial services.</p><p>Take, for example, digital accounting platforms, which are already a frequent destination for small-business owners, and which collect a lot of data about their customers' finances. Intuit's QuickBooks and other accounting platforms now offer numerous banking-like features, including payments and financing, Javelin Strategy &amp; Research said in a recent report.</p><p>\"For many small businesses, accounting platforms have already become a de facto primary bank. That should be alarming for bankers,\" the Javelin report said.</p><p>Outsize peril for small banks</p><p>The trends described above are working against the U.S. banking industry as a whole. But thousands of smaller, locally oriented banks are in a particularly tough spot. Between 1992 and 2006, the industrywide return on equity never fell below 12.98%, according to data from the FDIC. In the 12 years since, that metric has never climbed above 12.01%.</p><p>Those percentages are averages that mask important distinctions between large banks - relatively well positioned to weather rapid changes in the business climate - and smaller, more vulnerable institutions.</p><p>Last year, institutions with more than $250 billion in assets posted stronger returns on equity than those with between $10 billion and $250 billion in assets, which in turn performed better than those with between $100 million and $10 billion in assets, according to FDIC data. Institutions with under $100 million in assets performed worst of all.</p><p>The differences are relatively small at the moment - in 2018, about 1.5 percentage points separated the average returns on equity at the largest banks from those at the smallest ones - but an institution's size is likely to matter significantly more five years from now than it does today.</p><p>\"As technology and scale become more important, it will force more consolidation,\" said Mehta, the McKinsey senior partner.</p><p>That seems particularly true as fintechs and big banks extend their reach. More than three decades after interstate banking began to gain momentum, any startup that develops a good mobile app can attract customers from coast to coast. At the same time, big banks are finding it much easier to attract customers in locales where they do not have branches.</p><p>\"The millennials are now the largest generation ever, and they're expecting good technology. And they're not going into bank branches,\" said Jo Ann Barefoot, CEO of Barefoot Innovation Group.</p><p>Still, there are steps that even smaller banks can take to set the stage for a thriving future. Small banks have access to a lot of the same technology as their larger peers, and they have the advantage of nimbleness, said Tripp Shriner, a venture capitalist at Point72 Ventures.</p><p>In an era where distribution is national, specialization is perhaps the biggest key for smaller institutions. This is the path forged by CBW Bank in Weir, Kan., and Cross River Bank in Teaneck, N.J., both of which have carved lucrative niches by providing services that cater to fintech companies.</p><p>But with roughly 5,300 banks now operating in the U.S., a lot of consolidation seems likely over the next five years. Only so many specialties are available.</p><p>\"Many organizations underestimate the increasing momentum of digitization,\" Jim Marous, host of the \"Banking Transformed\" podcast, wrote in a recent report. \"New digital tactics are important, but not enough. The organizational culture must also be upended, silos must be torn down, and agile processes must be put in place.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USBANK-226581-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USBANK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWN-GJ31-F06X-W3P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8066</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Why the NP99 and not 100? Because that last spot is reserved for the one we forgot. You'll think of it soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">99</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Strange Weather by Joe Hill (William Morrow)</p><p>Following on the heels of two doorstopper novels (NOS4A2 and The Fireman), Hill turned his skills to these four novellas, each a powerful distillation of story and exploration of theme. All killer, no filler indeed. - Robert J. Wiersema.</p><p>98</p><p>What Happened by Hillary Clinton (Simon &amp;; Schuster)</p><p>If you hate Hillary Clinton, you'll hate this book. It's a damn good read: funny at the right times, poignant at others, captivating and page-turning throughout. But most of all, it's a salve for those whose wounds from waking up on November 9, 2016 have yet to close. - Ashley Csanady( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hillary-clintons-what-happened-is-a-salve-for-those-whose-wounds-have-yet-to-close\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hillary-clintons-what-happened-is-a-salve-for-those-whose-wounds-have-yet-to-close</url> )</p><p>97</p><p>In the Cage by Kevin Hardcastle (Biblioasis)</p><p>In the Cage is a novel of toxic masculinity in a variety of forms, each more insidious than the last. And through Hardcastle's style - sentences plain and broken, glinting with moments of beauty even in the depths of violence and pain - we become part of Daniel's world, part of the very structure he fights against, inside the cage and out. - Robert J. Wiersema( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/in-the-cage-is-a-novel-of-toxic-masculinity-in-a-variety-of-forms-each-more-insidious-than-the-last\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/in-the-cage-is-a-novel-of-toxic-masculinity-in-a-variety-of-forms-each-more-insidious-than-the-last</url> )</p><p>96</p><p>The Weekend Effect: The Life-Changing Benefits of Taking Time Off and Challenging the Cult of Overwork by Katrina Onstad (HarperCollins)</p><p>A look at our obsession with overwork and overtime, and the benefits of taking off the odd weekend, Katrina Onstad's The Weekend Effect doubles as self-help. Its terrifying accounts of the toll too much work can take on the average 9-5er is enough to make you want to never leave the office late again. - Sadaf Ahsan( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/the-important-lessons-sundays-are-the-new-mondays\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/the-important-lessons-sundays-are-the-new-mondays</url> )</p><p>95</p><p>The Collapsing Empire by John Scalzi (Tor)</p><p>In the distant future, humanity lives in habitats scattered throughout the stars, connected by a series of hyperspace tunnels known as the Flow. Though entirely dependent upon it for survival, and while it forms the basis of vast interstellar monopolies and their resulting nobility, no one knows completely how the Flow works. But a few individuals know that it is about to stop working. - Paul Taunton( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/john-scalzis-the-collapsing-empire-sets-the-table-for-plenty-of-court-intrigue\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/john-scalzis-the-collapsing-empire-sets-the-table-for-plenty-of-court-intrigue</url> )</p><p>94</p><p>The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google by Scott Galloway (Portfolio)</p><p>Along with Franklin Foer's World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, and Farhad Manjoo's columns on the \"Frightful Five\" in the New York Times, Galloway's book is an important read for citizens grappling with the effect of tech companies on both the evolving economy and our way of life. - Paul Taunton</p><p>93</p><p>All the Lives I Want: Essays About My Best Friends Who Happen to Be Famous Strangers by Alana Massey (Grand Central)</p><p>Alana Massey is many things, and in her debut collection of essays, she tries to capture the countless women in pop culture who have guided her throughout her many lives. Including hilarious and introspective analyses of everyone from Sylvia Plath to Fiona Apple to Britney Spears, Massey also brings her own stories to the forefront, touching on everything from mental illness to the sex industry, effectively marrying the personal and the popular. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>92</p><p>The Water Beetles by Michael Kaan (Goose Lane)</p><p>The Water Beetles is based on the experience of Michael Kaan's father during the Second Sino-Japanese War as it bled into the Second World War. Shortlisted for the Governor General's Literary Award, the novel moves from occupied Hong Kong to rural China and finally, to university in America, where Chung-Man Leung begins to understand what has happened to him and his family. - Paul Taunton</p><p>91</p><p>Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century by Jessica Bruder (Norton)</p><p>Since the Great Recession, the retiree dream of an RV lifestyle is now a necessity for many older citizens who can't afford to own a house or retire. Nomadland exposes the reality most of us don't see, while humanizing those who must rely on a modern-day version of riding the rails. - Paul Taunton</p><p>90</p><p>Future Home of the Living God by Louise Erdrich (HarperCollins)</p><p>Many of the dystopic works of art that have been considered so timely this past year were in fact produced or begun long prior. Erdrich started her novel in 2002 when things seemed already to be \"moving backward,\" before setting it aside for two intervening books (which won the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award, respectively). But Future Home of the Living God, exploring reactionary dogma and the regulation of childbirth, arrives squarely in the zeitgeist of 2017. - Paul Taunton</p><p>89</p><p>The Golden House by Salman Rushdie (Knopf Canada)</p><p>The Golden House doesn't contain much of the author's signature magic realism, but it is a story about extreme wealth, which, let's face it, can be considered a type of magic. What we refer to as \"Mary Sue stories\" in fiction - where people live in impossible houses, where their life floats upon unspecified sources of income - exist in real life. In an odd reversal, the main characters in The Golden House reflect the kinds of people whose real lives are stranger than fiction. - Paul Taunton( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/salman-rushdies-the-golden-house-suggests-names-might-be-the-mother-of-reinvention\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/salman-rushdies-the-golden-house-suggests-names-might-be-the-mother-of-reinvention</url> )</p><p>88</p><p>The Vanity Fair Diaries by Tina Brown (Henry Holt)</p><p>This Oxford-educated British journalist took the helm of one of America's most influential magazines in her early 30s, helping set the tone for what she refers to as \"The Crazy Eighties,\" a time of decadent affluence when the world of print journalism was awash with cash. Her diaries are juicy, vulnerable and jolly good fun. - Sarah Sahagian( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/five-takeaways-from-the-vanity-fair-diaries-1983-1992\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/five-takeaways-from-the-vanity-fair-diaries-1983-1992</url> )</p><p>87</p><p>Mississippi Blood by Greg Iles (William Morrow)</p><p>The stunning conclusion of Iles's Natchez Burning trilogy, Mississippi Blood is a harrowing, disturbing examination of racial violence in the contemporary south in the guise of a pot-boiling thriller. While the storyline may occasionally be over-the-top, Iles's recent history of the role of racism in the American south - from the political assassinations of the 1960s to post-Katrina reconstruction - is the stuff of all-too-vivid nightmares. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>86</p><p>Earthly Remains by Donna Leon (Atlantic Monthly Press)</p><p>It's been 25 years since Commissario Guido Brunetti entered the world of crime fiction. And what an entrance it was. Leon knows her world intimately, yet never overloads the reader with research. She shows only the tip of her iceberg, confident in the richness that lurks underneath. The cast is small but memorable. The square miles she covers are few but exploding with life - at least where humans have yet to quash it. - Howard Shrier( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/donna-leon-takes-her-readers-deep-into-the-discontented-soul-of-a-detective-in-earthly-remains\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/donna-leon-takes-her-readers-deep-into-the-discontented-soul-of-a-detective-in-earthly-remains</url> )</p><p>85</p><p>The Spectacular Sisterhood of Superwomen: Awesome Female Characters from Comic Book History by Hope Nicholson (Quirk)</p><p>Imagine the daunting prospect of going through a museum that covers the history of women and feminism (or lack thereof) in comics. You don't know where to go, or where to start. The emergence of independent publishing and wider representation in webcomics? The soap opera stylings of the romance comics genre? The dichotomy of the all-powerful superheroes and stereotypical damsels-in-distress? Then a guide appears, and with a wink and a smile, says, \"Want a special tour? Follow me. Your guide is author Hope Nicholson, publisher of Winnipeg-based Bedside Press, and your personal tour culminates with The Spectacular Sisterhood of Superwomen. - April Flores( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hope-nicholson-chronicles-the-female-comics-heroes-you-know-and-many-more-that-you-dont\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hope-nicholson-chronicles-the-female-comics-heroes-you-know-and-many-more-that-you-dont</url> )</p><p>84</p><p>Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine by Joe Hagan (Knopf Canada)</p><p>When Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner approached Joe Hagan about a biography, Hagan took the job on the condition of independence. As is often the case when a mogul is profiled, Wenner's discomfort with the final product is the reader's gain. Fifty years after Rolling Stone was founded in San Francisco (and while it is up for sale for a fraction of its former worth), Sticky Fingers is a true legacy of the magazine, its creator and a host of the rock stars who've graced its covers over the decades. - Paul Taunton</p><p>83</p><p>Fugue States by Pasha Malla (Knopf Canada)</p><p>In Fugue States, Pasha Malla flips the tried-and-true story of the second generation immigrant discovering their family history and heritage through Kashmiri-Canadian Ash Dhar. Compelled to learn more about his recently deceased father's life, Ash instead sends along his stoner BFF Matt to do the discovering in his place, making for a thought-provoking and polarizing exploration of self-identity and masculinity. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>82</p><p>The Power by Naomi Alderman (Little, Brown)</p><p>The Power is unintentionally timely. It was written before #MeToo, before Harvey Weinstein and his sorry band of brothers seized public consciousness - but, of course, it could never not be timely. We've all played the game of idly wondering what the world would be like if its current power structure were reversed; this novel is a long, serious, and sometimes bleakly funny engagement with that question. - JC Sutcliffe( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/naomi-alderman-imagines-a-world-where-physical-power-dynamics-have-been-flipped\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/naomi-alderman-imagines-a-world-where-physical-power-dynamics-have-been-flipped</url> )</p><p>81</p><p>Arrival: The Story of CanLit by Nick Mount (House of Anansi)</p><p>Arrival is Mount's second book and, in many ways, he's the only one who could possibly have written the thing. By turns professor, editor, advocate and critic, Mount's voice is rarely absent from any meaningful discussion of Canadian literature. He's part and parcel of it, too, both taking and leaving jobs as acts of defiance when debates heat up. It's from these oscillating perspectives on CanLit - buzzing around and rooted within - that Mount documents our country's literary history, centred chiefly on Canada's mid-20th century boom. - Terra Arnone( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/nick-mounts-history-of-canlit-shows-us-how-we-got-here-and-asks-where-to\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/nick-mounts-history-of-canlit-shows-us-how-we-got-here-and-asks-where-to</url> )</p><p>80</p><p>White Tears by Hari Kunzru (Knopf)</p><p>The appropriation of black music by those who want to be \"authentic\" is the tip of the (vanilla) iceberg in Kunzru's fifth novel, which traces systematic racism by slipping back and forth from the present day to the late 1920s, when the Delta Blues were first recorded. What starts as a dark comedy focused on a \"hipster Jesus\" trust-fund kid and his hapless sidekick morphs into a horror novel designed to give American pop culture an existential shock. - Mike Doherty( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hari-kunzrus-white-tears-is-more-than-just-literary-clickbait-using-music-to-define-racial-divide\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/hari-kunzrus-white-tears-is-more-than-just-literary-clickbait-using-music-to-define-racial-divide</url> )</p><p>79</p><p>Demi-Gods by Eliza Robertson (Hamish Hamilton)</p><p>Eliza Robertson captures something often ignored about the B.C. coast in Demi-Gods, her quiet, menacing first novel. There's a coldness to the place, an absence among all that splendour. Demi-Gods is an uncomfortable, propulsive and deeply enjoyable read. It has an air of coastal gothic to it, a sense of chaos barely restrained amid all the calm. - Richard Warnica( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/eliza-robertson-demi-gods\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/eliza-robertson-demi-gods</url> )</p><p>78</p><p>We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy by Ta-Nehisi Coates (One World)</p><p>Coates, #1 on the NP99 in 2015 for Between the World and Me, returns with the signature essays he wrote during Barack Obama's eight years as president, enhanced with new reflections. Past is prologue in this collection, and his voice remains indispensable. - Paul Taunton</p><p>77</p><p>The Mariner's Guide to Self-Sabotage by Bill Gaston (Douglas &amp;; McIntyre)</p><p>With stylistic command and heart-wrenching insight, Gaston has been a writer's writer for too long. This collection of stories continues the Victoria writer's chronicling the lonely and the outcast, individuals struggling for meaning and significance in a hostile, frequently surreal world. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>76</p><p>The Sun and Her Flowers by Rupi Kaur (Simon &amp;; Schuster)</p><p>Poet Rupi Kaur, landing at No. 76 with The Sun and Her Flowers.</p><p>Kaur self-published her first poetry anthology, milk and honey, on Amazon in 2014. The book spent 52 consecutive weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and has since sold over a million copies. Her follow-up, the sun and her flowers, is bound to come close if not exceed its predecessor's numbers - if the growth of her digital footprint has anything to do with it. Kaur has become not only a voice for the marginalized, but a social media commodity as well - and she is very well aware of it, readily capitalizing on all those likes and follows from a community that had never seen itself represented quite so loudly before. - Sadaf Ahsan( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/on-rupi-kaur-and-the-question-of-authenticity-in-the-age-of-social-media-artists\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/on-rupi-kaur-and-the-question-of-authenticity-in-the-age-of-social-media-artists</url> )</p><p>75</p><p>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking by Samin Nosrat, illustrated by Wendy MacNaughton (Simon &amp;; Schuster)</p><p>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat represents 17 years of culinary experience. Chef and writer Samin Nosrat arrived at her theory of the four elements of good cooking through practice, using it as a mnemonic device to guide her. Whereas cookbooks squarely centre on recipes, Nosrat designed Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat to \"give people independence\" - highlighting the science and techniques that underscore good cooking. This is a book that can help you decide what to cook, how to cook it and why. - Laura Brehaut( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/life/food/how-to-cook-without-recipes-master-these-four-elements-and-never-look-back\">http://nationalpost.com/life/food/how-to-cook-without-recipes-master-these-four-elements-and-never-look-back</url> )</p><p>74</p><p>The Customer is Always Wrong by Mimi Pond (Drawn &amp;; Quarterly)</p><p>Madge spends her days working in a cruddy Oakland caf\u00e9 filled with degenerates and lowlifes while trying to get her start as a cartoonist. A charming, loosely autobiographical story of Pond's early years, before she found success as an illustrator for National Lampoon and the Los Angeles Times. - Michael Melgaard</p><p>73</p><p>The Stone Sky: The Broken Earth Book 3 by N.K. Jemisin (Orbit)</p><p>The Stone Sky, the final novel in Jemisin's The Broken Earth trilogy, fixes the series as perhaps the defining fantasy work of the early 21st century. The first two volumes won back-to-back Hugo Awards for Best Novel in 2016 and 2017. The Stone Sky will - if there's any justice - make it a hat trick. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>72</p><p>So Much Love by Rebecca Rosenblum (McClelland &amp;; Stewart)</p><p>So Much Love isn't a Gillian Flynn fling-your-fork-in-fear kind of crime fiction. It's not a tea-bite breed of keen and patient reading like Miriam Toews might ask, either. It isn't exactly a yield of the two, but So Much Love borrows a couple tablespoons from the recipe for both: something macabre in its undercurrent, enough to be unsettling, but the story is tempered with a cerebral sub-plot that lets the mind drift a little for relief. You wouldn't call So Much Love a thriller, but sometimes sharp insight draws interest in much the same manner as suspense, and here Rosenblum uses both to propel her story. - Terra Arnone( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/in-rebecca-rosenblums-so-much-love-a-past-crime-may-repeat-in-a-small-towns-present\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/in-rebecca-rosenblums-so-much-love-a-past-crime-may-repeat-in-a-small-towns-present</url> )</p><p>71</p><p>Game Change: The Life and Death of Steve Montador, and the Future of Hockey by Ken Dryden (Signal)</p><p>Ken Dryden had already planned to write a book about concussions in hockey, but needed a focus to make people care. He found it in a person, a well-liked person and teammate in the case of NHLer Steve Montador, who died in 2015 and had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Game Change( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/simmons-ken-dryden-hopes-new-book-on-montador-concussions-can-be-game-changer/wcm/bf722b83-76c0-41b4-9154-a39199f8d0c2\">http://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/simmons-ken-dryden-hopes-new-book-on-montador-concussions-can-be-game-changer/wcm/bf722b83-76c0-41b4-9154-a39199f8d0c2</url> ) says a lot that fans and league officials don't necessarily want to hear, but it does so by profiling a player they didn't want to lose. - Paul Taunton</p><p>70</p><p>South and West: From a Notebook by Joan Didion (Knopf)</p><p>If Joan Didion is anything, she's her own archivist. Here( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/sketches-from-a-master-joan-didions-south-and-west-is-a-reminder-of-what-the-journalist-could-once-do\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/sketches-from-a-master-joan-didions-south-and-west-is-a-reminder-of-what-the-journalist-could-once-do</url> ), we see her sometimes scattered, always profound ruminations on the connections she drew between her childhood in California and her travels through the American South, via pages from her hallowed notebooks, circa the 1970s. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>69</p><p>Bookshops: A Cultural History by Jorge Carri\u00f3n (Biblioasis)</p><p>Part travelogue, part history, Jorge Carri\u00f3n's ode to bookshops captures the feel of browsing shelves at your favourite bookstore.

She has sparked outrage in her native India by speaking out against nuclear testing, the rise of Hindu nationalism and, in recent years, human rights abuses in Kashmir.

Some of her praise, however, was not entirely pleasing. Canadians are the only people who eat up all their oatmeal, she said, as if that was the most endearing trait you could imagine. We were just that boring. I thought at the time that I might mention our famous Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, cuckolded (we all assumed) by one of the Rolling Stones.

The protagonist, Rose, 34, owner and manager of a repertory cinema, has the preternatural ability to enter the psyche and the body of another human being, in this case a books editor named Harriet. But Little Sister is not horror. Fiction writers who work with normal human characters perform much the same trickery in their imagined worlds. To hear some writers talk, the relations between them and their characters are positively uncanny, the characters occasionally taking the author by surprise with their unexpected responses.

It is, after all, a writing manual - not the sort of book that normally reaches an audience beyond writers and editors - the kind of book that generates little noise and creeps quietly onto university and college reading lists. In this case, though, the author in question is John McPhee, the legendary New Yorker staff writer, author of 32 books and a preeminent figure in creative nonfiction. He is also the instructor of an equally legendary course at Princeton called \"Creative Non-Fiction\" whose alumni include the current New Yorker editor David Remnick and a slew of other professionals scattered throughout the media.

Tackling everything from race and gender to body image and family, Koul comes off far more motivating and inspiring than her title (and brand) might suggest. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>30</p><p>The Lonely Hearts Hotel by Heather O'Neill (HarperCollins)</p><p>A magical rendering of love and loss, triumph and despair, the magic of art and the art of magic, The Lonely Hearts Hotel( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/heather-oneills-checks-in-to-the-lonely-hearts-hotel-in-the-dark-heart-of-montreal\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/heather-oneills-checks-in-to-the-lonely-hearts-hotel-in-the-dark-heart-of-montreal</url> ) is a powerful, singular work. And you'll never look at clowns the same way again. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>29</p><p>Borne by Jeff VanderMeer (HarperCollins)</p><p>Science-fiction writing often gets away with using tropes that other genres can't, simply because it's setting up a grand allegory or there's some sequence of parables that depends on easily understood metaphors. Borne( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/borne-to-be-great-jeff-vandermeers-new-novel-is-much-more-than-a-familiar-dystopian-tale\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/borne-to-be-great-jeff-vandermeers-new-novel-is-much-more-than-a-familiar-dystopian-tale</url> ), the story of a scavenger named Rachel who finds and raises an all-consuming bioengineered being, doesn't condescend to its readers, instead it offers a fresh plot with rich images and symbolism. But above all else, it's a good old fashioned suspenseful read about survival. - Dustin Parkes</p><p>28</p><p>Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann (Doubleday)</p><p>Part history, part mystery, Grann's investigation( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/more-than-mere-blood-a-true-crime-master-david-grann-on-the-most-important-story-he-has-ever-told\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/more-than-mere-blood-a-true-crime-master-david-grann-on-the-most-important-story-he-has-ever-told</url> ) of the murders on the Osage Indian nation in Oklahoma in the 1920s is a stunning work of narrative nonfiction, drawing together disparate strands and new information to shed light on a largely forgotten American tragedy. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>27</p><p>The Doll's Alphabet by Camilla Grudova (Coach House)</p><p>Over the course of The Doll's Alphabet, Grudova isn't merely creating a collection of stories. Read as a whole, one feels swept into an entire universe. The Doll's Alphabet is a singular collection from a unique talent, stories with the force of dreams, a reading experience from which you may never awaken. - Robert J. Wiersema( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/read-at-your-own-risk-the-dolls-alphabet-presents-a-nightmarish-and-often-troubling-world\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/read-at-your-own-risk-the-dolls-alphabet-presents-a-nightmarish-and-often-troubling-world</url> )</p><p>26</p><p>The Accident of Being Lost by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (House of Anansi)</p><p>A finalist for the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, this collection of stories, poems and songs from a major Indigenous voice, is a singular demonstration of the different ways an idea can manifest. Reviewers have often not quite known where to begin, and then just kept going and going. - Paul Taunton</p><p>25</p><p>I Hear She's a Real Bitch by Jen Agg (Doubleday Canada)</p><p>Jen Agg comes in at No. 25 with I Hear She's a Real Bitch.</p><p>As one of the most polarizing figures in the Canadian food industry, Jen Agg knows she has a reputation. And in I Hear She's A Real Bitch( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/jen-agg-chronicles-a-life-in-the-canadian-restaurant-industry-with-i-hear-shes-a-real-bitch\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/jen-agg-chronicles-a-life-in-the-canadian-restaurant-industry-with-i-hear-shes-a-real-bitch</url> ), that fact may be how she pulls you in, but in recounting how she got to where she is as a successful restaurateur with an exacting work ethic and as impressive a palate, she writes a personal and motivating memoir. However you feel about her, Agg proves she's a force to be reckoned with (and aspire to). - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>24</p><p>The Accusation by Bandi (House of Anansi)</p><p>Smuggled out of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 25 years after they were written, this pseudonymous collection covers the final years of the rule of Kim Il-sung. Depicting everyday citizens trying to make the best of a bad situation, The Accusation gives a human face to the people living under a brutal regime. - Michael Melgaard( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/the-first-work-of-fiction-smuggled-out-of-north-korea-reveals-life-under-the-kim-dynasty\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/the-first-work-of-fiction-smuggled-out-of-north-korea-reveals-life-under-the-kim-dynasty</url> )</p><p>23</p><p>Birds Art Life by Kyo Maclear (Doubleday Canada)</p><p>Readers often like to know the inspiration behind an author's story, but in Birds Art Life the inspiration is the story. In this charming memoir, a year of urban birding leads to a host of realizations about living creatively. - Paul Taunton</p><p>22</p><p>The Bone Mother by David Demchuk (ChiZine)</p><p>Fairy tales - as in the real kind, the scary kind - form the backbone of this unique debut. In Eastern Europe in the last century, the monsters of the Old World are cornered by the coming wars and mostly eradicated, with their survivors scattered into the New World in what the author has called \"a supernatural diaspora.\" - Paul Taunton</p><p>21</p><p>History of Wolves by Emily Fridlund (HarperCollins)</p><p>It's tough reading a book with a ceaselessly changing timeframe, when a writer barrels through chronology and catches you in their upheaval. Emily Fridlund does this without restraint, apology or fair warning. But somehow it works, and with her debut novel History of Wolves, Fridlund might well find herself literary fiction's newest golden girl. - Terra Arnone( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/supple-fiction-formed-in-able-hands-emily-fridlund-writes-a-literary-winter-in-a-history-of-wolves\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/supple-fiction-formed-in-able-hands-emily-fridlund-writes-a-literary-winter-in-a-history-of-wolves</url> )</p><p>20</p><p>The Dark Dark: Stories by Samantha Hunt (FSG Originals)</p><p>The Dark Dark, more than anything else, is an example of the sheer force of storytelling, of the power of narrative to elicit understanding and emotional response at an unspeakable, unspoken level. What seems at the outset as perhaps a stylistic experiment pays off, repeatedly, at an emotional level, never losing sight of the characters, a regressive storytelling that spirals on the page and in the reader's mind, looping fractally, perhaps endlessly, the shape of chaos made beautiful. - Robert J. Wiersema( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/chaos-made-beautiful-samantha-hunts-the-dark-dark-is-blissfully-unconcerned-with-genre-distinctions\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/chaos-made-beautiful-samantha-hunts-the-dark-dark-is-blissfully-unconcerned-with-genre-distinctions</url> )</p><p>19</p><p>Boundary by Andr\u00e9e A. Michaud; translated by Donald Winkler (Biblioasis)</p><p>Boundary is a book about murder - two, actually - but somehow reads with a warmth and familiarity that makes me question my own subconscious predilections. Michaud's latest spin on thriller easily overtakes the genre's more traditional approaches (many ruling bestseller lists this year); a singular story, entirely unique, but laced with classical crime's nostalgic flair. - Terra Arnone( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/andree-michauds-newest-thriller-straddles-genres-and-the-quebec-maine-border\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/andree-michauds-newest-thriller-straddles-genres-and-the-quebec-maine-border</url> )</p><p>18</p><p>Lost in September by Kathleen Winter (Knopf Canada)</p><p>A finalist for the Governor General's Literary Award and the much-anticipated follow-up to Winter's 2010 bestseller Annabel, Lost in September finds a reincarnated General Wolfe (as in the foil to Montcalme) stricken with PTSD and living on the streets of Montreal. It is an inventive personification of past and present, and the way historical violence bleeds into the future. - Paul Taunton</p><p>17</p><p>Hostage by Guy Delisle (Drawn &amp;; Quarterly)</p><p>A graphic non-fiction account of Christophe Andr\u00e9's kidnapping and imprisonment by Chechen rebels, Delisle creates tension out of a relatively static situation: Andr\u00e9 chained to a radiator in a locked room for over a hundred days, waiting for an opportunity to escape. - Michael Melgaard</p><p>16</p><p>Home Fire by Kamila Shamsie (Riverhead)</p><p>Kamila Shamsie's Home Fire, which made this year's Man Booker longlist, brings Sophocles's Antigone to the now, in five acts, taking the reader from England to Massachusetts to Istanbul to Syria to Pakistan in a story that not only crosses waters but families, in their efforts to reach for something more, weighed down again and again by the anchor of home. - Sadaf Ahsan</p><p>15</p><p>Minds of Winter by Ed O'Loughlin (House of Anansi)</p><p>Minds of Winter( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/nothing-that-is-not-there-and-the-nothing-that-is-minds-of-winter-is-a-haunting-novel-of-the-arctic\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/nothing-that-is-not-there-and-the-nothing-that-is-minds-of-winter-is-a-haunting-novel-of-the-arctic</url> ) is a mystery, sort of, but it's more a profound ode to land, legend, and love. I had good mind for but no money on O'Loughlin bringing home this year's Giller, and his loss doesn't take a thing away from the shortlisted book itself: beautifully drawn and expertly told, Minds of Winter is gripping from the start. - Terra Arnone</p><p>14</p><p>Manhattan Beach by Jennifer Egan (Scribner)</p><p>After the experimentation of her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel-in-stories A Visit From The Goon Squad, a straightforward historical novel might seem a step back for Egan. Perish the thought. Manhattan Beach( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/a-purposeful-departure-jennifer-egan-takes-a-detour-into-the-past-with-manhattan-beach\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/a-purposeful-departure-jennifer-egan-takes-a-detour-into-the-past-with-manhattan-beach</url> ) is at once an utterly convincing historical piece while maintaining a contemporary approach and sensibility. Blending several storylines, Manhattan Beach will break your heart. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>13</p><p>Boundless by Jillian Tamaki (Drawn &amp;; Quarterly)</p><p>Canadian illustrator Jillian Tamaki's latest feels weighed down by nostalgia, by expectation, and by longing; three common bedfellows that here are given new life not only in her mostly black-and-white renderings, but through her anxious eye. It's almost as if she knows something the reader doesn't, instilling an infectious hope from page to page. - Sadaf Ahsan( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/outside-the-lines-in-an-age-of-anxiety-jillian-tamakis-boundless-draws-transcendence\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/outside-the-lines-in-an-age-of-anxiety-jillian-tamakis-boundless-draws-transcendence</url> )</p><p>12</p><p>The Way of the Strangers: Encounters With the Islamic State by Graeme Wood (Random House)</p><p>The winner of the Governor General's Literary Award for nonfiction, The Way of the Strangers is the extension of Wood's Atlantic feature \"What ISIS Really Wants,\" and an expansive but incisive look at why so many around the world have been radicalized. - Paul Taunton</p><p>11</p><p>Transit by Rachel Cusk (HarperCollins)</p><p>It's strange: a novel which largely eschews narrative (renovations are about the only thing that happens in Transit( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/no-narrator-is-an-island-in-transit-rachel-cusk-masters-the-art-of-revealing-the-one-through-the-many\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/no-narrator-is-an-island-in-transit-rachel-cusk-masters-the-art-of-revealing-the-one-through-the-many</url> )) is one of the most powerful assemblages of storytelling of the year, disparate recollections weaving and circling through fundamentally human questions and concerns. A surprising, disarming novel. - Robert J. Wiersema</p><p>10</p><p>Life on the Ground Floor: Letters from the Edge of Emergency Medicine by James Maskalyk (Doubleday Canada)</p><p>In a memoir that won the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction, Dr. James Maskalyk relates the universality of emergency room medicine around the world (and between his two hospitals in Toronto and Addis Ababa in particular), and the shared experience of those who find themselves there. - Paul Taunton</p><p>9</p><p>We'll All Be Burnt in Our Beds One Night by Joel Thomas Hynes (HarperPerennial)</p><p>The winner of the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction, Hynes's newest novel is an epic road trip across Canada and into the past, as Johnny Keough delivers his girlfriend's ashes to a Vancouver beach while reflecting on the series of mistakes - and maybe one last chance - that have brought him there. - Paul Taunton</p><p>8</p><p>Too Much and Not the Mood: Essays by Durga Chew-Bose (HarperCollins)</p><p>It feels like an injustice to describe Chew-Bose's book as a memoir; that genre alone doesn't capture the wide-ranging abstraction of her own memory and thought process. In fact, it feels more like a collection of music than of personal essays, each vignette demanding an emotional pause by the end, to think about what you've just read and then think about it again. - Sadaf Ahsan, on her No. 1 book of 2017</p><p>7</p><p>Annie Muktuk and Other Stories by Norma Dunning (University of Alberta)</p><p>Inuk writer Norma Dunning's debut collection passed under the radar of the big awards despite being the year's best short fiction collection. The stories infuse Inuit myth with reality, explore the effects of colonialism, and delve into settler-writer portrayals of Inuit, all told with heart and humour that is infectious. - Michael Melgaard, on his No. 1 book of 2017</p><p>6</p><p>I Am a Truck by Michelle Winters (Invisible)</p><p>My favourite of 2017; landing top spot entirely despite itself. In fewer pages than the average graduate thesis, Winters uses some inexplicable, paradoxical, somehow decadent simplicity to paint no less than six profound character studies against the backdrop of - wait for it - rural Acadia. Va savoir. - Terra Arnone, on her No. 1 book of 2017</p><p>5</p><p>Seven Fallen Feathers: Racism, Death, and Hard Truths in a Northern City by Tanya Talaga (House of Anansi)</p><p>Tanya Talaga investigates the deaths of seven Indigenous teens in Thunder Bay - Jethro Anderson, Curran Strang, Robyn Harper, Paul Panacheese, Reggie Bushie, Kyle Morrisseau and Jordan Wabasse - searching for answers and offering a deserved censure to the authorities who haven't investigated, or considered the contributing factors, nearly enough. - Paul Taunton</p><p>4</p><p>Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (Random House)</p><p>George Saunders comes in at No. 4 with Lincoln in the Bardo.</p><p>On January 3, 2013 (pay attention to that date), the New York Times wrote of the about-to-be-published Tenth of December, \"George Saunders Has Written The Best Book You'll Read This Year.\" They were right then, and they would have been right if they had said something similar this past January. Lincoln in the Bardo( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/self-googling-in-the-afterlife-i-hope-theres-not-an-extended-interview-with-booker-winner-george-saunders\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/self-googling-in-the-afterlife-i-hope-theres-not-an-extended-interview-with-booker-winner-george-saunders</url> ) was one of the earliest books I read in 2017, and it set the bar for fiction so high few other books even came close. A master class in literary pyrotechnics and fundamental human empathy, Lincoln in the Bardo continues to impress. - Robert J. Wiersema, on his No. 1 book of 2017</p><p>3</p><p>Bellevue Square by Michael Redhill (Doubleday Canada)</p><p>The winner of the 2017 Scotiabank Giller Prize, Bellevue Square is a literary thriller - about a Toronto bookstore owner who becomes obsessed with a doppelg\u00e4nger roaming Kensington Market. Redhill's victory was roundly cheered by fans of his books back to his debut Martin Sloane (2001), itself a finalist for the Giller Prize. - Paul Taunton</p><p>2</p><p>Brother by David Chariandy (McClelland &amp;; Stewart)</p><p>Winner of the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize, Chariandy's sophomore novel further establishes him as one of Canada's best writers. Set in the nascent hip-hop scene of Scarborough in the 1980s, Brother is a deeply emotional story of family, community, and coming to terms with grief. - Michael Melgaard( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/east-of-eatons-david-chariandys-scarborough-set-second-novel-exceeds-expectations\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/east-of-eatons-david-chariandys-scarborough-set-second-novel-exceeds-expectations</url> )</p><p>1</p><p>Son of a Trickster by Eden Robinson (Knopf Canada)</p><p>The book perhaps most widely praised by Canadian prize juries, booksellers and media this year, Son of a Trickster was a finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and a favourite among the National Post's contributors.</p><p>Terra Arnone says, \"Eden Robinson is one of Canada's best writers, wry and somehow subtle in always-weighty subject matter, and Son of a Trickster is one of her finest books.\"</p><p>Robert Wiersema( <url normalizedValue=\"http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/as-slippery-as-a-trickster-tale-should-be-eden-robinsons-son-of-a-trickster-begins-a-promising-humourously-dark-trilogy\">http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/books/book-reviews/as-slippery-as-a-trickster-tale-should-be-eden-robinsons-son-of-a-trickster-begins-a-promising-humourously-dark-trilogy</url> ) says, \"My favourite Canadian novel of the year, a brilliant marriage of teenage-burnout realism and Indigenous mythology, breathtakingly unique in Canadian letters. A propulsive read and, thankfully, just the first volume in a projected trilogy.\"</p><p>For those who think the second instalment of a trilogy is almost always the best, there's a lot to look forward to. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

People are concerned, with good reason, that big tech companies discriminate against conservatives. Numerous conservative outlets have had their videos demonetized on Google's YouTube. PragerU isappealing their loss in a lawsuit over that[1]. A study byThe Western Journalshowedthata change to Facebook's algorithm disproportionately harmed conservative sites[2]. In normal circumstances, this wouldn't be a problem for government to solve, but social media has come to dominate our national conversation. </p><p>Large political websites thrive or die based on changes to Facebook and Google algorithms. Everyone from cable news to newspapers to online-only publicationscreate and tweak their content based on how they think it will play on social media. A study has also shown that Google search results can have afrighteningly large impact on elections[3]:Randomized, controlled experiments conducted with more than 10,000 people from 39 countries suggest that one company alone\u2014Google LLC, which controls about 90 percent of online search in most countries\u2014has likely been determining the outcomes of upwards of 25 percent of the national elections in the world for several years now, with increasing impact each year as Internet penetration has grown.Keep in mind that we're not talking about individuals or even whole industries here; we're talking about unaccountable monopolies with detailed information about hundreds of millions of Americans, billions in cash reserves,and the capability to shape what is discussed and what is not discussed in America in a way that no book, radio show, television show or individual has ever had. Just to give you an idea of their dominance,86percent[4]of web searches in America go through Google and75percentof Americans whoare on the Internet are also on Facebook[5]. Google in particular has leveraged its monopoly to swallow up larger and larger shares of the online market. The company controls YouTube, the go-to source for videos on the web. It also has the single most influential ad company online. Gmail is the most popular email provider. Then there's Google maps, Google Play, Blogger, Android, Google Analytics \u2014it goes on and on and on. How do you take on monopolies withthis sort of dominance and almost infinite levels of cash to buy out any rising competitor? That's the question conservatives keep asking,and the answer is that realistically, you don't. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...=1497732830...8-1...words=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know\">https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...=1497732830...8-1...words=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know</url> by Sir John HawkinsJohn Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters.Buy Now[6]As an individual, youcan leave the platforms if you like\u2014but because of their power and control of the national conversation, you are essentially de-platforming yourself by not using them. A message that doesn't show up on social media might as well be written in a diary. Could their eventual failings or a technology that sidesteps them somehow make them irrelevant? Sure, but that could take decades if it happens at all. What about Congress regulating these businesses? They could certainly do that, but given the power and influence of these companies, it's entirely possible that new regulations might be written tobenefitGoogle and Facebook by making it even tougher for other businesses to compete with them. However, there is another option to deal with this situation that would reduce the power of these companies and serve the public interest. That is breaking these monopolies upinto smaller, more focused entities. This is something with a long historical pedigree in the United States, includingfor Republicans. Teddy Roosevelt was responsible for breaking up the Northern Securities Company. William Howard Taft helped bring down Standard Oil Company. Even Ronald Reagan broke up Ma Bell. Admittedly, breaking up a tech platform is a tricky proposition; people want to use Facebook because other people use Facebook, for example, so the government would probably have little success and win few friends if it tried to force users to divide into Facebook 1 and Facebook 2. What the government can do, however, is separate the core platform from the other products and services these companies provide, thus limiting the amount of power concentrated in a single company's hands.If Google and Facebook were broken up into multiple companiesthis way, there would be more competitors in the marketplace, and the companies would be less able to leverage their dominance in one product to give themselves an unfair advantage for others. We've had a furious debate in this country about Donald Trump and the power he has as president of the United States. However, arguably the second and third most powerful men in America are Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook and Larry Page from Google's parent company, Alphabet. Neither of them was elected to anything, but we are increasingly living in a culture and a media environment dominated by algorithms written by their companies.And if anything, those voicing privacy concerns have dramatically underplayed the scope of the information these tech giants have access to, including Facebook messages and Google searches. EmployeeTristan Harris[7]has said, 'A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today. I don't know a more urgent problem than this. It's changing our democracy, and it's changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.' If you doubt that, fine, but when was the last time you went a week without using Facebook? Google search? Gmail? YouTube? Instagram(owned by Facebook)? Even anti-Google and anti-Facebook articles such asthis one rely on Google and Facebook to get the word out. This is dangerous to our freedom, our culture,and our republic. Moreover, over time the danger is likely to increase, not fade. We can't alleviate that danger entirely, but breaking these monopolies up would go a long way toward safeguarding the interests of the American people.John Hawkins [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/03/29/judge-tosses-prageru-lawsuit-accusing-google-youtube-of-censoring-conservative-content/\">https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/03/29/judge-tosses-prageru-lawsuit-accusing-google-youtube-of-censoring-conservative-content/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/confirmed-facebooks-recent-algorithm-change-is-crushing-conservative-voices-boosting-liberals\">https://www.westernjournal.com/confirmed-facebooks-recent-algorithm-change-is-crushing-conservative-voices-boosting-liberals</url>/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://promarket.org/unprecedented-power-digital-platforms-control-opinions-votes\">https://promarket.org/unprecedented-power-digital-platforms-control-opinions-votes</url>/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america\">http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/all/united-states-of-america</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/01/09/pew-survey-social-media-facebook-linkedin-twitter-instagram-pinterest/21461381/\">https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/01/09/pew-survey-social-media-facebook-linkedin-twitter-instagram-pinterest/21461381/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...=1497732830...8-1...words=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know\">https://www.amazon.com/Things-Young-Adults-Should-Know-ebook/dp/B06XY87BF4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...=1497732830...8-1...words=101+things+all+young+adults+should+know</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-RWNG1032021532658646904251764500145</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RWNG-5118</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWR-44S1-JCMN-Y21W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><timeReceived>2:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Right Wing News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 27, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc.GOOGL[4], Amazon.com Inc. AMZN[5] and FacebookFB[6].Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day[7]:The Container Storeis a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a set of A's for the Zacks Style Score. </p><p>As the aggrssive growth stock strategist here at Zacks Invesment Research, I prefer to see a divergence in growth and value. That will tell me that I am on the right track as a low value score and a high growth score means growth is favored in a particular name. In the case of TCS, there are A's for both, so let's take a deeper look in this Bull of the Day article.DescriptionThe Container Store Group, Inc. engages in the retailing of storage and organization products and solutions in the United States. The company operates in two segments, The Container Store and Elfa. Its retail stores provide various lifestyle products, including closets, collections, and hooks, as well as bath, kitchen, laundry, gift packaging, long-term storage, office, shelving, storage, trash, travel and elfa branded products.The company also designs, manufactures and sells component-based shelving and drawer systems that are customizable for any area of the home, such as closets, kitchens, offices, and garages, as well as made-to-measure sliding doors. As of March 31, 2018, it operated 90 stores. The company also offers its products directly to customers through its Website and call center, as well as sells to various retailers and distributors, and on a wholesale basis. The Container Store Group, Inc. was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Coppell, Texas.Earnings HistoryI see an OK earnings history with two beat and two misses over the last four quarters. In the end, the beats were not as big as the misses but on the whole, the company is profitable.Estimate RevisionsThe recent revision have been positive, with the FY 2020 now looking at $0.49 which is up from $0.44. The next year's number is at $0.51, which is also up five cents over the last 30 days.ValuationI really like the valuation here, with the 14x forward PE and 16x trailing number. The topline growth is just around double digits. The price to book multiple of 1.3x is very low, but so is the 0.4x price to sales multiple. I see margins are improving so the valuation is a good one.Bear of the Day[8]:May was a tough month for stocks across the board. It was even worse to stocks that missed earnings in that month and that is just what happened to ArcBest Corp. Following the earnings miss, the stock has fallen to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is now the Bear of the Day.DescriptionArcBest Corporation provides freight transportation services and solutions. The company's Freight Transportation segment offers transportation of general commodities; motor carrier freight transportation services; business-to-business air transportation services; ocean transport services; global customizable supply chain solutions and integrated warehousing services.Its Premium Logistics ...pedited Freight Services segment provides expedited freight transportation services to commercial and government customers; premium logistics services; and domestic and international freight transportation with air, ocean, and ground service. ArcBest Corporation, formerly known as Arkansas Best Corporation, is headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas.Earnings HistoryBack on May 2, the company reported earnings that were below expectations. The total sales of $711.8M was still an increase of 1.7% on an annual basis, but still below the $724M consensus estimate. It is important to note that while the muiss of 13 cents was a 43% negative earnings surprise, it was the first miss over the last four quarters.Estimate RevisionsFollowing the miss, the estimates for 2019 dropped. The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from $3.69 to $3.38 over the last 60 days. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year slipped from $3.84 to $3.57 over the same time horizon.Research SupportA couple of weeks ago I saw a research note come out suggested that there would not be a freight recession. That same note highlighted ARCB among others as a solid investment oppotunity as most of the names in the group were trading below historic multiples.A call like that takes some guts as the broader market continues to worry about what a trade war might do to transportation names.Additional content:Antitrust Investigations Hit Silicon Valley - AgainAlphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. stocks opened Monday down big, with Amazon down 3% and Google down over 6%. Both companies are facing speculation of an antitrust investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly going after Google, while the Federal Trade Commission is trying to tackle Amazon and Facebook. Amazon closed the day down around 5% while Alphabet closed around -6.5%.Meanwhile, Facebook is just now nearing the end of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and will be paying $3-5 billion for its privacy violations based on reports. Facebook opened Monday down 3% amid the concerns around other tech giants and closed the day down around 7% as the FTC will reportedly be including Facebook in their antitrust investigation.DOJ InvestigationAlphabet's subsidiary Google is under pressure as the DOJ looks to open an investigation into \"Google's business practices related to its search and other businesses,\" as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. With Alphabet being the tech power that it is, it's hard to know exactly what the DOJ is set to look into.Many of the worries seem to be focused on Google's collection of search data and control of the digital advertising market. Google's search engine currently claims about 75% of the worldwide search engine market share for desktops and that number is even higher for mobile and tablet devices. Google also made up 38% of the digital advertising market in 2018, 17% more than its closest competitor, Facebook.Google has faced many investigations in the past, paying out billions to the European Commission over the past few years. The FTC has also previously investigated Google, which ended with Google agreeing to pay a $22.5 million fine after denying any guilt.FTC InvestigationThe Federal Trade Commission has started the first steps of an investigation into Amazon. There is no clear sign of what the FTC will be specifically looking into, but Amazon's control in the online retail sector has always been an area of concern for politicians. This, coupled with its growing influence in multiple markets, make it a prime target.Amazon is also currently under investigation by the European Union who believe Amazon may be stifling competition due to its size. As seen with the previous Google investigation, the European Union is not afraid to fine these big tech companies in the name of consumer protection. The EU also tends to be significantly stricter than the US when it comes to regulation of these large companies.Facebook was added to the investigation after initial reports were focused on just Amazon and Google. The investigation into Facebook will focus on whether or not it stifles competition and has acted in an unlawful and monopolistic nature. This comes on the back of an FTC investigation regarding privacy issues and Facebook's user data collection.Public PressureThese investigations come after the companies and tech giants as a whole have come under bipartisan pressure from government officials. President Trump, backed by other Republicans, has accused Google of having biased search results and has had something of a personal feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.Meanwhile, Democrats have concentrated on whether or not these tech-giants cut off competition. Antitrust regulation has become a main focus of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign and her thoughts have been echoed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Bernie Sanders. With this much support behind the investigations, it could prove troublesome for the companies.This investigation is just in the very early days and although the government pressure is large, all these companies have large legal teams and resources at their disposal so it is nothing to be overly worried about at the moment, but should be watched as it continues to progress.Will you retire a millionaire?One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire.

Hayes's wife, Lucy, took to her bed with a headache. The returns from the Presidential election were trickling in, and the Hayeses, who had been spending the evening in their parlor, in Columbus, Ohio, were dismayed. Hayes himself remained up until midnight; then he, too, retired, convinced that his Democratic opponent, Samuel J. Tilden, would become the next President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hayes had indeed lost the popular vote, by more than two hundred and fifty thousand ballots. And he might have lost the Electoral College as well had it not been for the machinations of journalists working in the shady corners of what's been called \"the Victorian Internet.\"</p><p>Chief among the plotters was an Ohioan named William Henry Smith. Smith ran the western arm of the Associated Press, and in this way controlled the bulk of the copy that ran in many small-town newspapers. The Western A.P. operated in tight affiliation-some would say collusion-with Western Union, which exercised a near-monopoly over the nation's telegraph lines. Early in the campaign, Smith decided that he would employ any means necessary to assure a victory for Hayes, who, at the time, was serving a third term as Ohio's governor. In the run-up to the Republican National Convention, Smith orchestrated the release of damaging information about the Governor's rivals. Then he had the Western A.P. blare Hayes's campaign statements and mute Tilden's. At one point, an unflattering piece about Hayes appeared in the Chicago Times, a Democratic paper. (The piece claimed that Hayes, who had been a general in the Union Army, had accepted money from a soldier to give to the man's family, but had failed to pass it on when the soldier died.) The A.P. flooded the wires with articles discrediting the story.</p><p>Once the votes had been counted, attention shifted to South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana-states where the results were disputed. Both parties dispatched emissaries to the three states to try to influence the Electoral College outcome. Telegrams sent by Tilden's representatives were passed on to Smith, courtesy of Western Union. Smith, in turn, shared the contents of these dispatches with the Hayes forces. This proto-hack of the Democrats' private communications gave the Republicans an obvious edge. Meanwhile, the A.P. sought and distributed legal opinions supporting Hayes. (Outraged Tilden supporters took to calling it the \"Hayesociated Press.\") As Democrats watched what they considered to be the theft of the election, they fell into a funk.</p><p>\"They are full of passion and want to do something desperate but hardly know how to,\" one observer noted. Two days before Hayes was inaugurated, on March 5, 1877, the New York Sun appeared with a black border on the front page. \"These are days of humiliation, shame and mourning for every patriotic American,\" the paper's editor wrote.</p><p>History, Mark Twain is supposed to have said, doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Once again, the President of the United States is a Republican who lost the popular vote. Once again, he was abetted by shadowy agents who manipulated the news. And once again Democrats are in a finger-pointing funk.</p><p>Journalists, congressional committees, and a special counsel are probing the details of what happened last fall. But two new books contend that the large lines of the problem are already clear. As in the eighteen-seventies, we are in the midst of a technological revolution that has altered the flow of information. Now, as then, just a few companies have taken control, and this concentration of power-which Americans have acquiesced to without ever really intending to, simply by clicking away-is subverting our democracy.</p><p>Thirty years ago, almost no one used the Internet for anything. Today, just about everybody uses it for everything. Even as the Web has grown, however, it has narrowed. Google now controls nearly ninety per cent of search advertising, Facebook almost eighty per cent of mobile social traffic, and Amazon about seventy-five per cent of e-book sales. Such dominance, Jonathan Taplin argues, in \"Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy\" (Little, Brown), is essentially monopolistic. In his account, the new monopolies are even more powerful than the old ones, which tended to be limited to a single product or service. Carnegie, Taplin suggests, would have been envious of the reach of Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Taplin, who until recently directed the Annenberg Innovation Lab, at the University of Southern California, started out as a tour manager. He worked with Judy Collins, Bob Dylan, and the Band, and also with George Harrison, on the Concert for Bangladesh. In \"Move Fast and Break Things,\" Taplin draws extensively on this experience to illustrate the damage, both deliberate and collateral, that Big Tech is wreaking.</p><p>Consider the case of Levon Helm. He was the drummer for the Band, and, though he never got rich off his music, well into middle age he was supported by royalties. In 1999, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. That same year, Napster came along, followed by YouTube, in 2005. Helm's royalty income, which had run to about a hundred thousand dollars a year, according to Taplin, dropped \"to almost nothing.\" When Helm died, in 2012, millions of people were still listening to the Band's music, but hardly any of them were paying for it. (In the years between the founding of Napster and Helm's death, total consumer spending on recorded music in the United States dropped by roughly seventy per cent.) Friends had to stage a benefit for Helm's widow so that she could hold on to their house.</p><p>Google entered and more or less immediately took over the music business when it acquired YouTube, in 2006, for $1.65 billion in stock. As Taplin notes, just about \"every single tune in the world is available on YouTube as a simple audio file (most of them posted by users).\" Many of these files are illegal, but to Google this is inconsequential. Under the Digital Media Copyright Act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton shortly after Google went live, Internet service providers aren't liable for copyright infringement as long as they \"expeditiously\" take down or block access to the material once they're notified of a problem. Musicians are constantly filing \"takedown\" notices-in just the first twelve weeks of last year, Google received such notices for more than two hundred million links-but, often, after one link is taken down, the song goes right back up at another one. In the fall of 2011, legislation aimed at curbing online copyright infringement, the Stop Online Piracy Act, was introduced. It had bipartisan support in Congress, and backing from such disparate groups as the National District Attorneys Association, the National League of Cities, the Association of Talent Agencies, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In January, 2012, the bill seemed headed toward passage, when Google decided to flex its market-concentrated muscles. In place of its usual colorful logo, the company posted on its search page a black rectangle along with the message \"Tell Congress: Please don't censor the web!\" The resulting traffic overwhelmed congressional Web sites, and support for the bill evaporated. (Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, who had been one of the bill's co-sponsors, denounced it on Facebook.)</p><p>Google itself doesn't pirate music; it doesn't have to. It's selling the traffic-and, just as significant, the data about the traffic. Like the Koch brothers, Taplin observes, Google is \"in the extraction industry.\" Its business model is \"to extract as much personal data from as many people in the world at the lowest possible price and to resell that data to as many companies as possible at the highest possible price.\" And so Google profits from just about everything: cat videos, beheadings, alt-right rants, the Band performing \"The Weight\" at Woodstock, in 1969.</p><p>\"I wasn't always so skeptical,\" Franklin Foer announces at the start of \"World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech\" (Penguin Press). Franklin, the eldest of the three famous Foer brothers, is a journalist, and he began his career, in the mid-nineties, working for Slate, which had then just been founded by Microsoft. The experience, Foer writes, was \"exhilarating.\" Later, he became the editor of The New Republic. The magazine was on the brink of ruin when, in 2012, it was purchased by Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, whose personal fortune was estimated at half a billion dollars.</p><p>Foer saw Hughes as a \"savior,\" who could provide, in addition to cash, \"an insider's knowledge of social media\" and \"a millennial imprimatur.\" The two men set out to revitalize the magazine, hiring high-priced talent and redesigning the Web site. Foer recounts that he became so consumed with monitoring traffic to the magazine's site, using a tool called Chartbeat, that he checked it even while standing at the urinal.</p><p>The era of good feeling didn't last. In the fall of 2014, Foer heard that Hughes had hired someone to replace him, and that this shadow editor was \"lunching around New York offering jobs at The New Republic.\" Before Hughes had a chance to fire him, Foer quit, and most of the magazine's editorial staff left with him. \"World Without Mind\" is a reflection on Foer's experiences and on the larger forces reshaping American arts and letters, or what's nowadays often called \"content.\"</p><p>\"I hope this book doesn't come across as fueled by anger, but I don't want to deny my anger either,\" he writes. \"The tech companies are destroying something precious.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. They have eroded the integrity of institutions-media, publishing-that supply the intellectual material that provokes thought and guides democracy. Their most precious asset is our most precious asset, our attention, and they have abused it.\"</p><p>Much of Foer's anger, like Taplin's, is directed at piracy. \"Once an underground, amateur pastime,\" he writes, \"the bootlegging of intellectual property\" has become \"an accepted business practice.\" He points to the Huffington Post, since shortened to HuffPost, which rose to prominence largely by aggregating-or, if you prefer, pilfering-content from publications like the Times and the Washington Post. Then there's Google Books. Google set out to scan every book in creation and make the volumes available online, without bothering to consult the copyright holders. (The project has been hobbled by lawsuits.) Newspapers and magazines (including this one) have tried to disrupt the disrupters by placing articles behind paywalls, but, Foer contends, in the contest against Big Tech publishers can't win; the lineup is too lopsided. \"When newspapers and magazines require subscriptions to access their pieces, Google and Facebook tend to bury them,\" he writes. \"Articles protected by stringent paywalls almost never have the popularity that algorithms reward with prominence.\"</p><p>Foer acknowledges that prominence and popularity have always mattered in publishing. In every generation, the primary business of journalism has been to stay in business. In the nineteen-eighties, Dick Stolley, the founding editor of People, developed what might be thought of as an algorithm for the pre-digital age. It was a formula for picking cover images, and it ran as follows: Young is better than old. Pretty is better than ugly. Rich is better than poor. Movies are better than music. Music is better than television. Television is better than sports. And anything is better than politics.</p><p>But Stolley's Law is to Chartbeat what a Boy Scout's compass is to G.P.S. It is now possible to determine not just which covers sell magazines but which articles are getting the most traction, who's e-mailing and tweeting them, and how long individual readers are sticking with them before clicking away. This sort of detailed information, combined with the pressure to generate traffic, has resulted in what Foer sees as a golden age of banality. He cites the \"memorable yet utterly forgettable example\" of Cecil the lion. In 2015, Cecil was shot with an arrow outside Hwange National Park, in Zimbabwe, by a dentist from Minnesota. For whatever reason, the killing went viral and, according to Foer, \"every news organization\" (including, once again, this one) rushed to get in on the story, \"so it could scrape some traffic from it.\" He lists with evident scorn the titles of posts from Vox-\"Eating Chicken Is Morally Worse Than Killing Cecil the Lion\"-and The Atlantic's Web site: \"From Cecil the Lion to Climate Change: A Perfect Storm of Outrage.\" (In July, Cecil's son, Xanda, was shot, prompting another digital outpouring.)</p><p>Donald Trump, Foer argues, represents \"the culmination\" of this trend. In the lead-up to the campaign, Trump's politics, such as they were, consisted of empty and outrageous claims. Although none deserved to be taken seriously, many had that coveted viral something. Trump's utterances as a candidate were equally appalling, but on the Internet apparently nobody knows you're a demagogue. \"Trump began as Cecil the Lion, and then ended up president of the United States,\" Foer writes.</p><p>Both Taplin and Foer begin their books with a discussion of the early days of personal computers, when the Web was still a Pynchonesque fantasy and lots of smart people believed that connecting the world's PCs would lead to a more peaceful, just, and groovy society. Both cite Stewart Brand, who, after hanging out with Ken Kesey, dropping a lot of acid, and editing \"The Whole Earth Catalog,\" went on to create one of the first virtual networks, the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, otherwise known as WELL.</p><p>In an influential piece that appeared in Rolling Stone in 1972, Brand prophesied that, when computers became widely available, everyone would become a \"computer bum\" and \"more empowered as individuals and co-operators.\" This, he further predicted, could enhance \"the richness and rigor of spontaneous creation and human interaction.\" No longer would it be the editors at the Times and the Washington Post and the producers at CBS News who decided what the public did (or didn't) learn. No longer would the suits at the entertainment companies determine what the public did (or didn't) hear.</p><p>\"The Internet was supposed to be a boon for artists,\" Taplin observes. \"It was supposed to eliminate the 'gatekeepers'-the big studios and record companies that decide which movies and music get widespread distribution.\" Silicon Valley, Foer writes, was supposed to be a liberating force-\"the disruptive agent that shatters the grip of the sclerotic, self-perpetuating mediocrity that constitutes the American elite.\"</p><p>The Internet revolution has, indeed, sent heads rolling, as legions of bookstore owners, music critics, and cirrhotic editors can attest. But Brand's dream, Taplin and Foer argue, has not been realized. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple-Europeans refer to the group simply as GAFA-didn't eliminate the gatekeepers; they took their place. Instead of becoming more egalitarian, the country has become less so: the gap between America's rich and poor grows ever wider. Meanwhile, politically, the nation has lurched to the right. In Foer's telling, it would be a lot easier to fix an election these days than it was in 1876, and a lot harder for anyone to know about it. All the Big Tech firms would have to do is tinker with some algorithms. They have become, Foer writes, \"the most imposing gatekeepers in human history.\"</p><p>This is a simple, satisfying narrative, and it allows Taplin and Foer to focus their ire on GAFA gazillionaires, like Zuckerberg and Larry Page. But, as an account of the \"unpresidented\" world in which we live, it seems to miss the point. Say what you will about Silicon Valley, most of its major players backed Hillary Clinton. This is confirmed by campaign-finance filings and, as it happens, by the Russian hack of Democratic National Committee e-mails. \"I hope you are well-thinking of all of you often and following every move!\" Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, wrote to Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, at one point.</p><p>It is troubling that Facebook, Google, and Amazon have managed to grab for themselves such a large share of online revenue while relying on content created by others. Quite possibly, it is also anti-competitive. Still, it seems a stretch to blame GAFA for the popularity of listicles or fake news.</p><p>Last fall, some Times reporters went looking for the source of a stream of largely fabricated pro-Trump stories that had run on a Web site called Departed. They traced them to a twenty-two-year-old computer-science student in Tbilisi named Beqa Latsabidze. He told the Times that he had begun the election season by pumping out flattering stories about Hillary Clinton, but the site hadn't generated much interest. When he switched to pro-Trump nonsense, traffic had soared, and so had the site's revenues. \"For me, this is all about income,\" Latsabidze said. Perhaps the real problem is not that Brand's prophecy failed but that it came true. A \"computer bum\" sitting in Tbilisi is now so \"empowered\" as an individual that he can help turn an election halfway around the world.</p><p>Either out of conviction or simply out of habit, the gatekeepers of yore set a certain tone. They waved through news about state budget deficits and arms-control talks, while impeding the flow of loony conspiracy theories. Now Chartbeat allows everyone to see just how many (or, more to the point, how few) readers there really are for that report on the drought in South Sudan or that article on monopoly power and the Internet. And so it follows that there will be fewer such reports and fewer such articles. The Web is designed to give people what they want, which, for better or worse, is also the function of democracy.</p><p>Post-Cecil, post-fact, and mid-Trump, is there anything to be done? Taplin proposes a few fixes. To start, he wants the federal government to treat companies like Google and Facebook as monopolies and regulate them accordingly. (Relying on similar thinking, regulators in the European Union recently slapped Google with a $2.7-billion fine.)</p><p>Taplin notes that, in the late nineteen-forties, the U.S. Department of Justice went after A.T. &amp; T., the Google of its day, for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The consent decree in the case, signed in 1956, compelled A.T.\u00a0&amp;\u00a0T. to license all the patents owned by its research arm, Bell Labs, for a small fee. (One of the technologies affected by the decree was the transistor, which later proved essential to computers.) Google, he argues, could be similarly compelled to license its thousands of patents, including those for search algorithms, cell-phone operating systems, self-driving cars, smart thermostats, advertising exchanges, and virtual-reality platforms.</p><p>\"It would seem that such a licensing program would be totally in line with Google's stated 'Don't be evil' corporate philosophy,\" Taplin writes. At the same time, he urges musicians and filmmakers to take matters into their own hands by establishing their own distribution networks, along the lines of Magnum Photos, formed by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and others in 1947.</p><p>\"What if artists ran a video and audio streaming site as a nonprofit cooperative (perhaps employing the technology in some of those free Google patents)?\" he asks at one point. \"I have no illusion that the existing business structures of cultural marketing will go away,\" he observes at another. \"But my hope is that we can build a parallel structure that will benefit all creators.\"</p><p>Foer prefers the model of artisanal cheesemakers. ( \"World Without Mind\" apparently went to press before Amazon announced its intention to buy Whole Foods.) \"The culture industries need to present themselves as the organic alternative, a symbol of status and aspiration,\" he writes. \"Subscriptions are the route away from the aisles of clickbait.\" Just after the election, he notes, the Times added more than a hundred thousand new subscribers by marketing itself as a fake-news antidote. And, as an act of personal resistance, he suggests picking up a book. \"If the tech companies hope to absorb the totality of human existence,\" he writes, \"then reading on paper is one of the few slivers of life that they can't fully integrate.\"</p><p>These remedies are all backward-looking. They take as a point of reference a world that has vanished, or is about to. (If Amazon has its way, even artisanal cheese will soon be delivered by drone.) Depending on how you look at things, this is either a strange place for meditations about the future to end up or a predictable one. People who worry about the fate of democracy still write (and read) books. Those who are determining it prefer to tweet.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_0817_29</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PDH-4VS1-DYWH-914N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3477\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6038-8GC1-F0NT-H4KF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy.

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6026-DHB1-F0NT-H0RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6037-Y7P1-F0NT-H3YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602D-2M91-F0NT-H1CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism.

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603M-RGY1-F0NT-H085-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.  In New York, for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, with its main priorities being telehealth, remote learning and broadband. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in to help create \"a smarter education system\".  The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for digital disruption. American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.  As author and activist Naomi Klein writes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Intercept</emphasis>, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".  All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. </p><p>The control revolution The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.  After World War II, the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.  The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Information economics Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".  Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.  These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.  By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.  Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".  By the 1990s, this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s, it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions -\u00a0 could not dislodge it. Market society This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6026-3DY1-F0NT-H03N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.  Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.  Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour.  As media theorist and author Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.  This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.  To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.  Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice.  Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. In praise of obscurity The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.  Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity.  Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\", according to Matthew Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture.  Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which citizens can enact their democratic rights.  The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.  The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity as an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-boosting-the-big-tech-transformation-to-warp-speed-138537\">first published</url> on</emphasis>\u00a0The Conversation.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/industries/retail/attract-customers-to-stores-after-lockdowns/\">NOW READ: Australia re-opens: Seven ways to increase the likelihood customers will return to your store</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/coronavirus/google-tool-retailers-covid19/\">NOW READ: The new Google tool helping retailers respond to changing consumer behaviour</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602D-CPX1-JD6R-T041-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1139\"/><timeReceived>12:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This debate is a by-product of major changes to capital market structure over the last few decades. It reflects concern about the rise of institutional investors, the growth of index investing, and increasing ownership concentration in financial markets. (1)</p><p>\"Common ownership\" (which is sometimes used synonymously with the terms \"horizontal shareholding\" or \"overlapping shareholding\") (2) describes the situation where large financial institutions with widely diversified portfolios own shares in competing companies within a particular economic sector. (3) A number of scholars (described in this Article as \"anti-common ownership scholars\") have argued that, even where these institutions have relatively small ownership stakes, their collective holdings in competing companies produce anticompetitive effects in a range of corporate governance contexts, such as mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) (4) and executive compensation. (5) The basis for this claim is that, in such circumstances, the institutions are interested in the financial performance of their portfolios as a whole, rather than the performance of individual companies in that sector. (6)</p><p>Although the common ownership debate began in the United States, it is now attracting attention around the world. (7) For example, European intergovernmental and regulatory organizations have focused on the debate, (8) which also has clear relevance to certain jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific region. (9) This is particularly true of Australia, given the distinctive role and large size of superannuation/pension funds in Australian capital markets (10) and the concentration of certain industries, such as the banking and finance sector. (11)</p><p>The aim of this Article is to contextualize the common ownership theory within a broad range of international corporate governance developments relating to institutional investment since the early 1990s. The structure of the Article is as follows. Part II discusses the impact on legal scholarship of the common ownership theory, which commenced in the field of financial economics. Part III examines three possible narratives that exist in the literature relating to institutional investors and common ownership. Part IV analyzes certain aspects of the common ownership theory in the light of contemporary corporate governance developments and debate, and Part V concludes the Article and argues that drawing regulatory and policy conclusions from current mixed empirical evidence is premature.</p><p>II. LAW'S DISCOVERY OF AN \"ECONOMIC BLOCKBUSTER\"</p><p>At the turn of the twenty-first century, a team of financial economists, Professor Rafael La Porta et al., postulated that \"law matters\" when it comes to the structure of capital markets. (12) The hypothesis claimed that jurisdictions with high levels of legal protection for minority shareholders would develop deep liquid capital markets like those in the United States and the United Kingdom. (13) The \"law matters\" hypothesis had significant policy implications for regulation and law reform (14) and proved highly influential in both economics and law. (15)</p><p>Almost twenty years on, recent scholarship concerning common ownership provides a strong counterpoint to the \"law matters\" hypothesis in terms of its policy implications for capital market regulation. According to anti--common ownership scholars, the problem today is that fund flows to deep capital markets occur via a small number of increasingly powerful financial intermediaries with highly diversified portfolios. (16)</p><p>Like the \"law matters\" hypothesis, the common ownership theory originated in economic literature, but subsequently emerged in legal scholarship, where it has had a major impact. In a high profile 2016 Harvard Law Review article, Professor Einer Elhauge described the argument that common ownership has anticompetitive effects as a recently exposed \"economic blockbuster.\" (17) Anti-common ownership scholars have referred to the rise of institutional investors as \"[t]he great, but mostly unknown, antitrust story of our time,\" (18) and \"a smoking gun.\" (19)</p><p>There have been major changes to capital market structure over the last few decades, and these changes lie at the heart of the common ownership theory. Today, the dominant shareholders of public companies in many, but by no means all, (20) jurisdictions are institutional intermediaries. The growth in financial intermediation in savings and investment decisions was foreseen from at least the 1970s by commentators, such as Peter Drucker (21) and Professor Robert Clark. (22) As anti--common ownership scholars have noted, however, financial intermediation investment channels are now highly concentrated. (23) The alleged culprits behind the common ownership theory are major financial institutions, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors. (24) A frequently cited statistic is that the combined holdings of these institutions (the so-called Big Three) (25) constitute the largest investment group in 88 percent of all S&amp;P 500 firms, (26) and this concentration is increasing. (27)</p><p>The common ownership theory is linked not only to institutional investors but also to a particular type of investment--index investing. (28) There has been massive growth in index funds, including both index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), (29) which has led some commentators to ask whether index funds are \"eating the world.\" (30) Index investing, which relies upon wide stock performance diversification, (31) has become the new default investment option for major financial institutions. According to BlackRock, for example, index investing is now a \"cornerstone\" of modern investment practice. (32)</p><p>Index funds, which have been described as \"autopilot portfolios,\" (33) track stock indices (34) rather than attempting to beat the market. (35) They feature prominently in the literature discussing common ownership; however, it is important to note the implications of the common ownership theory are, in fact, far broader than this form of investing and also include actively managed funds. (36)</p><p>In contrast to the \"law matters\" hypothesis, which regarded deep capital markets propelled by institutional investment as a desirable corporate governance outcome, anti-common ownership scholars view this form of diversified shareholding across concentrated product markets as deeply problematic. (37) They claim that there is empirical evidence to show that common ownership results in reduced competition and higher consumer prices in certain sectors. (38) The sectors targeted for academic scrutiny to date are the technology, airline, banking, and pharmaceutical industries. (39) An influential economics paper by Professor Jose Azar et al., for example, claims that common ownership by the largest institutional investors in the US airline sector resulted in reduced competition and higher airline ticket prices for customers. (40) Yet, according to Elhauge, the industries identified so far are merely the tip of the iceberg, and numerous other sectors are equally \"plagued\" by common ownership. (41)</p><p>Anti--common ownership scholars warn that the growth of shareholder diversification could have a variety of dire consequences, (42) potentially undermining the entire economy, (43) with harmful effects on consumer welfare and equality, (44) employment and wages, (45) and society as a whole. (46) The regulatory solutions suggested by some scholars to the supposed problems of the growth of institutional investors and common ownership are suitably Draconian. (47) They include depriving index funds of their voting rights; (48) restricting institutional investor share ownership to no more than one company in an oligarchy; and allowing institutional investors to hold shares in competing companies, only if those holdings do not exceed 1 percent, with forced divestiture in the case of noncompliance. (49)</p><p>III. THREE POSSIBLE NARRATIVES CONCERNING COMMON OWNERSHIP</p><p>At least three possible narratives might be derived from increased portfolio diversification by institutional investors, which is frequently in the form of common ownership across the same industry. Scholarship concerning the phenomenon of common ownership often shifts between these narratives, without necessarily specifying which version it is addressing. (50)</p><p>Version 1, which might be labelled \"the lazy investor narrative,\" focuses on the general incentives and behavior of fund managers. The argument here is that portfolio diversification, particularly across companies in the same economic sector, may result in perverse or inadequate incentives for institutional investors to engage in strong monitoring. (51) This narrative suggests that, particularly from a costbenefit analysis, it may not make sense for fund managers to adopt a private investor/owner-like stance toward individual companies in a widely diversified portfolio (52) and that rational apathy will therefore prevail. (53)</p><p>This narrative assumes that lack of interest by institutional investors in the performance of individual portfolio firms will be harmful to the company's performance. It suggests that lazy investors inevitably breed lazy managers, (54) whose desire to enjoy \"the quiet life\" (55) will override their responsibilities to the company and its shareholders. In this narrative, lack of attention by institutional investors enables the portfolio firm's managers to call the shots in favor of their own preferences and self-interest.</p><p>This was a familiar part of the so-called passivity story of the 1990s. (56) The underlying presumption in corporate governance literature during this period was that monitoring by institutional investors is a positive feature of corporate governance, and nonparticipation by such investors is a corporate governance problem in need of a solution. (57) Academic literature during the 1990s sought to find ways to overcome the legal and economic barriers to greater institutional investor engagement in corporate governance. (58)</p><p>Recent articles, by Professor Dorothy Lund and Professors Lucian Bebchuk and Scott Hirst, represent modern incarnations of this narrative. (59) Lund, for example, has argued within this paradigm that index funds are quintessentially passive and ignorant investors, with inadequate incentives to monitor management. (60) Bebchuk and Hirst are also concerned that index fund managers have incentives to underinvest in stewardship and to be overly deferential to the managers of portfolio companies. (61)</p><p>Yet, although the articles by these scholars reveal similar concerns, their regulatory prescriptions are quite different. Lund effectively adopts a punitive approach, arguing that index funds, as innately lazy investors, should therefore be deprived of their voting rights. (62) Bebchuk and Hirst, on the other hand, are more sanguine, suggesting reforms to counteract current incentives that nudge index fund managers toward passivity. (63) Their goal is to make index fund voting better informed and meaningful. (64)</p><p>Bebchuk and Hirst's approach is consistent with the policy goals in many parts of the world, where the aim is to increase, not decrease, corporate governance engagement by institutional investors, including index funds. (65) Lund's proposal, however, directly conflicts with those policy goals. (66) Furthermore, discrimination of the kind advocated by Lund could be unlawful in jurisdictions where a one-vote-per-share policy prevails. (67) It is interesting to note, for example, that, in Australia, an attempt to alter the corporate constitution of a company to disenfranchise institutional investors was struck down by the court on the basis that such inherent discrimination between different shareholder groups constituted fraud on the minority. (68)</p><p>Versions 2 and 3 of the possible common ownership narratives differ significantly from Version 1. Whereas Version 1 raises concerns about lack of engagement by institutional investors, Version 2 suggests that they are too involved in corporate governance. Also, whereas Version 1 focuses on the danger of uncontrolled power by corporate managers, Versions 2 and 3 are underpinned by concern about the behavior and/or power of institutional investors themselves.</p><p>According to Version 2, which might be described as \"the anticompetitive pressure model,\" where common ownership occurs across the same economic sector, institutional investors will have skewed incentives, leading them to abuse their ownership rights by pressuring managers of investee firms to act in an anticompetitive or collusive fashion. This narrative would seem to suggest that common ownership involves situations where institutional investors pressure managers of investee companies to engage in anticompetitive conduct. (69)</p><p>This interpretation of Version 2 appears to require active conduct by institutional investors to subvert competition between portfolio companies in the same sector. Such an interpretation accords with Professor Richard Buxbaum's suggestion almost twenty years ago that \"a totally passive investor ... may be easier to accept than an active one.\" (70)</p><p>At first sight, this interpretation of Version 2 would seem to exclude index funds on the basis that they are passive investors only. Nonetheless, there is a broader interpretation of Version 2, which is capable of including index funds, by challenging the accuracy of their depiction as \"passive investors.\" (71) It has been argued, for example, that, although index investors cannot vote on, or influence, the competitive strategies of their portfolio firms, (72) they, nonetheless, behave as active investors when they exercise rights attached to their shares with respect to governance matters (such as nomination of board members, executive compensation) and engage in dialogue with management. (73)</p><p>Indeed, large asset managers themselves reject the notion that they are \"passive.\" Vanguard has stated, for example, \"[w]e believe that our active engagement demonstrates that passive investors don't need to be passive owners.\" (74) Similarly, BlackRock has criticized the supposed dichotomy between active and passive shareholders as superficial, suggesting that most traditional asset managers adopt an approach midway between these two outer points. (75) Also, the majority of index funds are not stand-alone funds. (76) Rather, they are part of investment fund families, which will include active funds, and this may provide index funds with incentives to improve the corporate governance of a given company, in circumstances where that would improve performance of the fund family as a whole. (77) Moreover, even when index funds track a particular index, fund managers will have some discretion in terms of the relative weighting they give to stock in that index. (78)</p><p>Institutional investors have also stressed that, since they are effectively locked into their investment for the long term, they need to engage with the managers of the companies in which they invest. (79) Under Version 1 of the common ownership narrative, increased engagement in corporate governance by large institutional investors reflects good corporate governance. (80) Under the more expansive interpretation of Version 2, it is dangerous, in that it potentially involves transmission of anticompetitive incentives to portfolio firms. (81)</p><p>Version 3 of the common ownership narrative does a significant pivot in terms of perspective. Unlike Version 2, which examines the incentives and behavior of institutional investors, Version 3 instead focuses solely on the incentives and behavior of corporate managers of the investee firms, albeit under the shadow of institutional investor power. In so doing, Version 3 eliminates the need to show any misuse of share ownership rights by institutional investors; it is immaterial whether investors are active or passive. Under Version 3, which might be called \"the mindreading model,\" it is sufficient that the corporate managers of the portfolio firm are aware that common ownership exists in their sector, on the basis that this awareness allows them to discern, and follow, the presumed anticompetitive preferences of large diversified investors. (82) Adopting the mindreading model, some anti--common ownership scholars have predicted that managers who correctly divine institutional investor preferences by \"either conscious calculation, intuition, or pure luck\" (83) will tend to be selected to run the firm. (84) In evolutionary terms, this would appear to be a variant of natural selection. (85)</p><p>Version 3 of the common ownership narrative goes substantially further than Version 2. Under Version 3, the allegedly anticompetitive incentives are \"purely structural,\" (86) deriving from the mere fact of common ownership. Indeed, under this version of the common ownership narrative, it is irrelevant that: all the financial interests are merely minority shareholdings; (87) the institutional investors have not themselves engaged in any conduct to achieve anticompetitive ends; (88) there has been no attempt by institutional investors to communicate with, or influence, managers of the portfolio company; (89) and there is no coordination or collusion between managers of competing companies. (90)</p><p>According to Elhauge, who adopts Version 3 of the common ownership narrative, where institutional investors own shares in competing companies, those investors are liable under US antitrust law if their pattern of ownership lessens competition, regardless of whether they have undertaken any positive actions to contribute to such an outcome. (91) This is a startling proposition. It is reminiscent of Justice Louis Brandeis's comment more than a hundred years ago that \"[t]here is no such thing ... as an innocent stockholder.\" (92)</p><p>IV. THE THEORY OF COMMON OWNERSHIP FROM A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE</p><p>The common ownership theory subverts many fundamental tenets of contemporary corporate governance concerning the desirability of increased shareholder engagement. Version 3 of the common ownership narrative posits that mere ownership of shares by institutional investors across concentrated industries can ipso facto breach competition laws. This is a sufficiently disquieting proposition as to warrant close scrutiny of the common ownership theory from a corporate governance perspective. There are a number of points that can be made about the common ownership theory, which suggest possible weaknesses in its conclusions.</p><p>A. Common Ownership Is a Controversial and Broad-Brush Theory</p><p>In spite of its early academic impact, it is worth remembering that the common ownership theory is just that--a theory--and that theorizing about the possible anticompetitive effects of common ownership on managerial incentives does not prove that those effects occur in practice. (93) Nor does it prove that any anticompetitive behavior which does exist is caused by common ownership. (94) A recent empirical study by Professor Erik Gilje, et al., (95) for example, provides data to assess the extent to which the theory represents reality, and its findings suggest that in many instances, the empirical evidence does not conform to theory in relation to common ownership. (96)</p><p>Not only is the common ownership argument just a theory, it is also a very broad-brush theory, which contains several puzzling elements. For example, one curious aspect of the mindreading model, Version 3 of the common ownership narrative, is why corporate managers would, without any pressure or direction, act in the presumed interests of institutional investors with diversified portfolios. Elhauge suggests that corporate managers might behave in this way for a litany of possible reasons--\"out of a sense of fiduciary duty or gratitude, to gain support in future elections, to enhance future job prospects, because executive compensation methods align with shareholder interests, or so their shareholders will fend off takeover threats.\" (97) Also, discerning institutional investors' presumed preferences under Version 3 will be no easy task. Those interests and preferences are heterogeneous and constantly in flux, rendering the assessment that corporate managers are required to make difficult and prone to miscalculation. (98)</p><p>Such far-reaching suppositions about the means by which anticompetitive incentives might be transmitted from institutional investors to corporate managers suggest the need for further empirical research, like the Gilje et al. study,\" to bring greater clarity to the investigation of whether corporate managers actually behave in this way and, if they do, why this occurs and under what circumstances. A growing number of studies have challenged the empirical underpinnings of the common ownership theory, (100) and the mechanisms, including executive remuneration, (101) which have been suggested might provide the necessary conduit for transmission of anticompetitive incentives to corporate management. (102)</p><p>B. The Common Ownership Theory Includes Some Questionable Underlying Presumptions</p><p>The common ownership argument also includes several questionable presumptions in reaching its conclusion that corporate managers will behave in an anticompetitive way. As already noted, Version 2 of the common ownership narrative surmises that institutional investors will exert anticompetitive pressure on corporate managers of investee firms. Version 3 goes further, by suggesting that institutional investors, including index funds, are so powerful that the corporate managers will do their presumed bidding, even in the absence of such pressure. Shareholder power and participation in corporate governance in the United States has undoubtedly increased in recent years, (103) but are institutional investors as formidable as anticommon ownership scholars suggest?</p><p>Versions 2 and 3 of the common ownership narrative contradict the traditional image of the institutional investor as passive (104) and a \"paper colossus,\" (105) since they presume high levels of institutional investor influence. In fact, US shareholders have far fewer statutorily guaranteed corporate governance participatory rights than shareholders in other common law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Australia. (106) Also, recent studies highlight the fact that institutional investors direct relatively limited resources towards corporate monitoring. (107) These studies show that investment managers of mutual funds, both indexed and actively managed, have incentives to spend negligible amounts on stewardship, (108) and to side excessively with managers of corporations. (109) These studies suggest that, rather than corporate managers bending to institutional investors' pressure (Version 2) or presumed preferences (Version 3), institutional investors, in fact, generally follow the lead of the corporate managers. (110) Also, even when investors do flex their muscles by, for example, seeking stronger governance rights, management often responds by engaging in \"private ordering combat,\" (111) to try to modify or dilute the rights sought by shareholders. (112)</p><p>C. Recognition of the Link Between Concentrated Ownership and Antitrust Law Is Not New</p><p>The references to common ownership by institutional investors as a \"blockbuster\" discovery, (113) and its description as the \"great, but mostly unknown, antitrust story of our time\" (114) suggest that the link between the growing concentration of share ownership and antitrust issues has only recently been uncovered. This is not, in fact, the case. Corporate governance literature from the early 1990s onwards focused on the implications of concentration of share ownership associated with the rise of institutional investment. (115) Buxbaum, for example, highlighted the fact that a broadening of portfolio distribution was the inevitable consequence of the absolute growth of institutional investment pools, (116) while Professor Bernard Black sought ways of ensuring increased \"institutional voice,\" (117) in accordance with Version 1 of the common ownership narrative discussed above.</p><p>These scholars also explicitly considered the growth in concentrated ownership and portfolio diversification from a competition law perspective. (118) Yet, they concluded that antitrust law constituted a very weak constraint on institutional investors. (119) Although Buxbaum acknowledged the theoretical possibility that institutional investors could contravene antitrust laws, the potential scenarios in which he thought this might occur went well beyond mere common ownership, as envisaged under Version 3. (120) Rather, Buxbaum's examples involved coordinated forms of institutional investor activism, (121) such as a targeted collective boycott against a particular firm. (122) Black also considered this issue, (123) and, like Buxbaum, viewed the risk at that time to be \"entirely theoretical,\" and subject to countervailing factors that reduced the likelihood of antitrust violations. (124) The approach of Buxbaum and Black is consistent with a narrow reading of Version 2 of the common ownership narrative, which would require actual misuse of ownership rights by institutional investors to achieve anticompetitive ends. (125)</p><p>Professors Rock and Rubinfeld have addressed this issue more recently and come to a similar conclusion. (126) Although acknowledging that common ownership by institutional investors could in certain circumstances have anticompetitive effects, Rock and Rubinfeld find no persuasive evidence that this state of affairs currently exists. (127) BlackRock has similarly criticized the common ownership theory as based on \"fragile evidence\" in this regard. (128)</p><p>D. Common Ownership Is a US-Centric and Industry-Specific Debate</p><p>Although the common ownership debate is now spreading around the world, its origins are inherently US-centric in their focus on particular American industries. Nonetheless, the market for capital is now global and there are developments, both in the United States and elsewhere in the world, which potentially affect that investment ecosystem and the common ownership debate. For example, in recent years there has been a striking reduction in the number of public companies in the United States, (129) which has increased the importance of global investment opportunities for US institutional investors.</p><p>American companies are not always competing with each other. Indeed, they are not always competing with companies that have the same governance structures, as is shown by the rise of Chinese State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). (130) Whereas some of the industry clusters considered in the common ownership literature, such as the banking and the airline industries, may be US oligopolies, others, such as technology and pharmaceutical sectors, are now global markets. Even in concentrated industries, spillover effects in other industries and other markets, in which highly diversified shareholders are invested, will necessarily complicate any assessment of investor incentives. (131)</p><p>From a global investment perspective, it is interesting to examine The Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (the Norwegian oil fund), (132) which is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, with over $1 trillion in assets. (133) In 2015, the fund announced that it was moving from passive investment to adopting an active owner stance. (134) It now has stakes in over nine thousand companies in seventy three countries, and owns an average of 1.4 percent of every company listed on any stock market around the world. (135) The Norwegian oil fund's record breaking 2017 annual return of $131 billion (136) was largely attributable to its broad investment strategy, coupled with the strong performance of technology stocks in its global portfolio, including Apple and Microsoft in the United States and Tencent in China. (137)</p><p>As noted, the largest US institutional investors are also increasingly involved in international markets. Although they tend to have investments in far fewer companies than the Norwegian oil fund, their investment levels are, on average, higher. For example, it is estimated that BlackRock owns at least 5 percent of over 2,600 companies worldwide and Vanguard owns around the same level of 1,800 companies worldwide. (138)</p><p>The investment strategy of the Norwegian oil fund is based on the objective of \"maximising return with moderate risk.\" (139) The kinds of restrictions that are suggested by anti-common ownership scholars would seriously undermine the investment strategies of US institutional investors which, like the Norwegian oil fund, seek to use broad portfolio diversification as a risk management tool.</p><p>E. Common Ownership in Megacompanies</p><p>Another problematic aspect of the common ownership hypothesis is its focus on institutional investors, rather than on the rise in market power of the investee firms themselves. If these firms have indeed engaged in anticompetitive behavior, it might be thought that they would be more obvious targets for competition law than their shareholders. (140) Yet, by targeting investment patterns, the common ownership literature obscures the fact that the firms in some sectors, such as the technology sector, have themselves become \"powerful megacompanies.\" (141) This is reflected in Apple's 2018 market valuation of $1 trillion, (142) and in Senator Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up companies, such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. (143)</p><p>Several recent studies have shown a dramatic increase in the size and concentration levels of companies in some industries, including in the banking sector and airlines sector, which feature so prominently in the common ownership debate. (144) For some economists, it is the corporate consolidation and concentration of power in a small number of megacompanies, rather than their capital structure, which has created problems relating to wage inequality (145) and consumer welfare. (146) This suggests the possibility that the common ownership theory may reflect correlation, rather than causation. (147)</p><p>The regulatory implications of this approach are that the law should target the companies that engage in anticompetitive conduct, rather than targeting institutional investors, by restricting their ability to own shares in competing companies. (148) A recent report of the Australian Government Productivity Commission adopts this approach in relation to Australia's extremely concentrated financial sector. (149) Acknowledging that these huge financial institutions \"have the ability to exercise market power over their competitors and consumers,\" (150) the report adopts a targeted approach to anticompetitive conduct by such firms that may exploit their customers. (151)</p><p>In an era of megacompanies, the presence of large powerful institutional investors as a counterweight is not necessarily an undesirable corporate governance development.</p><p>F. Investee Firm Managers and Their Fiduciary Duties</p><p>The common ownership theory not only diverts attention from potentially anticompetitive conduct of portfolio companies themselves, but it also diverts attention from the conduct of directors and officers of those firms. (152) As Commissioner Hayne stressed in Australia's recent high profile Banking Royal Commission, (153) directors and officers are required to exercise their duties for the benefit of their corporation, which involves more than considering merely financial returns to shareholders. (154) Furthermore, Commissioner Hayne disputed the idea that the interests of shareholders and customers are opposed, (155) noting that the interests of both groups will generally converge when directors and officers act in the long-term financial best interests of the corporation. (156)</p><p>The Banking Royal Commission's Final Report took the view that, in addition to the banks themselves, their boards and senior managers bore responsibility for misconduct, which enhanced corporate profits by exploiting customers. (157) This raises the possibility that corporate managers could themselves be liable for breach of either the duty of care or the duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the company as a whole. Although liability for breach of the duty of care is unlikely under US corporate law, (158) due to the capacious protection offered by the business judgment rule and exculpatory clauses, directors and officers face a much greater risk of liability under Australian law. (159) It is, therefore, arguable that if, under Version 2 or Version 3 of the common ownership narrative, directors and managers of investee firms engaged in anticompetitive conduct (based on the actual or presumed preferences of a segment of the body of shareholders), those directors and officers would breach their statutory duties to the company under Australian law. (160)</p><p>G. Institutional Investors and the Growing Importance of ESG</p><p>The common ownership theory is focused almost exclusively on the goal of profit maximization. (161) It arguably ignores one of the most important developments in current international corporate governance, namely the growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. (162) Large institutional investors increasingly view a diverse range of ESG factors, such as climate change, (163) sustainability, (164) and gender diversity on boards, (165) as inherent aspects of risk management, and these issues now account for the majority of all shareholder proposals filed in the United States. (166) Also, a growing number of international Shareholder Stewardship Codes explicitly refer to investor stewardship responsibilities regarding ESG. (167) For example, the 2020 UK Shareholder Stewardship Code for the first time explicitly recognizes the growing importance of ESG matters to institutional investors. (168)</p><p>One recent paper effectively flips the central argument of anti--common ownership scholars on its head, by arguing that portfolio-regarding intervention by the largest institutional investors may have beneficial outcomes from a social welfare perspective. (169) The paper argues that large diversified investors are, indeed, sometimes prepared to exert their growing power over individual firms for the benefit of their portfolio companies, but that, rather than seeking to reduce competition, they do this to control the effects of firm-level negative externalities of climate change on their entire portfolio. (170) This development contradicts not only the profit-focused Versions 2 and 3 of common ownership but also Version 1, the lazy investor narrative. (171)</p><p>V. CONCLUSION</p><p>Anti-common ownership scholars propose an intriguing theory, but further empirical studies are required to determine whether it accords with reality. The regulatory prescriptions offered by the more extreme versions of the common ownership narrative would have dire regulatory consequences and result in wholesale discrimination against certain shareholders. They would effectively unravel the benefits of investment diversification and democratization of wealth. (172) If further studies determine that there are indeed \"hidden costs\" (173) to common ownership, the role of the law should be to craft an effective, but appropriately targeted, response to that problem.</p><p>Jennifer G.

Editor\u2019s Note: Morning Tech is a free version of POLITICO Pro Technology's morning newsletter, which is delivered to our subscribers each morning at 6 a.m. The POLITICO Pro platform combines the news you need with tools you can use to take action on the day\u2019s biggest stories. Act on the news with POLITICO Pro .     Quick Fix    \u2014 The conventions crystallize the moment:  Republicans have found just about the perfect nemesis in the American tech industry, and Democrats have hit pause on singing its praises.   \u2014 Now comes the next two months:  Tech is facing a fraught election homestretch \u2014 including its role in the country\u2019s wrestling with race.   \u2014 The TikTok scramble pulls in a surprising would-be buyer: Walmart\u2019s entry into the mix to bid on the Trump-targeted social site could cause trouble for Amazon.   GREETINGS AND WELCOME TO MORNING TECH, where your guest host, Nancy Scola, is, with one eye on election day, having trouble getting Europe\u2019s \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d out of her head ( \u201cDo do do do, do do do do do\u2026\u201d ) Got a news tip? Write me at [email protected] or follow along @nancyscola. An event for our calendar? Send details to [email protected] . Anything else? Full team info below. And don't forget: Add @MorningTech and @PoliticoPro on Twitter.    Tech of the Town    WHAT THE CONVENTIONS SAID ABOUT TECH: So that\u2019s it; the country\u2019s nominating conventions are over. And MT\u2019s topline takeaway: one major party \u2014 the Republicans \u2014 have settled on Silicon Valley as a near-perfect target, and the other \u2014 the Democrats \u2014 have backed away from championing the U.S. tech industry.   \u2014 Snapshot of this political-tech moment: When tech was mentioned during the Republicans\u2019 four-day event, it was to brand it the new elite, dedicated to stealing the voices of \u2018average Americans\u2019 \u2014 like Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington kid who said, \u201cwe must...not hide in fear of the media or from the tech companies or from the outrage mob.\u201d Meanwhile, the left\u2019s general silence on tech \u2014 but for Julia Louis-Dreyfuss\u2019s jokes \u2014 spoke volumes: we are a huge distance away from when then-President Barack Obama proclaimed this \u201cthe nation of Edison and the Wright brothers, of Google and Facebook \u201d in 2011.   FROM HERE, THE HOT SEASON: But that\u2019s all the past. Today, though, with the nominees locked in, this is the kick-off of the post-convention election season, day one of the homestretch. From here, everything torques upward: temperatures, stakes, the volume of debate. And much of what happens between now and Nov. 3rd will play out online. Have things seemed fraught for tech? Wait.   \u2014 That includes Kenosha. The major platforms are right now embroiled in the widespread rage around what\u2019s gone down in Wisconsin: the police shooting of 29-year old Black man Jacob Blake and the subsequent killings of two people by, allegedly, an armed 17-year-old. Both Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for fostering the hate that is swirling in and around that state. Color of Change \u2014 the advocacy group deeply involved in last month\u2019s corporate Facebook boycott \u2014 says the companies \u201chave not gone far enough to expeditiously crack down on content that incites hate-fueled violence.\u201d (Worth noting: one Facebook official is saying reports that it failed to pre-emptively act in Wisconsin are wrong.)   \u2014Race isn\u2019t going anywhere in this race. And so the major platforms will find it difficult to escape gnarly decisions on what people are posting.   \u2014And that includes the president. Donald Trump has leaned into the country\u2019s racial tensions, and he uses Twitter, in particular, to do it. ( @RealDonaldTrump : \u201cTODAY, I will be sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha, WI to restore LAW and ORDER!\") Between here and election day, Twitter may well face enormous pressure to police \u2014 and not to police \u2014 what Trump tweets. (Ivanka Trump touched on the topic during her convention speech Thursday night: \u201cI know that his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered. But the results, the results speak for themselves.\u201d)   \u2014There\u2019s also the president\u2019s bully pulpit. A second-tier RNC takeaway: President Trump is willing to use the powers of his presidency to win, like including a naturalization ceremony in his convention programming . When it comes to tech, he\u2019s already issued an executive order to push back at Twitter and pushed to cleave TikTok from China . The question for the next three months: what tools of Trump\u2019s office does he deploy to strike at his tech industry nemeses?          AN MT FEATURE: TEN(ISH) WORDS ON THE NEXT 67 DAYS: We asked smart people at the intersection of tech and politics to quickly answer the question: what are you watching for from here to election day? The gist:   Those left-of-center are worried about trouble :   \u2014 Jesse Littlewood , Common Cause: \u201cWill \u2018Big Tech\u2019 allow an October surprise of disinformation?\u201d  \u2014 Ann Ravel, former Democratic commissioner at the Federal Election Commission: \u201cDisinformation and voter suppression taking place online in swing states.\u201d  \u2014 Adam Conner , Center for American Progress: \"How social media companies handle attempts to delegitimize election results.\"  \u2014 Ashkan Soltani, former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist: \u201cHow platforms will be used to sow unrest after the polls close but before one candidate concedes.\u201d   While others, including some right of center, are keeping an eye on whether new rules will be forged in the heat of the election:   \u2014 Carl Szabo , NetChoice: \u201cWill platform regulation become a topic on which candidates compete?\"  \u2014 Neil Chilson, Charles Koch Institute : \u201cHow Biden campaign reacts to/reflects rift in left-of-center antitrust.\u201d   \u2014 Hal Singer, Econ One: \u201cWhether the House antitrust subcommittee\u2019s report calls for breaking up the platforms.\u201d   ABOUT TRUMP\u2019S TIKTOK PUSH \u2014 One possible \u2014 if unforeseen \u2014 benefit for Trump if Walmart indeed bids on TikTok : it could give the behemoth retailer an appealing channel for its online commerce ambitions, especially among TikTok\u2019s young user base. And that could be a challenge to Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos is a frequent Trump target.   \u2014Still, the politics of the president\u2019s TikTok targeting are muddled. On the one hand, Wired reports that pro-Trump TikTok influencers aren\u2019t balking at the president\u2019s move: \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d says one 29-year-old Mississippi Republican with more than a half-million followers. But then there\u2019s Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who tells Vanity Fair he warned Trump, \u201cIf you shut down this site, you\u2019re going to get kicked in the ass by a bunch of young people. Bad decision.\u201d (More Graham-on-social-media: \u201cQAnon is batsh__ crazy.\u201d)   VERIZON, T-MOBILE JOUST OVER T-MO\u2019S PANDEMIC AIRWAVES DEALS  \u2014 Two of America\u2019s wireless giants are still  at odds over whether the Federal Communications Commission should have allowed T-Mobile to bolster its network by leasing 600 MHz airwaves.   \u2014 As August wraps,  Verizon is telling the FCC that T-Mobile\u2019s indulging in a \u201cseries of baseless procedural gripes\u201d in an attempt to convince the commission not to reconsider its awarding of the expanded airwaves. That comes after T-Mobile last week argued that Verizon was being \u201csimply disingenuous\u201d for criticizing its new spectrum holdings when it could have bid on 600 MHz spectrum years ago and didn\u2019t.   \u2014 What\u2019s driving the fight? 5G . FCC staff will ultimately have to decide whether Verizon has a point. But the spat shows how eagerly companies are clamoring for available airwaves .   ICYMI \u2014 Republican digital strategist Eric Wilson \u2014 who led digital strategy for Marco Rubio \u2019s (R-Fla.) 2016 White House bid \u2014 said that neither the Biden campaign nor the Lincoln Project is using social media right , in an interview with, well, me.    Silicon Valley Must Reads    \u2014 At the nexus of Trump and Twitch: The comments on the president\u2019s official channels on the gaming-centric Amazon-owned platform are \u201cfull of conspiracy theories, vulgar coronavirus debates and racist, sexist, anti-Semitic memes,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Tina Nguyen reports .   \u2014 Detailing the downsides of data-driven shopping: Instacart\u2019s gig-workers \u2014 who\u2019ve proven a lifeline for some Americans during the pandemic \u2014 say they face punishing metrics, per the L.A. Times .   \u2014 The shining cities of Silicon Valley: Fujian-born TikTok founder Zhang Yiming has long admired the American tech industry, but has found his entry into the global tech landscape it dominates rather rocky, reports the Wall Street Journal .    \u2014 The passage of time hasn\u2019t helped on the Hill: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Congress\u2019s worries about tech have only grown over the last twelve months, notes Axios .     Quick Downloads    \u2014 No more yelling like you do at Alexa: Amazon\u2019s new fitness tracker, called Halo, analyzes the tones of users\u2019 voices to provide them insight on their moods, reports the Wall Street Journal .   \u2014 Le r\u00e9volution comes to Kalorama : Advocates for better treatment of workers set up a guillotine outside Jeff Bezos\u2019s D.C. home, right as the Amazon CEO\u2019s net worth hits the $200 billion mark, reports the Washington Examiner .

Warner and Josh Hawley seeks to protect privacy by forcing tech companies to disclose the \"true value\" of their data to users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Specifically, companies with more than 100 million users would have to provide each user with an assessment of the financial value of their data, as well as reveal revenue generated by \"obtaining, collecting, processing, selling, using or sharing user data.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In addition, the DASHBOARD Act would give users the right to delete their data from companies' databases.</p><p> As a researcher exploring the ethical and political implications of digital platforms and big data, I'm sympathetic to the bill's ambition of increasing transparency and empowering users.</p><p> However, estimating the value of user data isn't simple and won't, I believe, solve privacy issues.</p><p> Data collectors</p><p> The data collected by tech companies consists not just of traditional identifying information such as name, age and gender.</p><p> Rather, as Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov has noted, it includes \"Tweets, Facebook likes, Twitches, Google searches, online comments, one-click purchases, even viewing-but-skipping-over a photograph in your feed.\"</p><p> In other words, big data contains the mundane yet intimate moments of people's lives.</p><p> And, if Facebook captures your interactions with friends and family, Google your late night searches, and Alexa your living room commands, wouldn't you want to know, as the bill suggests, what your \"data is worth and to whom it is sold\"?</p><p> However, calculating the value of user data isn't that simple.</p><p> Estimates on what user data is worth vary widely. They include evaluations of less than a dollar for an average person's data to a slightly more generous US$100 for a Facebook user.</p><p> One user sold his data for $2,733 on Kickstarter.</p><p> To achieve this number, he had to share data including keystrokes, mouse movements and frequent screenshots.</p><p> Sadly, the DASHBOARD Act doesn't specify how it would estimate the value of user data. Instead, it explains that the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal government agency, \"shall develop a method or methods for calculating the value of user data.\"</p><p> The commission, I believe, will quickly realize that estimating the value of user data is a challenging undertaking.</p><p> More than personal</p><p> The proposed legislation aims to provide users with more transparency.</p><p> However, privacy is no longer solely a matter of personal data.</p><p> Data shared by a few can provide insights into the lives of many.</p><p>Facebook likes, for example, can help predict a user's sexual orientation with a high degree of accuracy.</p><p> Target has used its purchase data to predict which customers are pregnant. The case garnered widespread attention after the retailer figured out a teen girl was pregnant before her father did.</p><p> Such predictive ability means that private information isn't just contained in user data.</p><p> Companies can also infer your private information, based on statistical correlations in the data of a number of users.</p><p> How can the value of such data be reduced to an individual dollar value?</p><p> It is more than the sum of its parts.</p><p> What's more, this ability to use statistical analysis to identify people as belonging to a group category can have far-reaching privacy implications.</p><p> If service providers can use predictive analytics to guess a user's sexual orientation, race, gender and religious belief, what is to stop them from discriminating on that basis?</p><p> Having been let loose, predictive technologies will continue to work even if users delete their part of the data that helped create them.</p><p> Control through data</p><p> The sensitivity of data depends not just on what it contains, but on how governments and companies can use it to exert influence.</p><p> This is evident in my current research on China's planned social credit system.</p><p> The Chinese government plans to use national databases and \"trustworthiness ratings\" to regulate the behavior of Chinese citizens.</p><p>Google's, Amazon's and Facebook's \"surveillance capitalism,\" as author Shoshana Zuboff has argued, also uses predictive data to \"tune and herd our behaviour towards the most profitable outcomes.\"</p><p> In 2014, revelations about how Facebook experimented with its feed to influence the emotional state of users ended in a public outcry.</p><p> However, this instance just made visible how digital platforms, in general, can use data to keep users engaged and, in the process, generate more data.</p><p> Data privacy is as much about big tech's ability to shape your personal life as about what it knows about you.</p><p> Who is harmed</p><p> The truth is that datafication, with all its privacy implications, does not affect everyone equally.</p><p> Big data's hidden biases and networked discrimination continue to reproduce inequalities around gender, race and class.</p><p> Women, minorities and the financially poor are most strongly affected.</p><p> UCLA professor Safiya Umoja Noble, for example, has shown how Google search rankings reinforce negative stereotypes about women of color.</p><p> In light of such inequality how could a numerical value ever capture the \"true\" value of user data?</p><p> The proposed legislations's lack of specificity is disconcerting.</p><p> However, even more troubling might be its insistence that data transparency will be achieved by revealing monetary value alone.</p><p> Numeric assessments of financial worth don't reflect data's power to predict our actions or guide our decisions.</p><p> The DASHBOARD Act aims to make the business of data more transparent and empower users.</p><p> However, I believe that it will fail to fulfill this promise.</p><p> If lawmakers want to tackle data privacy, they need to regulate not just data monetization, but more widely address the value and cost of data in people's lives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNV-7e3cf8da2b0988e5450fea6dd58a73fc45e31d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CBBA7C32F44 NWBKNV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-8PD1-DXVP-V295-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 elkodaily.com<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This week Microsoft, Facebook and Google showed robust gains of their own. Supply chain disruptions and slowing ad revenue have put little dent in these cash-rich giants that, together with Apple, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">account for 20 percent</url> of the S&amp;amp;P 500 index. Amid the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, Big Tech is roaring ahead.</p><p>While tech\u2019s largest grow larger, it has been a brutal quarter for start-ups and smaller companies, which have laid off or furloughed thousands of people.</p><p>Where does Silicon Valley go from here? Even if the technology giants grow more powerful, change is coming for them, too. The regulatory and antitrust standards developed for the industrial age are not enough to protect competition and consumer rights in the digital age, and this crisis is forcing policymakers to confront that. The rules under which Big Tech has been playing may finally get an update.</p><p>History tells us this has happened before. Detroit\u2019s automobile industry began the 20th century as a cluster of venture-backed start-ups \u2014 another group of young tinkerers in garages, securing financing from wealthy investors who were willing to take a risk on a new product that changed the way people lived and worked. By the 1930s, they were immensely innovative, lightly regulated companies, and they resisted unionization as ferociously as some tech giants do today.</p><p>The Great Depression devastated Detroit. Sales of new cars fell by over 70 percent between 1929 and 1932. There were 40 U.S. companies making passenger cars in the late 1920s; a decade later, only 11 remained. By 1937, three giants \u2014 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler \u2014 controlled 85 percent of the market.</p><p>The automakers that survived the Depression grew bigger and more powerful, but something changed.</p><p>It started with the economic recovery programs proposed by President Franklin Roosevelt. Detroit executives <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">rallied at first</url> to help Roosevelt execute his New Deal agenda. But as wage and production controls rolled out of Washington in 1933 and 1934, big-business leaders began to express what the journalist Walter Lippmann described as \u201ca revulsion of feeling against bureaucratic control of American economic life.\u201d</p><p>Then, the unions that they had fought so successfully for decades also gained ground. As the Depression deepened, workers\u2019 demands for better pay and working conditions escalated, and autoworkers were at the vanguard. Waves of labor action in Detroit and elsewhere helped precipitate passage of the landmark National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which protected the right of workers to organize into unions, to collectively bargain and to go on strike.</p><p>Roosevelt\u2019s support for labor increased automakers\u2019 frustration. In the winter of 1937, tension between General Motors and the White House peaked, when workers began a 44-day strike for higher wages and recognition of the United Auto Workers as a bargaining unit. The government sided with the strikers, and Roosevelt delivered <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">a public rebuke</url> to Alfred P. Sloan, the head of G.M., when he refused to come to Washington to negotiate.</p><p>Within three years, however, the industry\u2019s relationship to big government and big labor had changed. Roosevelt persuaded G.M.\u2019s president, William Knudsen, to step away from his day job for a dollar-a-year position mobilizing American industry for World War II, and he had to share authority over the war production effort with a labor leader. Although wartime regulations tightly constrained workers\u2019 ability to strike, union membership soared. By 1945, more than one-third of the nation\u2019s nonagricultural workers were unionized.</p><p>The war effort certainly didn\u2019t hurt American automakers; they came out of the war bigger than ever and even more tightly connected to the centers of power. Charles Wilson of G.M. served as secretary of defense under President Dwight Eisenhower; Robert McNamara of Ford held the job under Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. George Romney, head of American Motors, was governor of Michigan and Richard Nixon\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development.</p><p>But that political influence did not prevent the industry from becoming more regulated. Carmakers began voluntarily adding seatbelts to vehicles in the 1950s; in the 1960s, the government made the feature mandatory. Additional federal safety and emissions standards made cars safer for people and the environment.</p><p>It may be too early to tell what a post-coronavirus Silicon Valley will look like, but there are some early signs of a similar transformation.</p><p>Tech companies that long disdained big government have been urging federal leaders to do more and working with governors and mayors to address the pandemic. In Washington State, Microsoft is teaming up with public health officials to collect data about the virus and procure protective equipment. In California and New York, an effort led by Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, has delivered truckloads of masks, gowns and swabs to hospitals. Facebook, Apple and Google have been \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">incredible partners</url>,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said this month.</p><p>At the same time, the public\u2019s dependence on digital technology during the lockdown and the growing market share of some platforms has increased calls for regulation. This week, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri called for the Justice Department to open a criminal antitrust investigation of Amazon, citing the pandemic\u2019s devastation of the retail sector. \u201cAmazon\u2019s reported data practices are an existential threat that may prevent these businesses from ever recovering,\u201d he said. Amid the shutdown, House and Senate committees have continued to consider tech privacy, which now includes concerns about how to protect personal data in the design of contact-tracing apps.</p><p>The worker activism already rumbling through tech has also accelerated. The blue-collar workers who power the digital economy \u2014 including fulfillment center workers and app-based couriers \u2014 are pushing for higher pay and better protection, just as Detroit autoworkers did 90 years ago.</p><p>The realm of political possibility is getting larger, just as it did in the 1930s. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal consisted of ideas that had been knocking around among activists for decades, but they lacked broad-based political support \u2014 until a crisis delivered it. Similar things are happening now, as Democrats and Republicans embrace trillions of dollars in government spending and mainstream Democratic politics tilt toward the left.</p><p>The Great Depression threw millions of people out of work and made the economic fragility and inequalities of the 1920s painfully clear. America responded by rewriting the rules of work and business, and we could do so again.</p><p>Margaret O\u2019Mara (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">@margaretomara</url>) is a professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">\u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201d</url></p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

The Earth is flat. Avril Lavigne was secretly replaced with a clone, \u00e0 la Paul McCartney. Elvis faked his own death and lived out a quiet retirement in Graceland. Drinking disinfectant will kill coronavirus. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some may be a little more harmful than others. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The spread of false information online has been high on the government's radar in recent years. This encompasses both misinformation, which cover inaccuracies shared inadvertently, and disinformation, which is deliberately deceptive and propagated for political, ideological, or financial purposes. </p><p>In 2018 and 2019 reports were released by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport after an inquiry into 'Disinformation and fake news', and the 'Online Harms' white paper of April 2019 has laid the groundwork for the possible appointment of Ofcom as an 'online harms regulator'. </p><p>After a considerable increase in online misinformation surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, the House of Commons DCMS Sub-committee on Online Harms and Disinformation launched an inquiry into what the World Health Organization (WHO) has coined the \"infodemic\" - the rise of misleading information specifically regarding the Coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>The committee appealed for evidence from the public, and was able to speak with representatives from Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. Evidence was also received from social media platform TikTok, BT, government ministers, front-line health workers in both the UK and US, academics, and Ofcom. </p><p>Coronavirus misinformation takes many forms online. Evidence presented to the committee ranged from stories of snake oil 'treatments' to phoney accounts of hospital negligence, claims that 5G encourages the spread of the virus to 'studies' that state certain medicines - such as painkillers - are dangerous. </p><p>70 </p><p>Verbal or physical against 5G workers </p><p>40 million </p><p>Impressions on government's coronavirus campaign on Google homepage </p><p>2018 </p><p>Year in which the Rapid Response Unit was established in the Cabinet Office to rebut misinformation </p><p>2.5 billion </p><p>Approximate number of monthly active Facebook users </p><p>The false claims are hugely varied, and are passed around by a similarly varied cast of characters, which can make disputing them en masse impossible. </p><p>\"Recall [Donald Trump's] public musings about using bleach or rubbing alcohol or UV light inserted into the body?\" wrote Irwin Redlener, director, a professor of public health and pediatrics at New York's Columbia University, in a letter submitted by the campaign group Avaaz and containing evidence from front-line health workers. </p><p>Figures to have used their public standing to profit from the pandemic included a registered nurse who allegedly mis-sold health products over Facebook to her 11,000 followers. </p><p>Not all of the misinformation originates from perpetrators seeking personal gain, though. A significant portion of Covid-19 misinformation seemingly directly benefits no-one. </p><p>Part of the appeal of these conspiracies is their alleviation of the sense of helplessness felt in the face of a disease with no available cure or vaccine. While portions of the populace lose faith in institutions, conspiracies offer a glimpse at so-called \"truth\". </p><p>Dr Claire Wardle, director of anti-misinformation project First Draft News, noted that many people are therefore \"inadvertently sharing false information believing they are doing the right thing\". </p><p>A GP, who provided evidence anonymously, noted that viral messages being spread on the Facebook-owned WhatsApp were passing fictional accounts of hospital misdemeanors around predominantly Asian communities - already at higher risk from the virus. The messages claimed that hospitals were deliberately infecting patients, or else leaving them to suffer without aid. </p><p>\"This has led to patients refusing to go into hospital and deterred them from seeking medical help,\" they said. \"It has also made dealing with family members who have loved ones in hospital difficult to manage as they feel adamant that the doctors are actively trying to harm them or discharging them without treating them.\" </p><p>The aversion to seeking help from hospitals has been a widespread response to certain fake news stories. </p><p>Cassie Hudson, a student paramedic in the UK writing in the same Avaaz letter, stated that she had seen patients with COPD or cardiac disease, \"just refusing to seek suitable levels of care because they're afraid they'll die of Covid-19 in the hospital.\" </p><p>Away from hospitals, false claims about the role of 5G in the spread of the virus led to almost 70 attacks against EE staff and subcontractors. </p><p>\"Misinformation has led to patients refusing to go into hospital and deterred them from seeking medical help. It has also made dealing with family members who have loved ones in hospital difficult to manage as they feel adamant that the doctors are actively trying to harm them.\" </p><p>In written evidence submitted to the committee, BT stated that these incidents, \"included threats to kill and vehicles driven directly at staff.\" </p><p>The inquiry found that \"loss of trust in institutions\" has been seen as both \"an aim and opportunity for hostile actors\". </p><p>It found that during the course of the infodemic, \"both state (Russia, China and Iran) and non-state (such as Daesh and the UK and US far right) campaigns have spread false news and malicious content\". </p><p>Fact versus fiction </p><p>One of the government's primary responses to the spread of misinformation has been to simply raise the profile of fact-checked resources. </p><p>According to one announcement, \"ensuring public health campaigns are promoted through reliable sources\" was a priority, alongside removing and rebutting harmful content on social media. </p><p>All of the social media companies who gave evidence to the sub-committee stressed their attempts to promote WHO-approved information to their users. </p><p>Searches for 'coronavirus' on Twitter, TikTok and Google aim to direct users towards accurate information -- often linking back directly to WHO, NHS and GOV.UK sources, or by adjusting search results and \"other platform-specific features\". </p><p>Facebook, for example, launched a dedicated 'Facts about COVID-19' section in their Coronavirus Information Centre in July, which seeks to debunk popular claims, such as \"medical masks cause oxygen deficiency\". </p><p>Twitter, TikTok and Facebook allalso stressed that they had provided the government with pro bono advertising credits, which they could then use to promote verified sources of Covid-19 information, or to push public-health messaging such as the 'Stay Home, Save Lives' campaign. </p><p>\"We have seen more than 3.5 million visits to the Covid resources on NHS and UK government websites from Facebook and Instagram since January as a result of us directing to those resources,\" Facebook's head of product policy and counterterrorism, Monika Bickert, told the committee. </p><p>\u00a31.4m </p><p>Value of contract for a social media analytics firm government hopes can identify 'key influencers' </p><p>90 million </p><p>Pieces of information flagged as false by Facebook fact-checkers in March and April </p><p>70 </p><p>Pieces of misinformation a week to be refuted by the RRU </p><p>11 March </p><p>Date on which DCMS committee launched inquiry and wrote to department secretary Oliver Dowden to express concern </p><p>Government public health messaging on Google's homepage also reportedly reached over 40 million impressions. </p><p>As part of their social media push, the Government Communication Service (GCS) is currently hunting for an analytics firm to help highlight key influencers to push coronavirus public health messaging. </p><p>The contract notice states that the chosen firm will assist with \"gathering social media insights to build strategic communications strategies and public information campaigns.\" </p><p>Correcting the record </p><p>While the government has been actively pursuing relationships with social media platforms in order to further the visibility of public health messaging, there is concern that simply promoting accurate information is not enough to quell the threat of viral misinformation. </p><p>\"I can speak to one person for 10 minutes and have an influence on that one person's experience of healthcare,\" explained advanced paramedic practitioner Thomas Knowles. </p><p>Meanwhile, a pandemic documentary that was circulating on YouTube gathered 40 million views within a 48-hour period. </p><p>\"That is 25,000 people in 10 minutes. I cannot speak to 25,000 people in 10 minutes,\" Knowles said. </p><p>Offline, solutions such as encouraging better digital literacy have also been floated as potential aspects of a multi-faceted response. </p><p>The government's 'Don't Feed the Beast' campaign - which has the tagline \"Just because a story appears online, doesn't mean it's true\" - encourages the public to approach online claims through the lens of a five-point checklist 'SHARE checklist', designed to alert people to false information before they spread it further. </p><p>Of course, these measures only discourage the misinformation shared accidentally by the public, and not more sinister offerings from scammers and those seeking to capitalise on the fear and confusion caused by the pandemic. </p><p>For that, the government's Rapid Response Unit (RRU), which was first established in the Cabinet Office in 2018 and is now housed between the Cabinet Office and 10 Downing Street, has been tasked with responding to 70 pieces of misinformation a week. </p><p>During the pandemic, the Counter Disinfomation Unit - which brings together existing analytics teams from various departments - has also been launched from DCMS and tasked with tackling coronavirus-related falsehoods. </p><p>For many of the medical professionals spoken to over the course of the inquiry, such measures do not go far enough to re-educate the public. There is rising pressure on social media companies not only to flag and delete misleading claims, but also to issue specific, targeted corrections. </p><p>These \"correct the record\" tools, explained campaign group Avaaz, would mean alerting every user who had encountered misinformation online to inform them both of the falsity of the initial post, and to provide correctional resources. </p><p>\"This means alerting and notifying every single person who has seen or interacted with health misinformation on their platforms, and sharing a well-designed and independently fact-checked correction - something shown to help prevent users believing harmful lies,\" the group said. </p><p>Since implementing a similar 'correction' tool, Facebook has stated that, \"100% of those who see content already flagged as false by our fact-checkers\" would see a warning screen. This was applied to 40 million pieces of content in March and 50 million pieces of content in April. </p><p>Those who share, like, or comment on misinformation are sent a 'correct the record' notification. However, the platform does not every user who has simply seen such information, for fear of \"diluting\" the effectiveness of the notification. </p><p>The attention economy </p><p>The committee examined whether social media companies are incentivised to \"correct the record\". </p><p>Many would argue that the opposite is true, and that a complete removal of \"fake news\" would damage their business models. Billed the \"attention economy\", these models rely on user engagement - without necessarily differentiating between positive and negative - to push content, generate users, and create more data and advertising opportunities. </p><p>Stacie Hoffmann, digital policy and cybersecurity consultant at specialist firm Oxford Information Labs, told the committee that due to the strong reaction guaranteed by misinformation and disinformation, \"the algorithms are rewarding negative reactions.\" </p><p>The report published by the committee argues that\"this is opposite to the corporate social responsibility policies espoused by tech companies relying on this business model\". </p><p>This is unlikely to change overnight. </p><p>Day-to-day policing of users on social platforms is still the responsibility of the platforms themselves. Each has its own set of rules surrounding the use of the site, and imposes penalties on users who do not act in accordance with these policies based on their own judgements. </p><p>It is these codes of conduct which dictate which content risks deletion - and it is not necessarily enough for the information presented to simply be incorrect. </p><p>YouTube's community guidelines, for example, explicitly ban \"hate speech, predatory behaviour, graphic violence, malicious attacks and content that promotes harmful or dangerous behaviour\". </p><p>The inquiry found that, \"prior to the pandemic, many of the tech companies did not have robust policies against harmful misinformation and have also often been slow in adapting their policies to combat it.\" </p><p>This subjective implementation of existing policies has predictably led to confusion when attempting to establish a common response to misinformation. </p><p>John Nicolson, SNP MP for Ochil and South Perthshire, summarised the issue in one oral evidence session by stating, \"the problem is that Mark Zuckerberg sets the tone, doesn't he?\", (pictured above, appearing on Fox News). </p><p>Addressing a representative from Facebook directly, he added: \"You will not take [misinformation] seriously until we, as parliamentarians, hit you with serious financial penalties. It worked in Germany, and I think we need to do it here.\" </p><p>German law states that any social network which does not take action to remove \"fake news\" misinformation, hate speech and other illegal content can be fined up to (EURO)50m (\u00a343m). </p><p>With or without a financial incentive to help counter the spread of fake posts, paramedic Knowles spoke of the \"moral obligation\" big tech platforms ought to feel to address the spread of damaging content. Especially in cases where such content is actively monetised by the host site. </p><p>The cost of battling such misinformation \"cannot be borne by the public purse when we are looking at organisations that are turning over billions of pounds a year,\" he said. </p><p>In this way, the spread of misinformation is not only a logistical issue, but a financial one as well, with both sides standing to lose money in the fight to counter it. </p><p>It may seem unlikely that, while the algorithms rely so heavily on engagement, these platforms will endeavour to remove incendiary content completely. </p><p>For this reason, one possible solution being considered is a change in the role of Ofcom. It was in February of this year that the government suggested it was \"minded\" to name Ofcom as a new 'Online Harms Regulator' - a role in which it would have further powers over the actions of social media companies. </p><p>This would mean it would be empowered \"to request explanations about the way an algorithm operates, and to look at the design choices that some companies have made and be able to call those into question\". </p><p>\"We are working around the clock to save lives. The wealth of misinformation increases our work; it places our lives in danger; and adds additional stress and emotional and mental toll.We would appreciate social media companies standing behind us in this fight.\" </p><p>Dr Meenakshi Bewtra, University of Pennsylvania</p><p>But the other proposed online harms legislation - put forward by the government with the aim to hold companies to their own policies and community standards - was found to be too weak by the DCMS committee. </p><p>\"The government must empower the new regulator to go beyond ensuring that tech companies enforce their own policies, community standards and terms of service,\" it said. \"The regulator must ensure that these policies themselves are adequate in addressing the harms faced by society.\" </p><p>In order to do this, it suggests that the regulator should have the power to: standardise policies across platforms, thereby ensuring minimum standards; hand out fines for non-compliance; disrupt the activities of businesses who do not comply; and to ensure custodial sentences as sanctions where required. </p><p>As the battle against coronavirus rages on, its online counterpart continues to eat into the time of those on the front lines. </p><p>\"We are working around the clock to save lives. The wealth of misinformation increases our work; it places our lives in danger; and adds additional stress and emotional and mental toll to all of us,\" said Dr Meenakshi Bewtra of the University of Pennsylvania. </p><p>\"We would appreciate social media companies standing behind us in this fight.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PBTNET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PBTNET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V9-V0D1-JD3S-J199-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2730\"/><timeReceived>2:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PublicTechnology (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Continue reading The coronavirus is forcing tech giants to make a risky bet on AI</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Machine learning tools have always been the ideal content moderators for Facebook, Google and Twitter   but COVID-19 is forcing their use before they re ready</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, let s talk about some of the front-line workers at Facebook and Google working on the pandemic: the content moderators who keep the site running day in and day out. Like most stories about content moderators, it s a tale about difficult tradeoffs. And actions taken over the past few days by Facebook and YouTube will have significant implications for the future of the business.</p><p>First, though, some history.</p><p>At first, content moderation on social networks was a business problem: let in the nudity and the Nazis, and the community collapses. Later, it was a legal and regulatory problem: despite the protections afforded by Section 230, companies have a legal obligation to remove terrorist propaganda, child abuse imagery, and other forms of content. As services like YouTube and Facebook grew user bases in the billions, content moderation became more of a scale problem: how do you review the millions of posts a day that get reported for violating your policies?</p><p>The solution, as I explored last year in a series of pieces for The Verge, was to outsource the job to large consulting companies. In the wake of the 2016 election, which revealed a deficit of content moderators at all the big social networks, tech companies hired tens of thousands of moderators around the world through firms including Accenture, Cognizant, and Genpact. This, though, created a privacy problem. When your moderators work in house, you can apply strict controls to their computers to monitor the access they have to user data. When they work for third parties, that user data is at much greater risk of leaking to the outside world.</p><p>The privacy issues surrounding the hiring of moderators generally haven t gotten much attention from journalists like me. (Instead we have been paying attention to their generally awful working conditions and the fact that a subset of workers are developing post-traumatic stress disorder from the job.) But inside tech companies, fears over data leaks ran strong. For Facebook in particular, the post-2016 election backlash had arisen partly over privacy concerns   once the world learned how Cambridge Analytica intended to use information gleaned from people s Facebook use, trust in the company plunged precipitously.</p><p>That s why outsourced content moderation sites for Facebook and YouTube were designed as secure rooms. Employees can work only on designated  production floors  that they must badge in and out of. They are not allowed to bring in any personal devices, lest they take surreptitious photos or attempt to smuggle out data another way. This can create havoc for workers   they are often fired for inadvertently bringing phones onto the production floor, and many of them have complained to me about the way that the divide separates them from their support networks during the day. But no company has been willing to relax those restrictions for fear of the public-relations crisis a high-profile data loss might spark.</p><p>Fast-forward to today, when a pandemic is spreading around the world at frightening speed. We still need just as many moderators working to police social networks, if not more   usage is clearly surging. If you bring them to the production floor to continue working normally, you almost certainly contribute to the spread of the disease. And yet if you let them work from home, you invite in a privacy disaster at a time when people (especially sick people) will be hyper-sensitive to misuses of their personal data.</p><p>Say you re Facebook. What do you do?</p><p>Until Monday, the answer looked a lot like business as usual. Sam Biddle broke the story in The Intercept last week. (Incidentally, the publication that The Interface is most frequently mistaken for.)</p><p>Discussions from Facebook s internal employee forum reviewed by The Intercept reveal a state of confusion, fear, and resentment, with many precariously employed hourly contract workers stating that, contrary to statements to them from Facebook, they are barred by their actual employers from working from home, despite the technical feasibility and clear public health benefits of doing so.</p><p>The discussions focus on Facebook contractors employed by Accenture and WiPro at facilities in Austin, Texas, and Mountain View, California, including at least two Facebook offices. (In Mountain View, a local state of emergency has already been declared over the coronavirus.) The Intercept has seen posts from at least six contractors complaining about not being able to work from home and communicated with two more contractors directly about the matter. One Accenture employee told The Intercept that their entire team of over 20 contractors had been told that they were not permitted to work from home to avoid infection.</p><p>In fairness, Facebook was far from alone in not having deployed a full plan for its contractors last Thursday. Some American companies are still debating what to do with their full-time workforces this week. But as Biddle notes, Facebook wasn t one of those: it was already encouraging employees to work from home. This prompted justified criticism from contract workers   some of whom petitioned Facebook to act, Noah Kulwin reported in The Outline. (Googlers are circulating a similar petition on behalf of their own contract coworkers, Rob Price reported at Business Insider.)</p><p>On Monday night, Facebook did act. As of Tuesday, it began to inform all contract moderators that they should not come into the office. Commendably, Facebook will continue to pay them during the disruption. Here s the announcement:</p><p>For both our full-time employees and contract workforce there is some work that cannot be done from home due to safety, privacy and legal reasons. We have taken precautions to protect our workers by cutting down the number of people in any given office, implementing recommended work from home globally, physically spreading people out at any given office and doing additional cleaning. Given the rapidly evolving public health concerns, we are taking additional steps to protect our teams and will be working with our partners over the course of this week to send all contract workers who perform content review home, until further notice. We ll ensure that all workers are paid during this time.</p><p>The news followed a similar announcement from Google on Sunday. It was followed by a joint announcement from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube that they  are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts,  including a commitment to remove fraud and misinformation related to the virus and promote  authoritative content.  (I m told the announcement is unrelated to the shift in content moderation strategies, but it points to a future where companies collaborate more on removing harmful posts.)</p><p>OK, so the content moderators have mostly been sent home. How does stuff get   moderated? Facebook allowed some moderators who work on less sensitive content   helping to train machine-learning systems for labeling content, for example   to work from home. More sensitive work is being shifted to full-time employees. But the company will also begin to lean more heavily on those machine-learning systems in an effort to automate content moderation.</p><p>It s the long-term goal of every social network to put artificial intelligence in charge. But as recently as December, Google was telling me that the day when such a thing would be possible was still quite far away. And yet on Monday the company   out of necessity   changed its tune. Here s Jake Kastrenakes at The Verge:</p><p>YouTube will rely more on AI to moderate videos during the coronavirus pandemic, since many of its human reviewers are being sent home to limit the spread of the virus. This means videos may be taken down from the site purely because they re flagged by AI as potentially violating a policy, whereas the videos might normally get routed to a human reviewer to confirm that they should be taken down. [ ]</p><p>Because of the heavier reliance on AI, YouTube basically says we have to expect that some mistakes are going to be made. More videos may end up getting removed,  including some videos that may not violate policies,  the company writes in a blog post. Other content won t be promoted or show up in search and recommendations until it s reviewed by humans.</p><p>YouTube says it largely won t issue strikes   which can lead to a ban   for content that gets taken down by AI (with the exception of videos it has a  high confidence  are against its policies). As always, creators can still appeal a video that was taken down, but YouTube warns this process will also be delayed because of the reduction in human moderation.</p><p>All that represents a huge bet on AI at a time when, as the company itself notes, it is still quite error-prone. And on Monday evening, both Facebook and Twitter followed suit. Here s Paresh Dave in Reuters:</p><p>Facebook also said the decision to rely more on automated tools, which learn to identify offensive material by analyzing digital clues for aspects common to previous takedowns, has limitations.</p><p> We may see some longer response times and make more mistakes as a result,  it said.</p><p>Twitter said it too would step up use of similar automation, but would not ban users based solely on automated enforcement, because of accuracy concerns.</p><p>So many of tech platforms  troubles with regulators and elected officials over the past couple years have come down to content moderation. Which posts did they allow to stay up? Which did they wrongfully take down? Which posts did they amplify, and which did they suppress?</p><p>At global scale, the companies were making plenty of mistakes even with the benefit of human judgment. As of Tuesday, they will be entrusting significantly more to the machines. The day one result was not great. Here s Josh Constine in TechCruch:</p><p>Facebook appears to have a bug in its News Feed spam filter, causing URLs to legitimate websites including Medium, BuzzFeed, and USA Today to be blocked from being shared as posts or comments. The issue is blocking shares of some coronavirus-related content, while some unrelated links are allowed through, though it s not clear what exactly is or isn t tripping the filter. Facebook has been trying to fight back against misinformation related to the outbreak, but may have gotten overzealous or experienced a technical error.</p><p>I m sure that bug will be fixed before too long. (Facebook says it s not related to changes in content moderation.) In the meantime, my thoughts are with the moderators who kept showing up to work every day for the past week even as they knew it put them in physical danger. One Facebook moderator working for Accenture recalled how the company began putting out more hand sanitizer in February as the threat worsened, but waited until Tuesday to tell him to stay home. This came after days, if not weeks, of employees telling Accenture that their partners and roommates had been exposed to the disease.</p><p> We were working with people who where exposed, definitely,  the moderator told me.  I think they have moved too late, and the actions initially taken were clearly insufficient. </p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE RATIO</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>plans to award $100 million in cash grants and ad credits for up to 30,000 small businesses in 30 countries around the world.

Chief among these new information economists was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Hurwicz\">Leonid Hurwicz</url>, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".</p><p>Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.</p><p>These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809376?seq=1\">ideas of F.A. Hayek</url>, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing. </p><p>By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as <url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.mises.org/qjae5_3_3.pdf\">almost superfluous</url> to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.</p><p>Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190270056.001.0001/acprof-9780190270056\">argue</url> economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regardless of what people want</emphasis>\".</p><p>By the 1990s this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/232739/never-let-a-serious-crisis-go-to-waste-by-philip-mirowski/\">a market failure of catastrophic proportions</url> - could not dislodge it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: We should all beware a resurgent financial sector</emphasis></p><h>Market society</h><p>This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/tale-of-two-auctions/A8CD471D2EC2F69BB23B3707CB0B6354\">auctions</url>. </p><p>Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.</p><p>Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/team-human/our-lives-are-now-run-by-persuasion-engineers-c42e5b352bf6\">Douglas Rushkoff</url> explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Is it time to regulate targeted\u00a0ads and the web\u00a0giants that profit from them?</emphasis></p><p>This model is being scaled up to treat <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.masfoundations.org/\">society as a whole</url> as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation. </p><p>To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive. </p><p>Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/welcome-to-algorithmic-prison/283985/\">constrain our choices</url> to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/team-human/our-lives-are-now-run-by-persuasion-engineers-c42e5b352bf6\">might seem innocuous</url>, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice. Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile. </p><h>In praise of obscurity</h><p>The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation. </p><p>Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/obscurity-a-better-way-to-think-about-your-data-than-privacy/267283/\">obscurity</url>. Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue, as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/algorithmic-governance-and-political-legitimacy/\">Matthew Crawford</url> identifies, of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\". Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which a citizen can enact her democratic rights.</p><p>The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its <url normalizedValue=\"https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/\">institutions</url>. </p><p>The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy.

Big tech companies have not hesitated to make the most of the crisis.In New York for example, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt is leading a panel tasked with transforming the city after the pandemic, 'focused on telehealth, remote learning, and broadband'. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also been called in , to help create 'a smarter education system'. The government, health, education and defence sectors have long been prime targets for 'digital disruption'. The American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.As author and activist Naomi Klein writes , changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see 'a warp-speed acceleration'.All these transformations will follow a similar model : using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour. Read more: Explainer: what is surveillance capitalism and how does it shape our economy? The control revolutionThe changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a 'control revolution' . This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.After World War II the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. </p><p>Even before COVID-19, we were already in the ' reflexive phase ' of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.The next phase is what we might call the ' uberisation of everything': replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app. Read more: The 'Uberisation' of work is driving people to co-operatives Information economicsBeginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz , winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on 'mechanism design theory'.<url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2020-05/29/TC_8916e86d-8_Image_In_Body.jpg\"/><br/>Information theorist Claude Shannon also conducted early experiments in artificial intelligence, including the creation of a maze-solving mechanical mouse. Bell Labs Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek , who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing. By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to 'the market', which he saw as an omniscient information processor.Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from 'ensuring markets give people what they want' to insisting they can make markets produce 'any desired outcome regardless of what people want'.By the 1990s this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions - could not dislodge it. Read more: We should all beware a resurgent financial sector Market societyThis orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions . Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to 'nudge' the user's behaviour. As Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad. Read more: Is it time to regulate targeted\u00a0ads and the web\u00a0giants that profit from them? This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation. To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive. Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous , but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice. Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2020-05/29/TC_8916e86d-8_Image_In_Body.jpg\"/><br/>Videoconferencing has boomed in schools and workplaces, with software like Zoom and Microsoft teams reporting enormous increases in usership. Lukas Koch / AAP In praise of obscurityThe pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation. Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity . Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue, as Matthew Crawford identifies, of our 'qualitative experience of institutional authority'. Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which a citizen can enact her democratic rights.The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions . The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.

The American business expert Scott Galloway and others have argued they are irresistible pools of demand for the big tech firms.</p><p>As author and activist Naomi Klein writes, changes in these and other areas of our lives are about to see \"a warp-speed acceleration\".</p><p>All these transformations will follow a similar model: using automated platforms to gather and analyse data via online surveillance, then using it to predict and intervene in human behaviour.</p><p>The control revolution</p><p>The changes now under way are the latest phase of a socio-technical transformation that sociologist James Beniger, writing in the 1980s, called a \"control revolution\". This revolution began with the use of electronic systems for information gathering and communication to facilitate mass production and distribution of goods in the 19th century.</p><p>After World War II the revolution accelerated as governments and industry began to embrace cybernetics, the scientific study of control and communication. Even before COVID-19, we were already in the \"reflexive phase\" of the control revolution, in which big data and predictive technologies have been turned to the goal of automating human behaviour.</p><p>The next phase is what we might call the \"uberisation of everything\": replacing existing institutions and processes of government with computational code, in the same way Uber replaced government-regulated taxi systems with a smartphone app.</p><p>Information economics</p><p>Beginning in the 1940s, the work of information theory pioneer Claude Shannon had a deep effect on economists, who saw analogies between signals in electrical circuits and many systems in society. Chief among these new information economists was Leonid Hurwicz, winner of a 2007 Nobel Prize for his work on \"mechanism design theory\".</p><p>Economists have pursued analogies between human and mechanical systems ever since, in part because they lend themselves to modelling, calculation and prediction.</p><p>These analogies helped usher in a new economic orthodoxy formed around the ideas of F.A. Hayek, who believed the problem of allocating resources in society was best understood in terms of information processing.</p><p>By the 1960s, Hayek had come to view thinking individuals as almost superfluous to the operation of the economy. A better way to allocate resources was to leave decisions to \"the market\", which he saw as an omniscient information processor.</p><p>Putting information-processing first turned economics on its head. The economic historians Philip Mirowski and Edward Nik-Khah argue economists moved from \"ensuring markets give people what they want\" to insisting they can make markets produce \"any desired outcome regardless of what people want\".</p><p>By the 1990s this orthodoxy was triumphant across much of the world. By the late 2000s it was so deeply enmeshed that even the global financial crisis - a market failure of catastrophic proportions - could not dislodge it.</p><p>Market society</p><p>This orthodoxy holds that if information markets make for efficient resource allocation, it makes sense to put them in charge. We've seen many kinds of decisions turned over to automated data-driven markets, designed as auctions.</p><p>Online advertising illustrates how this works. First, the data generated by each visitor to a page is gathered, analysed and categorised, with each category acquiring a predictive probability of a given behaviour: buying a given product or service.</p><p>Then an automated auction occurs at speed as a web page is loading, matching these behavioural probabilities with clients' products and services. The goal is to \"nudge\" the user's behaviour. As Douglas Rushkoff explains, someone in a category that is 80% likely to do a certain thing might be manipulated up to 85% or 90% if they are shown the right ad.</p><p>This model is being scaled up to treat society as a whole as a vast signalling device. All human behaviour can be taken as a bid in an invisible auction that aims to optimise resource allocation.</p><p>To gather the bids, however, the market needs ever greater awareness of human behaviour. That means total surveillance is here to stay, and will get more intense and pervasive.</p><p>Growing surveillance combined with algorithmic interventions in human behaviour constrain our choices to an ever greater extent. Being nudged from an 80% to an 85% chance of doing something might seem innocuous, but that diminishing 20% of unpredictability is the site of human creativity, learning, discovery and choice. Becoming more predictable also means becoming more fragile.</p><p>In praise of obscurity</p><p>The pandemic has pushed many of us into doing even more by digital means, hitting fast-forward on the growth of surveillance and algorithmic influence, bringing more and more human behaviour into the realm of statistical probability and manipulation.</p><p>Concerns about total surveillance are often couched as discussions of privacy, but now is the time to think about the importance of obscurity. Obscurity moves beyond questions of privacy and anonymity to the issue, as Matthew Crawford identifies, of our \"qualitative experience of institutional authority\". Obscurity is a buffer zone - a space to be an unobserved, uncategorised, unoptimised human - from which a citizen can enact her democratic rights.</p><p>The onrush of digitisation caused by the pandemic may have a positive effect, if the body politic senses the urgency of coming to terms with the widening gap between fast-moving technology and its institutions.</p><p>The algorithmic market, left to its optimisation function, may well eventually come to see obscurity an act of economic terrorism. Such an approach cannot form the basis of institutional authority in a democracy. It's time to address the real implications of digital technology.</p><p>Zac Rogers is Research Lead at the Jeff Bleich Centre for the US Alliance in Digital Technology, Security, and Governance at Flinders University.</p><p>Cross-posted with permission from The Conversation under CC BY-ND 4.0 licence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0053447954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602C-GJP1-DXMP-K0WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 4, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Data in recent years show domestic media revenues plummeting, while digital firms scoop up more of the market.</p><p>Michael Geist, professor at University of Ottawa, said the threat by Facebook is likely to be heard by Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, who has been among the most vocal opponents of Facebook and Google on the issue.</p><p>\"Guilbeault sees that with what's playing out in Australia, there could be a pretty significant cost,\" Geist said. \"The Australian situation highlights why there's some pretty significant risk for Canada if we decided to go down this particular road and we're seeing it play out in Australia right now.\" Guilbeault has in the past floated the idea of imposing regulations to \"level the playing field\" for local media firms.</p><p>Earlier this year, a panel released a report commissioned by Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Guilbeault that called for \"regulatory intervention to ensure that creators of news are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>Observers in the technology and media spaces are divided over the issue. Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policymakers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently possess, he said. Canada has for the most part followed the lead from Australia, France, Germany and others on the issue.</p><p>\"They don't want to be first,\" Hirsh said. \"They want to look as if they are not necessarily being tough on Face book, but regulating social media.\"</p><p>He said the threats made by Facebook against Australia is a clear shot across the bow aimed at other countries, and a calculation by the company that disallowing people to share news on social media sites could prove politically unpopular. Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content. \"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Data in recent years show domestic media revenues plummeting, while digital firms scoop up more of the market.</p><p>Michael Geist, professor at University of Ottawa, said the threat by Facebook is likely to be heard by Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, who has been among the most vocal opponents of Facebook and Google on the issue.</p><p>\"Guilbeault sees that with what's playing out in Australia, there could be a pretty significant cost,\" Geist said. \"The Australian situation highlights why there's some pretty significant risk for Canada if we decided to go down this particular road and we're seeing it play out in Australia right now.\" Guilbeault has in the past floated the idea of imposing regulations to \"level the playing field\" for local media firms.</p><p>Earlier this year, a panel released a report commissioned by Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Guilbeault that called for \"regulatory intervention to ensure that creators of news are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>Observers in the technology and media spaces are divided over the issue. Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policymakers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently possess, he said. Canada has for the most part followed the lead from Australia, France, Germany and others on the issue.</p><p>\"They don't want to be first,\" Hirsh said. \"They want to look as if they are not necessarily being tough on Face book, but regulating social media.\"</p><p>He said the threats made by Facebook against Australia is a clear shot across the bow aimed at other countries, and a calculation by the company that disallowing people to share news on social media sites could prove politically unpopular. Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content. \"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Data in recent years show domestic media revenues plummeting, while digital firms scoop up more of the market.</p><p>Michael Geist, professor at University of Ottawa, said the threat by Facebook is likely to be heard by Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, who has been among the most vocal opponents of Facebook and Google on the issue.</p><p>\"Guilbeault sees that with what's playing out in Australia, there could be a pretty significant cost,\" Geist said. \"The Australian situation highlights why there's some pretty significant risk for Canada if we decided to go down this particular road and we're seeing it play out in Australia right now.\" Guilbeault has in the past floated the idea of imposing regulations to \"level the playing field\" for local media firms.</p><p>Earlier this year, a panel released a report commissioned by Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Guilbeault that called for \"regulatory intervention to ensure that creators of news are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>Observers in the technology and media spaces are divided over the issue. Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policymakers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently possess, he said. Canada has for the most part followed the lead from Australia, France, Germany and others on the issue.</p><p>\"They don't want to be first,\" Hirsh said. \"They want to look as if they are not necessarily being tough on Face book, but regulating social media.\"</p><p>He said the threats made by Facebook against Australia is a clear shot across the bow aimed at other countries, and a calculation by the company that disallowing people to share news on social media sites could prove politically unpopular. Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content. \"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Sun Media Corporation.

Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policymakers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently possess, he said.

Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content. \"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Data in recent years show domestic media revenues plummeting, while digital firms scoop up more of the market.</p><p>Michael Geist, professor at University of Ottawa, said the threat by Facebook is likely to be heard by Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, who has been among the most vocal opponents of Facebook and Google on the issue.</p><p>\"Guilbeault sees that with what's playing out in Australia, there could be a pretty significant cost,\" Geist said. \"The Australian situation highlights why there's some pretty significant risk for Canada if we decided to go down this particular road and we're seeing it play out in Australia right now.\" Guilbeault has in the past floated the idea of imposing regulations to \"level the playing field\" for local media firms.</p><p>Earlier this year, a panel released a report commissioned by Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Guilbeault that called for \"regulatory intervention to ensure that creators of news are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>Observers in the technology and media spaces are divided over the issue. Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policymakers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently possess, he said. Canada has for the most part followed the lead from Australia, France, Germany and others on the issue.</p><p>\"They don't want to be first,\" Hirsh said. \"They want to look as if they are not necessarily being tough on Face book, but regulating social media.\"</p><p>He said the threats made by Facebook against Australia is a clear shot across the bow aimed at other countries, and a calculation by the company that disallowing people to share news on social media sites could prove politically unpopular. Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content. \"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

As a reminder, this meeting is on the record and it will be live-streamed on CFR.org and we'll be starting in just a second.</p><p>Thank you so much. Thanks for a good afternoon. I'm David Sanger from The New York Times and happy new year and welcome back to the Council; good to see such a big crowd on a snowy day and also good that we've got such a crowd for such a really fascinating topic, one that doesn't get discussed in foreign policy circles enough so I'm delighted see the Council increasingly focusing on this.</p><p>Our topic today is the strange relationship between National Security and Silicon Valley which has been in the news increasingly and is a subject of significant tension that is likely to get to be significantly more tension in the next year and we have the perfect panel for discussing this.</p><p>Let me start at the far end, my old friend Chris Kirchhoff who was one of the Founding Partners of the Defense Innovation Unit X, the X is for Experimental and in the Trump administration they have dropped the X so whatever you experimented with they're doing Chris.</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: It's over.</p><p>SANGER: That's...</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: It's over.</p><p>SANGER: ... that's it.</p><p>Chris has had a number of fascinating jobs, at the National Security Council, at the Pentagon but he seemed in his element when I would go visit him and I was working on a book called \"The Perfect Weapon\" about Cyber and they would -- his offices were in, you said an old Air National Guard...</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Yes, Moffett Field.</p><p>SANGER: ... Unit that is just outside Moffett Air Force Base and the real reason that they were located there was the Pentagon couldn't afford the rents in Silicon Valley...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SANGER: ... So it wasn't the most luxurious startup operation you ever saw but it was really interesting and Google's -- one of Google's buildings sort of loomed over it from the side.</p><p>Eleonore Pauwels is the Director of The AI Lab at the Woodrow Wilson Center but she's also working at United Nations University these days as a Research Fellow on AI and Emerging Cyber-Technologies and has done some of the most interesting early writing about what the U.N.'s role could be and should be in dealing with regulating emergent -- Emerging Technologies.</p><p>And my friend Mary Wareham is the Arms Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch but she also runs something called -- I'll make sure I have the title of this right, \"The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots\"?</p><p>WAREHAM: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: Is that right? Which has got to be the most grabbing NGO title I can think of so we will -- the topic will turn to \"killer robots\" at some point soon. The Council is not yet buying its own but I'm sure they're going to budget for it in the future.</p><p>So Chris let me start with you. So this has been a big period of tumult (ph) in recent times for reasons that we will get into from the decisions made at Google and so forth and so on but DIUx began really after it became clear following the Snowden disclosures that Silicon Valley and the national security world were going incompletely divergent directions particularly after it was revealed that the NSA have gotten into Google server -- between Google servers I should say abroad and so forth.</p><p>But let me start you with they sort of most basic question, you've often made the argument that there has been no time when the private sectors' inventions have been more critical to national security than today so take us in that direction for a bit, tell us why and what you are trying to do with DIUx?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: For sure. Well first of all it's a privilege to be on a panel with David. As a young staffer at the Pentagon, the worst thing that could happen would be David Sanger calling you. You know, the most sensitive National Security programs that we run are called Special Access Programs and so they are sort of a by-name list as to who gets to know and the joke at our office was that David was an honorary member of all the lists and if he was calling you, you know, it could only go south.</p><p>And it's also such a privilege to be on a panel here with Mary, the Pentagon for its employees runs a program you can donate some of your salary to charity and I was delighted each year to donate to Human Rights Watch which is a wonderful organization, it is also a deliciously subversive thing to do as a Defense Department employee.</p><p>The story of technology is -- over the last two generations is really a dramatic one in terms of the shift from the traditional institutions of technology development in the government, the National Labs, DARPA, to the West Coast, to the commercial technology sector so it used to be the case that you could presume that the Department of Defense had a monopoly on Advanced Technology and for sure you can no longer presume that. And in fact, the pendulum has swung so far that Google and Apple, if you look at their market capitalization, even now are more than twice the size of the entire U.S. Defense sector combined so what that means is that the locus of innovation has shifted from East to West, if you will and if the Pentagon isn't focused on what technologies are being developed in Silicon Valley then it is simply not any longer on the cutting edge.</p><p>And just another stat to make this real, you know, one of her most advanced systems in the Military is some of our Advanced Electronic Warfare Systems particularly those that are on the Aegis Cruiser. And if you look at the technology that actually is a part of those systems, 96 percent of that technology is available today on the global commercial technology market, only 4 percent is sort of produced for Defense (inaudible) application.</p><p>So what that means is not only is the locus of technology shifting from military specific into the commercial world (ph) but it also means that our adversaries have access to technology that really levels the playing field in a way that is historically unprecedented for the United States and for our allies so for that reason Secretary of Defense Ash Carter thought it was time that the Pentagon shifted its view and sought to engage with the technology world (ph) and the startups that are part of it and but by and large have no interest whatsoever for a very good reason for engaging with us and that's the story of how I got sent out to the West Coast to help start a Defense Innovation Unit Experimental.</p><p>SANGER: And just a word or two about your view of the resistance that you encountered in Silicon Valley. Some of it was simply financial, a lot of startups were told, \"Whatever you do don't deal with the government,\" you know, \"they make you work forever, they pay small amounts of money and they pay up late,\" or if you're a furlough (ph) employee, \"they just don't pay it at all\"...</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: ... Right but there was also an increasing resistance that you were running into?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Yes. So I mean you know, first of all you know, imagine explaining to a startup that you just signed a contract with what a government shutdown is or what a Continuing Resolution is, that means we can't pay you what we'd just agreed we would -- we'd pay you so you can imagine -- that's actually in a way the most difficult divide I found certainly is just making the government machinery speed along at the pace that Silicon Valley moves at.</p><p>You know, Defense Innovation Unit Experimental is not even three years old at this point and they've already worked with about a hundred companies who had never before worked with the Department of Defense and have contracts now that are approaching you know, almost a billion dollars of value and so what we found certainly was a large number startups actually that were very interested in working with the Military on a variety of missions, everything from humanitarian, disaster relief, to one project actually on cancer detection.</p><p>Not all of our projects are necessary about kinetic war-fighting so certainly there is a debate going on in our nation around technology and technology for instance in Silicon Valley but I would say that DIUx was largely unaffected actually by those debates...</p><p>SANGER: Yes.</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: ... except in a couple of specific instances.</p><p>SANGER: OK.</p><p>Mary, you spent some time looking at what happened at Google in the past year as the debate took off about their involvement in something called Project Maven and then the continuing debate they are about whether they should do it on providing the Pentagon with Cloud services and so forth, tell us a little bit about what you learned as you worked with the 4,000 or so Google employees who seemed to object here?</p><p>WAREHAM: Thanks David. And thanks to the Council on Foreign Relations for convening this discussion and to my panelists; I think a perfect panel actually from this topic would be one with representatives from the companies both from the management as well as the tech workers themselves and I don't want to speak on behalf of either of those groups but I think I think this story of Project Maven and what happened with the Google employees last year is a -- is an interesting one from our perspective Human Rights Watch mainly with respect to the debate over Autonomous Weapons and the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots which I'm coordinating.</p><p>I think a lot of people probably hear -- knew that the Pentagon had embarked on this project with Google but it was out of the public eye until early last year when a Reporter at Gizmodo called Kate Conger who is now over at The New York Times started to publish a series of pieces about this project that Google was undertaking to -- from what we understand, identify objects from videos footage that had been shot by those surveillance drones owned by the U.S. Department of Defense and the idea from what I understand was to use the Machine Learning and AI to sift through all of that data.</p><p>I wrote a letter to the heads of Google after reading that article just to seek more information on Project Maven and to find out how they were going to avoid a slippery slope whereby identifying objects could then turn into identifying targets for lethal attacks.</p><p>At the same time, we also invited Google to make a public commitment not to contribute to the developments of we call \"Fully Autonomous Weapons\" and what the government's internationally call \"Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems\" and that for me sparked a kind of a series of conference calls with some of the Human Rights staff and others at Google.</p><p>But at the same time, I was also starting to receive email messages from Google employees themselves saying that there were very concerned about this particular project and that they wanted to support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.</p><p>What really came to light in April last year through the New York Times reporting was this open letter that more than 4,000 Google employees signed and it was addressed to their bosses and it demanded that the company commit to never build quote, \"Warfare Technology.\"</p><p>A few weeks later at the beginning of June, Google issued the first set of ethical principles for the Company and these are quite detailed principles and I looked through them to see if they had heeded the call from the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and the principles commit the Company not to design or deploy Artificial Intelligence to be used in weapons or in technology that causes overall harm to humans. That was more than we had called for, that was a pretty big commitment. The trick will be in how it is operationalized but we welcomed that commitment.</p><p>And a few days before issuing these ethical principles Google also indicated that it would no longer be participating in Project Maven once it expires -- once that contract expired this year. And then a few months later in October Google announced that it would not be bidding on this much bigger Pentagon contract -- Cloud Computing contract which I understand is worth billions of dollars and other major tech giants are still bidding on that.</p><p>So that's the story in a nutshell of Project Maven and the Google employees' actions which just last week we acknowledge with their Arms Control Award by the Arms Control Association will be -- it was given to these anonymous Google employees, that they are going to hand it over in April, I'm not so sure how they'll hand it over.</p><p>And then the -- in the meantime we've been continuing from the campaign engagement with interested tech workers and these are tech workers not only in Silicon Valley, the Google ones including but in Europe and other parts of the world, people were contacting me from Google offices in Zurich, in Dublin, and in Japan, and elsewhere.</p><p>It's a -- I think -- I think it attracted a lot of attention because it was perhaps one of the first visible examples of the tech workers really starting to organize and now, we see thousands of employees at these big tech companies pushing back against projects on personnel (ph) decisions that they consider unethical.</p><p>I could go more into the campaign and...</p><p>SANGER: Well...</p><p>WAREHAM: ... how we're working with the tech workers but maybe just close off, another development from last year which concerns the United Nations. We meet at the United Nations for the diplomatic talks but last November on the 100-Year Anniversary of the end of World War I in Paris, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called for a prohibition on Fully Autonomous Weapons and I want to just read to you what he said. \"Imagine the consequences of an autonomous weapon that could by itself target and attack human beings. I call upon states to ban these weapons which are politically unacceptable and morally repugnant.\"</p><p>So he has taken the (inaudible) stand that machines that have the power and the discretion to take human lives are politically unacceptable and morally repugnant and should be prohibited by international law.</p><p>So those are a couple of examples of some of the things that happened last year with respect to the debate over autonomy and weapon systems and I think they show the momentum is building towards the creation of new international law.</p><p>SANGER: ... well we'll -- we'll come back to that in a minute but I think you perfectly teed up Eleonore on the question of what role might the U.N. have here because when you think about the early and major arms control agreements of the world, most of them were not done within the confines of the U.N., some were but most were not and yet it is interesting that the secretary-general sort of laid out this marker so what are you seeing at the U.N., is this an area for U.N. Commissions, is it an area for un-sponsored treaties, what...</p><p>PAUWELS: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: ... what's the -- what's the landscape?</p><p>PAUWELS: Thank you so much David. Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be here in such a good company. I wanted to start by sharing a few words of warning and wisdom from the U.N. secretary-general that are part of a report called, \"Securing Our Common Future,\" it was published this summer and he's saying \"We are living in dangerous times, new combination of weapon technologies is increasing risks, including from the ability of non- state actors to wage attacks across international boundaries.\"</p><p>And this quote often makes me think of another sentence from George Orwell, which says -- which says, \"It was an exceptional life that we are living, an unusual way to be at war,\" if you could call it war and so indeed at the U.N. governance level there is an acute understanding that were facing a new form of tech convergence which is simply too powerful for human kind to refuse but they are so inherently dual-use with drastic on long-term implications for global security in Cyberspace.</p><p>And so there is -- therefore a conviction that we need foresight, we need foresight and prevention for the Cyber era. Think of Deep-Learning Systems that are able to drastically intensify the nature and scope of Cyber-attacks or to design DEEP FIX simulations based on Biometrics that could initiate and fuel conflicts. The same algorithms can be used to optimize Genome editing for Biodefense applications and Tone Swarms relying on Cyber Networks of Intelligence are already changing the nature of prevention and conflict but could also help in the future, perform precision attacks on populations and Biotechnical structures. We are also building in -- slowly but surely an Internet of Genomes build these in in MIMES where surveillance and data manipulation may become pervasive.</p><p>And so increasingly there is an acute understanding at the U.N. of this new permeability between civil and military technologies which is disrupting prevention, denying attribution, and atomizing responsibility and therefore creating new risks for civilian security.</p><p>The diagnosis doesn't stop here as we witness Complex and Ambiguous Tech disruptions , we are also facing inside the U.N. a significant Trust Deficit Disorder and that's mentioned in almost every speech of the U.N. secretary-general, there are major tensions and dissenting interest between superpowers such as the U.S. and China that are engaged in a fierce competition over who controls AI, CyberTech, and Biotech and then other states are now -- are now testing new ways of waging Cohesive Emotional Conflicts remotely (ph).</p><p>Inequality is also widening for those countries that are Tech takers instead of being Tech leaders and some of those are on the verge of being cyber-colonized for their Biological Data and others are quickly becoming weak security links in Cyberspace so that's a diagnosis made at the U.N.</p><p>Finally we are also facing a new corporate order which is not made of diplomats and lawyers like we used to but made of CEOs with global reach and these large private tech platforms which have often applied a model of Permissionless Innovation, we break and we innovate; these platforms are now becoming our last line of defense as Dual-use Technologies are converging in Cyberspace and in turn some of these platforms such as Microsoft are increasingly interested in defining Cyber norms and policies for Cyberspace.</p><p>So in defense of this divide what role can the U.N. play in bridging national security and the private sector interest in the global governance of Dual-use Technologies? Within the U.N. there is an increasing commitment to better engage with the private sector from different regions including Asia and the Indo-Pacific, in the governance of AI and Emerging Technologies, and you see this through the high-level panel on Digital Cooperation that was launched by the U.N. secretary-general earlier (ph) this year and his agenda on Innovation.</p><p>So there is a sense of urgency that's been rooted at the (inaudible) system, needs to help build a new social contract to ensure that AI and Converging Technologies will be deployed safely and -- this is I think very important but aligned with the ethical needs of a globalizing world so there is a realization that the U.N. is in a unique position to articulate an ethical proposal - an ethical proposition for the global governance of Dual-use Technologies and so help states, the private sector, and other stakeholders find common ground, define their interest, and define their policy options so that learning about governance happens without crisis and failures.</p><p>So with this in mind the U.N. increasingly is trying to play a governance role which is deeply needed at the international level and this role is defined and they are the following words, \"To promote increasing foresight; to anticipate risk-diversity of expertise; the unknown implications of the combination of powerful Dual-use Technologies; to be an honest broker in discussion over norms, and oversight,\" which doesn't really exist at the international level, \"to monitor and ensure consistency between national, regional, and private-sector actors;\" and finally, may be the most important, to be -- \"to be a safe space where we can report governance anomalies including the misuse -- the misuses of Converging Technologies so that there is a feedback loop to improve normative governance -- normative guidance.\"</p><p>So it's an agenda that's about foresight and prevention for Converging Technologies, prevention for the Cyber-era.</p><p>And I think it makes sense for the private sector because we are at a crossroads. The next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs will have to manage the powerful tension (ph) between the need for secrecy and security and an ethos of openness and sharing in AI, CyberTech, and the Life-Sciences.</p><p>SANGER: Great. Well thank you.</p><p>Chris, you were among a group of people in Silicon Valley who taught me as I was doing book research and other reporting how complicated this gets really fast right so let's start with something simple like Project Maven. Some of the people who were working on Maven will tell you that most of the software could be used for Target Discrimination which is to say, to make sure that a farmer standing in the field with a farm implement is not mistaken by a drone operator to be a terrorist standing in the field with a rifle and that you're using this in an effort to go reduce casualties which is -- which over time in -- if you look at American drone-attacks it appears that they've gotten better using better technology at reducing -- not eliminating but certainly reducing the amount of collateral damage.</p><p>In a program like running the Pentagon's Cloud Services, some of that's going to use no doubt for war purposes but a huge amount of it is just going to be used for ordinary information sifting, the kinds of things that IBM used to build years ago for the Pentagon and others in the day of big mainframe computers so walk us a little bit through how cloudy this gets and how quickly?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Sure. Well I mean David you really you know, got right to it. I mean you know, the technology that Project Maven was about is actually not dissimilar from what Google has in its Nest security cameras which is a set of algorithms that can identify activities that the camera sees, it might be relevant for a human operator to observe and this is again where you know, there is a long spectrum I think of how Dual-use Technology gets employed and I think it's one thing to sit back and notice that you know, Artificial Intelligence is part of the family of technologies that can be used in fact in systems that are kinetic but that doesn't mean they will be, it doesn't mean that the purposes that they are deployed for will actually be anything other than force protection or defensive - so one of the things that was interesting for us, was the Department of Defense watching the Project Maven in countries that play out is for us to sit back and realize, \"Hey, you know, this is actually not targeting technology in a way that we think of targeting technology,\" it has many other uses.</p><p>And you know, I am actually -- I'm really proud of the Google employees for taking the stand they did and for beginning to wrestle with the nuanced-debate that we're all in about technology because the -- there is a spectrum of people that have responsibility for technology and it starts at the people that are inventing it but it ends ultimately with the people that use it on behalf of our government, our elected officials, and I think everybody needs to be a part of this conversation.</p><p>SANGER: Now one of the arguments you hear frequently in the Pentagon was -- and I'll ask Eleonore and Mary to come back and comment on this as well is, it's one thing for us to set a good moral line about how we're going to use this or not but unlike in the nuclear arms race, these are mostly technologies where you have no ability to verify how they're being used and at the time they're being developed, the people who are developing them may not know how they will ultimately be used.</p><p>So how do you design a set of principles here that you would have any confidence the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans, anybody else, who the U.S. might define as an adversary, will be making use of them and what do you -- how do you answer those at the Pentagon who would say, \"If AI shortens the time frame for an adversary to react, we have no choice but to use it to be able to shorten our time frames as well or its -- you're essentially disarming?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Well we're a democracy and we have made commitments to Human Rights and to ways of waging war that are -- that are -- keep those principles front-and-center so that's -- that's you know, number one.</p><p>Number two is that you know, the Pentagon is actually now in the process of developing its own set of principles on AI because it realizes I mean people in the military realize that this is going to be an issue with us for a long time but I think it's going to be difficult. I mean If you look at Google's AI principles which is a really noble first attempt to articulate a set of ideas about how we should think about AI, the first principle that Google listed is that AI is to be socially beneficial. I think that's right but you know, it turns out that security is actually a public good that's socially beneficial and AI is going to be a huge part of it in the future, going forward of ensuring security both domestically and abroad.</p><p>So you know, in a way Google's own principles, you read them -- at least to my mind, would actually call for Project Maven to go forward not to be stopped.</p><p>SANGER: Interesting (ph).</p><p>So Mary when you look at this, I mean this is the ultimate Dual-use Technology as we discussed with Maven, you could use it to avoid civilian casualties, you could use it to improve targeting, and you could be doing both of those at the same time?</p><p>WAREHAM: Yes. I mean maybe just to be clear, the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots calls for a preemptive ban on Fully Autonomous Weapons; preemptive means future weapon systems not the current ones today so you know, prohibiting drones is not within the scope...</p><p>SANGER: Right.</p><p>WAREHAM: ... of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and different members of the coalition have got different opinions on the impact of drones which some I guess call Semi...</p><p>SANGER: But it would...</p><p>WAREHAM: ... Autonomous...</p><p>SANGER: ... stop a...</p><p>WAREHAM: ... Security Drone.</p><p>SANGER: ... Fully Autonomous Drone, a future fully autonomous, would it or not?</p><p>WAREHAM: The tech?</p><p>SANGER: Under your principles?</p><p>WAREHAM: What we're seeking is international -- we're -- we're seeking a new law and we're hearing a lot of talk at the moment about principles. Principles are fine you...</p><p>SANGER: Yes.</p><p>WAREHAM: ... know Google issued its principles. We spent last year the United Nations in August with the diplomats while they negotiated the principles from the talks on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems and they came up with a big set of nonbinding principles and one of the first kind of findings of that was that international law applies to new weapon systems including Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems and it also affirmed the importance of the human element.</p><p>And so I -- for us that showed that governments are willing and ready to negotiate on the topic of killer robots, the problem is that they were negotiating nonbinding principles for a final report of the conference and not the international treaty that we seek.</p><p>We seek a new international law and national laws because that's when we're binding in permanence then ethical principles which can be forgotten like policy, overridden, dis -- you know, disbanded and that kind of thing.</p><p>We know that there are all sorts of challenges involved with verification and monitoring of such an international treaty but that's no reason for not attempting this and it has been done before as you might've seen from many of the open letters that have been issued since 2015 from the -- from the technology experts in those -- and the AI experts in those communities, they talk about how they're a little bit like the nuclear scientists and the chemists of the last century who wanted to continue their work in those fields but did not want to see it weaponized and that resulted in the creation of the Chemical Weapons Convention; we now have the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and these provide the normative frameworks to deal with some of the challenges that have raised.</p><p>SANGER: Great.</p><p>So Eleonore last question for you before we open this up to everybody else so the U.N.'s first -- so the toe in the water in this area was, the creation of a Council of Experts who were looking mostly at Cyber -- less at Artificial Intelligence issues and for a year or two they came up with some good principles, the U.S., the Chinese, the Russians, all signed on. Then last year the effort seemed to kind of fall apart as...</p><p>PAUWELS: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: ... they met again, try to push this forward, and basically sort of backtrack even on some of their initial agreements. What did -- what lessons are to be learned from how the U.N. has approached this kind of thing before?</p><p>PAUWELS: Yes. Increasingly I think the strategy will not necessarily be to get a consensus at the interstate level but actually have the U.N. invest in a -- in almost a new ethos of foresight and prediction, so prediction for convention.</p><p>I had a conversation with engineers at the MIME this summer and the most interesting part of our interaction was this notion that we as a species are really bad at anticipation, we just don't do foresight, we don't do it well.</p><p>And I think most -- may be the most crucial at this point would be to be able to engage the private sector, national policymakers, experts in academia and civil society in that process of foresight, so anticipating the implications of Dual-use Technologies and I say so because one element that I think is the most interesting here is this permeability (ph) between civilian military technologies and the increasing collusion between civilian and military contacts so for example we are facing a drastic phenomenonal -- phenomenon of decentralization in Converging Technologies; you can these days use Automated BioLabs, I call them \"Intelligent and Connected,\" they are Biotech Labs in the Cloud where you can run (ph) about 50 types of Bio-experiments just from your computer anywhere in the world and you can basically harness those processes to piece together benign DNA fragments into sequences that could lead to the production of Bio-agents of concern and using those systems you can to some extent evade some of the norms that we have developed at -- at the national levels and even international levels.</p><p>SANGER: Great.</p><p>PAUWELS: So the different resistance (ph) is really showing you how -- you know, technological experts will not be able to truly opt out of the security consequences of what they design and so we need to have them upstream in the process, in a conversation with policymakers and other experts doing foresight and if we can then shape the design of those Dual-use Technologies so that we have a form of you know, a -- you know, a form of non-contamination, a way to be able to target the decentralization (ph) process I think that would be very interesting.</p><p>SANGER: Oh, we've got about 25 minutes for all of your questions. There are microphones please wait until the microphone comes to you. A couple of things to know, first of all as I should have noted earlier, all of this session is on the record so that means your questions are also on the record. And when you do get the microphone, please stand, and tell us your name and your affiliation and really try to make sure that it's one question.</p><p>Great. So who would like to start off here?</p><p>Sir?</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. John Wilkinson, Building Engineering &amp; Science Talent. I wonder whether you could compare the issues that surround culture and the issues that surround values as the key divide between our National Security establishment and a Silicon Valley? It sounds from this conversation is that it's about values and we haven't said much about culture.</p><p>SANGER: Who wants to pick that up?</p><p>Chris?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Well I mean you know, the culture of tech is you know, awful different than the culture of the Pentagon that's for sure right, I mean you know, we don't have dogs in espresso bars and you know, free laundry in the Pentagon, last time I checked but you know, there's actually a lot that the two communities have in common. They are very mission driven, there are people who are there to do big things and to do things they care about, to do things that are important and one of my regrets, having now lived on -- in both cultures is how infrequently they actually meet which I think speaks to an even larger challenge for the nation that I think Mary and I we both very firmly agree on, which is that more dialogue not less is needed and we need to invent ways to make sure that dialogue happens at a much more rapid pace because the reality is, is all the issues that we face as a nation are becoming much more bound up with technology and many of the people here in Washington that are in charge of making policy on those issues don't have the benefit of having on their staffers that are in the room, people that really have had analytic (ph) experience with that technology so in that sense you know, DIUx has been a wonderful experiment right to take employees from Google and add them to our staff and then to send them back and to open some of those doors for conversation between the cultures.</p><p>WAREHAM: Maybe just to...</p><p>SANGER: Sure.</p><p>WAREHAM: ... I just wanted to read maybe a little extract from what one of the tech workers said at an event we did at the U.N. last August which is that you know, \"The concerns that the Google employee raised were not Google specific but affected the entire industry and workers with his and they weren't just about the military applications of the tech and its use but about use in domestic policing and surveillance and in other circumstances and the demands that the workers had with the transparency for public oversight, for employee representation, for decision-making power,\" you know, they wanted to stand up to the rights of all people and to give those on the receiving end of this technology control over their own lives.</p><p>And those are quite lofty you know, that is quite a lofty message to give but I think it shows the breadth and depth of the concerns here it's not just about the military and the national security side of it, it's really much, much broader than that and it's not just Google, it's -- it's across the board.</p><p>SANGER: I would just say that while it's across-the-board, every company has got its own distinct culture so you've seen...</p><p>WAREHAM: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: ... Google do what Google did, Microsoft turned out a set of principles that said it would deal with the Pentagon but then would also call them out if it believed the technology was being used wrong.</p><p>And then Amazon which currently does Cloud Services for the CIA and others and is probably the leading contender for the Pentagon project, has been much more silent on these issues...</p><p>WAREHAM: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: ... so.</p><p>Some other questions, ma'am, right here.</p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Hi, I am Jen Leonard with PACE Global Strategies. You touched on it a bit by expanding the conversation beyond Google's role and yes (ph) you mentioned Microsoft, Amazon, et cetera so help school me, some of this is new to me, what does it say about the industry, the sector, that at least in the case of Maven which you cited, the conversation began with basically an entrepreneurial journalist, probably some source documents that really spurred a very important discussion that you walked us through, the chronology.</p><p>I mean these are engineers who see a problem and want to fix it but the ability, the capacity, the willingness to put that problem-solving into a political context, an ethical context, are they wired to do that, is this learning in real time?</p><p>And we've also focused on the -- a very U.S.-centric conversation, can you -- can you broaden the aperture and talk about I mean I had the pleasure of going to the symposium in Silicon Valley a few weeks back that the CFR organized, lots of talk about China and the race -- and the competition there, so where does this dialogue fit in that global context? Thanks.</p><p>SANGER: Who wants to take that first?</p><p>PAUWELS: Let me go.</p><p>SANGER: Sure.</p><p>PAUWELS: So -- and I think I will bridge between two questions the previous one and this one. There is an intrinsic tension between the need for secrecy in national security and this notion that we need to share -- be open and share algorithms and source codes, training data sets, in the global tech industry so I think that's what you are facing there in terms of value admission.</p><p>And increasingly we see that in the tension between Silicon Valley and China where there is to some extent a willingness from the -- from Silicon Valley to go work with other companies in China and with engineers and do a form of knowledge -- transfer of knowledge and knowledge sharing and at the same time you have on the -- on China side, a much closer markets where data sets are not shared, there is not the same form of reciprocity in terms of flows of data, and also an aggressive strategy really you know, reinforced by the government to reform of Cyber-colonization and get as many Genomics Data, Biological Data, data about ecosystems in different places of the world for economic gain in China.</p><p>And so there you have again this tension between a technology for public good, for global public good and a technology that serves the interest of one nation with strategies of acquisition and codation (ph).</p><p>SANGER: Anybody else on this one?</p><p>WAREHAM: I mean perhaps just to say that the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, last year wrote to both Microsoft and Amazon seeking to have a similar dialogue to the one that we had with Google and we've not received a -- any replies to those letters yet but we follow carefully and look at what Brad Smith is saying in all of his blog posts about his desire you know, the concerns that AI raises for weapons in warfare and he's actually talked about the need for new law and policy .</p><p>On the Amazon side, we've seen Bezos describe the prospect of Fully Autonomous Weapons as genuinely scary and his suggestion, a new treaty to regulate them, that was why we wrote you know.</p><p>So we're -- we're kind of very much a single -- single-issue campaign here as you can tell but we are seeking to have a meaningful dialogue not just with the tech workers but with the -- from the -- from the very top, top-down as well.</p><p>There's been a few questions about Russia, about China, about other countries that are investing heavily in AI and military applications of AI. All I can say is that those countries they are also participating in the international diplomatic talks over killer robots and -- but none of them are terribly progressive but the campaign we just been reviewing a new public opinion survey from 26 countries around the world including China, Russia, Israel, South Korea, and in almost all of those countries -- the results will come out in a week, so I'm kind of giving you a sneak preview but almost all of those countries, the majority of the people who were polled opposed the developments of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems and the ones who were opposed, opposed on the most kind of popular reason why was that they did not want to see machines take human lives, the moral arguments and the fact that such weapons would be accountable (ph).</p><p>So I think we're starting to make inroads into the public opinion not just in the United States but around the world.</p><p>SANGER: Sir? There on the aisle (ph), yes.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Tuck Hassinger (ph), O'Melveny &amp; Myers (ph). You know, this discussion is obviously far broader than killer robots as the Google principles refer, and your organization endorsed those, I mean it's more than you asked for, it's also broader than weaponization, it's law enforcement, companies being resistant to unlocking devices, other, terrorists for example who are producing documents, it's -- it's a broader debate.</p><p>If Google's principles are the ethical principles, what is unethical, how do you draw the line and why is it more ethical to refuse to support endeavors in the national security community than it is to support those?</p><p>SANGER: Chris, do you want to take a first shot?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Yes. I think we should be very clear eyed about what's happening. What's happening is that because the world is a much wider place because of technology, the world order, the nations of the U.S. and Europe are not enjoying the kind of technological supremacy that they have for a long time and this has big implications for the ongoing competition between democracies on the one hand and autocracies on the other and just look at the way that you know, China and Russia are both using AI to suppress their own populations.</p><p>So one thing that we should -- certainly cannot afford to have happen as a nation at this moment is to have the people in the tech companies that are the smartest in this technology showing (ph) any contact with these very difficult issues and walking away, it would be like Detroit walking away in 1941 from the war effort, it just can't happen so I -- I'm hopeful that as we go forward in these debates people in tech companies are able to understand that these debates are playing out in a global context where -- we are in a -- in a very competitive new world.</p><p>SANGER: Sure.</p><p>WAREHAM: Perhaps just to say that that when I was speaking about Google's ethical principles and the campaign, it was the campaign welcomed the weapons part of that. The broader -- the ethical principles that will address all sorts of different aspects raised by AI and my organization, Human Rights Watch and others have got some big questions about other parts of them and other colleagues of my organization could speak much better to the surveillance concerns, to the developments and use of Special Recognition software and that tech and how that's been developed so I don't want anyone to kind of go away and think, \"Oh, we are all -- we are all good, now that Google has issued all these ethical principles.\"</p><p>We're not, there's still a lot of work to do but at least we've got a document to start the discussion with when it comes to that company.</p><p>SANGER: OK. Let's see here.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, I'm Audrey Kurth Cronin, Director of the Center for Kurth Cronin (ph), Director of the Center for Security Innovation and New Technology at American University. It's pretty easy to imagine how Artificial Intelligence would be used once a war is underway but what I am interested in is to what degree is Narrow Artificial Intelligence, so not fully developed killer robots but some of the applications that are currently in place, to what degree is that either stabilizing or destabilizing in your opinion with respect to (ph) the outbreak of war?</p><p>SANGER: For the last word, respect to the (ph)?</p><p>QUESTION: The beginning of a major war.</p><p>SANGER: The beginning, OK. So early days, early days so early days -- Chris why don't you start with this, this is a subject we've talked a lot about particularly on the destabilizing efforts -- effects of having shorter decision space?</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Yes. Sure. So I'd say is two things. I mean one is that systems that are reliant upon Artificial Intelligence can be very unstable and we've seen that with Tesla automobiles for instance that are learning constantly how to drive better on roads and every now and again the car will -- kind of re-condition (ph) if the algorithm is not handed to equip (ph) and something really bad will happen so you can imagine when you now start using Artificial Intelligence, the systems that are involved in war and peace that the fundamental instability that can be a part of AI systems becomes a really crucial concern which is why modeling and safety will be a crucial part of any discussion of Artificial Intelligence, really in any context but particularly in the context of national security.</p><p>And you know, again one of the things we cannot afford to have happen is to sit here modeling and safety technologies are all in the car systems (ph), they you know, they're -- it's Tesla and the firms on the contract with that are far ahead of really any of the National Security agencies and so this will be as a nation something that we need to import into our national security complex.</p><p>But I would say another thing about war right which is you know, this -- you know, the Pentagon exists to prevent war, to deter war, to make sure war never happens. I mean war if it does happen between advanced states it's going to be so violent and states, it's going to be so violent, so catastrophic, it's going to happen so quickly, it's not going to be anything like we've ever known before, it's going to be the worst possible outcome we could ever get to.</p><p>So I think we need to do everything we can to never allow war to break out and Artificial Intelligence is going to be one of the key technologies that will advance what the Pentagon calls \"indication and warning\" (ph) using for instance Artificial Intelligence to shift to satellite data, to pick up any indications that there might be for instance a missile launch by North Korea, and then taking steps to prevent that from happening before it does right.</p><p>So these technologies you know, again are very nuanced, it's very complicated, many applications and may end up having applications that stop war.</p><p>SANGER: Eleonore can you pick up on that as -- in the discussions at the U.N., do you hear much discussion of the deterrent effects of these technologies?</p><p>PAUWELS: Yes. I mean in terms of how now, a way (ph) I could be using it. In terms of (inaudible) now, a way I could be using Cyber Defense and Cyber Offense, one of the issues is that (inaudible) networks have a tendency to show aggressiveness behaviors and kind of escalate behaviors when they -- when they are used eliminate cyber-attacks so you could be facing a problem with you know, not really having a concept of proportionality anymore that stands.</p><p>In terms of deterrence, I mean that's not really a strategy we can use in the same way but algorithms could help you increasingly identifying where the source of the aggression comes from, not necessarily the identity or the attribution as we were doing it in the past but could help you patch some of the -- some of the issues you are facing.</p><p>So it's another form of -- it's more prevailing, prevailing by foresight and having strong algorithms on your side and you being able to do a full attribution network thinking (ph) but so -- if I may, I wanted to bridge the two last questions with -- I think we are focusing extremely on this notion of military use of those Converging Technologies but you could think of so many other ways that aid our data manipulation, you manipulate data using algorithms in a Genomics Data Base or you, you know, use those Automated Attacks for propaganda, for surveillance, for Cognitive Emotional Conflict, manipulating public perceptions inside foreign countries so political security in a form of Digital Biosecurity is at stake here when you can actually use Data Optimization in Productivity Analysis (ph) (inaudible).</p><p>SANGER: I think you raise a very interesting point which is we tend to think of the kinetic when in fact in the Russia case we saw one of influence operations, we've seen cases of data manipulation...</p><p>PAUWELS: Yes.</p><p>SANGER: ... we've seen data manipulation against non-military systems, Iranian centrifuges and so forth and so on, also intended if you ask the designers to do what Chris suggested which is deter a conflict rather than push out a capability rather than bring one down right away.</p><p>We have about six or seven minutes so I'm going to grab three questions and let the panel here, in that wonderful Washington way decide which ones they are going to answer.</p><p>So the gentleman there, and then let's see where -- there was -- some hands over on this side, maybe not. And then the gentleman in the front, and in the back there behind you, yes.</p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Zach Baker from the Center for Public Integrity. I wanted to ask, if we look at a little bit of history of the attempted reach across the country between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley, if you look at for instance the Defense Digital Service. Now at the start of the idea was to convince Silicon Valley engineers to do a tour in the Pentagon and over time they found that they weren't as successful at times in doing that and so they instead were trying to find military officers with coding skills that could be helpful for some of the applications so when the Pentagon doesn't find what it needs out at Silicon Valley, it finds it internally in the military. What do you think it means if Silicon Valley decides not to work with the Pentagon in terms of the way that AI technology is developed for military weapons systems, what does it mean if they have to find solutions internally or with traditional defense contractors instead of working with Silicon Valley?</p><p>SANGER: OK so that's the first question.</p><p>And sir, you'll be the second?</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. I'm Jaime kon Duckley (ph), Clinton Group (ph). The question really is to Christopher. You mentioned about the fact that private technology dominates most technology in that 96 percent of it is commercially, available only 4 percent is classified. My question is, does this apply to technology in general or is it the application of technology, the division between the 96 and 4 percent? And two, how does this compare to for example places like China, Russia other places?</p><p>SANGER: OK.</p><p>And sir?</p><p>QUESTION: Adam Furman (ph), a former Pentagon lawyer and both of those questions are much better than mine but of the topics that we've hit today, nobody has talked supply chain, Supply Chain Security and is it something that we should be concerned about for consumer electronics made overseas and what that kind of market share might do in terms of national security concerns?</p><p>SANGER: OK. Three great questions.</p><p>Chris, I'm going to start with you on the first one which was the Defense Digital Service, what we learned from that and whether the Pentagon can provide this coding themselves. If they could I don't think the DIUx would necessarily have been around.</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: You know, our biggest success at DIUx, it was actually a software project involving a tool that allows much more efficient air refueling and it's an amazing story of how just a few programmers from the Air Force working with a couple of people from a software development firm were able to for a million and a half dollars saved the government hundreds of millions of dollars in keeping tankers up flying in the fight against ISIL so I think the military has woken up to the fact that software engineering is actually a core skill; you know, it's going to be silicon not steel that wins the next war and so that's a game that wins the next war and so that's the game we're playing and we ought to have in-house talent to do it.</p><p>I think the Defense (inaudible) has actually had a lot of success, is they've been really important but as Zach mentioned there I mean there is this is divide right, in terms of attracting people truly from the -- from the sort of the real private sector, the tech firms who have a level of skill that's -- that's you know, 10 X maybe even a hundred X, your average programmer that hasn't had that experience and if we fail to attract them, if we fail to develop easy ways to hire them, to respect their unique skills, to bring the them in laterally for a couple years and to put them to work on our hardest operational problems, to get them a security clearance quickly so they don't have to wait a year and a half to actually do something real, if we don't do that, make no mistake we will have a weaker military because of it.</p><p>SANGER: You know, you remind me of a story I heard when I was out doing some reporting where one of your colleagues said to a head of a small Silicon Valley startup start up, the startup head said to him, \"You know, I would give you some of my coders but I don't think they would get a security clearance,\" and he said, \"You mean because they smoked weed, when they were in college?\" And he said, \"No, because they smoke weed while they code.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SANGER: And he said, \"We'd bring it to them, if it works.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SANGER: OK.</p><p>There was a good question about the application of the -- of the 4 percent rule that you have. Anybody here can take that on?</p><p>Chris, is that one, that you -- you're the one who cited the number so.</p><p>KIRCHHOFF: Yes. And I would just say that Luke you know, one of the challenges for all of us is that technology is really democratizing so it used to be the case that if you wanted to exert power in the world you'd belt -- you'd build an aircraft carrier, or a sixth (ph) generation stealth fighter and now if you're a small group of people, you can really go on Amazon, you can buy a drone, you can strap a grenade to it, and you can cause a real problem whether you're ISIS in the Middle East or whether you want to go you know, making an NFL Football game more exciting than it ordinarily is, so technology is democratizing and it's not just in the kinetic warfare, it's in -- it's in Bio, it's in many other areas.</p><p>And so we I think as a nation, both law enforcement and national security, are facing a whole new world and it's going to take deep cooperation from the people that know these technologies, the best, to do all they can to keep to keep -- to keep our nation sovereign, to keep us all safe.</p><p>SANGER: Mary, can you take on the supply chain question?</p><p>WAREHAM: No.</p><p>SANGER: No.</p><p>WAREHAM: Not really.</p><p>SANGER: You can't.</p><p>WAREHAM: Not my -- sorry. That's not...</p><p>SANGER: Eleonore?</p><p>WAREHAM: ... my thing.</p><p>PAUWELS: Oh...</p><p>SANGER: Can you talk a little bit about it? I'm sure the issue come up some as people have dealt with the sovereignty issues and the -- at the U.N.</p><p>PAUWELS: ... I was more thinking about it in a -- in a technical aspect but I don't know if that's what the interlocutor meant.</p><p>You know, as the convergence happen you are going to have use of algorithms and automation increasingly to endanger different types of supply chain we have so Biotech, Medical, you know, you can think of any form of Data Optimization and use of data we do so those supply chains are probably not always taken into consideration because they don't necessarily belong to the military - the traditional military perspective; they are part of national security though but that something that you know, that that's a -- that's a field where more and more Cyber experts are trying to start cooperating with Biosecurity -- Biosecurity experts for example and AI security experts to understand how we protect certain type of infrastructure and supply chains.</p><p>SANGER: Great.</p><p>We have about one minute for any final thoughts.</p><p>WAREHAM: I mean I guess I've been around the block too long because I've worked for the last 20 years on particularly indiscriminance (ph) and inhumane weapons with people like General Guard (ph) who is in the -- in the audience here. And in the United States and especially in this town we always hear the high-tech fix, you know, the high-tech fix on landmines was to create some self-destructing landmines and if we all just used those ones everything would be better.</p><p>The answer from the U.S. on cluster bombs and all the civilian carnage that were being caused by those weapons was to create sensitive (ph) weapons and new and better type you know, so when I hear these arguments on the AI that we're kind of you know, that it will reduce casualties, it will do all of these wonderful things, we are always kind of dealing with that with a certain degree of skepticism but you know, we are not saying to the Pentagon, \"Don't use AI ,\" we hear a lot about the dirty, the dull, the dangerous, tasks that Artificial Intelligence can be helpful with and we want however for it to be beneficial for humanity which is why we ask the question, \"What happens when AI is incorporated into weapon systems,\" and we have to look at the regulatory framework which currently is lacking and which is why we call for a new international law.</p><p>SANGER: Great. Well we are not out of questions but we are out of time and the CFR has determined that if we go beyond time, they begin to replace the moderators with robotic moderators (inaudible) soon (ph), I want to avoid that.</p><p>So I want to thank you all for coming and appreciate your question. And thank our panelists as well.</p><p>WAREHAM: Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200003131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H6R-PC51-JCRM-B0GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9503\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Data Licensing, LLC.

It will test this technology with FedExExpress, a cargo airline. It's the latest sign that the action in augmented reality is in the enterprise, as mainstream consumer smartglasses are years away.For the past few years, augmented reality companies have set their sights on the larger consumer market, as big tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple chase what they believe to be the next big platform. </p><p>But now, the companies making augmented reality-powered smart eyewear are changing course: They're now going after selling to big businesses, as it now looks like it could be a few years before the devices are small and light enough for mainstream use. One great example of this shift towards businesses is ODG, a San Francisco-based company that has gotten a lot of attention for its Android-based smartglasses. ODG spent most of 2017 angling its R-9 glasses for consumers and developers. The glasses were able to show vivid images inside its lenses, putting similar hardware to a tablet on your head to project digital imagery over the real world. Now, ODG istaking its optical technology and integrating it with the oxygen masks worn by pilots, it announced on Wednesday. It looks like a step beyond Google Glass, integrating the headgear with a plane's onboard systems. \"There's a lot of attention on augmented reality, whether it's tablets and phones, heads-up-displays or headworn, like us, or [Microsoft] Hololens, or the hype around Magic Leap,\" ODG COO Pete Jameson told Business Insider. \"But this is technology integrated into a vertical industry with an immediate impact on lives.\" ODG calls its smart oxygen mask system \"SAVED,\" an acronym standing for \"'Smoke Assured Vision Enhanced Display,\" and announced its first partner on Wednesday: FedExExpress, the cargo airline owned by Fedex. The idea is that you can put advanced smart optics inside an oxygen mask. And then, if the cockpit were ever to fill up with smoke in an emergency situation, the pilot would be able to see the feed from cameras outside the plane and other critical cockpit displays inside their helmet. It's a safety feature.  One big difference with a product like this, versus its consumer counterparts, is that aviation is a highly regulated industry. ODG will work with FedEx to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration over the next year, and tweak the technology further so that pilots both like and appreciate the experience. FedExExpress needs the mask to work with big jets, like the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 747.The announcement underscores a sea change in the young augmented reality industry. Companies like ODG have a lot of expertise in optics and displays, and are even able to integrate smartphone parts and their proprietary technology to make working smartglasses. But the smartglasses out there right now aren't poised to cross over to mainstream consumers at the moment, so smaller companies, like ODG have refocused on taking their technology and selling it to other businesses, where style or weight are less of a concern. \"It's an example that headworn [computers] are going to start to serve multiple industry apps, users, and verticals,\" Jameson said. But if ODG's optics can handle the stresses of a smoke-filled cockpit, they can probably handle whatever people might be doing on their smartglasses in five or ten years.Youtube Embed: //<url

It's enough to put anyone off ever answering the phone again.</p><p>Last week, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ordered the country's wireless providers to implement new technology that will help fight such calls. The problem for users is that carriers have until September, 2020, to do so. Until then, the tsunami - and the frustration - is likely to continue.</p><p>Spam calls are a global problem. Overall volume increased 18 per cent globally in 2019, to 26 billion between January and October, according to a report by Truecaller, a Stockholm-based caller ID app developer.</p><p>Canadians receive an average of 12.2 spam calls a month, or 11th most in the world, Truecaller said. Users can at least take some comfort in the fact that they don't live in Brazil, which leads with an average of 45.6 monthly calls. Americans also fare worse, ranking eighth with an average 18.2 per month.</p><p>The onslaught is the unfortunate byproduct of technology that makes it easy to place such calls, a lack of competitiveness among carriers and an unwillingness by regulators - so far - to force solutions. The combination has created a fertile environment for scammers that will now take a concerted effort by all stakeholders to stamp out.</p><p>Spammers are taking advantage of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) technology that allows for numbers to be spoofed and appear legitimate. Aside from the annoyance, a growing number of Canadians are being defrauded in this manner. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre reports that 4,695 people have lost more than $16.7-million to phone scams since 2014.</p><p>One near-term measure that may help is universal call blocking, which the CRTC told phone service providers last year to put in place by this Dec. 19.</p><p>The system will block malformed numbers, such as the likes of 000-000-0000 and those with more than 15 digits. It's unlikely to help with numbers that appear legitimate, however.</p><p>The additional measure due by September is STIR/SHAKEN, or Secure Telephone Identity Revisited/Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information Using ToKENs.</p><p>The technology will put a digital fingerprint on every legitimate wireless phone number. Carriers will then approve calls from such numbers and patch them through in near-instant time, while those without fingerprints will be flagged as likely spam.</p><p>It's a worthwhile effort that should provide users with some respite, but the robocall battle is an unending arms race and spammers will inevitably try to circumvent each new countermeasure.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission had asked wireless carriers to adopt STIR/SHAKEN by the end of this year. But voluntary progress has been slow, prompting even FCC chairman Ajit Pai - considered a friend to industry - to recently levy the threat of forced regulation.</p><p>Carriers in both the U.S. and Canada tout their respective markets as competitive, but significant anti-spam technologies such as STIR/SHAKEN would already be in place if they truly were. Service providers would rush to advertise them as advantages over competitors, but instead they're allowing consumer and regulatory anger to build.</p><p>In Canada, some carriers are taking some steps, to their credit. Bell Canada says it is testing technology it has developed, while Telus offers home phone customers a Call Control feature that effectively whitelists - labels as trustworthy - accepted numbers.</p><p>But clearly, not enough is being done. All Canadian wireless carriers should implement STIR/SHAKEN voluntarily, as soon as possible, rather than wait for the CRTC's September deadline.</p><p>Part of the solution, if not potentially most of it, may in fact be delivered by the truly competitive component of the phone market - the handset makers themselves. The inaction is quickly becoming an opportunity for Google, Apple, Samsung and others.</p><p>Google has emerged as an anti-spam leader with the Call Screen function on its Pixel phones. The feature identifies calls from unknown numbers and then allows users to intercept them with an artificially intelligent assistant - it's like fighting robocalls with robocalls.</p><p>The company last week announced an upgrade that will see Call Screen automatically block suspected spam calls without involving the user at all. It's a major differentiating feature that Google's competitors are surely working to match, if not surpass.</p><p>Will it be the large technology companies rather than regulators and carriers who answer the call to defeat phone spam? They very well may be. Whether that's a desirable outcome or not at a time when distrust of Big Tech is growing is another question worth pondering.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-crtc-is-cracking-down-on-spam-calls-but-canadas-wireless/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-crtc-is-cracking-down-on-spam-calls-but-canadas-wireless/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20191217composer_OZXI5M4IRZDJLC4SXPAJOAIH74</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSB-X5F1-JCS0-V3YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><timeReceived>3:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

It has become one of the most comprehensive, exhaustive, and cynical advertising campaigns in modern British history, imposed on a captive audience confined to their homes, under surveillance. The British population have been bludgeoned, bullied and recruited into compliance by images and slogans in a multi-million pound advertising campaign, paid for by the British taxpayer and actioned to cover up the catastrophic unpreparedness and indecision of government. It is the same parliamentary and media management of the electorate that delayed Brexit for 3.5 years. </p><p>It saw the rise of 'woke' diversity politics to fill the void, whilst infrastructure, immigration, fishing and manufacturing industry, regional investment in jobs, things that truly effect the lives of ordinary people, were sidelined by white noise and globalist corporate ideology. It is a centralised governmental attempt to re-frame the narrative, to exert control over a population by obscuring the real issues by any means. History repeats itself. Parliament and the mainstream media are once again hiding in plain sight.. The government is not listening to the people and the people have to search through alternative media to find the facts. With the rise of populism and the cry for the return to the sovereign nation state, the British people thought that through the ballot box they had won. They were wrong. This technocratic elitist government are far more embedded, they truly are deep state. They will readily kill a country's spirit and sacrifice lives. The science they called upon to protect the people has proved to be a failure, the UK has the highest death rate in Europe. This government will keep its people under lock and key for as long as it takes to break them. Britain is a country whose economic policy has lived in the pockets of China for many years. Now, a toxic combination of an ideologically driven globalist mainstream media, science and 'big government', lives at the heart of Westminster. People Management has replaced manifesto, ethics has been exchanged for ideology and dogma. This parliament are presiding over the managed decline of a nation, it ushers in an age where freedom of speech and free choice will be exchanged for big tech, de-platforming, dogma and tyranny. THE RISE OF A CULT Mullenlowe Group is a global integrated marketing communications network, headquartered in London, IPG New York its parent company. Mullenlowe are the government's preferred ad agency creators of the NHS campaign whose slogans include,'Stay home, save the NHS'. A multi-billion dollar media machine. Last year IPG's net revenue increased 7.4% to $8.63 billion, they have over 90 branches, including their London headquarters. Mullenlowe China were named Agency of the Year 2018 by IAI International Awards. 'We are the NHS'. 'Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.'- MullenLowe: 'We use creativity to get our clients' brands an unfair share of attention.' 'You need a short, informative message to get the public's attention, certainly to resonate with younger audiences today,'. 'Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives' is like a wartime version.' -Jeremy Hine, chief executive of MullenLowe Group UK. Other recent campaigns are voiced in short, simple language, tailored to the younger generation used to multiple platform soundbites. Recent MullenLowe slogans include: 'Healing Hero's'- Bayer Medical,'Home is Good'- Persil / OMO, ironically, an extension of the Persil campaign,'Dirt is Good'. Re-branding the NHS is rather like changing deckchairs on the Titanic, you can change as many times as you like, but it's still going down. On 26th March new 'Heath Protection Regulations' were signed and lockdown began. It was also the beginning of a propaganda exercise to ensure compliance of the public to a dystopian authoritarian norm. Mainstream media became enablers-in-chief of this government's myopic, misjudged deceit. In return, the government have allowed the press to push their ideologically driven woke politics. A globalist agenda of open borders and corporate governance by elites, beaten into the electorate even at the cost of British lives. It was a trade-off, and the government took the deal. It is mutually exclusive, it provides money generated by advertising space and click-bait around coronavirus news to be fed back to corporates and the media giants, while promoting government policy. With Covid-19, advertising revenue plummeted and media groups were happy to have that revenue stream picked up by the government. The government are their best clients, in good times and in bad. A new 35 million ad campaign was launched on the 17th April,'Stay at home for the NHS, your family, your neighbours, your nation the world and life itself.', it is due to run for 3 months,'All in, all together'. Many people will have lost their homes and businesses before this campaign has run its course. The biggest loser will be the middle class, whose businesses will be picked off in M&amp;#38;A's and buyouts by corporates. In the meantime, elective surgeries have been cancelled, people that have been waiting for months, sometimes years for operations, such as hip replacements and cataract removal, were told to stay at home, and most have no idea when those operations will be rescheduled. Mullenlowe have done an excellent job promoting the NHS, whilst Parliament have crippled a nation. ELEVATION BEYOND CRITICAL THINKING To stop overload on A&amp;#38;E and ICUs with virus cases, Mullenlowe were given the task of modifying public behaviour and sentiment to alleviate unnecessary strain on an already overstretched NHS. The government chose to 'Protect the NHS' not the public. It has been an exercise in crowd control. Early in March, banks, financial trading firms and Whitehall government employees were asked to take their PCs home with them. The VPN (Virtual Private Network) was to be tested to see if it could cope. Many went into self-imposed lockdown asking staff to work from home. Weeks before the government announced its herd immunity strategy, investment brokers, big banks, international stock traders had already closed their central London offices. Large sections of the City were emptying. The rest of the population were in a two week 'no mans land' of probable infection. There was a two-tier system of information, big business and corporate elites were protected, while the rest of population were not. This two-tier system is still in operation. The government does not trust the public. By the second week of March, people in London began to stock-pile food. Warnings were coming in from Italy, it was clear to the public they were totally unprotected and unprepared. The government had given no guidance at all, and when it did come, it was in the form of 'herd immunity'. There was confusion. NERVTAG meeting (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) made up of scientific advisors to the British government 13th Jan 2020: 'WHO's update on 12 January reported symptom onset of the 41 confirmed Wuhan Novel Coronavirus cases ranges from 8 December 2019 to 2 January 2020. No additional cases have been detected since 3 January 2020' 'Current reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers. Cases of pneumonia possibly linked to Wuhan City have been assessed in Hong Kong and some of the surrounding countries. WHO have stated that according to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people.' China, using the WHO (World Health Organisation), peddled false information. Neighbouring countries were already dealing with the virus and person to person transmission. Scientists noted: 'There are already some sequence discrepancies between various Chinese groups releasing virus sequence information.' At the same meeting, a report from Taiwan about a woman who had flown into Taiwan from Wuhan: 'Symptom onset was on the 5th January 2020, she developed fever with a chill, sore throat and headache. She then went to the local health facility and received some medication. On the 8th January, she took a direct flight from Wuhan to Thailand together with her 5 family members in a tour group of 16 tourists. She was transferred to Bamrasnaradura, Infectious Disease Institute for isolation. ' 'Reports suggest airport entry screening has been introduced by Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Singapore. There is a direct flight from Wuhan to the UK three times a week.' By 13th January, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore were screening incoming flights from China, by February they were already successfully dealing with the virus; they had no need for lockdown neither did they advocate herd immunity. The CCP were involved in a concerted effort to spread disinformation using the WHO. Leaked footage from Wuhan early in January, showed people being dragged to quarantine centres or locked in their apartments by operatives in Hazmat suits and breathing equipment, whilst the authorities were struggling to remove these images from the internet. The wet markets and the Wuhan Institute of Virology were 'bleached' of evidence. Key scientific personnel, researchers and doctors were 'disappeared' or silenced. Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, who leaked information on Covid-19 person to person contagion, was arrested by the Chinese authorities and forced to sign documentation that his claims were false. He was eventually released, but died of Coronavirus in January. The CCP now describe him as 'a Martyr'. 'I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society, and I don't approve of using public power for excessive interference,' - Doctor Li - born 1986 - died January 2020 In the two weeks from January 9th, at least 2000 people arrived on direct flights from Wuhan City into London with no checks on arrival. Chris Whitty, scientific advisor to the British government, was asked why incoming flights were not screened or flights halted: 'Every country does this slightly differently, that's always been the case. The screening would not really provide any appreciable increase in benefit for the UK public.' In China, 56 million people in Hubei province were already in quarantine, yet China's external borders were open for international flights out of Wuhan. The government failed to act to protect the public. They appear myopic when dealing with the CCP, viewing them as a benign, rather than a malignant partner. The government chose to ignore the CCP's human rights abuses, including concentration camps, racial and religious discrimination, organ harvesting from prisoners. It has instead, turned the UK into a conduit through which the CCP can conduct its business and firm up their grip on the worldwide tech market, and, from an important strategic position within the West. In mid-February Boris Johnson spoke to Xi Jinping, they were; 'resolved to work together across a range of issues including strengthening the economic partnership, to benefit the people of both China and the UK.' One month later Prime Minister Johnson along with half of his cabinet were ill with Covid-19. LOGOS, BANNERS &amp;#38; SLOGANS 'Save the NHS', adverts, bill boards, an internet blitz. It was no longer lockdown to save lives, it was lockdown to save the NHS. A mass recruitment scheme for which 750,000 members of the public signed up to volunteer to help in the first week. Between 13th January and 17th March, when the government and their scientific advisors had two months to prepare for coronavirus, a different scenario was being played out, one of deception and deceit. The public were being kept in the dark. At a hearing of the Commons Health Select Committee, March 17th, when questioned by Jeremy Hunt, (former Health Secretary to the government), Sir Patrick Vallance (Government Chief Scientific Adviser) was asked why there was not more comprehensive testing: Vallance: 'We simply don't have mass testing available. What can I tell you.' Hunt: 'Looking at other countries, the one that people think has had the most success is South Korea, they are testing 10 times more people a day.' Vallance: 'I think we need a big increase in testing, and that's what I am pushing it for very hard'. In the second half of the Commons Health Select Committee, Jeremy Hunt quoted from a message he had received from a doctor on the front line treating coronavirus patients in a major UK hospital: 'One week ago I was wearing full personal protective equipment, now we've been told not to bother with any of that, contradicting WHO guidance. I am terrified, I can't bear the thought of infecting other patients with a disease that could kill them.' Vallance: 'That's a question that needs to go to the NHS as they organise a response to this. It is important that we get the proportionality right in terms of where protective equipment is needed and where it is not, because one of the things that is a risk, is if we go to the wrong place on protective equipment it hampers all those or other parts of healthcare delivery. That is not a question I am in a position to answer, that is one that the NHS need to.' Hospital staff were sent to work without PPE under the most extreme conditions. They were asked to treat patients not knowing if they themselves had the infection, or whether they would catch it and potentially pass it on to their patients. South Korea not only had the disease under control, they had implemented track and trace and were successfully treating symptoms. In addition, their infection rates were falling, despite no lockdown having been imposed. Their Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare, Kim Gang-lip, said of lockdown methods of virus control: 'Such an approach is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible.' British scientists appeared unwilling to talk about the success of South Korea and Taiwan or follow their example. Perhaps this was the diplomatic line from the British government who did not want to appear to endorse regimes not approved of by the PRC There was a reluctance to take advice or look at the models from non-Western democratic nations who had successfully dealt with the most important initial stages of infection. The UK seemed more worried about souring its relationship with China, one of its major business partners, rather than saving the lives of its electorate. Britain has become the conduit through which all things Chinese travel. The British government had no choice other than to tailor their policy to their lack of PPE, firstly choosing herd immunity to buy time, then imposing lockdown because they were struggling to get PPE for hospitals and care staff. The government decided the best country from which to acquire these supplies was China. In August 2019, CGNPG (China General Nuclear Power Group) a Chinese state owned company and 3 of its subsidiaries, were placed on 'The Entity List', a blacklist of companies the US has prohibited business with, citing that they may be'engaged in or enabled efforts to acquire advanced U.S. nuclear technology and material for diversion to military uses in China.'and further,'Acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.' No such caution has been adopted by the British government. The CGNPG has a 33% stake in the Hinkley Point C Nuclear Plant development, the 635 acre site in Somerset (UK) has continued construction throughout lockdown. Hinkley gives Beijing access to the UK's power system and will supply 7% of the UK's electricity, and costs are now estimated to overrun to 22.5 billion. In Suffolk, amid huge local opposition, a planning application for 'Sizewell C' a replica plant, is about to be sent in by the same partnership of French firm EDF and CGNPG. The West are in an economic and propaganda war with the CCP, the British government is China's useful idiot. On 17th March in the same Commons Health Select Committee, Jeremy Hunt questioned NHS chiefs, including Sir Simon Stevens (Chief Executive, NHS England and NHS Improvement). Hunt had received two messages from doctors, the first, working in a London hospital A&amp;#38;E read: 'it's absolute carnage in A&amp;#38;E utter chaos, we don't have any proper PPE, we've been given paper masks, not the gowns, not the FFP3 masks we need and not everyone even gets those. Literally, the doctors are seeing the sickest patients, the ones with suspected heart attacks, PE, sepsis, and all they have to protect themselves is a bit of paper across their mouth, I'm in shock, I feel like they're being thrown to the wolves here. Some of us are going to die.' Another doctor from Luton and Dunstable: 'I'm treating patients who are perhaps presenting for a broken ankle and then suddenly start coughing all over you, you're breathing in an aerosol spray of droplets and not even wearing a mask, just scrubs and a plastic apron.' Jeremy Hunt: 'Sir Simon, should the NHS have a policy that all staff should be wearing PPE equipment in hospitals where there is a reasonable chance they are going to come in contact with a Covid -19 patient?' Simon Stevens:'We are guided by the specialists of Public Health England. We have 28 million face masks in production.' Policy was that only NHS staff members that were 'symptomatic' would be tested. There were neither the supplies nor the logistical skills to distribute the PPE available. Matt Hancock, the current Health Secretary was not present at this meeting. The NHS had only 3,700 critical care beds and were at 90% capacity. It was the government's intention to test, but they did not have the capacity. They had an intention to supply PPE, but no capability. Vallance was waiting for an antibody test to be developed, magically they became available from China, 20 million was spent on ordering these tests from the first Chinese firm that had the capacity to licence, produce and export. Unfortunately on arrival in the UK, those tests proved not to be viable. The UK are still chasing their money, along with refunds for 250 ventilators that arrived from China described as 'dangerous' because of having problems with oxygen flows, and other PPE bought from China was also found to be faulty. Covid-19 fatalities - South Korea vs United Kingdom. South Korea - Population 50million Deaths so far: 256 United Kingdom - Population 67million Deaths so far: 32,000 RITUAL Whilst many NHS staff where feeling desperate and abandoned without PPE protection, the government requested there be a show of solidarity and appreciation. Citizens were requested to stand on their doorsteps to'Clap for NHS'. There was general compliance.'Engine'an ad agency, designed an emoji for it. Once a week, the sound echos round empty streets, a demonstration of the public acknowledging their own existence, the cheering and bashing of pans goes on for just a little too long until it becomes something like desperation. In a mental awareness initiative by ITV media, NHS staff were encouraged to clap the public. Stalin, Mao, Xi Jinping, now the British government. It is a natural progression. In 2017 the Chinese developed an app called,'Clap for Xi Jinping'. 'It is really revolutionary in the sense that it induces people to participate in an act of adulation. The individual becomes a part of propaganda - and even, potentially, enjoys the experience,' - David Bandurski, co-director University of Hong Kong, China Media Project. Engineer Yang Kaiwen on the clap app: 'it looks like a kind of entertainment propaganda. It's just a tool of the cult of Xi.' The army were called in to help with NHS logistical management of PPE, it described what they found as'appalling', 'We know how knackered their systems are, but we've been surprised we've not been called in to help more, and we've been surprised by their failure to ration.' The NHS was founded in 1948 by the then Labour Government Health Minister Aneurin Bevan. It is firmly embedded in that party's consciousness as their creation. In 1997 New Labour won a landslide victory in the general election. One of their campaign slogans was'Save the NHS'. Two years later this became'competition and choice'as Tony Blair implemented a pro-business agenda, introducing competition through private industry. Large corporations and big pharma began providing services. 'The NHS is being softened up for privatisation which, all along, was the real purpose of the NHS act 2012. Last year seven out of ten NHS contracts have gone to the private sector.' -Kailash Chand - Vice President of the BMA (British Medical Association) This year government spending on the NHS is coming in at 134 billion. The NHS has been under strain for decades. Since 1948, the population has increased by 25%, from 47 million to now near 67 million. Of all jobs in the public sector the NHS employs over 30% of them. The campaign has turned NHS staff into demigods, gladiators being sent into the Coliseum, an arena of death and sacrifice. Posters, press, even NHS staff themselves have been used to promote and propagandise. There is managed 'pandemic-speak', mistakes have become 'mis-steps', lies have become 'mis-information'. Boris Johnson's 'story' was cleverly coupled with that of the NHS. It is difficult to criticise someone who is recovering from a life-threatening virus, even if they did seem to bring it on themselves by shaking hands with patients. That's the spirit Boris. It would be interesting to learn what medicines were used to treat the PM and if they are readily available for other patients on the NHS. On leaving hospital the Prime Minister declared,'The NHS saved my life'. Most years the NHS is unable to cope with the average flu epidemic and is often described as overstretched and underfunded. In 2016 the government carried out a stress test to see if the NHS could deal with a pandemic. It concluded that if an outbreak were to occur, the health service would have a shortage of PPE and critical care beds. These findings proved to be correct. In a speech in the House of Commons in January, Matt Hancock Health Secretary announced: 'The Chief Medical Officer continues to advise that the risk to the UK population is 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them.' The government considered themselves equipped for a flu epidemic, they were however ill-equipped for a pandemic. In the UK the statistics are bleak, once you are on a ventilator with Covid -19, the chances of not making it out of the ICU are around 80%, higher than in most other countries. Doctors and scientists in South Korea practice early intervention to alleviate symptoms. From one of the most highly regarded peer to peer journals in the US - 'The New England Journal of Medicine'; 'Social distancing, isolation, and reluctance to present to the hospital may contribute to poor outcomes.' Scientists are always getting their fingers burned, it's a hazard of the profession, so don't be surprised if politicians throw them under a bus after this is all over. PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR THOSE FALLING INTO LINE The press has been relatively muted and cautious in criticism of the government, as have the opposition Labour Party. Mainstream woke media did not want the government to close borders, this goes against their pro-immigration, globalist corporate agenda. There is no longer talk of removing the BBC licence fee charged to the public, the government need the press, the press need the government's advertising revenue. Since lockdown, the only recourse to the public to regain human rights is through the courts. This becomes difficult when you can be arrested for being outside. The court system is expensive and time consuming and only available to the few who can afford it or can raise capital through crowd-funding. Challenges are already being attempted against the government lockdown. CRITICISM IS NOT ALLOWED The nation has been sent to the naughty corner. Worse, it has been asked to inform on friends and neighbours in order to'Save the NHS'. The public are not allowed to sit down in a park anymore, the police move them on. Even the Stasi would be embarrassed by these tactics. This cuts down on crime statistics so it's a win win for the government. Luckily, for the most part, the great British public ignore the instruction to 'inform', it defies logic that it could possibly be dangerous to take a walk, alone. The government has a primary weapon. Fear. Fear and enforcement. It has even threatened a 'second wave' of fear, if the first were not enough. This ensures the population stay in their homes as much as possible, and more importantly, stay off the streets; the public can't demonstrate or ask questions, and thousands have been fined because they have. There are multiple clips on social media of over-zealous policing. A demonstration at Whitehall, London, was quickly dispersed with the help of the 'Emergency Powers Act' which has a two-year timeline. BLIND OBEDIENCE Divide and rule. The nation is divided into those who can work and those who can't. Those who can't are divided into those who are getting money for not doing much, and those who are getting no money at all, and either going bankrupt, or asking friends for loans. The government has over-hyped a brand and manipulated the public so it can walk through its flawed policies. Covid-19 is political, it is weaponised. This is a highly charged environment and Covid-19 will be spun to obscure and to obfuscate what governments cannot control or deal with when their policy fails. Politicians have used the NHS as leverage. The longer this lockdown continues the more politicised this virus will become, and the more power the government will take from the population through over-regulation. They have turned the NHS, a sacred cow, into an icon. In reality, this ship was launched with a hole in it, and has been sinking ever since, intermittently patched up and set adrift, this time bailed out by government spin doctors and an ad agency. Cult NHS will allow the government to keep the lockdown in place as long as it wants, or reimpose it without too much public unrest. It has encouraged power without responsibility, the public were blindsided by a government who turned the virus into a weapon against its own population. The British public have been played, and the CCP have played the British government. Neither the government, Mullenlowe Group, nor mainstream media represent the peoples' voice however much they try to convince the public that they do. The people have been silenced. It is how the CCP silences their population, through propaganda, enforcement and ultimately imprisoning their citizens. The damage done by lockdown will far exceed any done by the virus itself, because it has shown just how easily democracy can be turned on its head. This is not about health, it is about power. You begin to understand why American citizens don't want to lose their 2nd Amendment rights.Liked it?

Innovate Finance helped to select a delegation of leading fintech firms,which were ideally placed to expand into US markets, to connect with American investors and large banking organisations, and to foster an introduction to an ecosystem of influencers, within the US.This was also an important opportunity for Innovate Finance to connect with a similar ecosystem of key stakeholders, within the global fintech marketplace.</p><p>Branching out There are many reasons why the global fintech movement has emerged from the UK - our geographical location provides unrivalled international connectivity; our leading academic talent pool is world-class; we have prime investors and impressive business facilities; we promote global thoughtleadership on emerging digital solutions; and we can provide a simple regulatory system that balances risk and innovation.But our job is not done.Fintech firms both big and small, face major innovation and growth challenges.We need to increase our exposure to great fintech opportunities and encourage smart, active investors to enter the fintech sector within the UK. It's imperative that we continue to foster leadership skills and talent,and we need to ensure that those skills are retained. We need to continue examining the conditions necessary to create greater competition,to open up the fintech sector to new players, and ensure our SMEs have good access to the capital needed to grow their business. It is vital that we continue to develop and connect the fintech sector in the UK, including accelerators, investors, academic institutions, code clubs, policy makers, big tech and beautiful design.The power of international corporations, need to be exploited.</p><p>Global investment Last year alone over \u00a3500 million was poured into fintech firms by way of investment. So being open to foreign influencers is essential.Indeed, American investors drove signifi-cant growth in the UK fintech sector - recent heroic funding rounds include TransferWise (\u00a358million); Nutmeg (\u00a332million); Funding Circle (\u00a340 million).More recently however, Digital Shadows our local success, grew from two people on Level39,to over 30,and is now launching in the US via Passion Capital after having raised \u00a35.2million in their latest funding round.</p><p>This raises an interesting question about the US v UK financial services sector. The recent 'Bootstrap to IPO' event, hosted by Innovate Finance, explored the different sources of financing, from angel investors, to venture capitalists and alternative investment. It also highlighted the cultural difference - the attitude towards risk and the confidence to dominate in a global marketplace.It was said that that there is no lack of entrepreneurial talent or technological innovation when we compare the two marketplaces.But the industry -- entrepreneurs, investors and consumers alike -- has some way to go.We need to champion the huge social and economic impact of the sector. We need to get behind these new high growth fintech companies, who are bringing greater choice, diversity and resilience to the financial services sector.This isn't just the responsibility of the entrepreneur,or the investor.This is the responsibility of all us, as consumers, to ask for and make sure this change happens.</p><p>These are some of the concerns we hope to address at our Global Summit on March 9th at the Guildhall. This historic gathering will explore the impact of fintech on society and the economy,and together with over 700 delegates we will discuss how we can overcome challenges to make UK fintech bigger and better - and, crucially, help build a global sustainable banking sector that means something for everyone.</p><p>\"Last year alone over \u00a3500 million was poured into fintech firms by way of investment\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-96333142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FC5-SGP1-JBVM-Y1HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 City A.M.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s the promise of a digital revolution felt like the start of a potential golden age, says Tim Wu in this admirably concise and punchy account of \"how corporate giants came to rule the world\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Useful start-ups appeared from nowhere. New services and online portals selling everything sprouted. The possibilities opened up by this new technology seemed boundless. Tiny blogs even outstripped established media outfits. \"Everything,\" says Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, \"was fast and chaotic, no position was lasting.\"</p><p>It seemed that the rules of business were being rewritten for the better. We didn't need to worry about how these new tech companies behaved. Concerns about monopoly or excessive corporate power seemed old-fashioned, says Wu, because we were assured that the internet would always enable new challengers to break through and take out the lazy or the excessively large, all to the benefit of consumers. The internet was a perpetual motion machine of competition and creative destruction.</p><p>For a while this worked, as the experience of AOL - America Online, for younger readers - seemed to prove. It looked set to be one of the defining presences in cyberspace, yet within a few years it was a joke, mocked in business books and smashed to bits by newer, hungrier, more innovative rivals such as Google.</p><p>The revolution then went awry, as revolutions often do. Now we have monstrously large tech conglomerates under the command of a small, self-satisfied new elite based in Silicon Valley. Google has more than 80 per cent of the market share for internet search. In the US, Amazon accounted for an estimated 37 per cent of all e-commerce last year. The lockdown, and the reliance of consumers on Amazon, has only strengthened its dominant position. When companies such as Facebook felt threatened by new competitors such as Instagram or Snapchat, they behaved like old-fashioned monopolists, gobbling up rivals or cloning their services.</p><p>Big tech and other large industrial concentrations get away with it, says Wu, because politicians and regulators lost sight of a vital lesson of the last century, that monopolies need to be broken up. In the late-19th century and early-20th century - the American progressive era - lawyers, politicians and officials combined to \"trust bust\" overly large and anti-competitive oil, steel and railroad companies under the banner of consumer choice.</p><p>Wu's hero from that period is Louis Brandeis, a lawyer and wealthy social-justice warrior who disliked consumerism. Brandeis took on monopolists such as the original JP Morgan. He did not see the dangers in narrow economic terms; it was also a question of character, he believed. \"Brandeis came to fear that, as the corporations became large and powerful, they took on a life of their own and were increasingly insensitive to humanity's wants and fears,\" Wu says.</p><p>As Wu sees it, the apotheosis of this anti-monopoly movement was in the 1950s and 1960s, when robust competition law was deployed in Europe and America. This sprang in part from the academic theorising of the ordoliberals in 1930s Germany, who had warned that monopoly industrial corporations working at the behest of a totalitarian state would help create the conditions for war.</p><p>The anti-monopoly movement is derailed, Wu says, from the 1980s when \"neoliberalism\" took over and the anti-monopoly agenda was banished under successive US presidents keen to stick close to globalised big business. I am sympathetic to much of the argument laid out in </p><p>                   The Curse of Bigness                   </p><p> - as a journalist whose industry is being \"creatively disrupted\", and as a free marketeer who believes in fair competition. Monopolies and cartels are, as Adam Smith explained, conspiracies against the consumer and the citizen.</p><p>Britain's gruelling experience in the banking crisis of 2008 demonstrated the risks. When these vast, bloated financial institutions, led by hubristic executives, that had been too cosy with government in the boom years blew up, they almost brought down the rest of the economy. However, Wu puts too much reliance on the lazy term \"neoliberal\"; a simplistic \"woke\" codeword for supposedly self-interested advocates of free-market economics. This is unfair. Many vocal critics of corporate monopoly and power are free marketeers and capitalist libertarians.</p><p>Several of the examples used to highlight the iniquities of capitalist concentration are questionable too. Wu is troubled by the excessive dominance of Luxottica, a luxury eyewear company in Italy that owns many high street brands and stores globally, who are blamed for the high price of shades. Worldwide it seems to have a mighty market share of more than 30 per cent. Does that really equate to \"ruling the world\"?</p><p>Wu also critiques the beer industry. Fair enough, there are several international mega-brewers dominant at the bland, high-volume end of the market, but in Britain there has never been a bigger variety of beers available with all manner of independents popping up in recent years. My two favourite Spanish lagers are produced by proud, independent family firms in Spain and imported by British brewers.</p><p>The author concludes with a crisp mini-manifesto, centred on justified calls to break up Facebook and use market investigations to challenge concentrations of power across the rest of the economy. In the future we will need to enforce tougher rules on mergers and breaking up big tech is the way, longer term, to ensure healthy competition. But that leads on to the other big problem here: </p><p>                   The Curse of Bigness                    </p><p>was written before the damned virus.</p><p>In Britain, we are slowly emerging from a Covid crisis in which government has wielded the most extraordinary power over us - confining the population and shutting down the economy. After that experience, any claim that the source of our problems is a weak state, in need of yet more power to check and harry bombed-out business, is not going to sound credible.</p><p>                   The Curse of Bigness: How Corporate Giants Came to Rule the World                   The Curse of Bigness: How Corporate Giants Came to Rule the World                   </p><p>                   by Tim Wu, Atlantic, 183pp;

Criminal organisations are not only incorporating emerging technologies in their activities, but are increasingly pioneering and seizing opportunities for new illegal enterprises made possible by the Internet and the continuing growth of electronic commerce.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Arguably, many of these innovations represent the cutting edge of global criminal activity. They provide higher prospects for illicit profits at seemingly lower degrees of risk. Security analysts can have difficulty in identifying the locations from where the cybercriminals may be operating (see Table1 below) and find it difficult to identify the perpetrators. Cybercrime thus represents the growing sophistication of existing criminal behaviour and the emergence of novel illegal cyber activities. It presents unique and difficult challenges for law enforcement officers charged with countering such activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite being an innovation-driven phenomenon, most analysis of cybercrime has been undertaken from the perspectives of criminology, information and communications technology (ICT) security firms and journalists, rather than innovation scholars. The aim of this paper is to examine the evolution of cybercrime through the lens of innovation studies in order to develop a framework which aims to contribute to a new perspective on how cybercriminals innovate, organise and operate, and how law enforcement agencies must change to combat this growing trend.</p><p>The lack of systematic innovation-based analysis of cybercrime has left gaps in the understanding of how cybercrime has evolved into a large global 'business' within and connected to the Internet. To contribute to filling these gaps, this paper analyses the evolution of cybercrime through the borrowed concept of a \"digital business ecosystem\" [16, p. 3].<footnote><anchor id=\"_000005\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>The conceptual framework in this article was developed and validated in a pilot study funded by the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA). This article draws upon and updates Rush, H; Smith, C; Tang, P. and Kraemer-Mbula, E. \"Crime online: Cybercrime and illegal innovation\", NESTA, 2009. As argued below, this particular framework promises valuable and comprehensive innovation insights because it combines elements of innovation study, value chain analysis, capability theory and business model examination.</p></bodyText></footnote> We suggest that by deepening our understanding of the cybercrime ecosystem it may be possible for the relevant authorities to more rapidly identify trends and forecast new developments. In so doing they should be able to more effectively concentrate their limited resources in dealing with cybercrime.</p><p>James Moore [39], in his McKinsey award-winning article, introduced this concept which has become widely used by social scientists and students of business and organisational management and design. Moore defined a business ecosystem as: \"a loose network of suppliers, distributors and outsourced firms that work cooperatively and competitively to support new products, satisfy consumer needs and incorporate innovation\".<footnote><anchor id=\"_000010\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>Quoted in [16].</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>According to his view, firms do not belong to a single industry, but their activities cut across multiple industries. Refining his concept further [40: 26], he added that an ecosystem is: \"an economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organisations and individuals-the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders\".</p><p>Other scholars have further elaborated on this concept by emphasising that entities of a business ecosystem have different interests but are interconnected through cooperation and competition, for their mutual survival and effectiveness [62]. Analogous to natural ecosystems, business ecosystems are characterised by \"interconnectedness\" and \"shared fate\" among diverse organisations, \"that contributes to their collective productivity and robustness\" [45: 104].<footnote><anchor id=\"_000015\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>It is worth noting that these authors, particularly Iansiti and Levien [62], with whom the term ecosystem is also much associated in the strategy literature, adopt the ecosystem concept to provide a perspective on business strategy and business networks.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>Drawing on this concept, we argue that there is merit to analysing the cybercrime network in terms of a digital business ecosystem, which depends on information and communication technologies, responds to its environment, is interdependent on various entities and continually innovates in order to be effective and survive. We label this ecosystem as the \"cybercrime ecosystem\".</p><p>Furthermore, the business ecosystem provides a perspective that can be used to analyse interconnected businesses, that is \"by looking at the relationships or interactions among the members and their environment and at the roles and interests of the members of the system\" [8,11,18].<footnote><anchor id=\"_000020\"/><label>4</label><bodyText><p>We acknowledge that there is a plethora of literature on business networks, which among other things, study the 'connectedness' of business networks and the diffusion of innovation. However we differ from these studies by focusing on the ecosystem's evolving and dynamic characteristic through 'internal innovation'.</p></bodyText></footnote> As will be discussed, financial cybercrime is an \"interconnected\" business, with different roles and interests of the constituents of this network. In addition to a variety of criminal participants, the cybercrime ecosystem includes legitimate businesses, such as IT security firms, banking and financial services. For instance, IT security firms interact with organisations in the financial services when they have to develop new measures to identify new attacks and to deal with the vulnerabilities found in network infrastructures. Cybercriminals, in turn, have to further hone their skills and develop ever more sophisticated malicious tools to infect the digital networks and to circumvent security measures. In a sense, these two communities, perversely, have a shared fate, as if participating in a game of innovation leapfrogging as one set of actors in the ecosystem attempts to counter the advances and responses of another set of actors.</p><p>Drawing from existing literature and the results from an exploratory study involving academics, IT security firms, law enforcement officers, financial institutions and policymakers [46], this paper first defines the types of cybercrime before examining the conceptual foundations of the cybercrime ecosystem and its three core elements. They are (1) the international value chains (networks) which link activities and actors; (2) the changing capabilities that underlie the ecosystem; and (3) the business models that arise from the changing capabilities and concomitant innovations and strategies.</p><h>2 What is cybercrime?</h><p>Cybercrime covers a wide range of activities relating to the use of information technology for criminal purposes. The modernisation of 'traditional' crimes such as drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering and extortion through the frequent incorporation of computer and mobile technologies is well known [63,23,58].</p><p>Although illegality is inherent in the concept, cybercrime is not a legal term and its definition and coverage continuously evolve with advances in communication technologies (from computer crime to electronic and virtual crime). Cybercrime, in essence describes all kinds of crime using telecommunications networks, in which computers or computer networks are a tool, a target, or a locale of criminal activity [2]. According to Wall [58: 221]: \"Cybercrimes are criminal or harmful activities that are informational, global and networked and are to be distinguished from crimes that simply use computers. They are the product of networked technologies that have transformed the division of criminal labour to provide entirely new opportunities and new forms of crime which typically involve the acquisition or manipulation of information and its value across global networks for gain. They can be broken down into crimes that are related to the integrity of the system, crimes in which networked computers are used to assist the perpetration of crime, and crimes which relate to the content of computers.\"</p><p>By this definition cybercrime takes many forms, depending on its final purpose and means, and classifications are as varied as the number of studies on the subject.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000025\"/><label>5</label><bodyText><p>Numerous definitions for cybercrime can be found in the literature. We have adopted the one provided by David [58] in his book on the subject because of its useful recognition of the informational, global and networked characteristics, which helps to locate the type of crimes with the technologies that facilitate them. Wall's definition is highly compatible with the innovation studies approach which we have adopted for this study.</p></bodyText></footnote> This paper focuses on financial cybercrime. Other types of cybercrime such as offences against the person (cyberstalking, harassment, blackmailing, bullying), computer misuse (denial of service<footnote><anchor id=\"_000030\"/><label>6</label><bodyText><p>There have been several well-published attacks on gaming websites, which effectively closed down the sites until a ransom has been paid.</p></bodyText></footnote> and software piracy), distribution of illicit material (child pornography and promotion of activities amongst paedophiles), Intellectual Property theft and industrial espionage are beyond the scope of this paper. Within financial cybercrimes, this study looks specifically at credit card fraud and identity theft.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000035\"/><label>7</label><bodyText><p>We use the term 'credit card fraud' to encompass all forms of fraud involving credit, debit and charge cards.</p></bodyText></footnote> These two often-interrelated cybercrimes share with legitimate businesses the ultimate goal of financial profit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Credit card fraud</emphasis> refers to the illicit use of stolen credit cards and credit card details (numbers and credit card 'dumps'<footnote><anchor id=\"_000040\"/><label>8</label><bodyText><p>Dump is a slang word for stolen credit card information and usually contains, among other things, name and address of cardholder, account number, expiration date and verification/CVV2 code.</p></bodyText></footnote>). This information can be obtained by several means such as card skimming - stealing the information off the magnetic stripe in automated teller machines (ATMs) or pin entry devices in commercial establishments; phishing schemes - acquiring the details by faking an email from a legitimate organisation (i.e. bank); or stealing information in personal computers or database systems using Trojans<footnote><anchor id=\"_000045\"/><label>9</label><bodyText><p>A Trojan is a programme that appears benign, but actually contains a harmful load (e.g. an attachments on virus-bearing messages).</p></bodyText></footnote> or hacking.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000050\"/><label>10</label><bodyText><p>Hacking commonly refers to obtaining unauthorised access to systems through skills, tactics and detailed knowledge.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>According to a recent report [61], credit card information was the most advertised category on underground economy servers, ranking the highest in terms of supplied and demanded information in 2009. The reasons for their high popularity are: (a) the frequencies of credit card transactions as consumers have almost completely switched from traditional types of payment such as cash and cheques to debit and credit cards; and (b) growing preference for online transactions - the growth in e-commerce and online banking increases the opportunity for online theft of credit card information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Identity theft</emphasis> is the misappropriation of somebody else's personal details, without their knowledge or consent. However, ID theft is not in itself an offence in the UK and penalties for those who make fraudulent applications (for example for passports) are very small [64]. Identity fraud occurs when the misappropriated and stolen identity is actually used in criminal activity, to obtain goods or services by deception, generally for financial gain.</p><p>ID theft generally combines online and offline methods. Online methods include stealing personal information stored in computer databases using Trojans or hacking; or through phishing,<footnote><anchor id=\"_000055\"/><label>11</label><bodyText><p>Phishing refers to the process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

In 2011 the UK Cabinet Office estimated that identity fraud had cost the UK economy \u00a31.7billion in the previous year. CIFAS showed that fraud as a whole is on the rise, for instance, in 2005 the number of fraud cases identified was 152,176. By the end of 2010 this figure had risen to 217,385, of which 47% were ID frauds.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000080\"/><label>16</label><bodyText><p>See .</p></bodyText></footnote></p><h>3 Global trends in financial cybercrime</h><p>Financial cybercrime has increased dramatically in recent years worldwide. Advanced economies remain on top of the list as both originators and recipients of cybercriminal attacks.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000085\"/><label>17</label><bodyText><p>According to Symantec [61] in 2008 computers from the United States were the leading source of Web-based attacks against users, accounting for 38% of the total worldwide.

The widespread availability of ICT skills, exacerbated by the downturn in the current global economy, provides potentially fertile ground for increased growth in financial cybercrimes.</p><p>The economics of security is also a significant contributing factor to the growth of financial cybercrime.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000095\"/><label>19</label><bodyText><p>For a comprehensive discussion on this issue, see [7].</p></bodyText></footnote> This is largely because companies rely on digital networks for their business operations, for instance, in e-banking and e-retailing. Indeed, a range of software-based mechanisms have been introduced and are regularly updated to prevent illegal behaviour in these transactions. For instance, the Digital Rights Management systems, which are aimed to prevent illegal downloading of movies and music; cryptographic methods for authentication of user and products; fraud-detection software, and an array of anti-virus software to secure computers and protect them against inherent vulnerabilities, are all common measures deployed to protect business operations and transactions.</p><p>Yet, as we will discuss, cybercriminals are in many cases, outflanking these mechanisms. Notably, the 'quality' of their countermeasures (tools) is improving rapidly. According to experts, the cybercriminal innovators \"invest in proper research, development, quality control and customer service\", which include the testing of their new tools against common antivirus products [7]. As a result, these antivirus products are initially unable to detect the new cybercriminal software applications. However, once detected, the cybercriminal innovators rapidly issue updates to their 'customers', prompting \"an escalating arms race of online attack and defense\" [7,21].</p><p>Another possible driver for the growth of financial cybercrime lies in the probability that cyber victims do not always bear the full cost of their system's failures. For instance, in banking, countries with lax banking regulations can pass such costs to their customers and retailers. This could disincentivize these banks from installing robust security systems. Furthermore, banks and financial systems might be inclined to under-report financial cybercrime perpetrated against them (as some of our interviewees have suggested) for fear of revealing their weaknesses and a consequent loss of confidence amongst their clients. Small businesses may be particularly vulnerable to cybercrime. This is mainly because these businesses may not have full knowledge of their IT system and how it functions. Such a lack of knowledge may result from resource constraints that impede the hiring of either qualified technical security personnel or continual refreshing of their security systems. According to a recent report, 40% of cyber crime against small businesses goes unreported [13].</p><p>It has also been suggested that IT security companies could be over-reporting the number of certain types of incidents in the hope of marketing products aimed at certain categories of vulnerabilities. Whatever may be the real situation, over- or under-reporting, financial cybercrime has direct economic implications in an increasingly networked business ecosystem, where devices and systems are acquiring more and more processors and communications.</p><p>Against these factors, and particularly the profuse use of the Internet, inter alia, cybercrime is increasingly globalising [36,61]. Published evidence<footnote><anchor id=\"_000100\"/><label>20</label><bodyText><p>These include multiple sources, such as reports published regularly by security firms (e.g. Symantec, Sophos, MacAfee, Kaspersky, etc.) and other independent international initiatives that offer regular updates, trends and general information on specific types of cybercrime techniques, such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group, focused on activities that direct people to fraudulent websites through phishing, pharming and spoofing; or the Spamhaus Group, which tracks and publishes information about Internet spammers as well as about spam gangs and services.</p></bodyText></footnote> and the interviews conducted for this research have emphasised that cybercrime is a global issue. The growth of the required skills to perpetrate cybercrimes and the spread of broadband infrastructures, coupled with uneven prosecution procedures and legislations, are driving the fast global redistribution of the geographical locations of cybercrime.</p><p>Most cybercrime attacks are currently directed at the US and the UK, since they account for a high proportion of the global financial traffic. Table1 shows that the origin of phishing activities is also concentrated in a few international locations, namely the US, Southern Asia and Eastern Europe. Other locations such as Brazil and India, although lagging behind, also appear to be entering the global cybercrime scene.</p><p>Each has developed technological capabilities according to their available skills, domestic context and local vulnerabilities. A snapshot of the key cybercriminal \"players\" is summarised as follows<footnote><anchor id=\"_000105\"/><label>21</label><bodyText><p>Compilation of features provided in various security reports (MacAfee, 2008 [37]; Sophos, 2007 [51], 2008 [52]; Symantec, 2008 [54], 2010 [61]).</p></bodyText></footnote>:</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United States</emphasis> is reputed to be the major generator of malware and source of cybercriminal attacks.

At least four factors conspire to spur the growing sophistication of the cybercrime industry in China: (1) widespread use of online leisure (including social networking websites, online gaming sites, forums, blogs, and online shopping sites),<footnote><anchor id=\"_000125\"/><label>25</label><bodyText><p>.</p></bodyText></footnote> (2) low average income of Internet users (94.9% of the Internet users in China have an average monthly income of less than \u00a3470 in 2010); (3) high availability of skills due to emphasis on computing\u20acrelated subjects such as Maths and the Sciences [59]; and (4) most Internet users in 2010 were students (30%), while the unemployed, retired and self-employed segments comprised nearly one quarter of the users.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000130\"/><label>26</label><bodyText><p>According to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), Statistical Report on Internet Development in China, July, 2010, Beijing.</p></bodyText></footnote> These factors have plausibly driven the dramatic increase in the population of hackers in China, which is reported to be near four million spanning across just 19 online hacker forums [59]. Most Chinese hackers, however, have been depicted as hackers with \"basic training who can tweak and use tools\" rather than are capable of producing \"genuine\" tools [30]. Nonetheless, the ability to use or adapt existing tools does not preclude the perpetration of cybercriminal activities, and there is little to suggest that these basic skills will not evolve into more advanced capabilities for developing innovative criminal applications, such as those for which Russian cybercriminals are renowned (see below).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Russia</emphasis> has traditionally been considered the original home of cybercrime, where high technical skills are combined with a stumbling economy and a long tradition of organised crime.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000135\"/><label>27</label><bodyText><p>In 1993, after the European Council invited Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to apply for EU accession, the Baltic States implemented an intensive period of national and cultural reconstruction following years of encroachment from Russia, especially the penetration of Russian organised crime groups. At the centre of this purge was an attempt to stem the incursion of non-indigenous criminal influence on public-sector employers. It would seem that very early on in the evolution of the Internet, Russian organised crime became aware of its potential. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the nascent Russian Business Network (RBN) is thought to have taken a keen interest in the IT skills that existed in the Baltic States. It also took a similar interest in the underemployed IT experts in the former Soviet Union's military, many of whom remained unpaid for months on end.</p></bodyText></footnote> Russian programmers are believed to be behind the most widely used malware-making toolkits such as Mpack and WebAttacker. Dubbed \"the mother of cybercrime\" the Russian Business Network (RBN) has been linked by security firms to child pornography, corporate blackmail, spam attacks and online identity theft, although most Russian cybercrime is directed at financial fraud, particularly through botnets (collections of compromised computers) and phishing.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000140\"/><label>28</label><bodyText><p>R.

What is known, however, is that it has no legal identity; it is not registered as a company; and its senior figures are anonymous, known only by their nicknames. Its websites are registered at anonymous addresses with dummy e-mails and it does not advertise for customers. Those who want to use its services may contact it via Internet messaging services and pay with anonymous electronic cash. \"RBN is a for-hire service catering to large-scale criminal operations,\" says VeriSign (the Internet and communication security company). It hosts cybercriminals, ranging from spammers to phishers, bot-herders and \"all manner of other fraudsters and wrongdoers from the venal to the vicious\" according to VeriSign. The company estimates that a single scam, called Rock Phish (where gullible Internet users were tricked into entering personal financial information such as bank account details) made USD150m in a year (, 20 August 2007). A recent report indicated that in March 2011 Russia was the most frequent source of spam given that a large number of bots are located in its geography.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000145\"/><label>29</label><bodyText><p>Messagelabs (2011, March).

A main driver that encourages young Brazilians to develop their skills is the lack of any form of effective legislative framework to combat cybercrime. Another factor contributing to the perceived growth of cybercrime in this country is the propensity and readiness of Brazilians to share data via chatrooms, which are a target of cybercriminals to garner personal data for online banking fraud [23,49]. Furthermore, Brazilian hackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and malware creators are rapidly developing and adapting malware to avoid the security prevention techniques from banks.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000150\"/><label>30</label><bodyText><p>Operation Pegasus, launched by Brazilian authorities, arrested 85 people in 2005 as part of a ring planting key loggers (software that logs people's keyboard activity) that helped the alleged criminals steal approximately US$33 million from bank accounts [28].</p></bodyText></footnote> The number of cyber attacks has escalated, according to the country's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), from 68 thousand in 2005 to nearly 360 thousand in 2009.

The following section turns to the conceptual elements of the criminal ecosystem and further suggests the aptness of adopting an ecosystem perspective to study cybercrime.</p><h>4 Conceptual foundations of the digital business (and cybercrime) ecosystem</h><h>4.1 Value chains</h><p>The literature on value chain analysis defines it as the full range of activities required to bring a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production to the end users or consumers [68]. The concept of value chains also relates to the inputs from multiple actors in various industries, although the relationships illustrated by the value chain tend to be more vertical within one type of industrial commodity than the concept of business ecosystem, which cuts horizontally across many sectors, commodities and services. Nevertheless, the concept of value chains offers important contributions to understanding the ecosystem since: first, it locates particular <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">actors</emphasis> within the value chain and shows how they change position over time. Second, it maps the common <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">flow of activities</emphasis> required for the production of goods and services. Third, it identifies the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">linkages</emphasis> between the various activities in the chain. Fourth, it helps us to see who gains along the supply chain and identifies the strong and weak links. In other words, it identifies who plays an important role in its success, or how it is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">governed</emphasis>. Finally, it highlights the importance of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">upgrading</emphasis> or improvement of capabilities and infrastructure, services and products. A value chain framework thus provides insights into the dynamics of a business ecosystem.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000180\"/><label>36</label><bodyText><p>A more in-depth exploration of the cybercrime value chain can be found in Rush and Kraemer-Mbula (2012) \"The Cybercrime value chain\", International Journal of Cyberspace Sciences and Emergency Management (2012, pending).</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>As in the legitimate business world, cybercriminals compete and coordinate their actions in order to gain competitive advantage over a specific segment of the market. The sequence of activities, described above, that is required to make a product or service, involves the combination of inputs from various actors, which, in most industries are increasingly distributed globally. A central concern of value chain analysis is to enhance the understanding of, and unpack the relationships between the actors involved in the range of activities that lead to producing a good or service.</p><p>Each of the activities from various actors is intended to support the undetected generation of financial profit. Therefore, each activity can be associated with multiple methods of achieving a financial gain within their own niche markets, sources of competitive advantage and gains or value added benefits, combining with each other to form a value chain. Cybercrime can thus be seen as a whole value chain facilitating fraud, with different operations, profit margins, technological capabilities and upgrading of products and services and, consequently, opportunities attached to each stage.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000185\"/><label>37</label><bodyText><p>R.

A quicker, more effective and increasingly common method involves working with 'subcontractors' or thieves. 'Insider agents', employees of companies, such as in financial institutions, call centres and bars and restaurants are the prime targets. Credit card fraudsters and identity thieves directly approach potential accomplices who have two distinct characteristics: (1) those who have easy access to customers' personal or financial details; (2) those in poorly paid jobs with access to financial data, so the financial incentive is so attractive that it outweighs concerns about collusion with the fraudster [1].<footnote><anchor id=\"_000195\"/><label>39</label><bodyText><p>Confirmed by interviews conducted by [46].</p></bodyText></footnote> In an economic environment in which job stability is elusive, loyalty to the employer is threatened.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000200\"/><label>40</label><bodyText><p>A recent survey indicates that 60% of global fraud (in which the perpetrator is known) is enabled by insiders.

They are keeping pace with technological developments and even outpacing them through the adaptation and upgrading of existing software tools. At the higher end of the generation of crimeware tools and distribution (harvesting fraudsters), increasing specialisation in the methods for data harvesting poses greater challenges for the prevention of cybercrime. Specialisation allows cybercriminals to be ahead of the protection techniques, and new tactics arise constantly for each type of threat [46]. Spamming, phishing and cracking are the three main techniques for data harvesting. We explain each below.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spamming</emphasis> is the practice of sending unwanted e-mail messages, frequently with commercial content, in large quantities to an indiscriminate set of recipients. Increasingly, e-mail spam today is sent via 'zombies', that is, networks of virus- or worm-infected personal computers worldwide. It was estimated that more than 90% of all e-mail was spam in 2009.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000205\"/><label>41</label><bodyText><p>Information about spamming is collected by Spamhaus. See .</p></bodyText></footnote> Recently it has been calculated that the worldwide spam cost to business alone is USD130 billion annually [75]. Despite the banning of sending unsolicited bulk email by all Internet service providers, the number of spammers has exponentially grown and new trends include the growing use of social networking sites (i.e. Facebook and Myspace) as spamming platforms.</p><p>The skills deployed in spamming vary in their sophistication. An example of a low skill in spamming involves sending bulk unsolicited e-mails requesting personal details, such as the notorious 'Nigerian Letter' scam (also called the '419 fraud').<footnote><anchor id=\"_000210\"/><label>42</label><bodyText><p>This is also referred to as the 'Advance Fee Fraud', named '419 Fraud' after the relevant section of the Nigerian Criminal Code.</p></bodyText></footnote> This involves e-mails in which the target is enticed to advance sums of money in the hope of realising a significantly larger gain, through high returns from the unsuspecting victim's 'investment'. The skills for spamming, however, are becoming more technically sophisticated. For instance, nine out of ten spam messages now contain little more than a few simple words and a web link, which, when clicked, downloads malicious code to steal data, according to a survey of major computer company's security division. 'Spamvertised sites' also are found in many spam e-mails which contain links to a website or websites, which offer products, ranging from adult entertainment to financial services to health products, thereby presenting themselves as legitimate marketing sites.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phishing</emphasis>, now popularly labelled as a social engineering technique,<footnote><anchor id=\"_000215\"/><label>43</label><bodyText><p>Social engineering is the practice of obtaining confidential information by manipulation of legitimate users. Phishing is social engineering because it tricks people to divulge information, perform certain actions or break security procedures. Trend Micro, Threat Roundup and Forecast, London (2008). See also [58]. Social engineering is also explored in a Whitepaper issued by ENISA (2008) \"Social Engineering: Exploring the Weakest Link\", The European Network and Information Security Agency.</p></bodyText></footnote> is a sophisticated form of spam. Phishing is the fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. The practice is often conducted by sending e-mails that look as if they come from a financial institution. This information is later exploited for a financial gain (either using the information directly to obtain goods or services by deception or selling the information to another criminal). Some phishing techniques require high levels of technical skill and know-how. For instance, cybercriminals are leveraging new technologies to invent new forms of phishing, for example, 'spear phishing'. This is any highly targeted phishing attack in which a fake e-mail from a seemingly internal person to an organisation is sent to all the employees or certain members.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000220\"/><label>44</label><bodyText><p>Microsoft, . Another form of phishing is 'whale' phishing, in which high profile individuals are singles out for phishing attaches.</p></bodyText></footnote> Also, cloning the websites of retailers is one quick way to obtain financial and personal data. These cloned websites closely resemble the real ones and require close scrutiny to spot the difference. The Anti-Phishing Working Group [12] reported that more than 300 brands were hijacked by phishers in a six-month period during 2011 [12]. In an attempt to deal with this problem, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo and 11 other big tech companies are jointly designing a system for combating phishing email scams. However, there are also examples of 'phishing kits' available for cybercriminals with low technical skills. Phishing (technical) kits typically bundle all the content required to replicate a targeted website and these are offered freely on the Internet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crackers</emphasis> are specialists in gaining unauthorised access to other computers. This is generally achieved through the application of particular tools, programming skills and computer knowledge. This activity has gradually moved away from the original virus writing, motivated by the reputation to become a key component of the cybercrime industry. Crackers can also develop malware (software viruses/programmes) with a financial motive in mind, and are currently the top cause of reported data breaches.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000225\"/><label>45</label><bodyText><p>Information on data breaches is regularly collected by the Identity Resource Center; see .</p></bodyText></footnote> Eight hundred data breaches were reported worldwide in 2008, which resulted in more than 200million identities exposed.

However, different types of capabilities are required to either adapt legitimate software tools for criminal purposes or develop malicious software for specific criminal use. The operation of crackers has also changed, and rather than working in isolation they currently often share their ideas in user communities. Many such communities are characterised by an open sharing of ideas and innovations, termed 'free revealing' [76]. Moreover, new evidence suggests that crackers and malware writers are gradually entering the hierarchical structure of cybercrime organisations, where they have their own well-defined role and reward system [14,31,59]. Given the high technical nature of their skills, it is expected that crackers represent a small percentage of the cybercriminal population. However, the way they operate, their role in the governance of the cybercriminal value chain and the evolution of the trends, skills and linkage with traditional criminal gangs, are still largely unknown.</p><h>4.2.2 Capabilities in the exploitation of information</h><p>At the lower end, specialisation in exploitation is minimising the level of IT related skills required to perpetrate crime.

One way of doing this is known as \"account takeover.\"<footnote><anchor id=\"_000235\"/><label>47</label><bodyText><p>[1], p.9.</p></bodyText></footnote> Here, the fraudster manages to obtain sufficient information about the victim, such as from billing statements, pre-approved credit card offers and receipts, to impersonate him or her in bank dealings, in person, by telephone or in writing. The fraudster changes the address associated with the account so that all mail is delivered to another address. The fraudster then gets a new card by reporting the loss of an existing card or requests an additional card. Upon receipt of the card and the pin, the fraudster uses the card. The transactions are not immediately detected, because the statement is sent to another address and the victim is unaware of the loss of the card. Only when the transactions become too obvious or high in value will the rightful owner realise that the card has been used fraudulently.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In the UK, according to CIFAS [15], the first 9months of 2009 saw a 23% increase when compared with the same period in 2008. While some observers may regard this as rather worrying, this increase was on top of a staggering 207% increase in the previous year. Cases of account takeover have risen by 238% in total when comparing the first nine months of 2009 with the same period in 2007. In terms of the individual victim, these figures work out to a 36% increase in the number of victims of impersonation during the first nine months of 2009 when compared with the same period in 2008.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>b) Use of cyber skills to exploit the information</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The trend towards the development and marketing of user-friendly tools for criminal exploitation is rapidly developing into crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS). The emergence of crimeware as a service releases criminals from having to deal with the technical challenges of cybercrimes. Some of these services include crimeware toolkits. As noted above, these provide readymade tools for criminals to gather and sort out the data stolen, minimising the necessary coding skills to operate them [19]. The director of security strategies from a large IT multinational said \"for subscriptions starting as low as USD20 per month, such enterprises sell fully managed exploit engines that spyware distributors and spammers can use to infiltrate systems worldwide\".<footnote><anchor id=\"_000240\"/><label>48</label><bodyText><p>Gunter Ollman quoted at: .</p></bodyText></footnote> It is likely that CaaS will increasingly hamper the ability of law enforcement to track malicious hackers.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>One commentator has argued that the virtual relationships within online communities \"... encourage the social deskilling of the individual through the specialisation and compartmentalisation of interactions\" [58, p. 33]. However, the examples presented above suggest both increasing acquisition of technical skills and deskilling, depending on the type and activity of the cybercrime. Consequently, capability is being spread across a dramatically increasing range and number of cybercriminals. Highly capable cybercriminals are developing skills that will harvest data worth vast sums of money. However, even a barely capable cybercriminal can still make an effective living with a small investment of funds and limited computer literacy.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Networks of criminals specialise, cooperate and compete with the ultimate goal of generating an illicit profit in this cybercriminal ecosystem. Their interconnection and dependence means that to pursue their individual interests, they need to become part of value chains, where different actors specialise, link and upgrade, driven by innovation. The strategic position of a firms and its' activities in the value chain helps determine how it approaches business and generates a profit. A wide variety of actors participate in the cybercrime ecosystem at various levels, creating different business models. Some of these are explored below.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>A firm's capability is \"a collection of routines that confers upon an organisation's management the ability to produce significant outputs of a particular type\" [69]. Scholars, however, argue that dynamic capabilities, more than just 'routine' capabilities, are required to create and sustain competitive advantage in a changing business environment [70]. Dynamism connotes change, so dynamic capabilities are those that extend, modify or create capabilities [69] to meet the challenges and demands of the marketplace. Such capabilities, therefore, underpin the ability of an organisation to make best use of new equipment or technologies to produce novel and innovative products or services, and hence improve their productivity and competitive advantage [71,72].</p><p>Within an ecosystem, the identification of the firm's distinctive competencies, skills and capabilities is necessary in order to assess if specialisation in a product or process also helps to determine the behaviour of the individual firm within the value chain [79]. As with legitimate businesses that have to innovate and develop new skills, specialisation is also driving changes in the skills needed to perpetrate cybercrime at different points in the value chain. While we acknowledge that firms can change without reliance on dynamic capabilities [73], we argue that the cybercriminal 'enterprise' reflects capability-building in the ways that Teece [55] shows how enterprises can maintain competitive advantage through dynamic capabilities. He disaggregates dynamic capabilities into the capacity to sense and shape opportunities and threats, seize opportunities, and maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise's intangible and tangible assets.</p><p>Eisenhardt and Martin ([74], p. 21) also discuss dynamic capabilities in terms of specific and strategic organisational processes, noting that organisations become engaged in \"alliancing and strategic decision making that create value for firms in dynamic markets by manipulating resources into new value creating strategies\". The financial cybercriminal \"market\" exhibits such dynamism and the cybercriminal enterprise is rather adept at sensing, shaping and seizing opportunities, manipulating its resources to maintain competitiveness. It primarily does this by adapting and developing capabilities to create and exploit opportunities for innovative forms of credit card fraud and identity theft.</p><p>A capability analysis also helps to illuminate the generation and adaptation of the new capabilities, both at the highly-technical level and other types of capabilities (e.g. social engineering, process management, etc.). The analysis of the capabilities involved in cybercriminal activities illuminates the process of specialisation of the perpetrators. Understanding the specialisation process is critical in order to anticipate the strategic behaviour of a firm, as well as to understand their capabilities and their innovation activities. Credit card fraudsters and identity thieves use a combination of traditional and new skills to acquire data and perpetrate fraud. These capabilities generally involve both cyber and non-cyber skills and can be illustrated by focussing on two essential credit card fraud and identity theft activities, such as data harvesting and exploitation (more below).</p><h>4.3 Business models</h><h>4.3.1 Offline business models</h><p>Although the Internet is a common meeting and workplace for cybercriminals, we have already seen that some credit card fraud and ID theft still takes place in a traditional offline fashion. These activities are usually at higher risk, since they lack the anonymity of the Internet. However, offline activities have provided an opportunity for traditional crime gangs to exploit the economic opportunities of cybercrime businesses, which have benefited from their existing structure, hierarchy and occasional funding from other illicit activities. Two likely offline business models are the loyalty business model and business process outsourcing.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>a) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The loyalty business model</emphasis> is used when company resources are employed to increase the loyalty of customers and other stakeholders to meet corporate expectations. Whilst supermarkets use loyalty cards, organised crime groups may maintain the loyalty of gang members and the code of silence with cash \"incentives\" [17] or the threat of violence or extortion.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>b) The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">business process outsourcing model</emphasis> (BPO) involves contracting operations and responsibilities of specific business functions (or processes) to a third-party service provider. It is traditionally associated with large manufacturing firms outsourcing large segments of their supply chain. Today, it is primarily used to refer to outsourcing of services. In the cybercrime business, given the variety of technical and organisational skills required to perpetrate certain crimes, many of the services will likely be hired or outsourced. It is well reported [37] that criminal organisations are increasingly hiring (legitimate) financial specialists to conduct their money laundering transactions in countries where financial jurisdictions are 'safer'. Similarly, criminal gangs can also hire the technical expertise they need to perpetrate one type of attack, ensuring, through a mixture of rewards and threats, that the technical expert will conduct the assignment effectively. Here we note the \"connection\" between the legal and dark networks of Raab and Milward, and the \"interconnectedness\" of Moore, Iansiti and Levien, and other scholars who have written on business ecosystems.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><h>4.3.2 Hybrid business models</h><p>A hybrid business model results from the combination of physical (off-line) and web channels (online). Many authors have differentiated hybrid models from Internet-only businesses models, using terms like 'bricks and clicks', also known as \"clicks and mortar\", \"surf and turf,\" \"cyber-enhanced retailing,\" and \"hybrid e-commerce\" [3,42,53,56] and swarming business models.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>a) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The bricks and clicks business model</emphasis> and its variations generally describe the partnership between Internet businesses and traditional distribution companies, for instance the successful business model adopted by Amazon, where orders placed online are physically distributed by the postal system. In the cybercrime business, the integration of e-commerce with physical channels takes place mostly during the final transformation of stolen information into cash, without which the entire process would have no value. The business model of drop services provides an example of a combination of web channels of communication with the purchaser of illicit goods online, and off-line provision of a physical address to mail the stolen goods.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>b) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The swarming business model</emphasis> involves the temporary collaboration of individuals to meet a particular challenge or goal. In the legitimate world, members of the \"swarm\" work towards a collective interest, which is broadly defined by any of the stakeholders and is driven by innovation [24,25]. Many legitimate businesses have used collaborative innovation networks to facilitate close cooperation between customers and product developers [24]. Given the range of skills required in the various forms of financial cybercrime, it is plausible that swarms can be born online, similar to what we call the \"Internet community business model\", but in most cases they combine physical and online means for communication (online collaboration among individuals who also meet in person). One distinct feature of the model is that swarms generate for a specific purpose and for a limited period of time, until the goal is achieved (unlike the Internet-based model). In cybercrime, swarms could be generated for the purpose of cracking.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><h>4.3.3 Internet-based business models</h><p>The growth of Internet-based businesses in the legitimate world has resulted in many classifications and methods of conducting business over the Internet. E-commerce has given rise to new kinds of business models. The benefits for customers and suppliers offered by online businesses and Internet technology over physical channels have been highlighted by many commentators (e.g. [10,48,35]) and include reduced operational and overhead costs, scale and scope, access to wider markets, lower inventory and building costs, flexibility in sourcing inputs, improved transaction automation and the ability to bypass intermediaries. Cybercriminals benefit from all these advantages as well as enjoy anonymity. The Internet provides criminals with a favourable environment to disguise their identity, even amongst trusted colleagues, making them hard for law enforcement agencies to locate.</p><p>Some models identified in our research include:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>a) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Advertising-based models</emphasis>: This model is used legally by companies that provide content or services to visitors and sell advertising to businesses that want to reach those visitors. The advertising based model is widely used by Internet Relay Chats (IRC) and web forum operators. In the underground economy, advertised items include bundles of credit card numbers, identity theft information, online banking information and skilled labour for hire. Discounts are often offered for bulk purchases [54].</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>b) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brokerage model</emphasis>: At the heart of the brokerage model are third parties known as brokers, who bring sellers and buyers of products and services together to engage in transactions. The broker usually charges a fee to at least one party involved in a transaction, sometimes both, in much the same way a real estate agent charges a fee for a successful sale. In the underground cybercriminal business, this would be illustrated by the providers of referral services. These specialised services act as a 'trusted' intermediary between a seller and buyer of malware and other illegal services. Such agents hold the money on the transaction until a buyer has had a chance to check that the goods or services purchased function as promised. Their fees can range from 2% to 4% of the total transaction [54].</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>c) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Internet community model</emphasis>: This business model is based on the creation of a virtual community of interested users who support the development of products through voluntary donations. A legitimate example is the 'Open Source' community. There is evidence that communities of hackers are developing attacking tools mimicking Open Source communities [27].<footnote><anchor id=\"_000245\"/><label>49</label><bodyText><p>There are examples such as the distribution of Try2DDoS, a tool that automates distributed denial of service attacks. It was first released in June 2005 on Underground Konnekt, a French hacker website. Over the next two years, identical source code turned up in China, Guatemala, Russia and Argentina. As the programme moved around the globe within the online community of hackers, the tool gained new capabilities, including support for Spanish and Chinese languages.

Using CaaS, criminals can now rent malware and hosting services along with any patches needed to defeat security software. The final user only needs to have a target and to identify the type of data they seek to steal, while the technical work can be hired. The emergence of CaaS releases criminals from having to deal with the technical challenges of cybercrime. Under this business model, everything can be rented, from crimeware toolkits to pay-per-infection services.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>e) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crimeware toolkits</emphasis> offer off-the-shelf tools that allow criminals to gather and sort out the data stolen, minimising the need for coding skills to operate them [19].

For instance, the swarming model, where participants work together on a common goal, can also include crime-as-a service elements. Many sources, as discussed above, have made assumptions about the various types of business model and their features but empirical evidence of each model is still lacking. This is hardly surprising given the murky nature of cybercrime. Still, with the relentless adoption of the Internet for conducting online business, international cooperation in promoting cybersecurity and the concomitant acquisition of technical expertise by law enforcement authorities to improve cybersecurity and combat cybercrime, continues as an urgent policy objective nationally and internationally.</p><p>The integration of business models into the criminal ecosystem allows opportunities for the identification of the typical cybercriminal business structures. Yet all business models have weaknesses as well as strengths [78]. It is thus arguable that, by acquiring a better understanding of the weaknesses of the cybercrime business models (how they are organised and operate), better perspectives and measures for dealing with cybercrime may be developed. Similarly, a better understanding of the cybercriminal business models is likely to facilitate a greater degree of understanding of the criminal activity, which in turn could provide more grounded intelligence that could be used to neutralise such activities.</p><p>The third contributing body of work that is important in understanding how the cybercrime ecosystem works is that of business models. The term 'business model' is used in the literature to describe the key components of a business, and has gained particular interest in research related to e-businesses [3,5,9,47]. A business model is a conceptual tool that articulates the vision of a business and conveys a high-level understanding of the overall strategic goals of a business and its interaction with rivals [77,29,38].</p><p>In any given industry, the methods of doing business may vary between actors and over time in response to changing market conditions, technological innovations, new product strategies, competition, among others. While little is known about the types of business models that operate in the underworld, we do know that all cybercriminals want to make money. We also know that every business model has its own inherent strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>While some models are quite simple, others can be more intricately woven. Rush et al. [46] identified three predominant business models: off-line business models, Internet-based business models and hybrid models (a combination of the previous two). Since most cybercrime activities take place online, there are more Internet-based examples of business models. However, it is still worth noting that a significant component of cybercrime activities takes place offline, as well as a combination of online and offline methods. Below we present a number of plausible business models, but further examination is much needed.</p><p>We have already discussed that a business ecosystem relies on \"the performance of individual firms and the utility of individual products depends much on the performance of other firms and products in the ecosystem.....[and] an ecosystem is a network of organisations that drive and create/deliver services or products\" ([67]: 5). As Moore [40] had intimated, business ecosystems evolve and are dynamic, and like natural or biological systems, they behave like an \"organism\" which responds to its environment and continually evolves. For instance, consumer tastes change over time and, therefore, the constituents of the business ecosystem that supplies this particular consumer demand have to react accordingly in order to succeed in the market. This biological analogy emphasises the interdependence of all actors in the business environment who \"co-evolve their capabilities and roles\". Thus, innovation is central to the creation, development and life of a business ecosystem and is, as Moore has also suggested, a \"catalysing element for the evolution of the ecosystem\".</p><p>Cybercriminals are increasingly operating in a business ecosystem in much the same way that companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, Cisco and Hewlett Packard, have successfully used their environment to define and establish their alliances and networks to sell their products and services. In particular, the traditional, ethnocentric organisational structures of criminal organisations have increasingly eroded to allow new sets of actors to collaborate. As with companies, the cybercriminal ecosystem has acquired new partners, knowledge, ideas and skills to fuel innovation and thereby has expanded the range of its cybercrime activities.</p><p>In a business ecosystem, the collective health of other actors who influence the creation and delivery of the product or service is fundamental to a company's success [62]. Firms \"operate in a business environment of shared fates and business models, and see their ecosystems as helping them become more resilient to market changes... to achieve market success and sustain performance\" [32]. Similar to legitimate businesses, the success of certain cyber-criminal activities may be dependent on innovations generated in other segments of the industry [18]. For instance, for cybercriminals to become more effective in perpetrating credit card fraud, they need to have access to, or develop more, sophisticated malicious software that allows them to infect more computer networks and get hold of the credit card data they want. In most cases, the criminal that steals the data is unlikely to have the ability to undertake innovations in developing new malicious software; therefore, their activities depend on the innovations from other actors in the industry. Moreover, most actors in the cybercrime industry must remain adept at overcoming the preventative obstacles and the risk of identification and detection. In sum, business ecosystems emphasise the interconnectedness between the relationships, capabilities and business models among players in the network fuelled by innovation.</p><p>As described by Raab and Milward [44, p 3], a cybercrime ecosystem is, in effect, a \"dark network\" in which there may be \"interpenetration between illegal and legal networks\". They further explain that there is a connection between legal networks, such as those aimed to destroy these dark networks. Such 'interpenetration' between these legal and illegal networks can be illustrated by a law enforcement officer or informant posing as a member of a dark network.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000170\"/><label>34</label><bodyText><p>An example can be seen in an FBI sting operation, in which the agency used an informant to target a top crime site, Shadowcrew.com, which was eventually shut down.</p></bodyText></footnote> So while networks are often perceived positively, for instance, they are formed to solve a political, social and economic problem, dark networks,<footnote><anchor id=\"_000175\"/><label>35</label><bodyText><p>For an overview on network research, see again [44].</p></bodyText></footnote> Raab and Millward argue, need to be studied so that policymakers may \"reformulate the problem of illegal activity in network terms\" in order to tackle these problems. The authors specifically suggest that policymakers, and scholars interested in the study of networks, need to learn (1) more about the activities of these networks; (2) how they operate; and (3) how they are organised. The following sections will elaborate on these three aspects.</p><p>To explore the core elements of the cybercrime ecosystem, we refer to the key writings on value chains, dynamic capabilities and business models to help reveal what the cybercriminal activities are and how cybercrime operates and functions. The following sections address each body of literature, highlighting mainly its key relevance and utility to understanding the cybercrime ecosystem.</p><h>5 Conclusions</h><p>The organisational and technological capabilities of cybercriminals will likely advance and grow in the foreseeable future. As the use of cyberspace develops further, new opportunities will open up, for instance in the observed rapid growth in mobile web usage and social media. It remains to be seen how the current global financial crisis will affect this situation. We have already seen how powerful emerging economies (the so-called BRICs, for example) are already playing significant roles within the cybercrime ecosystem. If the crisis deepens and persists, this may encourage a new generation of under- or unemployed youth with IT skills to seek entry into the profitable and comparatively low risk world of cybercrime. We have also discussed the range of countries that have become \"IT-savvy,\" from where many cybercriminals are conducting their illicit activities. It is arguable that as IT capabilities are further developed in countries such as Africa, other parts of Europe, South-East Asia and Latin America, and exacerbated by a prolonged financial exigency, the growth prospects of this criminal activity are likely to increase.</p><p>Against this global spread of cybercrime, we have aimed to show why the concept of business ecosystems provides a useful approach to exploring the complex global environment in which cybercriminals operate. In the absence of coordinated global governance and leadership, criminal networks are likely to proliferate or consolidate in order to pursue convergent goals and interests. From an analytical viewpoint, digital business ecosystems provide a holistic framework to analyse the cybercrime 'industry' from a variety of angles, including its horizontal connections to other legitimate sectors (e.g. software production, Internet services providers, etc.). By adopting the ecosystem analogy, we have shown that the cybercrime ecosystem is continually evolving as it develops new criminal techniques, as well as responds to the external environment in which online activity and transactions continue unabated. The recent hacking of the Sony Playstation website in which millions of personal data were stolen is a distressing reminder that cybercriminals (and hackers with 'political' agendas) are unrelenting in their activities [11]. We believe that the ecosystem perspective, once fully populated with reliable data, will permit a clearer view of the multiple actors within the cybercrime universe.</p><p>This paper has also attempted to examine cybercrime through an innovation lens, by examining how cybercriminals innovate, what the sources of innovation are and from where they emanate. We argue that by doing so, we have also contributed to the broad literature on cybercriminal activity, which is mainly populated by scholars in the fields of criminology, psychology, sociology, law and information technology. Important and necessary as these fields are for understanding the roots of cybercrime, the law for tackling it and the security measures that may be deployed to combat this felonious activity, an innovation perspective for studying this activity provides an added dimension to its activities, operation and organisation, which taken together, expands the understanding of this activity. Furthermore, the greater the awareness of the new ways that cybercriminals use to compile, package, distribute and market their products and services, the greater the success of dealing with counter measures against cybercrime. As concerns regarding the systematic collection of cybercriminal activities continue to worry national enforcement authorities, we believe that the framework presented in this paper could further help to identify the kinds of data required for capturing the actors and activities of cybercrime. In the UK for instance, the UK National Fraud Authority (NFA) set up the National Fraud Reporting Centre in 2011 (Action Fraud)<footnote><anchor id=\"_000265\"/><label>53</label><bodyText><p>.</p></bodyText></footnote> to improve the low reporting activity of fraud victims, as well financial and cyber-enabled fraud.</p><p>An enhanced understanding of cybercriminal activities could have a number of policy and practical implications for the communities charged with tackling cybercrime. Knowledge of how cybercriminals innovate, operate and organise their activities could plausibly aid law enforcement officers and policymakers to devise more effective strategies to deal with them. For instance, Kaplinsky [33, p 126] argues that an advantage of value chain analysis shifts \"the focus from 'point' to 'systemic' efficiency,\" which could imply that it would be more efficient for policymakers and the law enforcement community to understand the cybercriminal value chain than to deal with each kind of cybercrime discretely. Similarly, a deepened understanding of the dynamic capabilities required and the development of new business models within the cybercrime ecosystem, could help in the identification of significant trends (often mimicking legitimate sectors of the economy). Such insights and knowledge about the activities of networks could help criminal enforcement authorities and policy makers to concentrate what are often limited resources in order to increase the effectiveness of their response.</p><p>Developing proactive measures to address complex, uncertain and globally interconnected issues, calls for the use of tools and approaches to analyse trends and directions of change, but importantly with a long-term perspective. Scenario planning and foresight are growing areas of interest that support strategic thinking by developing a range of possible ways in which the future could unfold, anticipating trends and identifying optimal policy responses to address each possible scenario. Foresight analysis has been deployed in cybercrime studies - a notable example is the \"Foresight's Cyber Trust and Crime Prevention Project\" sponsored by the UK Home Office in 2004.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000270\"/><label>54</label><bodyText><p>See .</p></bodyText></footnote> These exercises provide valuable insights on the perceptions of risks of cybercrime. The integration of an ecosystem perspective to foresight exercises could add value to future analyses.</p><p>Addressing cybercrime is becoming a worldwide priority - in 2011 the UK government allocated \u00a330m over a period of four years to develop an e-Crime Unit exclusively dedicated to tackle computer intrusion, denial of service attacks and Internet fraud. Since its establishment there have been notable successes in terms of prosecutions and arrests.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000275\"/><label>55</label><bodyText><p>Operation Podium led recently to over 100 arrests related to Internet fraud connected to the Olympics (BBC, 2012); and Operation Dynamaphone, which resulted in \u00a35.5m worth of harm saved. Three individuals were jailed for 13years for their part in a concerted attack on the UK and international banking system. (BBC, 2012).</p></bodyText></footnote> Yet these measures remain predominantly reactive, that is, taking action after the perpetration of the crime, although the UK Foresight project (see above) signals recognition that anticipation of the (new) types of cybercrime is a requirement for effective measures.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000280\"/><label>56</label><bodyText><p>In the U.S. attempts are being made to be more proactive in their strategies against cybercrime. For instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation led the formation of a National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) and in 2008, the U.S. President mandated the NCIJTF to be responsible for the coordination, integration and the sharing of information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations. This Task Force includes 18 intelligence and law enforcement agencies, working together to identify key players and schemes. Its goal is to predict, anticipate and prevent cybercrime and to identify and pursue the organisations behind cybercriminal activities.</p></bodyText></footnote> In the U.S. attempts are being made to be more proactive in their strategies against cybercrime.

Moreover, we argue that the application of an ecosystems framework may help to better understand not only the business models and interactions between criminals, but also the \"mirror\" approach of techniques and models that have been used by law enforcement agencies in their prosecution activities, in such a way that good practices can be replicated and scarce resources more efficiently allocated.</p><p>It becomes apparent that to deal with cybercrime effectively, concerted action by national and international law enforcement, separately and together, and stringent corporate information security measures are indispensable, given the global nature of cybercrime. Thus far, our research has concentrated on devising a conceptual framework, which would aid decision-makers working in law-enforcement and IT security. Of course, an integral part of the ecosystem s also to be found at the level of the organisation/company level and the individual. These far, the conceptual model only covers the criminal aspects of the ecosystem and a next step will be to extend it to encompass their victim's. It has been suggested that much of cybercrime is aided and abetted via insider knowledge or simply lax security. Too many companies think that they are either two small to be a target, that they have taken adequate protection but rarely update their defences, or are simply unaware of the dangers faced. Former Navy Admiral and National Security Agency director Mike McConnell once told a forum on cyber security that \"good cyber hygiene\" is imperative for eliminating security risks that companies face.<footnote><anchor id=\"_000290\"/><label>58</label><bodyText><p>See Taylor Amerding [6], \"Thwarted by security by enterprises, cyber criminals target SMBs. See . May 15, 2012.</p></bodyText></footnote></p><p>It is also, of course, the responsibility of individuals to protect the confidentiality of their personal data and to exercise care in giving them out. Developing an awareness of individual information security, however, assumes that cybercrime affects the social behaviour of the individual by making him or her, among other things, more careful about data security. The so-called 'social-engineering' skills and techniques used to part an individual from their data and money are just as dynamic as the technical development of new and evermore powerful malware. Furthering our understanding of the changing nature of such techniques, capabilities and the new business models to which they are attached would be useful for those organisations (governmental and non-governmental), which are attempting to educate the public about cybersecurity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: *Corresponding author.

I'm Cat Zakrzewski, a tech policy reporter at The Washington Post. I'll be at the helm of The Cybersecurity 202 these next few weeks. If you can't get enough of Post newsletters, sign up here for my forthcoming newsletter, The Technology 202. You won't want to miss our daily analysis on the complex relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, coming to your inbox in December.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             THE KEY          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             With its decision to open half of\u00a0its HQ2 in Crystal City, Va., Amazon will be the Pentagon's newest neighbor - putting the company in a strong position to expand its business opportunities with the federal government.          </p><p>The company's new address will be on the doorstep of some of the government's largest contractors. Amazon already provides services for a wide range of government entities, including the Central Intelligence Agency. The prime real estate for the technology giant\u00a0right across the bridge from the nation's capital means that contractors like the Defense Department, which is already considering a bid from Amazon for its cloud computing services, might be even more likely to count on their new neighbor's offerings.\u00a0</p><p>             \"It's a potential game changer now that they have their headquarters in the shadows of the Pentagon,\" said Daniel Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and equity analyst. \"This is really Bezos planting his flag and saying the federal government is going to be a big piece of our business.\"          </p><p>A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment. (Amazon\u00a0founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             With HQ2 soon housed near both government agencies and prominent defense contractors, Amazon will also be able to\u00a0recruit people with technical talent who are open to working on government projects. Amazon arrives inside the\u00a0Beltway as tech workers largely living in Silicon Valley have protested their companies' business ties to the military as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this year, Google announced it would not renew its AI contract with the Pentagon, known as Project Maven, after widespread backlash and employee resignations.</p><p>Bezos has taken a harder line, saying company leadership can't let employees call the shots. He said at a Wired conference last month that Amazon\u00a0would continue to support the Defense Department.</p><p>\"If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble,\" Bezos said.</p><p>Amazon's commitment to the public sector apparently has been lucrative. Wedbush estimated that federal business\u00a0 has accounted\u00a0for well over $2 billion in revenue\u00a0for the technology company so far in 2018. It's a major area of growth for Amazon, the Wedbush analysts said, up from between $200 and $300 million in 2015.</p><p>About $20 billion in\u00a0federal cloud projects will be \"up for grabs\" in the next five years as the government transforms its systems, according to Wedbush. The firm predicted in a recent note that Amazon and Microsoft will be the front-runners vying against each other to win those deals.</p><p>Even before confirming its HQ2 plans, Amazon was widely seen as the\u00a0favorite to land one of the largest government IT contracts in years: a $10 billion effort to build a department-wide cloud computing infrastructure for DoD, known as the \"Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure\" or JEDI.\u00a0Ives said the decision to open HQ2 in Crystal City is \"a potential ingredient\" that could sweeten Amazon's chances of winning the deal. He said JEDI is \"just the tip of the iceberg\" in the company's ambitions as a federal IT provider.</p><p>             But continuing to win government contracts could be a double-edged sword for Amazon, whose business practices could come under increasing scrutiny from President Trump and federal regulators.          </p><p>Trump, in a November interview with Axios aired on HBO, said the administration\u00a0is continuing to study Silicon Valley giants - including Amazon, Google and Facebook - for potential violations of antitrust laws.</p><p>John Weiler, the managing director of the IT Acquisition Advisory Council, said he is concerned about Amazon's growing power and influence in Washington. He said the company's decision to open part of HQ2 in the Washington metro area was \"a cornerstone\" to its broader political strategy.</p><p>\"This is going to be a book called, 'How to Take Over the Government,' \" Weiler said. \"They perfectly played the game.\"</p><p>Weiler was among the critics of the Pentagon's decision to go with a single cloud provider for the competitive $10 billion JEDI contract. On Wednesday, the Government Accountability Office ruled against a bid protest filed by Oracle, which criticized that decision, my colleagues Aaron Gregg and Christian Davenport reported.</p><p>IBM also protested the bid, which the GAO is reviewing. A decision on the bid protest is expected by January, Aaron and Christian reported.</p><p>             PINGED:\u00a0Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of\u00a0CrowdStrike, told senators\u00a0the Pentagon ought to\u00a0switch the focus of its cybersecurity efforts from hygiene to \"continuously hunting\" hackers in its systems. \"Implementing security controls is hygiene. Patching vulnerabilities is hygiene. Building an asset inventory is hygiene,\"\u00a0Alperovitch\u00a0said in opening remarks at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Cybersecurity subcommittee. \"No matter how good the department gets at these tasks, they alone will not accomplish the most important mission:\u00a0Stopping foreign intelligence and military services from countries such as Russia and China from breaking into our networks.\"          </p><p>Alperovitch said\u00a0the DoD's emphasis on cyber hygiene\u00a0\"too often\" gets in the way of rooting out hackers from the agency's networks. He also said the Pentagon should emulate\u00a0private companies' approach to cybersecurity, which includes\u00a0\"rapidly detecting and ejecting adversaries.\"</p><p>In his\u00a0written statement\u00a0to the committee, Alperovitch\u00a0elaborated: \"Hunting is assuming that adversaries are in your network and proactively searching for them by looking across your assets for indicators of malicious activity,\" he said. \"Simply investigating alerts generated by security tools is not hunting. Good hunters have an offensive mind-set and think like the adversary.\"</p><p>             PATCHED: FireEye said it expects increased\u00a0activity from\u00a0Chinese\u00a0and Iranian hackers. In a report\u00a0outlining\u00a0several\u00a0trends for 2019, the company predicted that Chinese espionage will accelerate over the next few years after Beijing reshuffled its cyber capabilities starting at least in 2016. \"We assess that this reorganization will inform the growth and geographic expansion of Chinese cyber espionage activity through 2020 and beyond,\" the report said.</p><p>FireEye\u00a0also warned that Iranian\u00a0threats could escalate following the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal. The firm said it expects Iran-linked hackers to\u00a0\"resume probing critical infrastructure networks in preparation for potential operations in the future.\" However, \"disruptive or destructive attacks on private companies\" in the United States\u00a0appear unlikely \"in the immediate or near-term,\" according to FireEye.</p><p>Additionally, Kevin Mandia, FireEye's chief executive, said he anticipates that more governments across the world will seek to acquire offensive cyber capabilities. \"In my travels, I have the privilege of meeting with government officials from around the globe, and in nearly every conversation I inevitably get the same question within the first 10 minutes,\" Mandia\u00a0said in the report. \"Whether it be in the Middle East, Europe, Asia or North America, they ask how they can develop an offensive capability for their own nation.\"          </p><p>             PWNED: Facebook's leaders largely failed to grasp the extent of Russia's\u00a0disinformation efforts on the social network\u00a0during the 2016 presidential election and then sought to play\u00a0down the issue, according to a wide-ranging investigation by the New York Times's\u00a0Sheera Frenkel, Nicholas Confessore, Cecilia Kang, Matthew Rosenberg and Jack Nicas. The reporters described\u00a0a September 2017\u00a0meeting of top Facebook executives, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, during which Sandberg berated\u00a0\"the social network's security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos's briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\"</p><p>Moreover, Sandberg\u00a0lobbied Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who leads the panel's investigation into Russian interference, according to the Times. \"The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall,\"\u00a0Frenkel, Confessore, Kang, Rosenberg and Nicas\u00a0reported. \"While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.\" Facebook said in a blog post that the Times story contains \"a number of inaccuracies.\" You can read Facebook's response here.</p><p>From Confessore:</p><p>From Bloomberg News's\u00a0Sarah Frier:</p><p>From the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Robert McMillan:</p><p>             - \"The departments of Defense and Homeland Security have agreed to a framework that more clearly articulates the agencies' roles and responsibilities in defending U.S. networks from advanced cyberthreats, officials told lawmakers Wednesday,\" CyberScoop's Sean Lyngaas reported. \"A joint memo recently signed by Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen 'is a major step forward in fostering closer cooperation and marks a sea change in the level of collaboration between our departments,' Kenneth Rapuano, an assistant secretary of Defense, said at House Armed Services subcommittee hearing.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0\"The former U.N. diplomat accused of helping steal and distribute Republican fundraiser Elliot Broidy's emails is entitled to diplomatic immunity, the U.S. government tells NBC News,\"\u00a0Josh Lederman\u00a0of NBC News reported. \"It's the latest blow to Broidy's legal campaign against Qatar and the individuals he says hacked him on its behalf. Several other defendants in lawsuits filed by Broidy including Qatar itself have already convinced the court to dismiss them from the case, which crisscrosses the murky worlds of cybercrime, the Persian Gulf diplomatic crisis and pay-to-play politics in Trump era.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - \"A pair of hackers have earned themselves $50,000 for a hack of an iPhone X that allowed them to grab a photo that was supposed to have been deleted from the device,\"Forbes's Thomas Brewster reported. \"Benevolent hackers Richard Zhu and Amat Cama teamed up as Fluoroacetate to come up with an attack on an Apple device running the latest iOS (12.1) that exploited weaknesses in the Safari browser. Apple has now been informed, as per the rules of the Mobile Pwn2Own contest that's wrapping up Wednesday in Tokyo.\"</p><p>             - A group of influential chief information security officers and other cybersecurity leaders are unveiling their plans to bring a new cybersecurity event to Maryland.\u00a0The invite-only Global Cyber Innovation Summit will bring top chief executives, CISOs, researchers as well as policymakers together in Baltimore in May 2019. The event is\u00a0 part of an effort\u00a0to raise the city's profile as an East Coast technology hub.\u00a0</p><p>             Bob Ackerman, an investor in cybersecurity companies and one of the organizers, said the event will be focused on practitioners.\u00a0\"We want to bring that community together to tackle the issues they worry about,\" he said. Large cybersecurity conference like RSA in San Francisco or Black Hat in Las Vegas already attract thousands of attendees and influential cybersecurity leaders. But Ackerman says the summit aims to improve the dialogue around cybersecurity issues at a time when many conferences have become focused on marketing new cybersecurity products.\u00a0Ackerman say he has a rule: no selling. The event will instead focus on meaty topics such as the weaponization of artificial intelligence, he said.\u00a0</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the private sector:          </p><p>             -      Yoshitaka Sakurada, a Japanese minister whose responsibilities include\u00a0overseeing\u00a0 the revision of cybersecurity\u00a0laws before the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, said he doesn't use computers, The Post's Adam Taylor reported.\u00a0\"When asked by independent lawmaker Masato Imai how a man who does not use computers could help implement online security measures, Sakurada said that the cybersecurity initiative is a government-wide project and that he had confidence in it,\" Adam wrote.</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from abroad:          </p><p>             Today          </p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>Pence blasts Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya sitting next to Aung San Suu Kyi:</p><p>CMA Awards honors Thousand Oaks shooting victims:</p><p>Night Sight: How Google's Pixel phone can take pictures in the dark.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-3b5836be13fc4168b5296b6557816379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRF-6H21-DXKP-J00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2243\"/><timeReceived>12:38 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The tech giants are worried that the new law could hamper their operations and herald tougher regulation on the national level in the wake of controversy over how these companies share users' data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Industry groups lobbying for changes\u00a0haven't said specifically what they want to see modified, but they're making clear\u00a0they intend to play a major role in negotiations over the coming months. They\u00a0include the Internet Association -- which represents Google, Amazon and other tech giants, as well as TechNet and the Interactive Advertising Bureau. (Amazon CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p>             \"It is going to take time to fully understand the implications of this bill for California's consumers and economy,\" said Robert Callahan, vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association.\u00a0\"The bill was written in a hurried and ill-considered process, and received very little input from those affected by the legislation.\u00a0             Changes will be necessary as businesses of all types look at implementation.\"          </p><p>The law, signed by the governor late last week, requires tech companies to disclose the type of data they collect on customers and reveal the advertisers and other third parties they share it with. It also gives users the ability to opt out of data collection and empowers the state attorney general to punish companies that don't protect user information.</p><p>Legislators introduced, debated and passed the law in the span of less than a week to head off a ballot initiative that contained even tougher privacy protections, as my colleague Tony Romm has reported. The initiative's main backer agreed to withdraw his proposal if lawmakers passed a compromise bill before a June 28 deadline to get the measure on California's November ballot.</p><p>             Google, Uber and other giants fought to kill Alastair\u00a0Mactaggart's initiative, which drew more than double the signatures needed to be put to a vote, Tony reported. But they ultimately came to accept the compromise legislation - likely because it's easier to change than a ballot initiative, according to Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher and technologist who helped craft the measure .</p><p>\"Part of the calculation by industry was to try to move Mr. Mactaggart off the table to bring this back into a standard legislative lobbying process,\" Soltani told me.</p><p>             \"Moving forward, I think we will make clarifications, but the goals of the bill won't change,\" State Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D), who co-authored the legislation, said in an emailed statement. \"The value of keeping these discussions in the Legislature is that as technology evolves, we will be able to have thoughtful conversations about how to balance innovation with the ability of consumers to control their private information, know if it's being sold, and delete it if necessary.\"</p><p>             The law's January 2020 implementation date gives critics\u00a0ample opportunity to amend it.          </p><p>Google,\u00a0in comments to the Hill newspaper, said that \"we look forward to improvements to address the many unintended consequences of th e law.\" The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a digital advertising trade group whose members include Facebook and Microsoft, said it too was weighing its options. \"This is the broadest, [most] sweeping piece of privacy legislation in the nation now, without question, so we are doing our due diligence as to what it means,\" Brad Weltman, the organization's vice president of public policy, told the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>             The law also has\u00a0detractors on the consumer side. The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California said the law \"fails to provide the privacy protections the public has demanded and deserved\" in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica\u00a0scandal and other high-profile cases of data misuse. \"This measure was hastily drafted and needs to be fixed,\" said\u00a0Nicole Ozer, the group's technology and civil liberties director.</p><p>             Despite those criticisms, the measure is already being held up as a bellwether\u00a0for privacy initiative\u00a0in other states and nationally.\u00a0Soltani\u00a0said that's\u00a0important for Big Tech to keep in mind as they work to influence the final version. \"If the measure is weakened too substantially,\" he said,\u00a0\"the industry risks having an even worse intervention than what's on the table now.\"</p><p>             Programming note: We'll be off tomorrow celebrating July 4th. We hope you are too!\u00a0See you back in your inbox on Thursday.          </p><p>             PINGED: The federal investigation into Facebook and\u00a0Cambridge Analytica is expanding.\u00a0\"Representatives for the FBI, the SEC and the Federal Trade Commission have joined the Department of Justice in its inquiries about the two companies and the sharing of personal information of 71 million Americans, suggesting the wide-ranging nature of the investigation, said five people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a probe that remains incomplete,\" The Washington Post's Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett report. The social network said it is cooperating with investigators, The Post reported.</p><p>People familiar with the probe said investigators are examining the social network's actions in 2015 when it found out that Cambridge Analytica had used information harvested from its users to assemble profiles of voters, my colleagues report. \"The questioning from federal investigators centers on what Facebook knew three years ago and why the company didn't reveal it at the time to its users or investors, as well as any discrepancies in more recent accounts, among other issues, according to these people. The Capitol Hill testimony of Facebook officials, including Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, also is being scrutinized as part of the probe, said people familiar with the federal inquiries ...          </p><p>             Many details about the federal probe remain unknown, including whether investigators are considering criminal charges or civil penalties for the companies involved,\" Timberg, Dwoskin, Zapotosky and Barrett write. \"But investigators seem particularly focused on what data Facebook allowed to be collected from its platform and under what conditions, as well as what Facebook told the public at the time of the data sharing and during recent Congressional hearings, said these people.\"</p><p>             PATCHED: Misinformation is turning deadly in India. \"More than a dozen people have been killed across India since May in violence fueled mainly by messages on the WhatsApp service,\"The Post's Annie Gowen reports. Violence has erupted following fake allegations on the app about child trafficking or organ harvesting, according to Gowen. The size of India's population combined with the fact that new users, especially in rural areas, may be unfamiliar with smartphones underscore the acuteness of the problem, my colleague writes.</p><p>\"As India's government weighs what to do, local authorities have been left to tackle fake news as best they can, issuing warnings and employing low-tech methods such as hiring street performers and 'rumor busters' to visit villages to spread public awareness,\" Gowen reports. \"One such 'rumor buster' was killed by a mob Thursday in the eastern state of Tripura.\"</p><p>Nikhil Pahwa, a technology expert, told Gowen that law enforcement authorities in India - a country with more than 200 million WhatsApp\u00a0users - can't fix this problem alone and the messaging company should do more to tackle the problem. \"The police are always going to be at a loss because the scale of WhatsApp usage is going to be difficult to contend with and they don't have the manpower,\" Pahwa told my colleague. \"The platform itself needs to evolve.\"</p><p>             PWNED: Developers of applications that pair with gmail are probably scanning or maybe even reading your emails, The Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan reports. Data from users' emails represents a wealth of personal and detailed information about consumers that can be used for marketing purposes, according to MacMillan.\u00a0Thede Loder, former chief technology officer at eDataSource Inc., which assists marketers with email campaigns, told the Journal that it is \"common practice\" for emailed-based service companies to allow their staff to read people's emails.\"Data-mining companies commonly use free apps and services to hook users into giving up access to their inboxes without clearly stating what data they collect and what they are doing with it, according to current and former employees of these companies,\"\u00a0MacMillan writes.</p><p>Developers of external apps say that Google, whose Gmail platform is the most widespread email service in the world, does not strictly enforce its own guidelines, according to the Journal. \"Google's developer agreement prohibits exposing a user's private data to anyone else 'without explicit opt-in consent from that user,'\" MacMillan reports. \"Its rules also bar app developers from making permanent copies of user data and storing them in a database.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news:          </p><p>             - Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) on Monday recommended\u00a0that election officials in Florida collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security to strengthen election security across the state and highlighted the risk of foreign interference ahead of the midterm primaries and general elections. Rubio and Nelson\u00a0wrote in a letter that the department provides \"a wide range of services to state and local officials that will support your efforts to make your systems secure.\"</p><p>\"DHS will follow your lead and meet your needs with a tailored set of options,\" Rubio and Nelson wrote. \"We encourage you in the strongest terms to take advantage of those resources, and to let us know about your experience with DHS and FBI.\"</p><p>             - The National Telecommunications and Information Administration cited concerns about national security when it advised on Monday against granting a U.S. license to the company China Mobile, The Post's David J. Lynch reports. \"Granting the authorization poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security and law enforcement,\" the NTIA said, as quoted by Lynch. \"...This assessment rests in large part on China's record of intelligence activities and economic espionage targeting the United States, along with China Mobile's size and technical and financial resources.\"</p><p>             - The California Supreme Court ruled Monday that Yelp.com has no obligation to discard\u00a0comments that a judge in a lower court had said amounted to defamation, the Associated Press's Sudhin Thanawala writes. \"In a 4-3 opinion, justices agreed, saying removal orders such as the one attorney Dawn Hassell obtained against Yelp 'could interfere with and undermine the viability of an online platform,'\" Thanawala reports. \"The decision overturned a lower court ruling that Yelp had said could lead to the removal of negative reviews from the popular website.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Did you block someone on Facebook or Facebook Messenger recently, only to find them showing up again? Facebook says there's an explanation. The social network on Monday announced that a bug between May 29 and June 5 on Facebook and Facebook Messenger\u00a0resulted in some users being \"unblocked.\" Erin Egan, the company's chief privacy officer, said in a statement\u00a0that \"while someone who was unblocked could not see content shared with friends, they could have seen things posted to a wider audience.\" Egan also said the bug extended to more than 800,000 Facebook users and \"83% of people affected by the bug had only one person they had blocked temporarily unblocked.\" Facebook said it has solved the issue and will notify users whose accounts were caught in the glitch.</p><p>             - Some NGOs and United Nations agencies worry about some security provisions of a law in Poland that aims to codify an international climate conference scheduled for December in Katowice, the Intercept's Kate Aronoff reports. \"While the vast majority of the law does little more than establish rules on governing how to host and finance the conference, one statute allows Polish authorities to 'collect, obtain, gather, verify, process and use information, including personal data about persons posing a threat to public safety and order, including outside the borders of the Republic of Poland' if there is a 'justified assumption' they will be staying in Poland,\" Aronoff writes.</p><p>Authorities have defended the security measures contained in the legislation, according to the Intercept. \"The primary responsibility of the country hosting the COP24 Summit is to ensure the safety of its participants,\" a representative from the office of the Polish environment minister told Aronoff in a statement. \"Due to the importance and nature of the meeting, as well as the specific terrorist threat associated with it, it is a major challenge for the services dealing with protecting the security of the state and public order, which the Polish Police is ready to face.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from abroad:          </p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>LeBron James moves to the Lakers:</p><p>Puppies face off in World Cup alternative programming:</p><p>The United States wins a World Cup - in quidditch:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-47a61ea1866148ad9bc002b5216f124e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SPP-8XS1-JB4M-V0FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2298\"/><timeReceived>11:56 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

This time,\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg and his social media giant are facing intense scrutiny from lawmakers\u00a0in Britain who are holding a high-profile hearing Tuesday in a continuing quest to hold the company accountable for\u00a0privacy breaches and dissemination of \"fake news.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The hearing comes on the heels of an unusual seizure of\u00a0 internal Facebook documents last week from an American businessman traveling in London that\u00a0a prominent British lawmaker believes\u00a0will shed light on the company's data practices leading up\u00a0to\u00a0the 2016 election of Donald Trump. The documents are currently under seal in a California court in an unrelated legal battle between a third-party developer and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The British hearing and aggressive document seizure spotlight\u00a0the growing tensions between European regulators and Facebook just as the social media company is facing additional questions in the United States from lawmakers - queries that are only likely to intensify as Democrats retake control of the House in January.</p><p>According to The Guardian, Ted Kramer, who founded\u00a0U.S. software company Six4Three, was\u00a0compelled to \"hand over the documents during a business trip to London. In another exceptional move, parliament sent a serjeant at arms to his hotel with a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with its order. When the software firm founder failed to do so, it's understood he was escorted to parliament. He was told he risked fines and even imprisonment if he didn't hand over the documents.\"</p><p>             British officials think the documents could reveal more about\u00a0Facebook's relationship\u00a0with Cambridge Analytica,\u00a0the now-defunct\u00a0voter profiling firm\u00a0hired by the Trump campaign and other Republicans that\u00a0improperly harvested\u00a0information from Facebook profiles. It was banned in March from Facebook, and rules for using the technology company's platform were tightened in the wake of the controversy (which is why Six4Three is suing Facebook in California).</p><p>Damian Collins, the chair of the committee that will hold tomorrow's hearing, called the seizure \"unprecedented\" but said \"we are in an unprecedented situation.\"</p><p>             There's now a dispute about making the papers public. Regardless, Facebook will face a grilling from Collins's committee and an unusual slew of lawmakers from six\u00a0other countries on Tuesday.\u00a0</p><p>             Collins is upset that Zuckerberg has refused to testify before his committee - instead, it is sending Richard Allan, the company's vice president for public policy solutions.          </p><p>This isn't the first time Zuckerberg has refused to appear before British lawmakers - he declined to do so at the end of October, and again before an expanded committee of international lawmakers in November, The Post's Tony Romm reports.\u00a0U.K. investigators have also fined Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica\u00a0mess, a penalty the company is appealing.</p><p>             European officials have been\u00a0leading the charge to crack down on the use of online information in moves that could be costly to U.S. technology giants\u00a0and pave the way for U.S. action. The European Union implemented a sweeping digital-privacy law in\u00a0May that\u00a0gives users\u00a0the right to demand the deletion of their data and requires companies to get explicit consent from consumers about how their data can be used, among other things.</p><p>The United States\u00a0has lagged behind in privacy efforts, though some states - specifically California - are taking their own action to toughen privacy regulations.</p><p>             The international hearing in British Parliament tomorrow - and the seizure of a U.S.\u00a0company's information - suggests European regulators won't be letting up anytime soon. With a new political order coming soon in Washington, the same could soon be true on home turf for Zuckerberg and other tech titans.          </p><p>             A note to readers: Joe Marks, the new\u00a0anchor of The Cybersecurity 202, will take the helm the first week of December.

Thanks for bearing with us during the transition.          </p><p>             PINGED:\u00a0\"Russian hackers are back in the spotlight after the U.S. midterm elections, carrying out a widespread campaign that targeted the federal government, media outlets and think tanks,\"the Hill's Jacqueline Thomsen and Olivia Beavers reported. \"American officials were on the lookout for Russian interference ahead of and during the Nov. 6 elections, but the detection of activity by a Kremlin-linked hacking group took place just days after the polls closed. Some researchers told The Hill that the recent cyber efforts are a sign that hackers are exploring the new political landscape now that Democrats will be in control of the House starting in January.\" As Thomsen and Beavers reported, U.S. cybersecurity companies\u00a0spotted phishing efforts impersonating a State Department official. Moreover, the cybersecurity firms noted that the phishing campaign resembled previous operations by Russia-linked hackers, according to the Hill.</p><p>             \"Analysts warned against trying to predict the motivations of the Kremlin-linked hackers, saying they don't know the specifics of what's driving the phishing campaigns,\" Thomsen and Beavers wrote. \"Steve Weber, faculty director for the Center for Long Term Cybersecurity at the University of California at Berkeley, said a number of scenarios could be playing out behind the scenes, and it's unclear how exactly the groups are run. Regardless of their orders, he said, the hackers could be showing that they can carry out campaigns at any time for whatever reason, and perhaps even for the sake of showing they still have the capability to launch cyberattacks.\"          </p><p>             PATCHED:\u00a0\"The U.S. government has initiated an extraordinary outreach campaign to foreign allies, trying to persuade wireless and internet providers in these countries to avoid telecommunications equipment from China's Huawei Technologies Co., according to people familiar with the situation,\" the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Stu Woo and Kate O'Keeffe\u00a0reported. \"American officials have briefed their government counterparts and telecom executives in friendly countries where Huawei equipment is already in wide use, including Germany, Italy and Japan, about what they see as cybersecurity risks, these people said. The U.S. is also considering increasing financial aid for telecommunications development in countries that shun Chinese-made equipment, some of these people say.\"</p><p>The Journal reported that briefings from the U.S. government argue that cyberattacks could target\u00a05G networks. \"Today's cellular-tower equipment, for instance, is largely isolated from the 'core' systems that transfer much of a network's voice and data traffic,\" Woo and O'Keeffe wrote. \"But in the 5G networks telecom carriers are preparing to install, cellular-tower hardware will take over some tasks from the core-and that hardware could potentially be used to disrupt the core via cyberattacks. For that reason, U.S. officials worry that Huawei or ZTE cellular-tower equipment could compromise swaths of a telecom network.\" Citing a U.S. official, Woo and O'Keeffe\u00a0also reported that\u00a0the briefings mention\u00a0\"Beijing's ability to force Chinese corporations to comply with government requests from government authorities.\"</p><p>             PWNED: Several European companies seek to challenge Google's dominance over online searches. \"The backlash over Big Tech's collection of personal data offers new hope to a number of little-known search engines that promise to protect user privacy,\"the Associated Press's Kelvin Chan reported. \"Sites like Britain's Mojeek, France's Qwant, Unbubble in Germany and Swisscows don't track user data, filter results or show 'behavioral' ads. These sites are growing amid the rollout of new European privacy regulations and numerous corporate data scandals, which have raised public awareness about the mountains of personal information companies stealthily gather and sell to advertisers.\"</p><p>             European search engines remain far smaller than Google but firms like Qwant and Mojeek are drawing more and more traffic, the AP reported.\u00a0\"Qwant is even getting official support,\" Chan wrote. \"Last month the French army and parliament both said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European 'digital sovereignty.' The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft's Bing.\"</p><p>             - \"Conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi is in plea negotiations with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, according to Corsi and another person with knowledge of the talks,\" The Post's\u00a0Rosalind S. Helderman, Josh Dawsey and Manuel Roig-Franzia\u00a0reported. \"The talks with Corsi - an associate of GOP operative Roger Stone - could bring Mueller's team closer to determining whether Trump or his advisers were linked to WikiLeaks' release of hacked Democratic emails in 2016, a key part of his long-running inquiry. Corsi provided research on Democratic figures during the campaign to Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. For months, the special counsel has been scrutinizing Stone's activities in an effort to determine whether he coordinated with WikiLeaks. Stone and WikiLeaks have repeatedly denied any such coordination.\"</p><p>             - \"A federal judge on Sunday ruled George Papadopoulos must report to prison as scheduled on Monday, rejecting a bid from the former Trump campaign adviser to delay the start of his sentence while a constitutional challenge to the special counsel investigation into Russia's election interference remains unresolved,\"The Post's\u00a0Rosalind S. Helderman and Matt Zapotosky\u00a0reported. \"Papadopoulos, who was sentenced to spend 14 days in prison, had argued it was possible that the constitutional challenge in a separate case would result in his conviction being set aside, and that he should therefore be allowed to remain free on bail. But U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss noted that\u00a0Papadopoulos had not appealed his conviction, having waived his right to do so when he pleaded guilty. Moss also wrote that Papadopoulos had not shown that the appeals court in the separate case probably would conclude the special counsel's appointment was unlawful.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity\u00a0news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0\"Japan's cybersecurity minister, who gained global notoriety last week when he said he doesn't use a computer, has now admitted he's not that familiar with the whole cybersecurity field either,\"The Post's Simon Denyer reported.\u00a0\"Yoshitaka Sakurada, 68, who also serves as minister for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, faced a parliamentary committee Thursday on the country's new cybersecurity law. 'I myself am not that familiar with' cybersecurity matters, he told the committee, according to the Japan Times.

And some fear a secure system may not be built until well after the pandemic has run its course.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have high confidence that we can create a system that would allow for us to debate and vote online in times of emergencies but that's not something we should rush into, and we need to be mindful of security concerns,\" Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, told me. \"This would be a high value target for anyone from nation state actors to rogue hackers to try to disrupt proceedings or to undermine confidence in the system.\"\u00a0          </p><p>Underinvestment in cybersecurity planning has left Congress struggling to complete even basic tasks during a crisis.</p><p>          This makes it harder for lawmakers to act as a check on the White House, which is better equipped to continue working during the pandemic since it can make big decisions with just a few people in a room or by secure line.\u00a0       </p><p>             \"It's as if one of the branches of government has decided to sit on the sidelines, and it's time for them to get back in the game,\" Paul Rosenzweig, a top Department of Homeland Security official during the George W. Bush administration, told me. \"We have three branches of government and we need them to be checks and balances on each other during this time of crisis.\"</p><p>Rosenzweig helped draft a letter signed by two dozen think tanks and advocacy groups urging Congress to include provisions in the next coronavirus stimulus bill\u00a0establishing a system for all House members to vote remotely and boosting congressional technology funding to ensure that system is secure and reliable.\u00a0</p><p>Plans inside Congress have been decidedly low-tech so far.</p><p>House members planning to return to Washington to vote on another coronavirus relief bill could also vote as soon as this week on a plan hatched by House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) that would allow a handful of members in Washington to cast ballots on behalf of colleagues back home.\u00a0</p><p>Some groups of lawmakers, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus, are also experimenting with remote hearings on Facebook, and there's talk of holding some committee meetings via webcast.\u00a0</p><p>But there's little appetite for a large-scale technological fix in the House. One big concern is that less tech-savvy members couldn't manage to use it securely without help from staff.\u00a0</p><p>\"Many members of Congress probably couldn't handle two-step authentication from their laptops,\" a senior House Democratic aide told me. \"We have conference calls where people can't even mute themselves or get off mute. There's a big tech gap that's going to be problematic.\"</p><p>There's also widespread concern that remote voting systems could face legal challenges from people who say it doesn't meet constitutional requirements for what counts as a vote in Congress. These concerns - along with a slew of technical and security hurdles to remote voting - were outlined in a 23-page House Rules Committee report that detailed potential options in March.\u00a0</p><p>             \"If this is challenged in the courts and we've passed 40 laws that have been enacted and the Supreme Court invalidates them all, that's a nightmare,\" the senior aide said.\u00a0</p><p>The Senate has already outright rejected any efforts for remote voting.\u00a0</p><p>That's the verdict from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the Rules Committee's top Democrat, is pushing for a way that the body can vote without members returning to Washington but has been stymied by objections from McConnell, a staffer in her office told me.\u00a0</p><p>Asked about whether such a system could be created securely, a Democratic staffer on the Rules Committee said, \"Cybersecurity is a key consideration with any technology implemented in the Senate.\"\u00a0</p><p>But remote voting advocates say cybersecurity concerns are overblown.</p><p>Making online voting secure for lawmakers is far easier than for the general public, they say, because lawmakers don't remain anonymous when they vote. That means it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a hacker to change a vote without the lawmaker noticing and correcting it.\u00a0</p><p>Congressional lawmakers could simply hold a large video conference and make speeches or vote one by one when their names are called, said Daniel Schuman, policy director for Demand Progress, one of the lead groups advocating for remote voting. That's basically an online version of what they do in Washington.\u00a0</p><p>To be extra secure, lawmakers could also verify their votes are recorded correctly using email, Schuman said.</p><p>He also downplayed concerns about lawmakers not being able to handle the technology.\u00a0</p><p>\"They may not be tech savvy but they're not stupid,\" he said. \"People are managing all sorts of technology solutions and the simple things work best. My 7-year-old can do teleconferencing. It's not that hard.\"</p><p>Schuman's organization also helped organize a mock online hearing at Georgetown University last week to demonstrate how such a hearing would work. It was chaired by former Rep. Brian Baird (D-Wash.) and included testimony from retired Gen. David Petraeus, who described the military's use of teleconferencing, as well as technologists and lawmakers from other nations that have embraced remote work.</p><p>             Other nations' governments are moving far more quickly toward remote meetings.          </p><p>The European Union Parliament is already holding some votes using email during the pandemic. The United Kingdom's Parliament is expected to approve a plan today that would allow up to 120 of its 650 members to participate in some proceedings using the Zoom app and it may extend the system to legislative debates later.\u00a0</p><p>State lawmakers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are also testing remote voting. And even the U.S. Supreme Court plans to hear some arguments by telephone next month.\u00a0</p><p>Langevin said he's confident the pandemic will spur Congress to be better prepared for remote voting before the next crisis - but that's unlikely to happen in the next few months.\u00a0</p><p>\"Necessity is the mother of invention and there's no doubt that creating an e-Congress capability will take on greater urgency after this,\" he said. \"I believe that for any future crisis we will have that capability, but we need to make sure it is secure and well thought out.\"</p><p>             Republicans are ramping up claims that voting by mail will lead to fraud.          </p><p>Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) is joining the chorus of GOP officials claiming voting by mail could lead to fraud - even though his state votes almost entirely by mail. Other states lack Oregon's safeguards and won't be able to put them in place before November, he           told Fox News yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think mandating that every state has to have vote by mail with just a few months before the election is really dangerous, frankly, for the electoral integrity and the outcome of the election,\" Walden said.</p><p>That echoes similar concerns from House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and President Trump who called online voting \"horrible,\" \"corrupt\" and prone to widespread fraud earlier this month.\u00a0</p><p>             But Democrats disagree.\u00a0They're demanding $4 billion and a guaranteed option to vote by mail for all Americans, which they say is vital so people don't have to risk their health to cast ballots. Progressives including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Mark Pocan (Wis.)\u00a0 Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) touted a vote-by-mail requirement as one of their priorities for the next coronavirus stimulus bill during a\u00a0Facebook Live event\u00a0yesterday along with actions to halt layoffs and ensure financial support for lower-income people.</p><p>             States are already moving forward on expanding vote-by-mail. Officials in several states that require an excuse for absentee voting are declaring the pandemic an appropriate excuse for all voters during primary elections, per a\u00a0rundown\u00a0from the Brennan Cyber at New York University.\u00a0</p><p>New York is preparing to announce plans to send mail ballots to all absentee voters, reports Zach Fink at NY1:\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>             The Supreme Court may limit the reach of a controversial decades-old computer fraud law.          </p><p>Justices will hear an appeal this term from a former police officer who was convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for digging through law enforcement records for information that he sold to an acquaintance, Lawrence Hurley at Reuters reports.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             The case will test whether the law can be used to charge people for misusing computer records they rightfully have access to.\u00a0If justices rein in the law, it would be the biggest change in years to the nation's main anti-hacking statute, which cybersecurity experts say is overly broad and out of step with the modern Internet.</p><p>Lawyers for the plaintiff, Nathan Van Buren, say his conviction opens the door for prosecuting anyone who uses a computer in a way their employer doesn't like - even for things as innocuous as using a work computer for a sports betting pool.</p><p>             But the Justice Department is urging the court to leave the law unchanged.

The Board of Elections plans to send mail ballots directly to the city's 500,000 registered voters without making them request the ballots first, a move that some Republicans say invites voter fraud.\u00a0       </p><p>             The divergence is representative of an emerging trend in which state-level Republicans are shrinking back from mail voting after the primaries while Democrats embrace it during the pandemic. It's deepening as President Trump and some Republican allies have savaged mail voting broadly, without evidence, as prone to widespread fraud.\u00a0</p><p>\"These divergent choices illustrate political values that are very much in tension and that have been championed by the two parties,\" Edward Perez, global director of technology development at OSET Institute, a nonprofit election technology organization, told me. \"D.C.'s decision...appears to be motivated by a desire to ensure every voter can vote during the pandemic. Republicans, rightly or wrongly, are concerned about the integrity of the vote.\"\u00a0</p><p>The Republican push against mail voting often isn't coming from election officials.\u00a0</p><p>For example, Iowa's Secretary of State Paul Pate (R) sent absentee ballot request forms to all registered voters before the state's June primary. But the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill blocking him from doing that in the general election. The bill allows Pate's office to send mail ballot request forms only to voters who've already requested the form.\u00a0</p><p>And the Republican-controlled Ohio legislature passed bills shortening the time frame for voters to request mail ballots in the general election and prohibiting Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) from sending voters postage-paid envelopes along with ballot request forms as he'd suggested.\u00a0</p><p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), meanwhile,             ordered counties             to send ballots directly to all registered voters in a model similar to the District's. The move prompted a lawsuit from the Republican National Committee, which charged it \"would create more opportunities for fraud [and] destroy the confidence Californians deserve to have in their elections.\"</p><p>Georgia's turn away from mail voting is primarily about money, Raffensperger said.\u00a0</p><p>The state simply can't afford to send ballot request forms to all of its 6.9 million voters in the general election as it did in the primary, he said -- even though the coronavirus pandemic may make in-person voting just as difficult then.\u00a0</p><p>The announcement drew immediate pushback from critics.</p><p>\"By refusing to send mail-in ballot applications to Georgia voters, he is willfully making voting lines longer,\" said Lauren Groh-Wargo, CEO of Fair Fight Action, a group founded by Democratic politician Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 Georgia governor's race.\u00a0</p><p>Here's the reaction from journalist Ari Berman, author of a history of U.S. voting rights:</p><p>Raffensperger's plan to instead build an online portal for mail ballot requests also sparked concern.\u00a0</p><p>Election security experts say it's generally best to have as little technology involved in the voting process as possible to limit the chances of technical malfunctions or manipulation by hackers. For example, hackers could create major problems by overwhelming the Georgia portal with traffic so residents can't use it during the final days or hours before the deadline to request ballots.\u00a0</p><p>\"You're depending on potentially vulnerable technology that will presumably be managed by a third party and you're still maintaining all the bureaucracy of dealing with ballot applications,\" Perez said.\u00a0</p><p>Raffensperger's mail voting announcement was part of a broader plan to correct problems that bedeviled the primary, including poorly trained poll workers who couldn't operate the state's complex voting machines and electronic poll books.\u00a0</p><p>The plan includes increased state technical support to counties and a legislative proposal that would allow the state to intervene and overhaul operations in counties including Fulton County, which experienced some of the longest voting wait times.\u00a0</p><p>The District's decision comes with concerns, as well.</p><p>          The District's expansion of mail-voting comes after it failed to send absentee ballots in time to several hundred people who requested them. Officials ultimately resorted to driving across town to deliver ballots to some voters, and even launched a plan to allow some residents to cast ballots over email - a system security experts say is far too risky.\u00a0       </p><p>Yet even some Democrats worry that sending ballots directly to registered voters whose addresses haven't been scrupulously verified could create the perception of fraud. \u00a0</p><p>States that have near-universal mail voting such as Washington and Colorado send ballots directly to voters - but they've also spent years ensuring their voter rolls are up to date and accurate. A\u00a0Washington Post analysis\u00a0recently found possible voter fraud cases in those states accounted for just 0.0025 percent of ballots in 2016 and 2018 \u00a0- or about one out of every 39,000.\u00a0</p><p>             Many election security experts, however, say any risks in the process are far outweighed by the benefit of ensuring people can vote without damaging their health during the pandemic. And the main Democratic congressional proposal to expand mail voting would require sending ballots directly to voters.\u00a0</p><p>Georgia and the District are among a number of states and localities attempting to recover from disastrous primaries in time for November.\u00a0</p><p>Los Angeles County, which had one of the highest profile primary-night debacles, released a lengthy assessment of what went wrong, Kim Zetter reports for Politico.\u00a0</p><p>Among the problems:\u00a0</p><p>The report's major takeaway: L.A. County, like many jurisdictions, has a lot of testing and preparation to do in the next few months.\u00a0</p><p>             Our newsletters will be off tomorrow in honor of Juneteenth. Here's an explainer about the significance of the holiday from Karen Attiah, Washington Post Global Opinions editor.          </p><p>             Trump was eyeing reelection in Huawei fight, John Bolton's book claims.          </p><p>          The former national security adviser cites the battle to restrict the Chinese firm from global telecom networks as one of many instances in which the president's true interest was only in securing a second term - in this case by landing a U.S.-China trade deal.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my White House tenure that wasn't driven by reelection calculations,\" Bolton says in an\u00a0                       excerpt from his controversial tell-all                     \"The Room Where it all Happened\" printed by the Wall Street Journal. \u00a0       </p><p>The president offered to reverse\u00a0criminal charges against Huawei and its chief financial officer\u00a0Meng Wanzhou if it would help with a China trade deal\u00a0 - and his reelection, Bolton alleges. He also accuses Trump of reversing penalties against Chinese-owned ZTE in 2018 for the same reason.</p><p>          Bolton's memoir largely supports the outline of Democrats'\u00a0                       impeachment case against Trump                     and confirms that the president was fixated on the conspiracy theory that Ukraine - not Russia - had hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. The book quotes Trump saying\u00a0that \"Ukraine tried to take me down\" and that he was not interested in helping the country with military aid,\u00a0             the Journal's Michael C. Bender and Rebecca Ballhaus report                    .

The Justice Department has lambasted end-to-end encryption as creating a haven for child predators as part of a push for companies to provide backdoor to encrypted communications.       </p><p>          Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said he consulted with child safety experts and civil liberties groups ahead of the decision. The company will require free users to provide personal information including their phone number to verify their identity.       </p><p>          \"We are confident that by implementing risk-based authentication, in combination with our current mix of tools...we can continue to prevent and fight abuse,\" Yuan                        wrote in a blog post                    .       </p><p>Microsoft pitched its facial recognition software to government for years, records show.\u00a0          </p><p>Microsoft tried to sell its technology to the Drug Enforcement Administration just months before company executives called in\u00a0July 2018 for increased regulation of facial recognition tools, emails obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union show.\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>          It's unclear whether the DEA ever purchased the technology, but a partnership would be concerning to privacy advocates.       </p><p>          \"The DEA has a long history of racially disparate or racist practices and has been engaged in wildly inappropriate mass surveillance,\" ACLUMassachusetts Director of the Technology for Liberty Program Kade Crockford                        told BuzzFeed News                    .

(Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)       </p><p>A Justice Department proposal would leverage a key tech industry legal shield in its war against encryption.</p><p>The proposal builds on an executive order Trump issued earlier this month and threatens to erode a long-standing legal shield that protects tech companies from liability for content users post on their sites, Tony Romm reports.\u00a0</p><p>It raises the possibility companies could lose their legal protection if security protections such as encryption hamper law enforcement.\u00a0</p><p>But Congress would need to get behind the proposal, which is a long shot in an election year. Both parties have called in recent months to overhaul the legal shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Democrats tell Tony they're unlikely to line up behind the Justice Department.          </p><p>\"I've certainly been one of Congress's loudest critics of Section 230, but I have no interest in being an agent of Bill Barr's speech police,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. Blumenthal is co-sponsoring a bill that would threaten companies with losing liability protections if they can't slow the spread of child pornography on their sites but it's far narrower and would require separate action by Congress before encryption is directly threatened.\u00a0</p><p>             Barr's proposal could also be an avenue to force social media companies to be more transparent about their content moderation policies amid claims of political bias by conservatives, Tony reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm deeply concerned that President Trump and Attorney General Barr are exploiting Big Tech's complicity in human misery to advance their own political agenda,\" Blumenthal said.\u00a0</p><p>             National Security officials want the FCC to reject a Google-Facebook plan to run an underwater cable between the United States and Hong Kong.          </p><p>          The officials fear the cable will create too many spying opportunities for China,                        Politico's John Hendel and Betsy Woodruff Swan report.</p><p>A malicious Google chrome extension loaded with spyware was downloaded 32 million times.</p><p>\"Based on the number of downloads, it was the most far-reaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date, according to Awake co-founder and chief scientist Gary Golomb,\" Reuters's Joseph Menn reports.\u00a0</p><p>More news about industry and cybersecurity:</p><p>A French data privacy watchdog slammed the privacy of coronavirus surveillance cameras.</p><p>\"Their uncontrolled development poses the risk of generalizing a feeling of surveillance among citizens... which could be detrimental to the proper functioning of our democratic society,\" the agency said, Reuters reports.</p><p>Yet another case of art imitating life from The Huffington Post's Ariel Edwards-Levy:</p><p>And the real plot twist from FiveThirtyEight's Clare Malone:</p><p>More on Bolton (and his trademark mustache) from Stephen Colbert:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-13206ca56a9f442e8c64bbab7ab5fc48</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-3MB1-JB4M-V35F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2295\"/><timeReceived>11:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Elections</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTlGMTIwRjY1ODQ4NDQyRUE1MkJFMUQwMTE1MDhGQjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp;

I'm Cat Zakrzewski, a tech policy reporter at The Washington Post. I'll be at the helm of The Cybersecurity 202 this week. If you can't get enough of Post newsletters, sign up here for my forthcoming newsletter,\u00a0The Technology 202. You won't want to miss our daily analysis on the complex relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, coming to your inbox in December.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             A note to readers this Thanksgiving week:\u00a0Our indefatigable researcher,\u00a0Bastien Inzaurralde, is on vacation. So we'll be bringing you an abbreviated newsletter this week and be fully back up to speed following the holidays.</p><p>             THE KEY          </p><p>Increased scrutiny of\u00a0Facebook's activities after a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0investigation into\u00a0the company's damage-control tactics\u00a0following the 2016 election is expected to spark more calls on Capitol Hill for tighter\u00a0regulation of the tech giant as well as its chief competitors.</p><p>             \"It's important for Facebook to recognize that this isn't a public relations problem - it's a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\" Sen.\u00a0Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee that probed Russian influence in 2016,\u00a0told me in an email.\u00a0\"\u00a0I think it took them too long to realize that. It's clear that Congress can't simply trust [Facebook] to address these issues on their own.\"          </p><p>             Last week, Senate Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar\u00a0(Minn.) responded to the Times piece by sending a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation into potential campaign finance violations by Facebook. Another group of Senate Democrats, also led by Klobuchar, sent a letter to the company, pressing it on the reports.          </p><p>The senators slammed Facebook's relationship with the GOP\u00a0firm Definers Public Affairs, which was exposed by the Times and\u00a0performs opposition research on its clients'\u00a0foes and then deploys the information in much the same way as a political campaign.\u00a0The company severed its ties with\u00a0Definers after the report.</p><p>             \"We are gravely concerned by recent reports indicating that your company used contractors to retaliate against or spread intentionally inflammatory information about your critics,\" the senators wrote in the letter to Facebook.          </p><p>             Things may only get worse for Facebook -- and other tech companies -- when Democrats take control of the House come January.          </p><p>There is growing bipartisan clamor for privacy legislation that would knit together a patchwork of state rules in the wake of new and strict European privacy rules aimed at protecting consumer information known as\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\u00a0Earlier this year, Silicon Valley Rep.\u00a0Ro Khanna\u00a0(D) introduced an \"Internet Bill of Rights,\" which shares some tenets with GDPR.</p><p>So far, Washington has been hesitant to slap major regulations on the tech industry -- and there will be limits on what is likely to get done because Republicans still control the Senate. But the Times report, as well as a slew of not-so-positive press for Facebook especially, is likely to increase calls from lawmakers in both parties to do something to protect consumer privacy and to mitigate the possibility of foreign political interference on their platforms.</p><p>Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said the recent reports about Facebook's political\u00a0tactics and executive turmoil are leading to an \"an inquisition in Washington.\"</p><p>             \"There's a feeding frenzy that's going on,\" he said. \"It just keeps building upon itself.\".</p><p>Atkinson said the question isn't if there will be privacy legislation, it's\u00a0whether legislation will be \"light-touch\" or a \"whole-hog draconian\" bill similar to the rules created by the European Union. Facebook's recent controversies could add pressure for lawmakers to lean in on tougher rules like GDPR.</p><p>             \"This will provide some motivation for comprehensive privacy legislation,\" Atkinson said.          </p><p>Attempts to rein the companies in -- such as political ad transparency\u00a0\u00a0legislation --\u00a0 have so far stalled in Congress. Privacy regulation is expected to be a major priority for the next Congress, and Facebook's bargaining power may be hindered by the damage recent reports have dealt to its reputation in Washington.\u00a0</p><p>             It also remains to be seen whether the big tech companies will work together or against each other in shaping such policy.          </p><p>Already, Apple chief executive Tim Cook has tried to shield his company from concerns about Silicon Valley's growing power by coming out as a strong advocate for privacy legislation. Apple's business model relies more on selling ads and less on customer data, so it can advocate for tougher privacy rules without necessarily hurting its bottom line.\u00a0</p><p>The\u00a0Times reported\u00a0 that\u00a0Cook's attacks on other companies' approach to privacy enraged Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who ordered\u00a0his top lieutenants to instead use Android phones. Facebook later said it does encourage its employees to use Android -- but only\u00a0because it is the most popular operating system in the world.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook itself engaged in finger-pointing tactics, the Times found. When top tech executives appeared before lawmakers in September, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg lobbied for a Google executive of similar stature to testify along with her. When Google failed to provide a senior enough executive,\u00a0          lawmakers left an empty chair for a Google executive           - taking some of the public-relations glare off Facebook in the process.       </p><p>The infighting among companies\u00a0is one of the ways the technology industry significantly diverges from other industries such as pharmaceuticals or the auto industry when it comes to lobbying, Atkinson said. Because the tech companies have such different business models, there is rarely uniformity of views.

The official, Brian Murphy, said...</p><p>with Tonya Riley   A senior Department of Homeland Security official was told to stop providing intelligence assessments on the dangers of Russian interference in the 2020 election, according to a new whistleblower complaint.   The official, Brian Murphy, said that he was twice \u201c told to stand down on reporting about the Russian threat and alleged that senior officials told him to modify other intelligence reports, including about white supremacists, to bring them in line with President Trump\u2019s public comments, directions he said he refused,\u201d reported my colleagues Shane Harris, Nick Miroff and Ellen Nakashima.   Murphy was formerly the head of intelligence and analysis at DHS, which supervises election security in states and cities, but was assigned to a different administration role on July 8. His complaint documents evidence the Trump administration wanted to shift the focus from Russia to China and Iran when it came to worried about foreign interference in the 2020 election.  Murphy claims orders to stand down came from the top.  \u201cOn July 8, Murphy said in the complaint, acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf told him that an \u2018intelligence notification' regarding Russian disinformation efforts should be \u2018held\u2019 because it was unflattering to Trump , who has long derided the Kremlin\u2019s interference as a \u201choax\u201d that was concocted by his opponents to delegitimize his victory in 2016,\u201d my colleagues reported.   \u201c He claimed that in May, Wolf told him to stop producing intelligence assessments on Russia and shift the focus on election interference to China and Iran. He said Wolf told him \u201cthat these instructions specifically originated from White House National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien.\u201d   Murphy also says he made \u201ctwo classified disclosures\u201d to the department's No. 2 official, Ken Cuccinelli related to \u201cabuse of authority, willfully withholding intelligence information from Congress, and the improper administration of an intelligence program.\u201d   DHS vigorously denied Murphy's charges.   \u201cWe flatly deny that there is any truth to the merits of Mr. Murphy\u2019s claim,\u201d said Alexei Woltornist, a DHS spokesman, according to Shane, Nick and Ellen.  There have already been reports Russia is, again, attempting to spread disinformation about the 2020 election.  Facebook and Twitter have already identified attempts by the Kremlin troll farm that used their platforms to boost Trump in 2016, the Internet Research Agency, to reprise their meddling in 2020 on smaller scale. The IRA used a network of fake accounts and launched a fake left-wing news site called Peace Data using American writers.   Meanwhile, senior intelligence leaders recently said they will no longer brief members of Congress about potential threats to the election in person but instead in writing because of fears their information will leak.   \u201cThe move follows a public statement earlier this month by William Evanina, the top counterintelligence official who had been leading the in-person briefings, that Russia is \u2018 using a range of measures\u2019 to interfere in the 2020 election and has enlisted a pro-Russian lawmaker from Ukraine \u2014 who has met with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer \u2014 to damage Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy and the Democratic Party,\u201d Ellen reported.   Dan Coats, the former head of the intelligence community under Trump, yesterday criticized the suspension of in-person briefings.   \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that the intelligence community keep Congress fully informed about the threats to our elections and share as much information as possible while protecting sources and methods,\u201d the former director of national intelligence told Ellen in an interview.   \u201cWe must stand united in defending the election security process from being corrupted and ensure that a vote cast is a vote counted,\" he added.  The DHS whistleblower complaint also alleges political considerations affected other areas besides election security.  Murphy \u201cclaims that Wolf and [Cuccinelli] \u2026 on various occasions instructed him to massage the language in intelligence reports \u2018to ensure they matched up with the public comments by Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and \u2018anarchist\u2019 groups,\u2019 according to the complaint,\u201d my colleagues report.   One of Trump's main campaign themes is the behavior of left-wing groups in Democratic-controlled cities protesting following the shooting by police of Black people.   Murphy played a controversial role in one such protests after reports he collected information about journalist tweets about the situation in Portland. Some people told my colleagues that while his complaints about political interference in intelligence assessments may hit the mark, Murphy was the wrong person to make them.   The whistleblower \u201ccomplaint prompted mixed reactions among former senior administration officials, who said he had valid and significant concerns but described him as a flawed messenger. According to three former senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid, Murphy was a poor manager and the source of low morale in his office,\u201d Shane, Nick and Elllen reported.   Joe Marks will be back on Sept. 21. We have a slate of excellent guest hosts to keep you informed in the interim.  A new book on Trump by Bob Woodward claims to have new details on Russian election interference efforts in 2016.  Woodward says although there was no evidence the malware that infected the systems was used, it was capable of erasing votes.   The details have not been confirmed by federal authorities.   The breach of election infrastructure in some Florida counties in 2016 was outlined in a  by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The FBI  members of Congress from Florida after the report, but the names of the counties and details remained classified. Officials confirmed one of the counties as Washington County, .   \u201cThese reports continue to demonstrate just how much voters are unwisely kept in the dark by our government about election meddling and how this confusion only serves to destabilize trust in our democracy,\u201d Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) said in response to Woodward \u2019 s reporting.    Cybersecurity experts sounded off about the allegations in the new book. FireEye \u2019 s John Hultquist.   Cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter:  Industry report Former NSA chief Keith Alexander is joining Amazon\u2019s board.  Alexander, the co-chief executive of IronNet Cyberecurity, also served as commander of the U.S. Cyber Command. He will serve on a four-member audit committee.   Alexander was involved in the NSA \u2019 s broad data collection program revealed in the Edward Snowden leaks, Devin Coldewey at TechCrunch reports . The Snowden leaks led to a change in the way tech companies addressed transparency and user privacy policies.   (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   Alexander also brings defense contracting experience as the tech giant continues to challenge a Pentagon decision to award Microsoft a lucrative cloud-computing contract. The company alleges that President Trump \u2019 s animosity toward Amazon influenced the decision. (Amazon told TechCrunch it will continue to follow rules for conflicts of interest in government contracts.)   The U.S. Secret Service announced its inaugural U.S. Cyber Investigations Advisory Board    The 16-member board is comprised of senior executives and experts from industry, government and academia and works with the Secret Service to provide cybersecurity expertise. Inaugural members include Tom Kellerman, VMWare Carbon Black Head of Cybersecurity Strategy,   Global cyberspace China\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom is demanding that Twitter investigate an alleged hack.   Ambassador Liu Xiaoming claimed his account was compromised, resulting in \u201clikes\u201d of pornographic material and tweets criticizing China \u2019 s treatment of Uighur Muslims, Jeff Stone at CyberScoop reports . \u201cThe Embassy has reported this to Twitter company and urged the latter to make thorough investigations and handle this matter seriously,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Embassy reserves the right to take further actions and hope that the public will not believe or spread such rumor.\u201d    More international news:  Privacy patch Ireland has issued a preliminary order requiring Facebook to stop sending user data to the United States.   It \u2019 s the first major step by European Union regulators to enforce a July ruling restricting how tech companies can transfer the personal information of Europeans to America, Sam Schechner and Emily Glazer at the Wall Street Journal report . The ruling could require Facebook to overhaul its data collection service or potentially halt service entirely to E.U. consumers.    The order against Facebook could set a significant precedent for the numerous other big tech companies that operate in the bloc, including Google and Apple. Failure by Facebook to comply with the order would result in a fine of up to 4 percent of its annual revenue \u2014 or nearly $3 billion.   Facebook slammed the move as potentially devastating to the global economy.   \u201cA lack of safe, secure and legal international data transfers would damage the economy and prevent the emergence of data-driven businesses from the EU, just as we seek a recovery from Covid-19,\u201d said Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s top policy and communications executive. He confirmed that the order comes as part of a larger inquiry.   At the center of the conflict are E.U. lawmaker concerns over U.S. surveillance laws and lack of strong privacy protections. The E.U. and U.S. officials started negotiations this summer to iron out a new data-sharing agreement.

Facebook (and its tech friends) should prepare for more pressure. Tuesday began with a rare, joint hearing featuring nine countries, which grilled Facebook over its efforts to thwart the spread of falsehoods online. But the day-long affair, held in the United Kingdom, won't mark the end of heightened scrutiny for Facebook or its tech peers. Hours later, world legislators\u00a0signed a\u00a0\"Principles of the Law Governing the Internet\" - a sign of further hearings, and new regulations, perhaps to come outside\u00a0the United States.</p><p>Without mentioning companies, the document sought to adopt a tough tone on tech giants including Facebook, Google and Twitter. It stressed \"it is an urgent and critical priority for legislatures and governments to ensure that the fundamental rights and safeguards of their citizens are not violated or undermined by the unchecked march of technology,\" listing\u00a0ills they hope to address - from disinformation in civic discourse to online privacy.</p><p>The new statement stipulated that social media companies \"should be held liable\" if they fail to comply with orders to take down \"harmful or misleading content,\" and that they \"should be regulated to ensure they comply with this requirement.\" And it said that tech giants should make \"themselves fully answerable to national legislatures and other organs of representative democracy.\" The call follows a decision by Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to decline to testify despite the international policymakers' repeated entreaties.</p><p>Some experts, however, said they had more questions than answers after reading it. Daniel Castro, vice president of the tech-backed Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, sketched out a few: \"What are they going to actually achieve with this? Most of these principles aren't objectionable overall, but how do you implement them? Are particular governments going to say what Facebook can and can't [allow people to post] on these platforms?\"\u00a0</p><p>On top of that, Castro said there are broad implications for free speech and free trade. \"It's not clear the cure is better than the disease in this case.\"</p><p>             2. Facebook's no-good, very bad week could get worse. For the embattled social media company, the next few days could prove especially brutal. That's because U.K. legislators said Tuesday they plan to release a tranche of documents that could raise new questions about Facebook's privacy and security practices - including a potential, previously unreported 2014 incident involving Russia.</p><p>The brewing controversy centers on a legal dispute between Facebook and a third-party app maker called Six4Three. The developer has sued Facebook on grounds that earlier changes to the social network's privacy practices - restricting the data that apps could tap in 2015 - essentially forced it to shut down its app that allowed users to surface photos of their friends wearing bikinis. Six4Three obtained key Facebook documents, including the tech giant's internal communications, but a California judge placed them under seal. U.K. lawmakers, however, seized them from Six4Three after its founder stepped foot in the country. Damian Collins, the leader of the U.K. parliamentary committee, said Tuesday that lawmakers planned to release the documents \"within the next week or so.\" (H/T The Post's Karla Adam, who attended the news conference.)</p><p>One tidbit is out: Collins teased an internal communication from 2014 in which a Facebook employee took note of suspicious activity\u00a0seeming to\u00a0emanate from Russia. Collins said the note showed that bad actors may have tried to use special code to pull billions of data points from Facebook. A spokesman for Collins did not elaborate on the matter. Facebook initially said the documents were misleading - and later stressed in a statement that it found \"no evidence of specific Russian activity\" at the time. By late Tuesday, the company shared with reporters some of the emails in question, which appear to reflect that bad actors with Russian ties\u00a0had not been the culprit.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's an enormous public interest in the disclosure of these documents,\" Collins said.</p><p>             3. In the United States, meanwhile, there's a desire for a bigger, bolder watchdog. Facebook's chief U.S. regulator found itself in the congressional hot seat on Tuesday. And there emerged broad, bipartisan agreement among members of a key panel under the Senate Commerce Committee that the Federal Trade Commission simply lacks the tools it needs to keep watch over tech giants.</p><p>The FTC is an approximately century-old agency with more than 1,100 employees, a far cry from the multibillion-dollar tech behemoths that it regulates, as I reported earlier this year. To some experts, that's a problem as the FTC proceeds with its still-incomplete investigation of Facebook for its recent privacy mishaps.</p><p>On Tuesday, though, Senate Democrats and Republicans expressed similar sentiments. Outgoing Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) opened the hearing with a call to action: \"It is my hope that Congress will finally step up to the plate and do the right thing by providing the FTC with increased funding and personnel to police the marketplace and protect American consumers from the myriad of scams, frauds and corporate practices that fleece them of their hard-earned money,\" he said. The subcommittee's chairman, Republican Sen. Jerry Moran (Kan.), also expressed an openness to helping out the FTC.</p><p>And leaders at the FTC said they'd welcome the help. \"There is more and more data collection, and the largest firms in the economy are trying to monetize that data,\" said Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra. \"If that is going to grow, then the FTC's resources have to grow commensurately.\"</p><p>             4. Big tech hearings are not over for this year.\u00a0\u00a0Google chief executive Sundar Pichai is set to testify in a scheduled\u00a0Dec. 5 before the House Judiciary Committee, as I reported late last night. From my story: The company will \"[face] off against lawmakers for the first time at a hearing that could subject the search giant to the same harsh political spotlight that has faced its tech peers all year....Led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), GOP lawmakers long have blasted Google for allegedly\u00a0silencing right-leaning news, views and users, and President Trump similarly has claimed the company promotes negative stories about his administration. Neither has provided significant evidence that Google is biased, however, and Google has vehemently denied the accusations. 'There's a lot of interest in their algorithm, how those algorithms work, how those algorithms are supervised,'\u00a0Goodlatte, the outgoing chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said\u00a0during an interview at the time.\"</p><p>             Sign Up!

'They will,' Daniel told BuzzFeed News. 'I'm shocked they haven't already. It's the logical thing to do, right?' \"</p><p>Moreover, it's unclear what would happen if a foreign adversary decided to unmask U.S. hackers. \"There doesn't appear to be a single, overarching plan for what to do in such a scenario,\" Collier wrote. \"Variables like where the US hacker works, which country outs them, and the way they do so would all likely influence the response. 'We do need to get prepared,' Daniel said. 'I'm sure at least on some level it would involve the Justice Department, the State Department, and some form of the employee's home agency. Beyond that, I don't think anybody's gone far enough down that road to actually tell you.' \"</p><p>             PATCHED:\u00a0\"U.S. prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York filed a 13-count cybercrime indictment Tuesday against the suspected orchestrators of a scheme to defraud internet advertisers out of tens of millions of dollars,\"CyberScoop's\u00a0Jeff Stone reported. \"The indictment accuses the eight defendants, who hail from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, with criminal violations including wire fraud, computer intrusion, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. The list includes Aleksander Zhukov, one of the Department of Justice's recent high-profile cybercrime arrests.\"</p><p>             One scheme relied on servers in data centers while a second operation used a global botnet controlling more than 1.7 million computers, according to a news release from the\u00a0U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York. \"As alleged in court filings, the defendants in this case used sophisticated computer programming and infrastructure around the world to exploit the digital advertising industry through fraud,\"\u00a0U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue\u00a0said in a statement. The botnet scheme also involved \"an array of servers that could generate mountains of fake traffic with bots, roughly 5,000 counterfeit websites created to impersonate legitimate web publishers, and over 60,000 accounts with digital advertising companies to help fraudsters receive ad placements and get paid,\" according to BuzzFeed News's\u00a0Craig Silverman.</p><p>             PWNED:\u00a0Discontent continues to brew among Google employees over the company's Dragonfly project. More than\u00a0300 Google employees\u00a0\"joined a petition protesting the company's plans to build a search engine that complies with China's online censorship regime,\"The Washington Post's Hamza Shaban reported. \"An employee-led backlash against the project has been churning for months at the company, but Tuesday's petition marks the first time workers at Google have used their names in a public document objecting to the plans.\" The employees expressed their opposition to the project as Amnesty International launched a \"day of action\" to call on\u00a0Pichai to drop the endeavor.</p><p>             \"Our opposition to Dragonfly is not about China: we object to technologies that aid the powerful in oppressing the vulnerable, wherever they may be,\" the Google employees said in a post published on Medium. \"The Chinese government certainly isn't alone in its readiness to stifle freedom of expression, and to use surveillance to repress dissent. Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions.\" Hamza also reported that opponents to the project \"question Google's corporate values and have raised concerns about the consequences of tech companies cooperating with authoritarian governments.\"          </p><p>             - \"Conservative author Jerome Corsi alerted longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone in early August 2016 that WikiLeaks planned to release material damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, including documents related to her campaign chairman John Podesta, according to a draft court filing,\" The Washington Post's\u00a0Carol D. Leonnig, Rosalind S. Helderman and Manuel Roig-Franzia reported.\u00a0\"Corsi emailed Stone about WikiLeaks's plans nearly 10 weeks before the group published Podesta's hacked emails in October, according to the document, which was prepared by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team as part of plea negotiations with Corsi that have collapsed.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0\"The charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will remain sealed for now, with a federal judge in Alexandria saying she would hear more before ruling on whether the public has a right to see the documents,\"The Post's\u00a0Rachel Weiner reported. \"'This is an interesting case, to say the least,' Judge Leonie M. Brinkema said Tuesday. 'Obviously, some kind of mistake has been made.' That mistake by the government, she noted, exposed Assange's name and 'the fact that he has been charged' in a filing for an unrelated case.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0\"Officials in Valdez, Alaska, admitted earlier this month that they paid off hackers to regain access to municipal computer systems that were crippled in July by a ransomware attack,\"StateScoop's Benjamin Freed reported. \"The city of just 4,000 gave its attackers four bitcoins, worth $26,624 at the time of the payment, in exchange for a decryption key that unlocked its systems that had been affected by the cyberattack.

But the tech executives weren't the only ones who came prepared for class on Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Senators on the Intelligence Committee clearly did their homework on a wide range of technical topics, and they peppered the executives with questions on issues ranging from doctored videos known as \"deepfakes\" to encryption.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The grilling marked a stark departure from hearings earlier this year with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, when senators on the Judiciary and Commerce committees were panned for their technical illiteracy.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Continued foreign interference on the platforms has ratcheted up pressure on lawmakers to better assess not only how these platforms were exploited ahead of the 2016 election, but also what threats could emerge next.          </p><p>             And it's evident they are putting in the work: Over the last year, Intelligence Committee senators have been working with advisers to better understand the rise of disinformation on social networks. They've met with tech executives behind closed doors and in open hearings, as well as third-party experts such as Renee DiResta, director of research for social media threat detection company New Knowledge.</p><p>DiResta has been battling disinformation campaigns online for years -- and she has been helping lawmakers from both parties understand technical topics and develop questions ahead of hearings for the last year.\u00a0\"They've worked with external experts as advisers throughout that time, reaching out to make sure they fully understand all of the technical facets of the problems as they come up,\" she said.</p><p>After working with the committee behind-the-scenes, she publicly testified in August - and told me she was pleased to see the questions she got back were \"similarly high caliber to what we heard\" on Wednesday.</p><p>             The senators' display of technical knowledge also comes as they grapple with potential next steps to rein in big tech.          </p><p>Even as lawmakers and technology executives struck a conciliatory tone during Wednesday's hearing - stressing the importance of cooperation between government and the companies - they are also considering legislative action. Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) laid out some options in his opening remarks, including regulation of the social media platforms and legislation that facilitates information sharing on cyberthreats between companies and the government.</p><p>\"There are no unsolvable problems,\" he said.</p><p>The top Democrat on the committee, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, set the tone at Wednesday's hearing in his opening remarks, warning that the threats to discourse, privacy and democracy will only intensify with new advances in technology and artificial intelligence. Warner\u00a0cautioned deepfakes, or doctored videos, could amplify the fake news dilemma the technology giants are grappling with today.</p><p>\"We're on the cusp of a new generation of exploitation and, potentially harnessing hacked personal information to enable tailored and targeted disinformation and social engineering efforts,\" he said. \"That should frighten us all.\"</p><p>Warner and Florida Republican Marco Rubio began ringing the alarm about deepfakes earlier this year. Warner floated the idea of holding the companies liable for failing to take them down in a policy paper, and Rubio called them a national security threat in a speech.</p><p>Maine Sen. Angus King pressed on deepfakes later in the hearing, asking Sandberg if Facebook could tag videos that have been manipulated and warn consumers that they may be misleading.\u00a0\"Deepfakes is a new area, and we know people are going to continue to find new ones,\" Sandberg said. \"As always, we're going to do a combination of investing in technology and investing in people so that people can see the most authentic information on our service.\"</p><p>             Deepfakes were just one of many emerging technologies discussed as lawmakers attempted to address concerns ranging from election interference to censorship in a hearing that highlighted the complicated relationship that exists between Silicon Valley and Washington. As the technology companies continue to grow, they are increasingly treading into the crosshairs of regulators. As Wednesday's hearing was wrapping up, the Justice Department warned that leading technology companies may be \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas\" and hurting competition. And lawmakers' interest is unlikely to wane: Less than two hours after the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing finished,\u00a0 Dorsey was testifying again in front of the House Energy and Commerce. \u00a0</p><p>Though senators were intent on determining whether the social networks have taken adequate steps to address election security, past points of contention between Silicon Valley and the government reemerged during the hearing. As law enforcement leaders warn that the spread of encryption is hindering critical investigations, Sandberg made a point to stress Facebook's commitment to consumer security and privacy. \"We are strong believers in encryption,\" Sandberg said. \"Encryption helps keep people safe, it's what secures our banking system, it's what secures the security of private messages, and consumers rely on it and depend on it.\"</p><p>             There was one thing both lawmakers and executives seemed to agree on: That private-public cooperation was necessary to address disinformation at the hands of foreign adversaries.\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p>And it's clear lawmakers expect the companies to engage. Google drew bipartisan criticism for not sending an executive that lawmakers deemed senior enough to testify at the hearing. Lawmakers\u00a0left an empty chair for Google next to the other witnesses to draw attention to the company's absence.       </p><p>          Rubio lashed out at the company for not sending an executive.\u00a0\"Maybe it's cause they're arrogant,\" he said.</p><p>             PINGED: \"Cyberweapons and sophisticated hacking pose a greater threat to the United States than the risk of physical attacks, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Wednesday while urging state election officials to add more safeguards to their voting systems,\"The Washington Post's Nick Miroff reported.\u00a0\"In a speech timed to next week's anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and amid worries about interference in coming U.S. elections, Nielsen said the Department of Homeland Security is facing down an array of cyberthreats from hostile foreign governments, extremist groups and transnational criminals.\"</p><p>In her speech\u00a0at George Washington University, Nielsen called election security\u00a0\"one of my highest and continuous\u00a0priorities\" and said states should include paper trails and audits in their election systems. \"Today I am calling on every state in the Union to ensure that by the 2020 election, they have redundant, auditable election systems,\" she said. \"The best way to do that is with a physical paper trail and effective audits so that Americans everywhere can be assured that\u00a0-\u00a0no matter what\u00a0-\u00a0their vote is counted, and it is counted correctly.\"\u00a0The Trump administration also intends to \"hold cyberattackers accountable,\" according to Nielsen. \"We will no longer naively assume that a nation state with cyber capabilities chooses not to use them.\u00a0We will no longer tolerate the theft of our data.\u00a0 We will no longer stand idly by as our networks are penetrated, exploited, or held hostage,\" Nielsen said. \"Instead, we will respond,\u00a0and we will respond decisively.\"</p><p>Nielsen also delivered a message for Congress.\u00a0\"'Threats to the U.S. from foreign adversaries are at the highest levels since the Cold War,' she said, calling on lawmakers to elevate Homeland Security's cybersecurity division - the National Protection and Programs Directorate - to a 'full-fledged operational agency,' on par with other major DHS agencies such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the Transportation Security Administration,\" Nick wrote.</p><p>             PATCHED: Cybersecurity\u00a0deserves its own federal agency as DHS already has a lot on its plate, according to former CIA director David H. Petraeus and\u00a0Kiran Sridhar, a Stanford University student. \"We need to acknowledge that cyberthreats have reached a new level, and that they need to be addressed in a new way,\" Petraeus, a retired Army general, and Sridhar\u00a0wrote in Politico on Wednesday. \"The time has come to establish an independent National Cybersecurity Agency to take the lead in protecting our critical infrastructure.\" Creating a single agency would allow the federal government to\u00a0tackle cybersecurity issues in a more effective way, the authors argued.</p><p>             \"A standalone agency would be much more focused, capable and empowered than the current grab bag of governmental initiatives,\"\u00a0Petraeus and Sridhar\u00a0said. \"As the head of an independent agency, the director would report directly to the president and have the ears of members of Congress to get much needed legislation. The prestige of a new agency and the cultural shift it would drive would also allow it and, hopefully, the rest of government to build the public-sector talent base we need.\"</p><p>Such an agency would also allow the executive branch of the federal government to speak in one voice in its interactions with lawmakers.\u00a0\"An NCA likely would find a receptive audience among Washington policymakers: Members of both parties agree that the government needs to do more to shore up cyber defenses, but without a coordinating agency, it's hard for them to know how to help,\" according to Petraeus and\u00a0Sridhar.          </p><p>             PWNED: The House on Wednesday passed a bill introduced by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) that aims to deter cyberattacks sponsored by foreign states. Under the bill, titled\u00a0Cyber Deterrence and\u00a0Response Act of 2018, the federal government may label as \"critical cyber threat actor\" people or organizations that carry out state-sponsored cyberattacks against the United States. The bill also lists several punitive measures - such as financial and travel sanctions\u00a0-\u00a0that federal authorities may enact in response to cyberattacks.</p><p>In a statement\u00a0issued after the bill's passage, Yoho\u00a0mentioned China, North Korea, Iran and Russia as examples of foreign states\u00a0that direct cyberattacks \"on a daily basis\" against the United States. \"The Cyber Deterrence and Response Act will bring these aggressors out of the shadows and create a framework that deters and provides the proper response for their actions,\" Yoho said. \"It is vital that when these attacks happen, they are exposed and punished quickly and accordingly. I encourage the Senate to pass their companion bill and send this legislation to the President to be signed into law.\"</p><p>             - Rep. Justin Amash\u00a0(R-Mich.) on Wednesday criticized the Trump administration after the U.S. government issued a statement alongside Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand last week calling on tech companies to allow back-door access to their products so that public authorities may access encrypted data.\u00a0\"By demanding backdoors to encrypted data, the Trump administration is putting everyone's security and privacy at risk,\" Amash said in a tweet. \"The government should be encouraging the use of strong encryption instead of fighting to weaken it.\" (The Cybersecurity\u00a0202\u00a0 yesterday analyzed the statement issued last week by the Five Eyes countries.)</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Here's more bad news for Facebook, this time from a Pew Research Center survey.\u00a0\"Nearly three-quarters of American Facebook users have changed how they use the social media app in the past year, following a barrage of scandals involving the abuse of personal data, foreign interference in U.S. elections and the spread of hateful or harassing content on the platform,\" The Post's Hamza Shaban reported on Wednesday.

The Justice Department gave a big hint Thursday when it coordinated with allies to condemn a Chinese government-backed hacking group that\u00a0targeted a global collection of government agencies and companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Condemnations, so far, have come from the U.K., Canada, Australia,\u00a0New Zealand\u00a0and Japan, and more are expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the United States, the tough words were accompanied by indictments against the hackers Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, who Justice Department officials said were part of a Chinese Ministry of State Security-backed hacking group commonly known as \"Advanced Persistent Threat 10\" or \"Stone Panda,\" as my colleagues Ellen Nakashima and David J. Lynch reported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The joint condemnations mark a watershed in U.S.-led efforts to impose rules of the road on the once-lawless realm of cyberspace, experts and former government officials said. They\u00a0also demonstrate\u00a0that the Trump administration has reached a very un-Trumpian conclusion: When it comes to cybersecurity, the United States\u00a0can't simply go it alone.          </p><p>The U.S. strategy of seeking cooperation\u00a0with allies on naming and shaming nations that behave badly in cyberspace dates to roughly 2014, John Carlin, a former assistant attorney general for national security during the Obama administration, told me.</p><p>The United States and its allies have cooperated on numerous naming and shaming campaigns this year. That includes the U.S. and U.K.\u00a0attributing the 2017 NotPetya ransomware campaign to Russia, the U.S., U.K. and Dutch governments condemning Russian cyberattacks against chemical weapons monitors,\u00a0Olympic athletes and anti-doping organizations, and the U.S. and U.K.\u00a0fingering North Korea for the WannaCry malware campaign.</p><p>             Those attributions were relatively painless, however, compared to the possible consequences of publicly accusing China of massive corporate espionage and intellectual property theft.          </p><p>\"The rogue activities of Russia and North Korea are so provocative and the trade relationships are not so valuable, so there's a willingness to call them out,\" Carlin told me.</p><p>\"But other countries are more cautious when it comes to China,\" he said. Those countries \"clearly hit a threshold saying: 'Enough is enough. Even though we want to do business with you, if you keep doing economic espionage at this scale there are going to be consequences.'\"</p><p>The United States\u00a0and its allies are likely to push for more joint cybersecurity\u00a0attributions against China and other nations in 2019, Carlin told me. The more important question, he said, will be whether the United States\u00a0and allies can agree not just to name and shame Chinese hackers in 2019 but to actually impose consequences, such as levying harsh sanctions on Chinese companies.          </p><p>\"For China, when it comes to economic espionage, it's purely a cost-benefit analysis,\" Carlin said. \"If you keep raising the costs, the rational decision on their part will be that it's better to invest in research and development than in cyber-enabled espionage.\"</p><p>Here are three other big cybersecurity stories you should be watching\u00a0in 2019.</p><p>             Sitting down at the negotiating table          </p><p>Speaking of international cooperation, 2019 will also produce two parallel U.N.\u00a0groups focused on setting international rules of the road in cyberspace -\u00a0one sponsored by the U.S.\u00a0and the U.K.\u00a0among 30-some other nations and the other sponsored by Russia, China and North Korea among 20-some others.</p><p>It's unlikely those groups will reach a grand bargain on the major issues bedeviling international cybersecurity, but the fact the United States\u00a0and Russia are both still pushing for dialogue suggests there remains a chance for common ground.</p><p>In previous U.N.-led dialogues, the United States, Russia and other nations agreed to the broad contours of how international law should apply in cyberspace and endorsed norms of behavior, including that nations shouldn't hack each other's cyber emergency response units and shouldn't intentionally destroy each other's critical infrastructure. A 2017 round of meetings, however, ended in acrimony and with no additional agreements.</p><p>The 2019 dialogues should focus less on agreeing to new global cybersecurity norms and more on how to enforce the ones nations have already agreed to, Chris Painter, a former State Department cyber coordinator, told me</p><p>\"If you constantly violate those norms and there are no consequences, those violations emphasize that the norms are not valuable,\" Painter told me. \"We have been bad at doing that next step of imposing costs on these bad actors.\"</p><p>             Election security: Round 2          </p><p>Bipartisan support in the Senate, a Russian hacking and disinformation campaign that upended the 2016 election, and the threat of more hacking in 2018 weren't enough to get an election security bill over the finish line this Congress.</p><p>With 2020 coming up and a new Democratic majority in the House, however, the chances for a successful election security bill in 2019 are much stronger, Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) told me.</p><p>The most important element of that bill should be a new infusion of cash for states and localities to upgrade their election systems and invest in cyber testing, said Langevin, who co-founded the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus. It should also include minimum cybersecurity requirements that states must meet, he said, including an auditable paper trail for votes.</p><p>Congress did approve $380 million in new election security funds for states in 2018, but top Homeland Security officials have said that wouldn't cover all the necessary upgrades.</p><p>The federal government, which assisted states and localities with election security in 2018, must also continue to help out with cyber audits and training in 2019, Michael Daniel, who was a\u00a0White House cybersecurity coordinator during the Obama administration, told me.</p><p>\"You want to maintain state and local control over elections because that's an important part of the federalist structure,\" said Daniel, who now runs the Cyber Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity information sharing group. \"But you need to enable the federal government to assist states and localities because expecting them to go up against a nation state by themselves is just silly.\"</p><p>             New attacks in 2019?          </p><p>The coming year might also see new and more dangerous digital attacks, experts warned.</p><p>Suzanne Spaulding, a former top DHS cybersecurity official, pointed to 2018 reports that Russia hacked into a Ukrainian chlorine plant using a malware called VPNFilter. That malware is focused on stealing data but can also destroy computer systems -\u00a0which would be particularly dangerous in a plant that processes toxic chemicals.</p><p>A hacking group has also recently used Shamoon, another destructive malware, to attack computers across the Arabian Peninsula, according to cybersecurity firms.</p><p>If Russia or another nation used a destructive cyberattack to intentionally leak hazardous materials capable of killing people, that would cross a new and dangerous line, Spaulding told me.</p><p>While Russia and other major cyber powers may not be brash enough to launch a deadly attack on the U.S. electric grid or another piece of critical infrastructure in 2019, a nation might demonstrate that it's capable of doing so to send a message, Spaulding said.</p><p>\"Some adversary will get in and they will do something to let us know that they've gotten in as a deterrent,\" she said. \"They won't bring down the electric grid, but they might make it blink. It will be ambiguous enough to give plausible deniability, but it will say: You are, at least, vulnerable, so don't interfere with what we want to do.\"</p><p>             Runner-up:          </p><p>Will a strong new California privacy law and bad behavior by big tech companies finally push congressional action on privacy in 2019? Will it compel regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to go after more companies for privacy violations?</p><p>             That's it for 2018.

Prosecutors said\u00a0Zhu and\u00a0Zhang took part in two hacking campaigns. The first,\u00a0which began around 2006,\u00a0involved cybertheft of technology from U.S.\u00a0government agencies and companies, according to the indictment. Hackers stole \"hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data\" and targeted businesses in sectors such as aviation, satellites, pharmaceuticals, energy and communications. They also infiltrated the computers of more than 45 organizations in at least 12 states including California, New York and Texas.</p><p>             In the second,\u00a0Chinese hackers penetrated the networks of\u00a0\"managed service providers,\" which handle the IT infrastructure of other businesses in an attempt to access the networks of their clients. That way,\u00a0Chinese operatives were able to steal sensitive\u00a0data from companies in at least 12 countries, according to the indictment. Their targets included\u00a0financial businesses, telecoms, manufacturers, energy companies and others. Moreover, prosecutors said\u00a0that the\u00a0APT10 group stole information about more than 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel after compromising more than 40 computers.          </p><p>             PATCHED: Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein\u00a0said China is failing to uphold a\u00a0commitment it made in 2015\u00a0not\u00a0to engage in cybertheft for commercial gain.\u00a0\"We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community, but the evidence suggests that China may not intend to abide by its promises,\"\u00a0Rosenstein\u00a0said.</p><p>             Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the Senate Intelligence Committee's vice chairman, praised Rosenstein and DOJ for taking action.\u00a0\"DOJ's recent moves to hold China accountable are important in exposing some of the threats posed by China as it attempts to pursue economic and technological dominance over the United States,\" Warner said in a statement.</p><p>Yet some experts said the indictment may not deter Chinese President Xi Jinping, my colleagues Ellen and David reported. \"Just as when the Obama administration did it, indicting a handful of Chinese agents out of the tens of thousands involved in economic espionage is necessary but not important,\" Derek Scissors, a China analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, told my colleagues. \"International denouncements may irritate Xi, but they place no real pressure on him.\"</p><p>             PWNED: Chinese hackers also accessed the networks of\u00a0Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)\u00a0and IBM and then infiltrated the systems of their clients in a campaign called Cloudhopper, Reuters's Christopher Bing, Jack Stubbs and Joseph Menn reported. Hackers penetrated the networks of HPE and IBM\u00a0\"multiple times in breaches that lasted for weeks and months,\" Reuters reported.          </p><p>A senior intelligence official said compromising a managed service provider\u00a0allows hackers to expand their reach.\u00a0\"By gaining access to an MSP, you can in many cases gain access to any one of their customers,\" the official told Reuters. \"Call it the Walmart approach: If I needed to get 30 different items for my shopping list, I could go to 15 different stores or I could go to the one that has everything.\" Bing, Stubbs and Menn also reported that\u00a0\"IBM investigated an attack as recently as this summer, and HPE conducted a large breach investigation in early 2017.\"</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news:          </p><p>             -\u00a0Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) wants an investigation into allegations that online disinformation tactics targeted his Republican opponent Roy Moore in his Senate contest, The Post's Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin reported. \"What is obvious now is that we have focused so much on Russia that we haven't focused on the fact that people in this country could take the same playbook and do the same damn thing,\" Jones said in a statement, as quoted by my colleagues. \"I'd like to see the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department look at this to see if there were any laws being violated and, if there were, prosecute those responsible.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Federal authorities are cracking down on DDoS-for-hire services. \"Authorities in the United States this week brought criminal hacking charges against three men as part of an unprecedented, international takedown targeting 15 different 'booter' or 'stresser' sites - attack-for-hire services that helped paying customers launch tens of thousands of digital sieges capable of knocking Web sites and entire network providers offline,\" according to Brian Krebs of KrebsOnSecurity.com. Krebs, a former reporter for The Post, wrote that such sites \"are dangerous because they help lower the barriers to cybercrime, allowing even complete novices to launch sophisticated and crippling attacks with the click of a button.\"          </p><p>             - More cybersecurity\u00a0news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Russian trolls posed as a Los Angeles-based startup and sought to convince U.S. business owners to purchase\u00a0their online marketing services, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Shelby Holliday and Rob Barry. The startup was called\u00a0Your Digital Face and\u00a0part of a broader Russian online effort to sow discord among the American electorate.\u00a0\"The group recruited American business owners as customers, and for a monthly fee, promised to post snappy marketing content on the business owner's social-media pages and score them thousands of new followers,\" Holliday and Barry\u00a0reported. \"Their main contact was a man who claimed to be named Yan Big Davis, the business owners told the Journal.\"</p><p>             - As Bangladesh approaches general elections, Facebook took down nine pages and six accounts\u00a0that were controlled by people tied to the country's government and engaged in\u00a0\"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" on the social network,\u00a0Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy at Facebook, said in a news release. The pages resembled legitimate, independent\u00a0news outlets but posted content that favored Bangladesh's government and decried the opposition, according to Facebook.</p><p>\"This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook under our misrepresentation policy because we don't want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they're doing,\" Gleicher said. About 11,900 users\u00a0followed at least one of the pages that Facebook took down.</p><p>             - More cybersecurity news from abroad:          </p><p>             Coming soon          </p><p>Mattis to leave administration in February:</p><p>Travelers stranded at British airport after reports of drones:</p><p>Christmas treats for gorillas, lions and camels at London Zoo:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-669f9725ea8643d4b2c64c5559b3a635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V14-54M1-DXKP-J43Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2614\"/><timeReceived>12:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 21, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;
