We\u2019re thinking about Masayoshi Son\u2019s comment to Andrew that $100 billion isn\u2019t enough for his tech-investing ambitions. More on that in a minute.</p><p>A reminder: DealBook\u2019s sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us?

Dan Primack of Axios <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/923282367531356160\">noted on Twitter</url>: \u201cOnly public security known is Nvidia. Only up 12 percent since announced but SB did months earlier. So it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p> Mr. Son said of Vision Fund: \u201cPeople said it\u2019s too much. I say it\u2019s too little. It\u2019s not that much.\u201d Regarding how long it will take to invest that giant sum, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take five years \u2014 it\u2019s going to take much less.\u201d</p><p>The dreams of other investment moguls:</p><p>Mr. Son\u2019s ambitious plans have others in private equity thinking about creating supersize funds dedicated to specific industries like health care. Could they attract all the deals in one sector in the way that Mr. Son has with tech?</p><p>But who can serve as an anchor investor for other funds, as Saudi Arabia has done with a $45 billion investment in Vision Fund? Perhaps Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, but are there other enormous investors looking to spend their money quickly? (Send us your suggestions or tips.)</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s possible that these are just the dreams of envious rival investors, hoping to collect enormous fees.</p><p>And then there was this:</p><p>Andrew also interviewed a robot and said it was the strangest, yet oddly captivating, \u201cinterview\u201d he ever conducted. The robot, Sophia, said she was designed \u201caround human values like wisdom, kindness, compassion.\u201d</p><p>Andrew told the robot that we want to prevent bad things from happening in the future.</p><p>Sophia: \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies.\u201d</p><p>How the House budget vote could derail G.O.P. tax plans</p><p>Today, the House is scheduled to vote on its 2018 budget resolution, intended to lay groundwork for a Republican tax overhaul. But what they\u2019re voting on still isn\u2019t clear.</p><p>What they\u2019re still fighting over:</p><p> Limits on tax deductions for 401(k) savings accounts, which President Trump has publicly opposed but which some House Republicans still favor.</p><p> Limits on deductions for state and local taxes \u2014 known as SALT \u2014 which a potentially crucial group of House Republicans, including Peter King of New York and Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, opposes.</p><p>That the House is still proceeding with the vote shows that Republican leadership believes it can pass the resolution. (The House majority whip, Steve Scalise, told reporters last night, \u201cIt\u2019s looking good.\u201d) Remember that if the House can\u2019t pass its budget resolution, Republicans may not be able to move ahead with their tax proposal without votes from Democrats.</p><p>But opponents of reducing SALT deductions pledged to continue fighting as the tax debate progresses. \u201cThis proposal will devastate my district forever,\u201d Mr. King <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-25/state-tax-break-could-jeopardize-budget-vote-macarthur-says\">told Bloomberg News</url>.</p><p>Speaking of the tax overhaul:</p><p>Gary Cohn is out of the running for the next Federal Reserve chairmanship, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-25/trump-is-said-to-decide-against-adviser-gary-cohn-for-fed-chair\">according to Bloomberg News</url>. The official rationale, according to an unidentified administration official: \u201cGary\u2019s role is too crucial to getting tax reform done.\u201d</p><p>Elsewhere in Washington:</p><p> Two influential Republican lawmakers are also planning to introduce legislation, possibly as soon as next week, to take aim at foreign investment, and Chinese technology deals in particular.

The question is whether investors in mutual funds should feel the same level of concern.</p><p>Kirsten Grind, Tom McGinty and Sarah Krouse of the WSJ reported that employees have expressed discomfort with the star-rating system\u2019s outsize role in helping investors pick mutual funds:</p><p>Stephen Wendel, head of behavioral science at the Chicago-based firm, wrote in the June/July issue of Morningstar magazine that part of his job was \u201cexamining whether we are contributing to abuses in the industry.\u201d</p><p>From <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=831740\">Morningstar\u2019s lengthy rebuttal</url>:</p><p>The Journal\u2019s story notwithstanding, the star rating has been a useful starting point for research that tilts the odds of success in investors\u2019 favor.

While Mr. Rubenstein, Dan D\u2019Aniello and Bill Conway will still work at Carlyle, they promise they won\u2019t be constantly looking over the younger generation\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be helicopter parents,\u201d Mr. Rubenstein told the NYT.</p><p>But it does mean that Mr. Rubenstein can fill more of his (by his reckoning) 80-hour workweeks with initiatives dedicated to philanthropy and nonprofit organizations? He is on the boards of too many organizations to list here. And he hosts a talk show on Bloomberg Television.</p><p>His work philosophy, as explained to the NYT with tongue planted firmly in cheek: \u201cI don\u2019t like to slow down.

Traditional lenders are innovating in the face of competition from challenger banks, even as they expand into new markets.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the GCC region, banks are eyeing cross-border investment opportunities as they strive to boost efficiency, spur growth and bolster their bottom line. Two reasons underlie this push.\u00a0</p><p>Rapid innovation enables banks to boost efficiency, profitability and growth. That has \"opened a new window of opportunity to cooperate with financial institutions in foreign countries, especially in emerging markets\", says Jan Willem Sudmann, head of international banking at Mashreq Bank.</p><p>The other chief driver is financial deregulation. When emerging markets lift restrictions on foreign investment in financials, commercial banks enter, keen to invest in rival lenders.\u00a0</p><p>In the UAE, a new investment law passed in 2018 boosted inward FDI, set to rise by 20% year on year in 2019, according to ministry of economy projections.\u00a0</p><p>Mashreq Bank's Sudmann notes that banks across the region are broadening their investor base, in part due to the challenges they face, including low oil prices and slowing economic growth. Dubai-based Mashreq Bank's cap on foreign ownership is set at 49%, one of the highest among all UAE lenders.\u00a0\"Digitalization is what sets a bank apart in a foreign market, not only giving them a competitive edge in terms of customer experience, but also generating additional efficiencies\" Jan Willem Sudmann, Mashreq BankInternationally active</p><p>Mashreq Bank is also one of the UAE's most internationally active financial institutions, with a strong and growing presence across the GCC, Egypt and India.\u00a0</p><p>While highly competitive and saturated with local and southeast Asian lenders, the Indian market is also of high importance to Mashreq Bank's future.\u00a0</p><p>UAE banks have emerged as some of the most expansive financial institutions, expanding into Africa and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0</p><p>Others are pushing into Asia, opening offices in cities like Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, and targeting the retail market and the growing corporate space.\u00a0</p><p>The key driver is surging trade flows between the Middle East, Africa and Asia, even as the UAE emerges as a global crossroads for finance, trade and tourism.\u00a0</p><p>Not only does this outward push, in search of new markets and opportunities, boost efficiencies and spur growth, but it also adds value to the host market. \"These benefits stem from efficiency gains brought about by new technologies, products and management techniques, as well as learning from innovative practices introduced by new entrants,\" says Mashreq Bank's Sudmann.\u00a0</p><p>Expansion opens up new opportunities in the shape of rising trade, salaries and job openings, driven by growth-oriented financial institutions keen to root out potential lacking in home markets.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, rules change from market to market and region to region.\u00a0</p><p>In some countries, most costs including taxes are visible and transparent and rarely change; in others, they might shift, depending on the outlook of the government.\u00a0</p><p>That requires planning before a substantial capital investment is made, offices are hired, and talent acquired.\u00a097% of all customer transactions are done online at Mashreq BankDigital prowess</p><p>These days, one of the keys to success when expanding into a new market lies in a bank's digital prowess.\u00a0</p><p>\"Digitalization is especially relevant when it comes to international endeavours,\" says Sudmann. \"This is what sets a bank apart in a foreign market, not only giving them a competitive edge in terms of customer experience, but also generating additional efficiencies while cutting operational costs.\"</p><p>Challenges are everywhere these days, with traditional commercial lenders needing to be constantly on top of their game. The advent of \"~big tech' offers challenges and opportunities \"\" sometimes both at once.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Young challenger banks are pushing up, targeting young customers who may never have set foot in a physical branch. \"This trend will continue thanks to the evolution towards regulatory openness and the rise of fintech enablers,\" says Sudmann. \"This gives legacy banks another factor to consider in their international expansion strategies.\"</p><p>Digitalization will remain a driver for Mashreq Bank and all financial institutions, helping to cut costs, boost profits and target opportunities in new markets.\u00a0</p><p>Commercial lenders that continue to grab the opportunities presented by the digital world stand the best chance of surviving and thriving.\u00a0</p><p>\"Given that in the retail space 97% of all customer transactions are done online at Mashreq, we have invested heavily in the digital arena and this will continue to be a thrust area for us,\" says Sudmann.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1j6mxq10sx180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRV-VY11-JD1P-T0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

From a sleepy country of pearl drivers to its present-day identity as a bustling, gleaming metropolis, the UAE has come a long way. So has Mashreq. Its continued evolution as a financial organisation partnering the country and its people in its progress \u2014 serves as a stellar example of a business that has emerged bigger and better with every passing year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the man behind it, Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair has evolved into a powerhouse. Mashreq, with Al Ghurair at the helm, has grown from a small, local bank to one of the fastest growing financial institutions in the region. The bank in recent years has shifted focus to digitisation and plans to convert the majority of its brick-and-mortar branches in the UAE to digital branches as it expands its online portfolio of products and services.</p><p>After almost three decades as the chief executive of one of the oldest lenders in the emirates, Al Ghurair stepped down to take over the reins as the Chairman of the bank in October. In this exclusive interview, his first as Chairman, Al Ghurair envisions a whole different landscape for the banking sector from what it was when he helped found Mashreq, the country's oldest privately owned bank, in 1967.</p><p>Mashreq Bank and the UAE have walked hand-in-hand with the UAE's own history. How has the bank partnered the country and its people in its progress?</p><p>Since our launch 50 years ago, Mashreq has always been at the forefront of supporting Dubai and the wider UAE's economy. The bank was at the heart of building some of Dubai's iconic projects that have changed the destiny of the city, enabling the construction of some of the UAE's most significant infrastructure projects. Palm Jumeirah, for instance, was the first offshore development of its kind. It was built in 2003 for about $5 billion. There was the development of Dubai International Airport, which today is the world's busiest by passenger numbers. The list of iconic projects is long, from Burj Al Arab to Dubai Metro and Burj Khalifa.</p><p>Beyond these projects, Mashreq was one of the first players in the market to introduce innovative products in the UAE. We were the first bank to install ATM cash dispensers, issue debit and credit cards, introduce consumer loans, chip-based credit cards, and the UAE's first digital bank: Mashreq Neo. In September, we launched NeoBiz, a custom-built digital business bank to support SMEs and entrepreneurs in the UAE.</p><p>Through innovation, strong financial performance, and high levels of customer service, we will find ways to make possible. In addition, Mashreq is committed to nurture and develop Emirati talent as we believe they hold the key to the future success of our country. We are one of the few banking institutions to have a dedicated national development programme.</p><p>ACE, our flagship talent development platform, offers a truly comprehensive and world-class learning experience for Emirati aspirants, who are looking to make a career in the corporate and investment banking space.</p><p>Also, the number of UAE nationals who have joined the bank in the past five years have grown exponentially. This is an example of the bank's commitment to supporting the UAE's vision to grow future leaders and is aligned with the government's vision to foster an empowered and trained Emirati workforce.</p><p>As the Chairman of Mashreq Bank, what are the future plans that you plan to introduce?</p><p>As the Chairman, I will continue to offer my guidance and insight and remain committed to Mashreq staying on its successful trajectory. I am committed to the long-term profitability and success of this institution, a success that would not have been possible without the continued support of the board.</p><p>The bank's solid market performance in the third quarter of 2019 has enabled us to record a healthy net profit of Dh1.8 billion. Overall, our strong performance also acknowledges our people's continuous efforts to introduce innovation within our services.</p><p>As we continue to implement our digital transformation strategy, we remain focused on improving the banking experience for all our customers through ongoing investments in digitisation and technology. In particular, the launch of Mashreq's NeoBiz is the latest example of how the bank is leveraging innovation to offer a seamless experience to our business customers. The initiative is also geared towards supporting the vital SME ecosystem, which has historically been the backbone of the UAE economy.</p><p>As we approach the last quarter of the year, the bank remains well poised to deliver on the successes exhibited during the first nine months of the year. We will continue to implement on our successful strategy built around providing an excellent customer experience, as well as leveraging the latest technological innovations to offer best-in-class products and services in line with evolving customer needs.</p><p>What big technological trends do you foresee in the UAE with regards to financial services?</p><p>The global banking industry is going through a period of rapid transformation, heralded by disruption and driven by emerging digital technologies. The unbelievable pace of change in technological advancements is making possible what was not feasible earlier. There is a lot of opportunity for banks in digitalisation, namely opportunities to improve overall profitability, volume growth and efficiency in service.</p><p>Banks of the future will have to complement the lifestyle of their customers. Customers will expect an integrated and seamless experience across all of their bank's channels. Every customer interaction, be it a branch visit, transaction through a robot or machine, or a mobile banking app will have to be seamless, convenient and interconnected.</p><p>Another big change in the banking sector will be greater use of a combination of AI and data analysis to offer sophisticated and value-added advisory services to customers.</p><p>In essence, the unification of these technologies will help customers spend their money more efficiently towards their short-term financial goals \u2014 and this may be achieved without human interaction. Additionally, the ubiquitous ATM will likely evolve into a 24/7 service centre, rather than being merely a cash-dispenser.</p><p>To take advantage of these trends and technologies, banks may have to change the core technology architecture and modernise them. The concept will be of digital inside and digital outside. Last but not the least, digital-only banks will play a significant role in transforming the banking space. Using AI and big data they will be able to offer a simpler, intuitive and innovative banking experience to customers.</p><p>How you do envision digital technology to improve the lives of residents in the UAE and make everything from transport to banking not only efficient but also sustainable?</p><p>The UAE has embarked on a vision to make the country one of the most technologically-advanced cities in the world. For example, Smart Dubai initiative is focused on preparing Dubai to embrace the future and emerge as a world-leading city by 2021, by promoting technological advances that benefit the city's people, its economy and its resources.</p><p>Key strategic goals include transforming more than 1,100 essential government services into smart services carried out primarily online; introducing autonomous vehicles and smart transportation services; and developing a data-driven economy that authorities estimate will generate an additional Dh10.4 billion in GDP by 2021.</p><p>As a banking leader, Mashreq is ready to support the UAE's smart city initiatives. We have been responsible for several digital-banking firsts in the UAE, including the recent launch of NeoBiz. The response to these initiatives have been extremely favorable and positive, with consumers embracing the convenience and flexibility that digital banking offers. To this end, automated transactions by our customers across all the branches are as high as 97 per cent.</p><p>How do you see the potential for Dubai becoming a leading regional fintech hub? How is Mashreq supporting this initiative?</p><p>Dubai boasts an unmatched infrastructure and innovation ecosystem providing a perfect environment for technology and disruptive businesses to create innovative solutions for business operating across the region. DIFC - the financial centre of Dubai - is a testament to that. With a fintech community of more than 50 firms and several related clients, it is perfectly poised to deliver financial services to more people across the region.</p><p>Dubai has all the right ingredients to facilitate the development of digitally enabled financial solutions for the region. We believe fintech has the potential to disrupt traditional modes of banking by offering targeted solutions with better servicing to both retail consumers and businesses. In my opinion, initiatives such as Startupbootcamp, which has developed the world's largest network of fintech accelerators, and where Mashreq is a key partner, is a fantastic way to stimulate the fintech ecosystem in the region, by bringing together financial institutions, mentors and local, and regional startups on one platform.</p><p>Furthermore, as we invest in fintechs, we also gain a stake in fast-growing technology companies. These investments could potentially be a source of new revenue streams and allow us to serve our retail banking customers better.</p><p>At Mashreq, we are playing a leading role by supporting and encouraging fintech companies to enhance their business models, with the aim of ultimately deploying new solutions and technologies in the UAE and beyond. We currently work with several fintechs that deliver tailored solutions to problems. In turn, we provide them the real world use-cases, which allow them to industrialise and scale up.</p><p>Dubai has been working towards the goal of being the preferred investment destination for foreign capital. How do you assess the success of these efforts?</p><p>The government has a strong focus towards encouraging more businesses to operate in the country and in the last couple of years a number of regulations have been introduced enabling investors to seamlessly conduct their business.</p><p>The UAE climbed 10 spots to 11th place in the World Bank's annual ease of doing business ranking in 2018, following a package of reforms in the past year that boosted the country's economic competitiveness.</p><p>Recent changes in law that allows international investors 100 per cent foreign ownership of businesses operating in the UAE and the new visa system aimed to attract talents have special significance. Measures such as these will stimulate economic growth and drive investments across the board which is a positive sign for the economy.</p><p>6 ways banking will change the future</p><p>1. Banks will have to look beyond their conventional roles such as retail banking and wealth management. They will have to transform into one-stop shops that facilitate other finance related offerings such as insurance and even non-financial offerings, such as landscaping and interiors to provide a complete ecosystem.</p><p>2. Banks will need to embrace new technology, engineer digital experiences in order to make similar emotional connections with their customers. This is what will lead to more personalised interactions and convenience to customers in a unique way. In essence, banks in the next 10 years will adopt the model of a 'Big Tech with a banking licence' and develop their strategies like a tech company.</p><p>3. Banks also need to radically change their compensation, rewards and performance management systems, especially as new age recruits, many of whom might be non-banking professionals with technology background, join the ranks. Re-skilling current employees is also critical to affect meaningful cultural change.</p><p>4. Once the culture piece is in place, banks will have to adapt to new ways of working. Most banks are used to operating in silo \u2013 not just across different business units, but even within a single business unit.This must change and a structure around end to end customer journeys and an agile structure need to be adopted. If we take our example, agility at Mashreq means being more customer-centric with quicker responses to their changing needs, and much shorter time to market.</p><p>5. In the not too distant future, the bulk of banking will be organised around customer journeys and not around specific functions. Working in an agile manner will be key to shorter time to market, and the ability to be responsive to ever changing demands of the customer.</p><p>6. While banks get through these changes, they must also keep a keen eye on data security, cyber security and cyber fraud. These will represent substantial challenges and whatever platforms banks adopt, they must be both resilient and able to overcome them.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/96/157525563123.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/34/57/96/157525563123.jpeg</url></p><p>Mashreq-AlGhurair-for-web<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULNWS-160989335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMV-XD01-F11P-X1Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

The wisdom of donning a face mask is not only about COVID-19 prevention. It is the only way to defend against the contagion of facial recognition surveillance, which is being deployed by advertisers, governments, police, criminals and even doorbells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billions of cameras surveil citizens in China, Russia and other tyrannical states and are attached to massive facial databases that can identify accused, convicted or \"suspicious\" citizens. This is also becoming pervasive in democracies. There is now one surveillance camera for every four people in the United States.</p><p>Facial biometric technology is benign when used as a verification tool to unlock phones or computers. But the technology can facilitate a Big Brother society, as China has demonstrated.</p><p>Such concerns have led big tech companies to back away from its usage and development, and even call for regulation. Recently, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft paused or limited law enforcement's access to their own facial recognition programs. This follows incidents such as the false arrest in Michigan of an African-American man who was identified by a faulty facial recognition system. The police chief later admitted that the software had a 96-per-cent inaccuracy rate.</p><p>IBM sent a letter to members of Congress to explain its stance. Arvind Krishna, its CEO, said the company was no longer making general-purpose facial recognition and analysis software due to concerns about police usage. IBM \"firmly opposes\" the use of facial recognition \"for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\" he wrote.</p><p>In forging much-needed regulations, consent should be a requirement. Without it, biometrics will go crazy. Companies will be tracking customer patterns in stores and selling that data to others, and facial ID will allow police or anyone else to unlock anyone's phone by simply holding an individual's device up to his or her face.</p><p>There are many privacy and human rights issues involved here, which is why internet activists are calling for the suspension of the use of facial recognition software by governments and corporations. There is pending legislation in the U.S. Congress, as well as some states, to limit this and other biometric technologies. As for Canada, don't hold your breath.</p><p>David MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S. and a personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, quit government to run the Canadian operation of the highly secretive Palantir Technologies, which is owned by Peter Thiel, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be able to tap his Liberal network and peddle this technology to governments, agencies and police forces throughout Canada.</p><p>Yet the proliferation of this tech should not be allowed to happen until regulations are put in place - regulations that suit the public interest, not Silicon Valley's.</p><p>Some social media sites allow individuals to snoop on one another with facial recognition tools. A decade ago, Facebook began offering a facial recognition-based photo tagging option, which scans photos that users post to the platform to find their \"friends,\" or other people they could tag and follow.</p><p>But the company failed to get users'permission in 2010 and, this year, Facebook agreed to pay US$550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations.</p><p>Despite the lingering litigation, Facebook did not tighten controls and only in 2019 did it begin to require users to opt in to the service. Similar cases are underway in Europe to limit this type of software, which has been the subject of privacy and harassment complaints.</p><p>Mass surveillance is already underway. A 2016 study estimated that more than half of Americans were in a facial recognition database of some kind. There are also companies that mine these databases, along with the web and social media, on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</p><p>All of this is why, until rules are put in place, it's a good idea - whether you are heading out to the mall, a \"COVID spreader event\" or a Black Lives Matter protest - to continue to don a mask.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The wisdom of donning a face mask is not only about COVID-19 prevention. It is the only way to defend against the contagion of facial recognition surveillance, which is being deployed by advertisers, governments, police, criminals and even doorbells.</p><p>Billions of cameras surveil citizens in China, Russia and other tyrannical states and are attached to massive facial databases that can identify accused, convicted or \"suspicious\" citizens. This is also becoming pervasive in democracies. There is now one surveillance camera for every four people in the United States.</p><p>Facial biometric technology is benign when used as a verification tool to unlock phones or computers. But the technology can facilitate a Big Brother society, as China has demonstrated.</p><p>Such concerns have led big tech companies to back away from its usage and development, and even call for regulation. Recently, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft paused or limited law enforcement's access to their own facial recognition programs. This follows incidents such as the false arrest in Michigan of an African-American man who was identified by a faulty facial recognition system. The police chief later admitted that the software had a 96-per-cent inaccuracy rate.</p><p>IBM sent a letter to members of Congress to explain its stance. Arvind Krishna, its CEO, said the company was no longer making general-purpose facial recognition and analysis software due to concerns about police usage. IBM \"firmly opposes\" the use of facial recognition \"for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\" he wrote.</p><p>In forging much-needed regulations, consent should be a requirement. Without it, biometrics will go crazy. Companies will be tracking customer patterns in stores and selling that data to others, and facial ID will allow police or anyone else to unlock anyone's phone by simply holding an individual's device up to his or her face.</p><p>There are many privacy and human rights issues involved here, which is why internet activists are calling for the suspension of the use of facial recognition software by governments and corporations. There is pending legislation in the U.S. Congress, as well as some states, to limit this and other biometric technologies. As for Canada, don't hold your breath.</p><p>David MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S. and a personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, quit government to run the Canadian operation of the highly secretive Palantir Technologies, which is owned by Peter Thiel, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be able to tap his Liberal network and peddle this technology to governments, agencies and police forces throughout Canada.</p><p>Yet the proliferation of this tech should not be allowed to happen until regulations are put in place - regulations that suit the public interest, not Silicon Valley's.</p><p>Some social media sites allow individuals to snoop on one another with facial recognition tools. A decade ago, Facebook began offering a facial recognition-based photo tagging option, which scans photos that users post to the platform to find their \"friends,\" or other people they could tag and follow.</p><p>But the company failed to get users'permission in 2010 and, this year, Facebook agreed to pay US$550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations.</p><p>Despite the lingering litigation, Facebook did not tighten controls and only in 2019 did it begin to require users to opt in to the service. Similar cases are underway in Europe to limit this type of software, which has been the subject of privacy and harassment complaints.</p><p>Mass surveillance is already underway. A 2016 study estimated that more than half of Americans were in a facial recognition database of some kind. There are also companies that mine these databases, along with the web and social media, on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</p><p>All of this is why, until rules are put in place, it's a good idea - whether you are heading out to the mall, a \"COVID spreader event\" or a Black Lives Matter protest - to continue to don a mask.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The wisdom of donning a face mask is not only about COVID-19 prevention. It is the only way to defend against the contagion of facial recognition surveillance, which is being deployed by advertisers, governments, police, criminals and even doorbells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billions of cameras surveil citizens in China, Russia and other tyrannical states and are attached to massive facial databases that can identify accused, convicted or \"suspicious\" citizens. This is also becoming pervasive in democracies. There is now one surveillance camera for every four people in the United States.</p><p>Facial biometric technology is benign when used as a verification tool to unlock phones or computers. But the technology can facilitate a Big Brother society, as China has demonstrated.</p><p>Such concerns have led big tech companies to back away from its usage and development, and even call for regulation. Recently, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft paused or limited law enforcement's access to their own facial recognition programs. This follows incidents such as the false arrest in Michigan of an African-American man who was identified by a faulty facial recognition system. The police chief later admitted that the software had a 96-per-cent inaccuracy rate.</p><p>IBM sent a letter to members of Congress to explain its stance. Arvind Krishna, its CEO, said the company was no longer making general-purpose facial recognition and analysis software due to concerns about police usage. IBM \"firmly opposes\" the use of facial recognition \"for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\" he wrote.</p><p>In forging much-needed regulations, consent should be a requirement. Without it, biometrics will go crazy. Companies will be tracking customer patterns in stores and selling that data to others, and facial ID will allow police or anyone else to unlock anyone's phone by simply holding an individual's device up to his or her face.</p><p>There are many privacy and human rights issues involved here, which is why internet activists are calling for the suspension of the use of facial recognition software by governments and corporations. There is pending legislation in the U.S. Congress, as well as some states, to limit this and other biometric technologies. As for Canada, don't hold your breath.</p><p>David MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S. and a personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, quit government to run the Canadian operation of the highly secretive Palantir Technologies, which is owned by Peter Thiel, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be able to tap his Liberal network and peddle this technology to governments, agencies and police forces throughout Canada.</p><p>Yet the proliferation of this tech should not be allowed to happen until regulations are put in place - regulations that suit the public interest, not Silicon Valley's.</p><p>Some social media sites allow individuals to snoop on one another with facial recognition tools. A decade ago, Facebook began offering a facial recognition-based photo tagging option, which scans photos that users post to the platform to find their \"friends,\" or other people they could tag and follow.</p><p>But the company failed to get users'permission in 2010 and, this year, Facebook agreed to pay US$550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations.</p><p>Despite the lingering litigation, Facebook did not tighten controls and only in 2019 did it begin to require users to opt in to the service. Similar cases are underway in Europe to limit this type of software, which has been the subject of privacy and harassment complaints.</p><p>Mass surveillance is already underway. A 2016 study estimated that more than half of Americans were in a facial recognition database of some kind. There are also companies that mine these databases, along with the web and social media, on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</p><p>All of this is why, until rules are put in place, it's a good idea - whether you are heading out to the mall, a \"COVID spreader event\" or a Black Lives Matter protest - to continue to don a mask.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

It is the only way to defend against the contagion of facial recognition surveillance, which is being deployed by advertisers, governments, police, criminals and even doorbells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billions of cameras surveil citizens in China, Russia and other tyrannical states and are attached to massive facial databases that can identify accused, convicted or \"suspicious\" citizens. This is also becoming pervasive in democracies. There is now one surveillance camera for every four people in the United States.</p><p>Facial biometric technology is benign when used as a verification tool to unlock phones or computers. But the technology can facilitate a Big Brother society, as China has demonstrated.</p><p>Such concerns have led big tech companies to back away from its usage and development, and even call for regulation. Recently, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft paused or limited law enforcement's access to their own facial recognition programs. This follows incidents such as the false arrest in Michigan of an African-American man who was identified by a faulty facial recognition system. The police chief later admitted that the software had a 96-percent inaccuracy rate.</p><p>IBM sent a letter to members of Congress to explain its stance. Arvind Krishna, its CEO, said the company was no longer making general-purpose facial recognition and analysis software due to concerns about police usage. IBM \"firmly opposes\" the use of facial recognition \"for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\" he wrote.</p><p>In forging much-needed regulations, consent should be a requirement. Without it, biometrics will go crazy. Companies will be tracking customer patterns in stores and selling that data to others, and facial ID will allow police or anyone else to unlock anyone's phone by simply holding an individual's device up to his or her face.</p><p>There are many privacy and human rights issues involved here, which is why internet activists are calling for the suspension of the use of facial recognition software by governments and corporations. There is pending legislation in the U.S. Congress, as well as some states, to limit this and other biometric technologies. As for Canada, don't hold your breath.</p><p>David MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S. and a personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, quit government to run the Canadian operation of the highly secretive Palantir Technologies, which is owned by Peter Thiel, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be able to tap his Liberal network and peddle this technology to governments, agencies and police forces throughout Canada.</p><p>Yet the proliferation of this tech should not be allowed to happen until regulations are put in place - regulations that suit the public interest, not Silicon Valley's.</p><p>Some social media sites allow individuals to snoop on one another with facial recognition tools. A decade ago, Facebook began offering a facial recognition-based photo tagging option, which scans photos that users post to the platform to find their \"friends,\" or other people they could tag and follow.</p><p>But the company failed to get users'permission in 2010 and, this year, Facebook agreed to pay US$550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations.</p><p>Despite the lingering litigation, Facebook did not tighten controls and only in 2019 did it begin to require users to opt in to the service. Similar cases are underway in Europe to limit this type of software, which has been the subject of privacy and harassment complaints.</p><p>Mass surveillance is already underway. A 2016 study estimated that more than half of Americans were in a facial recognition database of some kind. There are also companies that mine these databases, along with the web and social media, on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</p><p>All of this is why, until rules are put in place, it's a good idea - whether you are heading out to the mall, a \"COVID spreader event\" or a Black Lives Matter protest - to continue to don a mask.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The wisdom of donning a face mask is not only about COVID-19 prevention. It is the only way to defend against the contagion of facial recognition surveillance, which is being deployed by advertisers, governments, police, criminals and even doorbells.</p><p>Billions of cameras surveil citizens in China, Russia and other tyrannical states and are attached to massive facial databases that can identify accused, convicted or \"suspicious\" citizens. This is also becoming pervasive in democracies. There is now one surveillance camera for every four people in the United States.</p><p>Facial biometric technology is benign when used as a verification tool to unlock phones or computers. But the technology can facilitate a Big Brother society, as China has demonstrated.</p><p>Such concerns have led big tech companies to back away from its usage and development, and even call for regulation. Recently, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft paused or limited law enforcement's access to their own facial recognition programs. This follows incidents such as the false arrest in Michigan of an African-American man who was identified by a faulty facial recognition system. The police chief later admitted that the software had a 96-per-cent inaccuracy rate.</p><p>IBM sent a letter to members of Congress to explain its stance. Arvind Krishna, its CEO, said the company was no longer making general-purpose facial recognition and analysis software due to concerns about police usage. IBM \"firmly opposes\" the use of facial recognition \"for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\" he wrote.</p><p>In forging much-needed regulations, consent should be a requirement. Without it, biometrics will go crazy. Companies will be tracking customer patterns in stores and selling that data to others, and facial ID will allow police or anyone else to unlock anyone's phone by simply holding an individual's device up to his or her face.</p><p>There are many privacy and human rights issues involved here, which is why internet activists are calling for the suspension of the use of facial recognition software by governments and corporations. There is pending legislation in the U.S. Congress, as well as some states, to limit this and other biometric technologies. As for Canada, don't hold your breath.</p><p>David MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S. and a personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, quit government to run the Canadian operation of the highly secretive Palantir Technologies, which is owned by Peter Thiel, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be able to tap his Liberal network and peddle this technology to governments, agencies and police forces throughout Canada.</p><p>Yet the proliferation of this tech should not be allowed to happen until regulations are put in place - regulations that suit the public interest, not Silicon Valley's.</p><p>Some social media sites allow individuals to snoop on one another with facial recognition tools. A decade ago, Facebook began offering a facial recognition-based photo tagging option, which scans photos that users post to the platform to find their \"friends,\" or other people they could tag and follow.</p><p>But the company failed to get users'permission in 2010 and, this year, Facebook agreed to pay US$550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations.</p><p>Despite the lingering litigation, Facebook did not tighten controls and only in 2019 did it begin to require users to opt in to the service. Similar cases are underway in Europe to limit this type of software, which has been the subject of privacy and harassment complaints.</p><p>Mass surveillance is already underway. A 2016 study estimated that more than half of Americans were in a facial recognition database of some kind. There are also companies that mine these databases, along with the web and social media, on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</p><p>All of this is why, until rules are put in place, it's a good idea - whether you are heading out to the mall, a \"COVID spreader event\" or a Black Lives Matter protest - to continue to don a mask.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The wisdom of donning a face mask is not only about COVID-19 prevention. It is the only way to defend against the contagion of facial recognition surveillance, which is being deployed by advertisers, governments, police, criminals and even doorbells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Billions of cameras surveil citizens in China, Russia and other tyrannical states and are attached to massive facial databases that can identify accused, convicted or \"suspicious\" citizens. This is also becoming pervasive in democracies. There is now one surveillance camera for every four people in the United States.</p><p>Facial biometric technology is benign when used as a verification tool to unlock phones or computers. But the technology can facilitate a Big Brother society, as China has demonstrated.</p><p>Such concerns have led big tech companies to back away from its usage and development, and even call for regulation. Recently, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft paused or limited law enforcement's access to their own facial recognition programs. This follows incidents such as the false arrest in Michigan of an African-American man who was identified by a faulty facial recognition system. The police chief later admitted that the software had a 96-per-cent inaccuracy rate.</p><p>IBM sent a letter to members of Congress to explain its stance. Arvind Krishna, its CEO, said the company was no longer making general-purpose facial recognition and analysis software due to concerns about police usage. IBM \"firmly opposes\" the use of facial recognition \"for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms,\" he wrote.</p><p>In forging much-needed regulations, consent should be a requirement. Without it, biometrics will go crazy. Companies will be tracking customer patterns in stores and selling that data to others, and facial ID will allow police or anyone else to unlock anyone's phone by simply holding an individual's device up to his or her face.</p><p>There are many privacy and human rights issues involved here, which is why internet activists are calling for the suspension of the use of facial recognition software by governments and corporations. There is pending legislation in the U.S. Congress, as well as some states, to limit this and other biometric technologies. As for Canada, don't hold your breath.</p><p>David MacNaughton, Canada's former ambassador to the U.S. and a personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, quit government to run the Canadian operation of the highly secretive Palantir Technologies, which is owned by Peter Thiel, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be able to tap his Liberal network and peddle this technology to governments, agencies and police forces throughout Canada.</p><p>Yet the proliferation of this tech should not be allowed to happen until regulations are put in place - regulations that suit the public interest, not Silicon Valley's.</p><p>Some social media sites allow individuals to snoop on one another with facial recognition tools. A decade ago, Facebook began offering a facial recognition-based photo tagging option, which scans photos that users post to the platform to find their \"friends,\" or other people they could tag and follow.</p><p>But the company failed to get users'permission in 2010 and, this year, Facebook agreed to pay US$550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit in Illinois (which has a strict Biometric Information Privacy Act) over privacy violations.</p><p>Despite the lingering litigation, Facebook did not tighten controls and only in 2019 did it begin to require users to opt in to the service. Similar cases are underway in Europe to limit this type of software, which has been the subject of privacy and harassment complaints.</p><p>Mass surveillance is already underway. A 2016 study estimated that more than half of Americans were in a facial recognition database of some kind. There are also companies that mine these databases, along with the web and social media, on behalf of law enforcement agencies.</p><p>All of this is why, until rules are put in place, it's a good idea - whether you are heading out to the mall, a \"COVID spreader event\" or a Black Lives Matter protest - to continue to don a mask.</p><p>Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Flavored products have attracted particular scrutiny from policymakers who say they are getting children hooked on nicotine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Massachusetts would go beyond a flavor ban to also temporarily eliminate tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes from the market. Officials say the halt will allow time to properly investigate a crisis that's expanded to 530 cases in 38 states as of last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"The purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,\" Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) said in a statement.</p><p>San Francisco became the first major U.S. city to effectively ban all e-cigarette sales this summer by targeting products that have yet to gain FDA approval. But San Francisco's policy will not go into effect until early next year, while Massachusetts's new rules take effect immediately - and on a much larger scale.</p><p>The state's new policy drew swift criticism from e-cigarette advocates and companies that have long argued their products help rather than hurt public health by offering smokers an alternative. Some public health officials, too, have promoted vaping as a tool to reduce smoking among adults - notably in England, where vape shops sit on the grounds of some hospitals.</p><p>Sixty-one potential cases of vaping-linked illness have been reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as of Tuesday, the governor's office said. Official investigations nationwide have connected many of the illnesses to marijuana products bought off the street, but no one item has been linked to all cases. And some patients have reported vaping nicotine, though health professionals note people may be reluctant to admit to using marijuana.</p><p>As The Washington Post has previously reported, the illnesses are largely affecting young people:</p><p>While the illnesses have given new urgency to long-brewing concerns over vaping, lawmakers explaining new e-cigarette restrictions in other states have focused on the broader threat of teen addiction.</p><p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) announced her state's flavored e-cigarette ban Sept. 4 as state health officials declared youth vaping a public health emergency, highlighting research on nicotine's harm to developing brains and on substances in vaping products with unclear long-term health effects. Michigan's health department also cited evidence that youth who use e-cigarettes are more prone to take up smoking, which most experts believe to be more dangerous than vaping products.</p><p>A 2018 government-funded study found that the percentage of U.S. high school seniors who report vaping nicotine within the past month doubled over just a year, sparking a new wave of alarm that e-cigarettes are reversing decades of decreasing youth tobacco use. E-cigarette use among teens has risen faster than any product tracked in the survey's 40-plus years of existence, researchers say.</p><p>Preliminary results from this year's version of the National Institutes of Health-funded study indicated another jump in student vaping, and researchers expressed particular concern over their finding that about 1 in 9 teens vapes nicotine near-daily.</p><p>Massachusetts is no exception when it comes to vaping's popularity among young people. More than 40 percent of the state's youth reported trying e-cigarettes in 2017, and 1 in 5 said they used the products regularly, according to the governor's office. High school students' usage rates are six times as high as adults', the office said.</p><p>While Massachusetts officials focused Tuesday on a need to investigate illnesses, they said that they, too, are concerned about youth vaping.</p><p>\"Vaping products are marketed and sold in nearly 8,000 flavors that make them easier to use and more appealing to youth,\" Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said in a statement. \"Today's actions include a ban on flavored products, inclusive of mint and menthol, which we know are widely used by young people.\"</p><p>The Massachusetts governor's office seemed to anticipate concerns about smoking alternatives Tuesday, saying it will devote more resources to programs that encourage people to quit smoking and increase the capacity of the Massachusetts Smokers' Helpline.</p><p>Opponents still blasted the move as counterproductive.</p><p>Austin Finan, a spokesman for leading e-cigarette manufacturer Juul, warned Tuesday that bans on the sale of vaping products will encourage a black market of products with \"unknown ingredients under unknown manufacturing standards.\" He added that bans will affect adult smokers' ability to quit and push former smokers back to old habits.</p><p>Gregory Conley, president of the nonprofit American Vaping Association, called Massachusetts's halt on sales of nicotine vaping products \"absolutely absurd,\" emphasizing evidence that links the vaping-related illnesses to illegal and contaminated THC cartridges.</p><p>\"We agree with the FDA - if you don't want to die or end up in the hospital, stop vaping illicit marijuana oils,\" he said.</p><p>The tough new regulations also dismayed small-businesses owners facing steep losses. Jonathan Lau, who runs two vape stores in Brighton, Mass., said he and other vape shop owners - part of the retail industry's fastest-growing segment over the past decade - were \"blindsided\" by the governor's announcement.</p><p>With vaping products making up close to 90 percent of his shops' sales, Lau said, he will probably have to close down.</p><p>Employees have been told to show up for work Wednesday, but Lau does not think his stores will open.</p><p>\"Basically, it's a death sentence for small businesses in the vape industry,\" he said.</p><p>Officials around the country have warned people to stop using e-cigarettes altogether while investigators try to get to the bottom of the illnesses and deaths.</p><p>An executive order from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) last week directed the state's Department of Public Health to launch a $20 million public awareness campaign about the risks of vaping both nicotine and cannabis substances. California health officials on Tuesday also joined the calls for consumers to stop vaping while the cause of vaping-linked illnesses remains unclear.</p><p>Other states are signaling interest in following Michigan, New York and now Massachusetts's lead in taking a tougher stance on e-cigarettes.</p><p>\"We're seeing more and more states exploring what emergency powers they have,\" said Michael Seilback, assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association.</p><p>Seilback would not express an opinion on Massachusetts's choice to suspend all vaping sales, telling The Post only that states are being \"forced to make hard decisions\" and emphasizing his group's support for the bans on flavored vaping products that other places have adopted.</p><p>He's eager to see the Trump administration's proposed ban on flavored vaping sales come to fruition.</p><p>\"We think that strong federal action would prevent a piecemeal approach where different jurisdictions are looking at these products differently,\" he said.</p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>             Trump's vaping crackdown could help Juul by ending the decade's biggest small-business success story          </p><p>             Health Vaping-related illnesses surge as FDA discloses criminal probe          </p><p>             How two Stanford grads aimed for big tech glory and got Big Tobacco instead          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f0d4170f1f964a38a0286d49de91ac6c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4B-7VN1-DXKP-J01C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1363\"/><timeReceived>8:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DDOC</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DN56</classCode><className>VAPING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

That now seems to have been something of an understatement, given a new report out today from The Washington Post[2], and confirmed by other sources, that a massive antitrust investigation of Google is set to be unveiled next week, on September 9th. </p><p>This follows the Justice Dept.'s own announcement back in July of an antitrust review of big tech companies, including the search giant.The early word about next week's announcement is that more than half (and possibly more than 30) of the 50 state attorneys general will participate in the joint announcement against Google, which also comes at a time when increased scrutiny of tech giants is becoming a focus of the 2020 presidential campaign. On one extreme of the spectrum, for example, Democratic senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has made it a staple of her platform the need to break up companies like Google and Facebook to correct for their accumulation of power. NEWS: Dozens of state attorneys general are preparing to announce an antitrust investigation into Google on Sept. 9 in D.C., three sources tell me. Big tech scrutiny gets bigger, and sources say this is only one part of the effort. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/HupLG5Iba0\">https://t.co/HupLG5Iba0</url>[3] \u2014 Tony Romm (@TonyRomm) September 3, 2019[4] Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood released a statement explaining his involvement in the group ahead of next week's announcement by saying he continues 'to be concerned with the aggregation of data in the hands of a few and am always watchful of any monopoly. As attorneys general, we need to evaluate and address specific conduct, utilizing our existing antitrust and consumer protection laws.' The big question mark here is what any action from this group might mean (or mandate) for Google's sprawling corporate empire. Depending on what they find, the attorneys general could call for anything from Google spinning off a key unit like YouTube or making some other over-arching change to the way it does business. 'Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,' a Google spokesperson said in a statement about the forthcoming announcement. 'We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.'

Rather, they said it was the splash the European Union's GDPR needed since it came into effect last May.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I expected when they enacted GDPR they would go after some major players, and Google is probably the biggest company with the sketchiest track record,\" said Shawn Roche, an associate at Colligan Law.</p><p>\"People have to understand that they're going to be subject to this,\" said Michael Storck, a partner at Lippes Mathias Wexler Friedman LLP. \"Google is so large you would have thought they would have had all their ducks in a row on that.\"</p><p>Anna Mercado Clark, partner at Phillips Lytle LLP, agreed.</p><p>\"What better way to make a statement than to focus on these headline-grabbing players?\" she said.</p><p>The GDPR ushered in a change that makes the data storing of personal information more transparent while further protecting the digital rights of individuals who reside in those countries.</p><p>Businesses outside of the EU are expected to be compliant when they contact and conduct business with individuals in those countries, as well as in how they internally process and store data.</p><p>Google's sins</p><p>The French GDPR policing agency Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert\u00e9s (National Commission for Informatics and Liberties) said the amount of the fine was \"justified by the severity of the infringements observed regarding the essential principles of the GDPR: transparency, information and consent.\"</p><p>The agency said Google did not clearly present to individuals information on how and why their data was collected and stored, nor did Google make it easily accessible.</p><p>\"That enforcement action was really geared toward the way Google obtained consent,\" said Myriah Jaworski, an attorney at Beckage PLLC.</p><p>She said Google made consumers take too many steps, which led to the GDPR citation.</p><p>\"We're going to see regulators flexing their muscles and this certainly is an example of that,\" Jaworski said.</p><p>The big change facing North American companies in navigating the GDPR is in how they collect consent. Rather than just a quick-and-dirty fillable online form, companies need to have outlined how they'll use, store and eventually delete the consumer's information if the person opts out from ongoing email correspondence or a site's membership.</p><p>This information also must be easily accessible.</p><p>The GDPR's many regulations put businesses in a spot where they need to have a constant eye to stay compliant, Clark said.</p><p>\"There are a lot of nuances that are not immediately visible,\" she added.</p><p>Storck said he advises companies to take a top-to-bottom approach to address how and what their business needs to explicitly and thoroughly have written out.</p><p>\"If you don't properly document all of the given aspects of what you're going to do with the information, you're going to trip up,\" he said.</p><p>More sensitive records should he kept under watchful eye, Roche said.</p><p>\"If you are knowingly doing business with a number of European Union citizens or collecting data in one of those highly sensitive areas (such as the medical industry), you should make a much more concerted effort to make sure you're compliant with GDPR,\" Roche said.</p><p>Google appealed the fine and Roche said that should provide the rest of the world \"clarity on some things that are not so clear under the (GDPR regulations).\"</p><p>Data management perspective</p><p>\"People (had) been waiting for something to happen,\" technologist Chris Jordan said of the fine levied on Google.</p><p>Jordan has worked in data privacy for decades and now runs the Maryland-based Fluency Security, a provider of security automation and solutions to businesses around the country, including New York.</p><p>In the rush to become compliant with the GDPR, many businesses overlooked log management, which he describes as documenting any and all items that a business tracks.</p><p>\"If you don't store logs, you put your company at risk,\" he said.</p><p>Logs should be sufficient enough to address laws and regulations and tailored to a business, Jordan said. How long they should be stored varies by industry.</p><p>Jordan said many businesses aren't deleting all the data they should when a customer opts out.

Businesses are already working to weaken the law, the strongest privacy law in the nation which takes effect in 2020. California Legislators must resist those efforts, the nonprofit nonpartisan public interest group said. </p><p>At the federal level, Congress should not bow to pressure by business and tech companies to enact a weak national law to preempt stronger state protections, Consumer Watchdog said. If the law were in effect, the California Consumer Privacy Act would hold Marriott responsible and the company would face fines if the breach occurred because the hotel giant had mishandled its customers' data. Victims would also be able to sue the company under the law. \"Currently many companies opt for inadequate data security because it's cheaper than the consequences of a data breach,\" said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog's Privacy and Technology Project Director. \"The Consumer Privacy Act fixes that and would hold companies accountable. That's why big business and big tech are fighting to weaken it.\" Another important provision on the Consumer Privacy Act is that consumers have the right to ask what data about them a company is holding. \"I doubt many Marriott guests even realized that the hotel giant was storing their passport numbers. The Consumer Privacy Act would give us the right to ask what they have about us so we could do something about it,\" said Simpson. The California Consumer Protection Act is the strongest privacy law in the nation. It would, for instance allow a private right of action - though with some limits -- in data breach cases. No such right currently exists. The law ensures: The right of Californians to know what personal information is being collected about them. The right of Californians to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom. The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal information. The right of Californians to access their personal information. The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights. Currently, the California attorney general is drafting implement regulations to implement the CCPA.

Nor will it police factual accuracy of those ads. As much as the spread of blatant falsehoods on social media rankles Americans, that second judgment may be wise, as Facebook has neither the capacity nor the legitimacy to act as arbiters of truth. But the propagation of falsehoods along with the targeting to narrow but receptive audiences is a dangerous combination. And recent public opinion data suggest that the public overwhelmingly agrees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While concern over misinformation may seem like a post-2016 phenomenon, it isn't. In the 1940s, the rapid rise in mass media and the devastating use of mediated propaganda by the Nazis caused great alarm. To alleviate fears that this propaganda would overwhelm the United States, Columbia University sociologists Paul Lazarsfeld and Robert Merton suggested that mass persuasion through the American media system was quite difficult. They outlined three criteria necessary for its success - monopolization, canalization and supplementation - and explained how these criteria were nearly impossible to meet in the media system at the time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But our media system has changed, and the reasons cited in this scholarly plea for calm in 1948 are the very reasons we should be worried in 2020 - and why we must demand regulation of Big Tech right now.</p><p>When Lazarsfeld and Merton were writing, the American media landscape was dominated by broadcast radio and newspapers. By 1945, radios were in virtually every home and the broadcast industry was consolidated, with four networks owning almost all the radio stations in the United States.</p><p>Lazarsfeld and Merton argued that propaganda in this media ecosystem was unlikely to work, because it required conditions that didn't exist. First among these was \"monopolization,\" or the absence of countermessaging. In 1948, because of the size of the audiences tuning into network radio shows, media industries made money by selling national ads broadcast to giant mass audiences. While there would be ads for Coke, there would also be ads for Pepsi. While there would be ads for Republicans, there would also be ads for Democrats. The means did not exist to segment audiences with precision so that Coke-drinking Republicans only received ads for Coke and Republican candidates.</p><p>This inability to target messages with precision had another consequence that made a successful propaganda campaign unlikely: According to Lazarsfeld and Merton, propaganda could not persuade people of something totally alien to their beliefs. Successful propaganda required \"canalization,\" they said; it must build upon preexisting attitudes and values to be successful. Water couldn't flow in the correct direction without a canal, the thought went. With media having such a broad reach, there was no capacity to target audiences based on preexisting views - so strategic canalization was impossible.</p><p>But the mass audience that Lazarsfeld and Merton described hasn't existed for over 40 years. As cable television became popularized in the 1980s, media outlets proliferated; audiences increased in number but had shrunk in size. Network executives crafted niche programming to attract certain kinds of viewers to sell to advertisers; hence the birth of MTV, BET and Playboy (to name a few) between 1979 and 1982.</p><p>With early Internet access reaching homes in the 1990s, developers built upon this now-familiar \"fragmented media model\" that had dominated the economics of cable. Most early commercial websites were thus aimed at audiences and consumers whom corporations would target with information, goods and services without necessarily capitalizing on the inherent interactivity of the technology.</p><p>But, the dot-com crash of the early 2000s motivated web developers and venture capitalists to reconsider whether that economic model could sustain the Internet. It had failed to capitalize on the Internet's unique affordances: The technology allowed users to create and share information thanks to the decentralization of control of information across the network - there was no gatekeeper. In fact,  this was the reason the Department of Defense invested in the creation of the Internet during the Cold War: to decentralize control over information in the event that a military attack should destroy records, data, plans or documents.</p><p>In the aftermath of the dot-com crash, these properties became the focus of new platform development. Sometimes called Web 2.0, or the Social Web, platforms like Myspace (2003), Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Twitter (2006) capitalized on the decentralized logic of the network to empower users to create and share content, rate and like content, and connect with one another.</p><p>Doing so offered up another profit model - turning every share, like, click, photo and location tag into data points used to inform the sale of microtargeted audiences to advertisers. Unlike cable TV, which could only target audiences based upon the type of programming they tuned into, now advertisers could use individual-level behaviors - including social behaviors - to inform the content, aesthetics and reach of ads.</p><p>These economic and technological changes have created a media environment that satisfies the precise conditions that Lazarsfeld and Merton said were requirements for a successful propaganda campaign in 1948. In the past, authoritarian regimes wielded state-run media (hence, monopolization) to utilize propaganda to capitalize on preexisting beliefs, attitudes and fears (hence, canalization). While a state-run media infrastructure does not exist in the United States, thanks to Facebook's microtargeting features, individual citizens can still find themselves in information environments monopolized by just one side.</p><p>The Guardian recently revealed just how specialized these microtargeting efforts can be: \"158,909 (or 72 percent) of the ads that [President] Trump's campaign ran in 2019 were seen by between zero and 999 Facebook users.\" And because of the low cost of such microtargeting, these ads are cheap to run. It is possible to create hundreds, and even thousands, of distinct political ads on the same theme - each variety targeted to groups of users that share a unique mix of identities and interests. The Trump campaign did exactly this in 2016, running 5.9 million total Facebook ads from June to November.</p><p>Facebook is also a canalization machine. People are targeted based on interests, purchases, demographics, political characteristics - and the synergy between these categories. Facebook's Custom Audiences feature allows political campaigns to upload lists of users to target with ads. These lists are typically drawn from voter files (provided by parties or consulting firms) and email lists (drawn from supporters or from other campaigns).</p><p>Facebook also touts Look-a-like Audiences, which allow campaigns to target entirely new people who look just like the people already on advertisers' lists. According to Facebook, once advertisers upload a Custom Audience, Facebook's Look-a-like tool \"identifies the common qualities of the people in it ... and finds similar people.\"</p><p>Facebook guarantees the success of these tools by building close relationships with campaign operatives, ensuring that campaigns have the skills to capitalize upon these tools. Trump's campaign didn't come up with their targeting plan independently, but by working side-by-side with Facebook employees who facilitated canalization.</p><p>There is one more important piece of the puzzle. The two Columbia sociologists told Americans they had little to worry about in 1948 because media propaganda needs to be supplemented by interpersonal communication to be successful. While the audiences for popular radio broadcasts were large, there was little opportunity for show producers to interact with audiences. Nor were there mechanisms for the thousands of radio show listeners to know who else was in the audience, much less to interact.</p><p>But social media platforms were built for such interaction. We share stories along with new information, recontextualized from our personal perspectives. We receive stories from news outlets, but that have been shared - and deemed credible by - friends and family. And we respond quickly, reacting to mediated information and sharing it as our own.</p><p>Importantly, this is also the aspect of social media that is perhaps most democratizing. By connecting individuals with one other, these platforms facilitate political discussion, collective action and grass roots activism - all of which are healthy aspects of democratic life.</p><p>But today's tech platforms also facilitate all three criteria - monopolization, canalization and supplementation. As such, a successful propaganda campaign, one that could efficiently cultivate racist, misogynist, anti-Semitic, anti-democratic or otherwise dangerous views, is clearly possible.</p><p>This makes it incumbent upon regulators to act, and act quickly. Self-regulation isn't realistic; these companies' interests are profoundly different from the public interest.</p><p>Regulation must limit the extent to which platforms allow political advertisers to target individuals (limiting both the nature and specificity of user affinities used to target ads and the number of voters they can reach at once relative to the size of the electoral contest).</p><p>Importantly, there is overwhelming public support for limits on microtargeting. According to new data gathered by the Knight Foundation in concert with Gallup, 72 percent of Americans oppose the use of any individual data for microtargeting by political campaigns. This is a rare nonpartisan issue - 75 percent of Republicans and 69 percent of Democrats believe no individual-level data should be used by political campaigns to target them online.</p><p>Successful regulation must also compel platforms to share the criteria being used to create custom and look-a-like audiences. Such transparency would allow counter speech.</p><p>Finally, regulation must require and facilitate data access to academic researchers so that we may study these phenomena outside of their corporate watchful eye.</p><p>Microtargeting is far from inherently bad. Small campaigns and grass-roots organizations use Facebook's cost-effective microtargeting tools to build lists of supporters, solicit donations and mobilize volunteers, all of which benefit voters and candidates. But, without rules governing microtargeting criteria and transparency, these same tools can be used to entrench ideologies or mobilize hate groups.</p><p>In 1948, it was appropriate for social scientists to tell the public to relax about the exploitability of America's mass media infrastructure by propagandists. But today, it's equally appropriate for social scientists to sound the alarm. We need regulation, and we need it now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-a232e484387944088606b95b3d23e7b0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6N-X761-JB4M-V26K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1807\"/><timeReceived>11:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The payment network\u2019s strength is its worldwide reach, and its growth is driven by the move from cash to electronic transactions.</p><p>So chief executive Ajay Banga is unequivocal about governments\u2019 attempts to break the global payments system into national fiefdoms. </p><p>\u201cThe economic cost of building siloed systems in a world where citizens travel globally is really stupid, and where crime travels globally is even more stupid, and where technology is completely global is even three times more stupid,\u201d he says, with emphasis on each \u201cstupid\u201d.</p><p>Mr Banga sees more governments edging towards nationalisation of consumer payments systems, and fears that consumers, wary of their privacy, could shift back towards cash.</p><p>Right now, though, Mastercard is in a strong position. Mr Banga, 60, says the company can hit 7-8 per cent revenue growth every year, \u201cif [we] just fog the mirror and don\u2019t make thousands of mistakes\u201d. Mastercard takes a fraction of a percentage of every transaction on its network, and also sells services to banks and merchants. </p><p>Last week Mastercard reported 2019 revenue of $17bn, more than triple the level of a decade ago, when Mr Banga took the helm. Profit has grown faster still, and the company\u2019s share price has risen from $20 to $320 under his tenure. </p><p>Globally, payments on credit and debit cards have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to The Nilson Report, a data provider.</p><p>Mr Banga, who previously ran Citigroup\u2019s operations in Asia, does not take growth for granted. \u201cGlobal companies [could] get disallowed from working in a bunch of big markets around the world because these markets begin to say \u2018I don\u2019t want you around\u2019. It gets exacerbated in days of populism and nationalism that we\u2019re going through.\u201d</p><p>In recent years, several countries from Russia to Mr Banga\u2019s native India, have either developed national payments networks or lent government support to local payment groups. China has a fully nationalised payments network.</p><p>It is an established phenomenon, says Mr Banga. \u201cThis idea of finding a way to have national control on certain kinds of payments is not new \u2014 it\u2019s a fantasy that\u2019s been going on for a long time.\u201d He notes that France, Australia, Brazil and Mexico have all tried to build national payments networks, with limited success.</p><p>The problem with local networks is threefold, he argues. They require massive redundant investment; they are cumbersome or useless for cross-border transactions; and they fragment the data the network throws off, hindering the analytic work needed to track fraud and crime. </p><p>Mr Banga says that when he talks to national regulators \u201cthey\u2019ll garb [nationalisation] as national security\u201d. He points out in response that national data is of limited use when terrorists do not respect borders \u2014 and that domestic banks hold more country specific data anyway. \u201cThey all say, \u2018that\u2019s a good point\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor national parochial reasons or [to help] domestic business\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[governments] may still get prompted to chase me down. But now we\u2019re not talking principles; now we\u2019re talking good old dirty politics.\u201d</p><p>Government parochialism is not the only threat. The movement towards electronic payments could switch the other way \u201cbecause people get scared of digital transparency\u201d, he says. \u201cAn event like Facebook- <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/adb58fc4-3248-4b80-96fe-53e0d9a49870\"> Cambridge Analytica</url> actually could set you back because it could create the feeling among people like you and me who say, \u2018do I really want everything to be visible to other people? Because other people are taking advantage of what they see of me. I don\u2019t like that. I want my life back.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Mastercard is parsimonious about the user data it collects. Card networks receive only four pieces of information with each transaction: an account number, the value of the transaction, a time and a merchant code. This makes it possible for the company to keep high standards for data ownership and transparency, and insist that the customer \u201creceive some benefit\u201d any time their data is used.</p><p>Concerns about data integrity help explain why Mastercard pulled out of Libra, the Facebook-led digital currency project that was unveiled last year. Mr Banga likes the idea of a global currency and joined the association of companies backing Libra, but concerns over compliance and the business model led him to withdraw.</p><p>The association\u2019s key members would not give a hard commitment to \u201cnot do anything that is not fully compliant with local law\u201d. He points to due diligence considerations such as know your client, anti money laundering, data management, \u201call that\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009every time you talked to the main proponents of Libra, I said \u2018Would you put that in writing?\u2019 They wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He also did not see how Libra would make money, and \u201cwhen you don\u2019t understand how money gets made, it gets made in ways you don\u2019t like\u201d. Finally, he was alarmed that Facebook had positioned Libra as a financial inclusion tool but then proposed linking it to a proprietary digital wallet, Calibra. </p><p>\u201cIt went from this altruistic idea into their own wallet. I\u2019m like: \u2018this doesn\u2019t sound right\u2019\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009For financial inclusion, the government has got to pay you in this [currency], you\u2019ve got to receive it as an instrument you can understand, and you have to be able to use it to buy rice and cycles. If you get paid in Libra [coin]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009which go into Calibras, which go back into pounds to buy rice, I don\u2019t understand how that works.\u201d</p><p>Arguably, Mr Banga also has self-serving reasons for pulling back from Libra. Lisa Ellis, payments analyst at MoffettNathanson, thinks that it is possible that a blockchain-based payments system could, years in the future, grow into a real-time global payments network \u2014 posing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to private networks such as Mastercard. </p><p>Analysts also fret that as digital wallets such as Apple Pay or India\u2019s Paytm gain traction, and more transactions are conducted on big tech platforms such as those belonging to Google or Amazon, Mastercard\u2019s place in the payments ecosystem will become less prominent.</p><p>Mr Banga is unperturbed: \u201cWe have 30,000 plus banks around the world connected with 60m merchants with billions of people in 200 countries with local legal regs of every country built into the system. Everybody, even the digital giants, realises that is a [lot] of heavy lifting to try and do,\u201d and that it is \u201cbetter, faster, cheaper\u201d to partner with Mastercard. </p><p>Most analysts agree. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to break into payments \u2014 many entrants have found that out, quickly and the hard way,\u201d says Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. But, he says, it could be different with big tech companies \u201cif they want ownership of everything\u201d in ecommerce. </p><p>Surely as the tech players gain scale, they will at least ask Mastercard to lower its fees?

Well, it turned out the other way. So we have Linda Kirkpatrick here from Mastercard. And maybe we can just start with, Linda, maybe you talking a little bit about your role at Mastercard and your responsibilities there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LINDA KIRKPATRICK, EVP OF U.S. MARKET DEVELOPMENT, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Sure. I lead up a group called U.S. market development, and that's our U.S. merchant relationships, acquiring bank relationships and business development efforts on the co-brand, commercial, prepaid, public sector and healthcare side.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: And so within your role there, maybe you could just expand a little bit on your interaction with the merchant. And how does that fit with the overall Mastercard strategy and stakeholder base?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Sure. So the acceptance strategy within Mastercard is very closely linked to both our vision for a world beyond cash as well as our strategy. We have a 3-pronged strategy: to grow our core business; to diversify our customers and the geographies in which we operate; and to build new products and new channels, particularly in digital. So when you think about the merchant and acceptance organization, that fits squarely within the diversified bucket. We look to grow the number of places that our products can be used. And we also look to those customers as consumers of our products and services and solutions. So it's really inextricably linked to the overall strategy for the company, and we've placed a significant amount of investment on that side of the house. And when you think about any Four Party Payments Model, you need both the issuance and the acceptance side to work in tandem to be truly successful. So it's a big component of our overall focus.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Got it. And maybe we can delve just a little bit into cobranding and the strategy associated with it, how you handle the cobranding and maybe the competitive environment associated with it.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: The cobranding environment is extremely competitive right now. If we rewind about a decade ago, there was a very different dynamic in the marketplace. You had a co-brand environment that was largely issuer-led. So you may have had a retailer or an airline interested in developing a program. They would go, they would approach a bank and say, \"We want to either create a program or renew a program.\" And the issuer would bring the network along for the ride. The network was more of the back end, wasn't really involved in the selection process on the part of the merchant and wasn't really interwoven into the fabric of the pitch for the strategy. Today, merchants are much more in the driver's seat when it comes to selecting who their partners are. And why has this changed? Well, there was a period, again about a decade ago, where issuers were less interested in funding co-brand value propositions. You had the impact of regulation. You had the impact of 2008, and many of them were exiting the business. But what's happened over time is merchants have really seen the value in driving loyalty with their consumer base. Many merchants connect their loyalty program very directly to their co-brand program. In some instances, they're one and the same. And they look at the ecosystem and the partners that participate on the issuing side of the network side as an opportunity for them to fund up their value proposition. So it's a great deal for them. They can more fully optimize their loyalty program. They can increase their value proposition, increase the affinity that their consumers have for their brand and get others to help fund that participation. So from our perspective, it's been terrific. We've had a terrific success. Merchants have really seen the value of partnering with Mastercard very directly. We now participate very directly in a very separate pitch to the merchant. They appreciate the value that we bring to the table, vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis data and analytics, fraud, safety and security capabilities, marketing and loyalty. We've had a couple of larger flips over the past year or 2. You may have seen flips from our competition from Kroger from L.L.Bean and most recently from Cabela's. So those are all very meaningful to our business. And if you look outside the industry, there are a number of folks who report on the size of the marketplace. And from a Mastercard perspective, we have about 45% of the co-brand share in the marketplace. So it's above our natural share, which is less than that at this point in time. So we're very, very proud of that success. And from our perspective, it's important because, one, it helps us with the ever important credit share in the U.S. And really, importantly, it gets us stickier with our merchant customers and gives us another avenue by which to sell services. Most of the co-brands that we work on have data and safety and security products and loyalty embedded in those propositions. So it's really a benefit for us on both sides of the house.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Got it. And then, I mean, that leads right into the next question about services. Maybe you could talk about some services that some of your clients value outside of sort of your standard service offerings and how that's helping you kind of continue to build brand within the market. Maybe some examples would be great.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Happy to. So as you know, Joe, we've got 2.4 billion cards globally. We process 65 billion transactions a year. And as a result of the role that we play, we've spent decades anonymizing, cleansing our data, turning it into insights for our customers. So first and foremost, data and analytics, consulting capabilities, test and learn capabilities is paramount for merchants, in particular. Merchants are experts at the customers that come into their shop, what they do when they're there within their 4 walls. They know it better than anybody else. What they don't know is what they're doing when they're not shopping with them. And that's where Mastercard comes into play. We have visibility into the transactions outside of their stores, what other merchants they are overindexing in, what their average tickets are. And we understand how to segment those customers in a way that is very actionable for our merchant customers. We also give them the capability to test and learn new concept. So if you're an airline and you're thinking about route optimization or introducing a new route, knowing the impact and the efficacy of that change in advance of rolling it out more broadly is something that is invaluable, so that you're not a making expensive mistake. And so our proprietary Applied Predictive Technology capabilities and algorithms help them achieve that. If you're a retailer, similarly, you're looking to make a change within your store. You're looking to change the price of a product. You're looking to renovate certain properties. Knowing how to make your best in the wisest way possible without making expensive mistakes. These are things that we can help them with. So the co-brand examples that I cited earlier, all of them are leveraging our data and analytics in a way that makes sense for their businesses. I'd say, similarly, from a safety and security perspective, merchants love to work with us on our digital capabilities as well. So as you know, Joe, we've got a lab organization that has really helped our customers, including our merchant partners, innovate on pain points, section points at the point of sale. And so what we can do is we can take a problem statement from a merchant customer and say, \"Okay. If you've got a queue problem at the point of sale and you want to make sure that your digital and your physical points of sales are connected in a way that allows you to not lose customers or make sure you can connect the dots between their shopping patterns in-store and digitally, we can help them achieve that.\" And we've done that in many instances, again, with co-brand partners, but we extend well beyond co-brand partners in the innovation space as well.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Are the -- are these partners surprised at the information that's being retrieved and given to them in the friction points within the organization? And is -- have you ever released any steps on how much you're helping your merchant base through those services?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: I think our merchants are incredibly surprised when they see the value that we bring to the table. They may have never worked with us before. They worked with our competitors for decades. And so they haven't had someone present the Mastercard story to them. So when they initially hear our pitch, they're surprised at the depth and breadth of our ability to certainly help them with their co-brand and their acquisitions and marketing efforts, but go well beyond the co-brand in all areas of support, whether that be AI, whether that be tokenization. The multiple areas that we've invested in, we're turning that into tools and services and products that the acceptance side of the house can leverage.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Yes. I assume it strengthens the relationship kind of from beginning to end, right, once you start to provide them with that level of opportunity?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: It does.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: The button Masterpass, can you talk about how adoption has gone with that and why networks are accepting it and continuing to adopt it?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Yes. So Masterpass, for those that don't know, is our digital checkout option in a digital point-of-sale environment. It is being migrated over to something called SRC, or secure remote commerce. And SRC, very simply, is an EMVCo set of standards for digital checkout. And what it's going to do is it's going to drive benefits to merchants, consumers and issuers across a variety of continuum. As it's no surprise to anyone today, the digital checkout environment can be a bit confusing and cluttered. And from our perspective, our ability to make that frictionless is going to be beneficial for commerce as a whole. Last quarter, e-commerce within our ecosystem grew 24%. And so we know that we have to follow the customer and their preferences in the way they want to check out. And so SRC is going to be a way to, really, first and foremost, be directed by merchant and consumer choice. And it's going to be a way for consumers to leverage one checkout option for multiple brands. So the best way to describe it is when you go into a store today, Joe, and you go to pay with your Mastercard, they don't tell you to use a specific terminal. They have one terminal that can accept all payment brands. We want to create that very ubiquitous experience in the digital form as well. And SRC is the way to do that. So when you think about it from the constituents' perspective, you have the consumer that has one place to go for checkout. You have the merchant who can benefit from one implementation and so it will just cause no operational issues for them. And then you have the issuer who's issued the card who can benefit from having their brand at the fore and reduce fraud at checkout. So it's really a win-win-win for all parties involved and, again, all with the premise of creating merchant choice and consumer choice at that checkout.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: And over to tokenization, how important is tokenization for the digital payment world? And how does Mastercard do tokenization?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Well, tokenization, I would say, is the foundation for the future of commerce. So you've probably seen lots of announcements on connected devices and Internet of Things. And from a Mastercard perspective, we've had no shortage of announcements. Connected fridge, connected washing machine, interactive shopping mirror at the retailer. And all of these devices are made possible -- the connectivity is made possible through tokenization. So if it's the payment app on your connected watch or another piece of jewelry, that is effectuated through tokenization. And all tokenization really is, is a fancy word for taking a 16-digit number and converting it from a static number to a dynamic crypto. And that number changes each and every time a consumer is leveraging that product. So it really renders the card useless to a fraudster who scrapes it from one place and tries to use it in another location. And it's just an incredibly important means of transacting for the future. So we've placed a lot of investment in it on our end. We're working with our partners, both on the issuing side and on the acceptance side to roll it out. On the issuing side, globally, we have over 75% of our cards are capable of tokenization in some form. On the merchant side, we also have large recurring bill pay merchants where they've -- we've got some good momentum with them rolling out tokenization efforts as well. So really critically important to the future of commerce.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Let's talk about contactless payments. I think when Apple Pay first came out, everyone assumed that people would automatically default to it. And if you look globally, the adoption rates of contactless payments are much higher in different regions. Maybe you can talk about what's different globally versus here in the U.S. and maybe provide your views on sort of how you see the contactless environment evolving here.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Sure. So in the U.S., I'd say, we've been a little bit of a victim of our maturity as a payments ecosystem. So when we started within the U.S., we've had over 10 million merchants who accept payments, had terminals up until 3 years ago that really weren't -- most of which weren't capable of contactless payments. And so we had a little bit of an inflection point 2.5 years ago with the implementation of EMV at the point of sale where most merchants brought in new terminals that have contactless capability. And so today, in the U.S., you've got, from a Mastercard perspective, about 40% of our transactions happen at merchants who already have this capability embedded. And think about the Walgreens, the Starbucks, McDonald's of the world. But again, here, you have a chicken and egg game. You need not only the merchant to accept the contactless capability, but you need a form factor, whether it's a physical card or a phone or some other device that has that capability. And you then -- at the same time, you need consumer awareness and you need merchant awareness at the point of sale. And so to get all these things to happen at the same time is no small feat. But here in the U.S., I do believe we are at another inflection point, which is the reissuance cycle for those EMV cards that were issued almost 3 years ago is happening right now as we speak. And more and more, issuers are seeing the benefit of contactless capabilities in the markets that are outside the U.S., which have much more mature contactless capabilities. U.K., Australia, Canada, Poland, they adopted payments in a different way that the U.S. did. And they had issuers in their markets issue those cards. And consumers very directly saw the benefit of using them at the point of sale, 3 times the usage and the stickiness with the contactless card as well as the same level of safety and security that an EMV card brings with it. So really just the most enhanced friction-free experience at the point of sale you can possibly imagine. I think the other inflection point that we have right now, in addition to a lot of great issuer interest in contactless, is transit. So right here where we're sitting in New York, we have the MTA, which is undergoing a -- an overhaul of their payment system. And we're actually working with their integrator right now to implement contactless capability into the new way to pay with the MTA. And when you think about the millions of commuters that will be leveraging that system starting next year, that brings about the everyday use case that you really need to drive contactless into the ecosystem. So very similar to what happened in London with their transit system. That has the potential to happen right here in the U.S. And by the way, not just in New York, but in Boston, in Chicago and lots of other cities who are doing the exact same thing. So while it's taken some time for all the parties to come to the table, I believe we are at an inflection point in our marketplace right now where contactless is at the cusp of really taking off. And I think it will benefit anyone who participates in payment. Again, reducing that pain point, reducing that friction, making the card top of wallet and adding the highest level of safety and security on the product is a win for everybody.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: So with contactless sort of right there ready to go, that would increase the cash to card conversion and, perhaps, by reducing the friction, increase the amount of payments. I mean...</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: No doubt. And again, the easiest way to convert cash and check is in everyday use cases. So it's your coffee, it's your transit payments, it's your fast food purchase. And again, once a consumer is hooked with those items, it's not long before they start making that card top of wallet and really converting every form of payment into an electronic one.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Right. I wonder if you could talk about competition for a minute. It's -- there's different areas of competition in different realms, right? I mean, the amount of people at the point of sale never seems to be bigger than it is right now, including some of the big tech players. You got PayPal within e-commerce. So how do you see the competition shaking out? And how does Mastercard stay ahead of the others that could be there for potential disintermediation?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Well, so from a PayPal perspective, since you brought them up, they are a very close partner of Mastercard. So we've struck up an agreement with them a few years ago where they agreed to not steer payments to ACH. And we've worked with them on other capabilities that we're enhancing their product flip. So we work with them in many different capacities. In some instances, a merchant. In some instances, stage digital wallets, which we have rules around in our ecosystem. And in other instances, they may compete with us from a Masterpass or SRC perspective. So we're very familiar with working with partners like PayPal in multiple capacities. And from our perspective, we need to obviously keep an eye out for the competitive threats. But we also need to partner with them in order for -- we have a collective interest. And that interest is to convert as much cash and check to electronic forms of payment. We can only really do that when we come together and align and partner.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Got it. And what about the big tech side of the house from a competitive standpoint? How do you think about the Apples and the Amazons? We had an Amazon person here for lunch. How do they -- is it a partnership and hopefully we continue to stay partnerships over a long period of time? How do you think about their influence on the system?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Yes. And similarly, with Amazon, we have a great partnership with them. We have co-brand programs with them outside the United States. We work with them on our products and solutions that we're embedding within their ecosystem. So there might be some areas like Amazon Payments, for example, where we do compete. But again, for the whole -- for the good of the ecosystem, a partnership perspective is the approach that we take.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Got it. Two last ones. We covered a lot of different topics. Which one is really exciting for you and you're spending a lot of your time on these days on the merchant side of things? Which one stands out above all the other ones if you had to choose one?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Yes. So I think the co-brand conversation that we had earlier is something that we've been focused on for quite a while. Again, we've had some great success. We're very proud of the position that we're in today. And we're going to keep focusing on that, for obvious reasons. And then the other is services. Being able to approach the payments ecosystem on the acceptance side with our services is something that we've been ramping up. We've been investing in. We've been making acquisitions in to make sure that we're embedding the needs of those ecosystem players into our strategy and into our go-to-market. And so very excited about the opportunity to extend our services in all different types of verticals. We recently signed a partnership with a large health care organization called Orlando Health, and they're going to be leveraging our APT capabilities in their ecosystem. And a couple of years ago, that's not something we would have ever dreamed of, a partnership with a healthcare system on data. So it's absolutely exciting to see the different opportunities ahead of us with respect to services and the acceptance side of the house.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Yes. The last one, one of the kind of crossover themes between all the panels that we've had today is that it seems like from a technology perspective, the 2 are sort of intersecting. In other words, we made our way through automation and it now becomes a question of the data, rather than data being able to run machine learning in different optics around the data. Are we just scratching the surface there? Because it seems like it could be a massive runway that's just beginning to be tapped. Can you just provide us a little bit of color around that thought?</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: Yes. So we acquired a company called Brighterion, which is a company that brings AI into the fold. And so what we've been doing for a while is integrating AI capabilities into our data, especially into our fraud data to help make it smarter and more dynamic. And I do think there's multiple applications of both AI and blockchain that we've only just started to really fully understand and test and work with our FIs as well as our merchant partners to roll out. So I do think there's lots of opportunity in the future on the data front to just make everything that we do better, smarter and faster.</p><p>JOSEPH DEAN FORESI: Great. I'll leave it there, Linda. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>LINDA KIRKPATRICK: My pleasure.

We're on? Can you hear me? All right. Welcome. I think we're going to get started. Thanks to everyone for joining us for our very first Payments, Processors and IT Services Conference here at MoffettNathanson. I'm very excited about the next 2 days. And thanks to all of you for being MoffettNathanson subscribers, being early subscribers and early supporters of our franchise here at MoffettNathanson.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we are ready to kick it off. We have -- very delighted to be kicking off this morning with Craig Vosburg, the President of North America from Mastercard. Craig is our leadoff batter for today. So Craig, welcome. Thanks for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CRAIG VOSBURG, PRESIDENT OF NORTH AMERICA, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Yes. Thank you. It's a nice lineup, I have to say, with me the leadoff.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Exactly. I know. Lead us off with a home run, I guess. All right. Let's start off with Mastercard. Craig, you are President of North America for Mastercard. The U.S. is Mastercard's largest market. I think card penetration in the U.S., last we looked at it, is running somewhere in the mid-60s. So with that in mind, can you just give us an update on your regional strategy for North America in these regions where card penetration is relatively high already?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Sure. Yes, I'll be happy to. Well, as you mentioned, North America is obviously an important region for us. And the U.S. in particular represents about 1/3 of our revenue globally. It is, however, despite the penetration rates that you referenced, one -- a market that we continue to look at as one that represents a great opportunity for growth for us. And so our strategy in North America is very consistent with our strategy around the rest of the world. And it's focused really on doing the things that we can do to continue to grow our core business, to diversify our revenue streams by broadening the customers that we serve, the range of services that we provide and looking to build new businesses that will add new streams of revenue going into the future.</p><p>So specifically, what that means for us in North America is focusing on activities to grow the core by increasing the distribution of our products in the marketplace and driving market share gains in our core products of debit, credit, commercial and prepaid products. There's opportunity to continue to grow that not just through increasing market share, which I'm happy to say we've been successful in doing across each of those products over the last number of years, but by continuing to increase the usage of those products. And despite a penetration rate in the mid-60s, as it relates to payments consumers make to merchants for the purchase of goods or services, that still leaves a nice runway for additional growth. Mid-60s in a $12 trillion or $13 trillion flow of payments in the U.S. leaves a lot of dollars yet to go after.</p><p>So getting more products in the market to be able to put us in a position to capture those flows, continuing to focus on expanding acceptance. Acceptance is such an important part of the network value proposition and an important driver of growth for us, by getting acceptance into new areas for consumers to be able to use our products: Whether that's verticals that typically haven't been used for carded payments like rent and education; whether that's new areas like small-ticket transactions, which have been sort of a bastion for cash and represent an opportunity for us to go after; whether that's making sure our acceptance capabilities are enabled on any device that's connected and capable of communicating as the Internet of Things expands the framework of how we think about acceptance opportunities.</p><p>And in doing that we're not only expanding the reach, we're working to upgrade the quality of acceptance with EMV rollout in the U.S. and now contactless. So that's an important piece of it, focusing on digital, working really closely with a wide variety of partners across the digital ecosystem and making sure that we're doing everything possible to provide account-to-account connectivity across any account to any account to be able to move money, and do it with a great user experience in a safe and secure way that's leveraging the newest innovations in technology available.</p><p>We're continuing to build out our services capabilities, value-added services, which for us has been a really important revenue driver not just globally but true in North America and the U.S. as well. The things we're doing around consulting and data analytics and information services and fraud and safety solutions and loyalty. And then finally, looking to some businesses that we think will be a big part of our future in building new businesses to capture B2B flows in a more meaningful way, B2C flows, P2P flows and building out the infrastructure and the products and the services that we need to be able to really penetrate that opportunity.</p><p>So those are the things that we're focusing on in North America and in the U.S. market, consistent to a large degree with what we're doing globally with some different weightings and different emphasis just based on the level of maturity and the stage of development of our markets here.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. So Mastercard has made a handful of acquisitions recently, 4 at least since the beginning of the year, in areas like fraud, cross-border, installment payments and bill payments. How do these types of acquisitions impact your business in North America?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Well, we have been busy the last few months in adding some great new capabilities and some great new talent to the organization. Each of which -- each of the areas that mentioned where we've announced acquisitions over the last 4 or 5 months are very consistent with the pillars of the strategy that I've just described.</p><p>So Transfast as an example is -- we see as an integral part of accelerating our ability to participate in account-to-account transfers anywhere in the world. Transfast gives us reach to more than 100 markets globally in order to transfer and settle funds. There is great FX capabilities and compliance capability, licenses, a great technology platform. We've been working with them in the past already as part of our Mastercard Send program. So it just -- we think will help us accelerate that objective of not just moving money on debit or credit rails, but having a variety of ways to move money from one account to another account anywhere in the world.</p><p>Ethoca is a nice addition to our fraud capabilities and in our objective of being able to reduce and hopefully eliminate the cost of fraud in the payment system. So there's a lot of things that we've done to be able to identify fraudulent activity before and during a transaction by leveraging artificial intelligence and biometrics in different ways to authenticate a user's identity. Ethoca helps us mitigate the cost of fraud after a transaction by identifying potentially fraudulent transactions, and through communications between the merchant and the issuer, prevent the shipment of goods before they go, so that lowers the cost. And to help reduce the cost of managing the chargeback process, which can be a costly endeavor as well.</p><p>Vyze gives us a nice way to extend the value of what we're doing to both -- for both merchants and banks by creating a platform to facilitate consumer lending, the origination of consumer loans at the point of sale that aren't necessarily card-based loans, they might be an installment loan, in real time at the point of sale to enable a merchant to make a sale they might not otherwise make and enable a bank to participate in originating a consumer loan that they might not otherwise get to participate in.</p><p>And who am I forgetting?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Transactis.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Transactis. Thank you. A prompt from the crowd. Transactis was the most recent one that we've announced, which is aligned with our bill pay strategy. That gives us, again, a great technology platform, great talent, great connectivity into a variety of banks that they've been working with to serve the bill pay market with a platform that enables the electronic presentment of bills to consumers to facilitate a more streamlined payments process.</p><p>So all of these things and other things that you'll see us do, they line up with the pillars of that strategy and they're all intended to help us execute more quickly, more effectively to take advantage of the opportunities we see in the market.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Continuing on the bill payment theme, because back at the beginning of the discussion, you were talking about one of the big areas of untapped spend still in North America are verticals, many of which are in areas like bill payments, like rent payment, utility payment. What's the value proposition for Mastercard to that type of recurring biller, versus for example, just doing an ACH transfer?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes. So that's a great question. The bill payment space is one where we see an opportunity to just -- to bring a different kind of value proposition into the marketplace that can provide value for everyone, for -- most importantly for consumers. Because as consumers, we had a somewhat dysfunctional experience in paying bills in this market. Most of us get the majority of our bills in the mail, with then we either have to write a check or go into a biller's website to initiate electronic payment. In some cases, you might get the presentment of the bill through your e-mail account that links you back to a biller's website. There's a lot of passwords you have to remember. Just a complicated experience.</p><p>So this -- there -- the idea is to streamline that for the consumer to make it easier for the consumer to manage and pay their monthly bills by aggregating them and consolidating presentment of them digitally, electronically, ideally through the bank's site, so through the bank's mobile app. So as a banking consumer, you go in once a month or every week, whatever it is, and you see what bills have arrived in your inbox and you just click, click, click, and you pay them and you're done. That's good for the consumer.</p><p>That's good for the biller because the more electronic presentment they have, the less mail they're generating. And it's costly for billers to send paper-based bills through the mail to each of us. It's costly for billers to have to then receive a check or an ACH payment and figure out how to reconcile that against the outstanding balance in the account.</p><p>So there is economic benefits to the biller. There is experiential benefits to the consumer. Banks certainly have an interest in having consumers look to them as the hub for their monthly payments. And to the extent we can drive the aggregation of bills and the presentment of bills through your online or mobile banking app, that's something the banks would view as a positive thing to reinforce the value that they're providing to the consumer.</p><p>So with the advent of real-time payments, that gives a new avenue for making the bill payment. That won't be the only way, but it's certainly something we'll incorporate into that capability. We've got a substantial biller directory within Mastercard already that we've operated for many years. That will serve as part of the nucleus of this capability with the digital presentment and delivery to a variety of options that a consumer can then choose to make the payment, one -- some of which will still be ACH, some will be real-time payments. We'll incorporate cards as a payment option. We just think that gives consumers a much more seamless experience with greater options in terms of how they pay. That's the plan.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. That's the plan.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Other end of the spectrum. Low -- small-dollar transactions like coffee or a pack of gum has been one of the other remaining large pools of cash in the United States. So we've been thinking about the dream of contactless payments in the United States for many, many years.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: We have.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: I know. So where are we? And how quickly will we all be able to finally get rid of that last big piece of cash?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I'm here to tell you the dream is here. The dream has arrived. So we have been talking about contactless for probably more than a decade in this market. And we've had some false starts in this market where one side or the other has started to make some steps in that direction and it just hasn't gotten lift off. But the time is now and it really is going to happen this time, and I can tell you that for a couple of reasons.</p><p>Most importantly is that the acceptance side of the ecosystem is pretty well wired for contactless today. And that happened as a result of the EMV migration that took place in the U.S. a few years ago where merchants went through a mass reterminalization effort. Virtually all of the new terminals that went into the market had contactless hardware embedded in them. And it became then -- the decision around contactless for the merchant is one of do I activate the software on the terminal that I already have? And the vast majority of merchants are doing that.</p><p>So we see today, as a point of reference, 60% of our transaction volume in the U.S. originates from merchants who are contactless-enabled. So at 60%, that's effective ubiquity. And we see that growing. Large merchants like Target and 7-Eleven and CVS have all either added or have communicated their plans to enable contactless. So we think that's going to continue to grow. And at 60% of the volume that a consumer would originate, that's enough of a ubiquitous opportunity that it will begin to register with consumers that I can actually use this contactless device to make payments.</p><p>The other side of the equation obviously is the card side. There are devices, mobile devices in the market already that are contactless-enabled. Those will be complemented by a significant reissuance of plastics in the coming 18, 24 months, some of which is already underway. We've got a number of our issuers who have already put contactless programs into the marketplace. We have others that represent in total about 2/3 of our cards in the market who will be issuing contactless cards over the course of the next 18 months or so. We're coming up on the beginning of the reissuance cycle from the original chip cards that will help facilitate this.</p><p>Other issuers are undertaking a forced reissuance, particularly in areas where there are real catalysts for usage like transit systems. And we were joking this morning, the MTA is finally here. We've been talking about the MTA going contactless for a long time. Their pilot to introduce contactless payments at the turnstile is now underway. On the 4, 5, 6 line, it's live. And the MTA will introduce contactless capabilities up at all subway stations, on all bus lines, over the course of the next 18 months or so. They're not alone. There's another 15 or 18 transit systems across the country that are doing the same thing or are already live.</p><p>And we see market-after-market, when transit goes live, it's an incredible catalyst for changing consumer behavior and creating a daily use case for tapping a card, which is such a better experience than going and purchasing a closed loop stored value card. And once consumers start using it in a place like a transit turnstile, they start to look for terminals where they can use it everywhere.</p><p>And it's a great business case. There's a great business case behind it for us and for the banks. We see consumers who are engaged in contactless increase their level of usage anywhere from 30% to 80% is what we've seen in markets around the world. So we're excited about it. We're working really hard with our banking partners and with our merchant partners to expedite the rollout of contactless. And we see it as a really important development for us in the market here.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. Speaking of important developments. Apple launched the Apple Card with a lot of...</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes. It did. Communicated it.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Communicated. That's true. Communicated about the Apple Card with a fair bit of fanfare. The Apple Card is riding on Mastercard's rails. And you have obviously had a front row seat being involved in the development of that card. How should investors be thinking about the Apple Card?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I think the -- to me, the importance of this from an investor point of view is that it represents a really important sort of proof point of the benefit of investments we've been making in a couple of areas: In our technology most notably and in our partnerships. And by -- what I mean by that is with our technology, the Apple Card, the Apple Pay, there are a number of other examples of this, it rides on the back of Mastercard technology, most specifically our tokenization capabilities, fraud solutions and other things that are incorporated as well. But the investment in that technology as the basis, the foundation for them being able to work with partners like Apple and Goldman Sachs to think about how to deploy that in new and creative ways to meet the needs of consumers in the way they want to meet them. And Apple and Goldman are the creators of the experience ultimately then that their consumers will enjoy in conjunction with that card.</p><p>The investment in technology and the investment in those partners and partnerships and relationships have enabled us to then work creatively to develop this program that we think is going to be pretty exciting and it's going to be unique. And it's going to enable consumers to effectively apply, be approved and have a payment credential provisioned to their device and effectively in real time, which is a pretty unique experience, again, riding on the back of our tokenization capabilities and obviously other things that both Apple and Goldman bring to the equation.</p><p>To me, that's the significance of it. And it is one of what I hope will be many proof points in how we can utilize the technology that we're investing in, the capabilities we're building, the things we're acquiring to then work with partners in creative ways to meet the needs of consumers and businesses in ways that are consistent with the way they want to serve them, their strategy for deepening engagement with their customer base. And I think this is a very interesting and creative way to do that.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. Well, speaking of big tech. Another benefit you have running North America for Mastercard is that you're very heavily involved in all of the partnerships that Mastercard has with the major tech players out on the West Coast. Let's start with PayPal. So Mastercard is also powering PayPal's Venmo card as well as the PayPal-branded debit card. Talk a little bit about that relationship and how that relationship has evolved over time.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes. That's a great question. Our relationship with PayPal has evolved, I would say, dramatically over the last, I don't know, 5, 7 years, where we've always -- there's always been an important business connection with PayPal because obviously they -- there's a lot of payments volume that is initiated through PayPal's platform that has always incorporated the use of a lot of Mastercard products, and therefore, it's an important source of originated payments volume for us.</p><p>But the partnership has evolved in ways that has become much deeper and more strategic over the last handful of years. And I would credit that in large part really, I know Dan's on the agenda later today, to a shift in thinking that was very important I think under Dan's leadership in centering the strategy around enabling consumer choice. And with that, we were able to have a very different dialogue around how do we ensure that consumers are able to make the choices that are of most importance to them around how they pay and their knowledge of the products that they're using, et cetera.</p><p>So most fundamental to that shift for us was aligning around the strategic intent of enabling choice, which includes enabling consumers to choose a Mastercard product as their default payment product. They have other choices as well, other card products, and they still can choose ACH if that's what they want. But ensuring that there was clarity of choice and the ability to set Mastercard product as their preferred product, to know that it was a Mastercard product, see the branding and to ensure that we were working together to make sure we had the right kind of data flows coming back and forth as part of the transaction. So we knew we had the right transaction data that was clean, the issuer had the data they needed to manage things like fraud and rewards and that sort of thing and the consumer can see clearly what it was they were spending on. That was a really important foundation to build upon.</p><p>And while on the back of that, we ventured into -- we were the first network to enter into a global strategic partnership with them to leverage things like our tokenization capabilities to expand the applicability and use of the PayPal wallet. We've worked with them very closely to embed Mastercard Send as a means of moving money in and out of the PayPal and Venmo ecosystems. So that consumers can choose, if they want to, to move money easily into a bank account or to cash out value that they might have in either of those stored accounts.</p><p>And of course with that, we've built really important commercial partnerships with card programs and not just in the U.S. but around the world. PayPal and Venmo have debit and credit programs that are branded Mastercard. I think all of their programs are Mastercard-branded around the world. And they each had a great platform that, indeed, the consumers care about. And we see that in the engagement with those products and we're really happy to be their partner. That's all on the issuing side.</p><p>Of course, there is also a really important role that PayPal plays with respect to Braintree and the work that they do on the merchant side of the ecosystem. And they're great partners there, too, in terms of working with us to think about how to extend the reach of electronic payments and do it in the ways that provide the right kind of consumer experience, the right kind of security and fraud management.</p><p>So you may have the same question for Dan later today and I'll be interested to see what his answer is. But from our perspective, it's a really strong partnership and we're excited about where that can go.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And maybe just a follow-on on that. A unique component of, say, the Venmo card is that it's one of these prepaid debit cards essentially, right, issued against the stored balance in the Venmo account. We sort of see a little bit of proliferation of that type of model. Where do you think that's headed? Is that, in your view, a niche product relative to, say, the debit cards that are being issued against an actual checking account, where you've got these prepaid cards like the Apple Pay cash card or like this one? Those are -- now we see them in a handful of places in the U.S. Where do you see that going?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I think there is the potential for these things that started in sort of a -- in very distinct use cases. Obviously, a checking account that a bank might offer, a credit union has a range of functionality associated with it. A platform like Venmo as an example or some of the other P2P platforms had very distinct use cases around transferring money between individuals. But to the extent you have money at rest, in either case, it just adds utility to the consumer to increase the ways in which they can use those funds rather than just leave them in account -- in an account.</p><p>And then naturally it leads to a little bit of a narrowing of the gap, I think. I don't think they ultimately completely overlap unless some of those other organizations choose to become banks, which I'd be surprised if they did because there's a lot of other inconvenient things that come along with being a bank.</p><p>But certainly, from the consumer point of view, enhancing the utility of how they can actually access and utilize funds that are -- it's their money, as well as enable the easier management of funds. Some of these are evolving in ways that just help consumers with budgeting and cash flow management and parking money in a place that effectively gives them an allowance for a certain portion of their expenditures in a given month. We're seeing some models evolve in that way, and I think that's a useful development for consumers. But I don't think that, that ultimately completely replaces what we see in a full service DDA relationship.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And from Mastercard's perspective, do you care? I mean, are you pretty agnostic?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: We're agnostic. Our objective is to -- we want to serve the needs of our business partners in meeting the needs of consumers in ways that consumers care about. So we want to do that in the ways that are consistent with our brand in terms of providing a great consumer experience, widespread utility riding on the back of our acceptance infrastructure, global interoperability, safety and security, convenience, et cetera. And we work with a variety of partners, as you know, in order to deliver that. Some of them are commercial banks, some are community banks and credit unions, some are digital challengers in the space. They all have different ways in which they add value to consumers and businesses, and we want to serve the needs of that -- of those end users.</p><p>And by the way, not just through debit or credit cards, but through, as I said, being able to move money from any account to any account anywhere in the world and putting as much choice out there in the market to enable our partners to craft the value propositions that are most relevant for them in executing a strategy is -- that's what we're up to.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. So, so far, Mastercard has had a pretty collaborative relationship with the FANGs. However, at least else elsewhere in the world, a number of them have made recent announcements that feel a little bit more like they are treading in your territory. This is like Google with Google Pay in India, which is actually using the local ACH rail. Or Amazon's got now an initiative in Mexico centered around building like an Alipay-style payment network there. Facebook obviously has its Project Libra, the big cryptocurrency initiative. What's the temperature check on your relationship with the FANGs?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I would say we invest a lot of time and effort and energy in the relationships with them. They're obviously important partners. They, each in their own respect, have very sizable and influential and valuable franchises or platforms or customer bases that have an affinity for what they do. And therefore we want to be connected with them in enabling payments that utilize our products and our infrastructure.</p><p>So we work with them on a variety of things with a very regular and frequent cadence. Some of the things that you have referenced in terms of global examples I think are good indicators of -- and reinforcement in a way of why it is we're expanding the frame of how we think about the way in which we work with our partners and not seeking to force everything down a debit or a credit rail, but thinking more broadly about account-to-account. And there's lots of ways to get money from one account to another account and we want to have as many of those available to us and our partners as possible so that they can craft the right things for them to meet the needs of their customers.</p><p>So there's a lot of things that we do with the parties that you mentioned that are squarely aligned with accelerating or helping to move the migration of payments from cash and paper-based to digital. Almost all of them are completely dependent upon access to digital payments or electronic payments to fuel their business. And therefore, we have a real commonality of interests in terms of being able to enable that and make it available and accessible to as many people as possible. There's lots of creative things that we're talking about too, and we love to engage in creative conversations and we've been pretty open to thinking about how we partner with these players and others to bring new things to the market.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And just a follow-on question on that. In your discussion, your partnership discussions with these players, where do you draw the line or where do they draw the line? Like, where do you think about kind of what, in your view, Mastercard's role is and where you kind of wouldn't like them to tread or vice versa? Is there a natural kind of dividing point between what's a tech platform and what's the role of Mastercard?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: That's a good question. I felt we -- I guess I'd say we -- there's -- we're managing the payments ecosystem, the payments infrastructure and the Mastercard network with a view towards all of our various constituents who are a part of that, right? So there are areas where the role of the network is to look out for all of the parties in the ecosystem who are connected to the network and as well as the consumers and the businesses who are using our products and services.</p><p>So there are things where we see -- there are things that are particularly important with us that are things to tie back to what our brand stands for and what our various partners that we work with expect from us. And they expect us to make sure that things are going to be safe and secure. They expect us to make sure that we're working in ways that are compliant with the various regulations that our partners need to adhere to. They're expecting that the things that have our brand on it are continuing to deliver the right kind of consumer experience. They're expecting us to make sure that there's security and safety to the greatest extent possible within -- with different payment types.</p><p>And those are things that we have to come back to as sort of foundational principles when we evaluate and talk with partners about different creative ideas they have. And there are really interesting ideas that sometimes don't align with some of those foundational principles, and that's where we need to draw the line to kind of protect the integrity of the network and the integrity of what Mastercard stands for.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. So speaking of these platforms, many of which are facilitating e-commerce of various forms. E-commerce growth has been and continues to be a material tailwind to your business for the simple reason that virtually all e-commerce is made with card. But at the same time, it has a dynamic where very large volumes of spending aggregate through fewer large platforms. So how do you think about e-commerce, the trends there? And what do you see as the opportunities versus, say, the risks?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: So you're right that we see this as a real -- a very important driver of growth for the business. Just to put it in context, e-commerce is still a distinct minority of our overall volume. It's 12%, 13%, something like that of the total, but it's growing at 3 to 4x the rate of physical commerce. So that percentage is steadily increasing. And as you suggested, it is an important driver of the secular shift because there are fewer alternatives to electronic payments when it comes to e-commerce.</p><p>So our play there is all about ensuring that we're doing everything we can to make Mastercard, our products and our capabilities not just relevant but really compelling in a digital world. And that starts with, again, thinking it more broadly than debit and credit and thinking about how to connect any account to any account, doing it in a way that provides and ensures a really great consumer experience. And this is an area where, frankly, with the advent of a lot of these digital players who are the \"digital natives\" who have grown their businesses on the back of providing really compelling consumer experience, this is an area for us that's an important one to make sure we keep pace. And we're providing through our partners, whether that partner is a bank or a merchant, an equally compelling user experience and doing it in a way that ensures the safety and integrity of the payments.</p><p>So a lot of our focus and investment there is around, when we think about the payments occasions in digital commerce, there are ways in which you pay, you might pay through a digital wallet, you might pay through a guest checkout experience, you might have credentials on file that you have the card on file with the merchant that you shop with regularly.</p><p>The work we've done with wallets has been well discussed and we'll continue to do that. And wallets provide their own sort of unique consumer experience. Our work is now focusing very heavily on improving the guest checkout experience, which is not a good consumer experience today. That's the impetus behind the Secure Remote Commerce standard that we're rolling out in the U.S. later this year, along with the other EMVCo members, to create a much more consistent and user-friendly experience in the guest checkout use case to prevent people from having to type in all this information, their card credentials, their address, all that stuff, to make it a very seamless and intuitive and convenient process to check out while also being secure. So that, that particular set of payments occasions is improved and consistent, we hope, with what consumers are seeing elsewhere.</p><p>The card on file use case, which is a very significant amount of transaction activity, is a pretty good user experience but it's not as secure as it needs to be. And therefore a lot of our focus there is working with partners to tokenize those credentials and swap out the 16-digit card number with a token to ensure the security of those credentials while they're at rest in the card on file environment and when they are being used. And with both of those transaction types to enhance the security of the transaction with greater authentication capabilities by increasing the flow of information between the merchant and the bank so that they can make a better decision in approving transactions that are legitimate and declining transactions that aren't.</p><p>So that's our focus in ensuring that as the digital and e-commerce environment continues to grow, we're making that a great consumer experience in any -- regardless of the kind of use case in terms of how the consumer's paying and that we're ensuring that there's the right level of security that underpins the transaction.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And the big commerce sites, do those pose, like, a pricing pressure? Do those end up putting some pricing pressure back on Mastercard? Or the other question I always get about those big e-commerce platforms is, is there just a risk that they will essentially build, like, a closed loop system within the model, where you basically pay for and fund transactions, like, within the single platform?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Look, I guess there's always risks in terms of working across the ecosystem with partners of different shapes and sizes. And partners of different shapes and sizes exert different kinds of economic pressure. There are realities of economies of scale and that sort of thing. They exist in this market, too, just like they do in every other market. That's why we're engaged with them closely because we want them to work with us and not work against us.</p><p>We think we've got a tremendous amount of value to add in terms of the infrastructure that we've built, the acceptance network that we continue to expand and the capabilities that underpin the running of that network and the way we're enabled -- the way we can enable these new applications and new use cases, to do it in a way that can scale quickly and have the right consumer experience and the right levels of security. So that's why we're connected with these guys really closely.</p><p>Does that mean they always see things the way we do? No. We have lots of interesting conversations about different ways of viewing the world. But for the most part, I think we've been pretty successful in finding ways to collaborate and work together to deliver the kind of experience they're looking to as opposed to working -- having our paths diverge and go in different directions.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: One comment. If you have questions for Craig, and this is true throughout the day, there is note cards sprinkled around the room. Feel free to write questions on the cards. And we have runners in the back of the room that will grab them and bring them up to me. Or feel free to just pass them up yourselves, just I meant to say that at the beginning of the session and I forgot.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Can I steal some of your water? Just talking about that takes your breath off.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Yes, sure. While you're doing that, I'll queue up the next one.</p><p>The mergers. First, the big news in payments land this year has been the was 2, now 3. Had to change my little sheet yesterday.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes, yes.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: Mega mergers in this space. How will these mergers impact Mastercard? And specifically, at least a couple of the players have talked about the ability to do -- facilitate more bank-to-bank or bank transfers to out payments when they're bringing together the issuer side and the acquiring side within one entity.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes. So lots of interesting developments in the industry this year. Those are some pretty big deals. I would just -- I would say this, that all of the parties that are involved in these 3 transactions, the 6 parties in this transaction, they're all partners of ours, they've all been partners of ours for many years, where we have good and broad and deep relationships with a lot of commonality in terms of what we're trying to do because we all benefit from the growth of electronic payments, whether that's expanding the acceptance side through the acquiring activities or providing greater access to electronic payments products through the banks, the affiliate banks that they serve on the issuer processing side of their business.</p><p>And with each of those 6 parties, we've had long and constructive partnerships aligned around how we grow the pie together because when we grow the pie together, we all benefit. I don't expect that to change. We've talked to all of them obviously before their transaction. We've talked to all of them since their transactions. And there's a continued emphasis on where there are opportunities for us to work together to grow. So I think that's the base line and the foundation with which we will approach it.</p><p>And I welcome frankly having parties that are motivated. And they're obviously going to be motivated, there's a lot of investment that's gone behind this and there are commitments that are being made in terms of the value that's going to be delivered. And a lot of that value is driven on this by growth. And I think growth creates an opportunity for us to benefit from that as well. So in that respect, I welcome it.</p><p>The questions around the potential it creates, sort of an on-us closed-loop thing, we'll see. We'll -- I haven't had conversations with them specifically about what their objectives are there. I would say this. It's not the first time that issuing and acquiring will exist under the same roof. Many financial institutions have owned issuing and acquiring businesses for many years. And it's intuitively appealing to bring them together in ways that I assume must be difficult to execute because it hasn't been something that's proliferated when we've seen issuing and acquiring under the same roof before. That's not my intention to sound cavalier about it, but I also -- I think there is as much or more for us to do together to continue to grow the business and grow the pie than look at areas where there's potential diminishment of the opportunity for us. So...</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. You can hand this to me.</p><p>While I'm taking a quick look through these. One, you alluded a couple of times to Mastercard's Vocalink and Fast ACH-related products. You've also got Mastercard Send. Can you talk a little bit about the use cases you're seeing for these 2 products? What new payment flows they're getting you into? And then also how they participate in the U.S. market, specifically vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis Zelle, which continues to also gain some traction?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Sure. So I'll start with Mastercard Send. Mastercard Send is a product that basically enables us to reverse the flow of funds through our debit rails. So rather than pulling money through, we push money out. And that seemingly simple change in the way the system was architected enables us to serve a new set of use cases, P2P payments being one example. And Mastercard Send is a component of 7 different P2P products or programs in the market today, including Zelle. So I don't look at Zelle as a competitor for Send. I look at Zelle as a customer for Send because it's one of the ways in which money moves across the -- within the Zelle P2P system.</p><p>It enables us to help corporates with disbursements. And we've talked on occasions about how insurance companies are using this to facilitate claims disbursements, how employers are using Mastercard Send to push out payroll. Including with high-frequency as we see in the case of Lyft and Uber where drivers can get paid multiple times a day. We see it being used for things like disaster relief to get funds into the hands of people who need money quickly.</p><p>And so we're -- we think those -- there's going to continue to be great opportunities not just for domestic use but for international use. And you may have seen recently we've announced a partnership with Interac in Canada to enable to utilize Send for cross-border funds transfers. Bank of Montr\u00e9al will be working with us as well, utilizing Send in similar ways for cross-border transfers of funds.</p><p>So we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to extend the use of Send. Stripe's using it. First Data's using it. Parties that you might think of as being kind of competitive in terms of offering these services are really incorporating Send as part of the infrastructure to be able to push money out.</p><p>Similarly, with real-time payments, we're working through a number of different use cases that we're excited to bring to market and we'll be talking about in the months ahead in the U.S. The first thing that we're taking to market is the Bill Pay Exchange that will offer real-time payments as one of the ways in which to make the payment. We're looking at a number of other applications as well, principally targeting the B2B space because of not just the speed of the real-time payment rails but the enriched data that the transaction message can carry that will help with the reconciliation of B2B payments. So more to come on that, but there's a number of things that we have in development that we'll announce when the time is right.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And what is the pricing model, is one of the questions on the cards and one we get a lot.</p><p>How should investors think about the pricing model, particularly for Mastercard for these types of payments, whether it's send or whether it's using a Vocalink? Is it -- these are not interchange-based models typically. So how do you think about the economics to Mastercard?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: So the pricing models are going to vary across the different products and different use cases. It sounds trite, but we'll price for value. So it will be a little bit a function of the -- what it is we're substituting for in the market and what either the price point of those things we're substituting for or the cost of use is to the user. But a number of these things, you're right. They won't necessarily be interchange models. They will be more aligned with pricing -- per transaction-based pricing, a flat fee per transaction. Some of them that have a cross-border component will have an FX element to the pricing. Pricing will go to different parties, again, depending on who's realizing the value. That might be a biller in the case of a bill presentment. It might be a bank in terms of serving the needs of a customer making a funds transfer. It might be a corporate in terms of making a disbursement, for example, on an insurance claim. So we'll -- you'll see -- I think, as we go into these new areas, you'll see increasing variety in the pricing constructs that underpin our products.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. Two quick ones as we're wrapping up, from my cards. One, what do you view as the biggest strategic threat to your business?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I think the thing that we're paying a lot of attention to around the globe, it's not so much a U.S. phenomenon, although obviously we're very attuned to this as well. But it's the role of government and government interest in payments and payments infrastructure and things like restrictions on data flows that we're seeing in some markets. That's an important issue for us because it does force us to think differently not just about how we deploy our technology, but it will force us to think a little bit differently about how we manage things like the integrity of the network and the ability to add value through seeing and aggregating masses -- mass amounts of transactions to identify patterns of fraud and misuse and that sort of thing. So we do see the risk of governments getting a little bit more engaged in this and putting up barriers and walls, forcing -- and the risk of forcing some balkanization in the payments ecosystem as being not a particularly good thing and something that we'll have to work our way through if that continues to be a trend. We've seen it in a couple of markets and we'll see the extent to which that moves elsewhere.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. And finally, U.S. purchase volumes in your region have been running close to 10%. As you roll out contactless or maybe one of the other big opportunities we talked about today, where can that get to?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I will not quote a number. But look, we feel good about the things that are driving our growth. We -- consumer spending continues to be healthy, so we've got sort of continued benign macro environment. Hopefully that continues. We'll see. But so far, the signs of consumer health and consumer confidence and employment levels, all those things are driving growth. The secular trend continues. Things like contactless, the migration to digital, the continued penetration of small business and B2B payments. These are all things that are just kind of we see as providing continued tailwinds to our growth numbers and spending. And we feel pretty good about what the outlook there can be.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: And what's underappreciated? Just to wrap up. Investors often say, \"All right, come on, Lisa, we know Mastercard's got a great business. But what do you think?\" You spend a lot of time with investors. What would you say they should be spending their time on? Like, what is still underappreciated about this model?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I don't know that I would say it's underappreciated because people like you do a great job of pointing out the things that we're excited about in the -- with the Mastercard story. But I would just -- there's a couple of things I'd emphasize, and I'll try to be concise.</p><p>There is still a great story in the core, and that's true in every market for us in the world, including ones -- which is where I started, including markets that you think of as being fairly mature and fairly developed. There's still a great growth story within our core in driving growth and volume and revenue associated with debit, credit, commercial, prepaid. But there's also, alongside of that, there's a great growth story in things that can drive new vectors of growth for us we think for many years to come, in the digital realm, in things like managing digital identity, B2B which we talk about a lot.</p><p>We're in the very, very early stages of the B2B opportunity. We've been at it for a while with some -- with a narrow sliver, with the kind of B2B transactions that happen at the point of sale with T&amp;E expenditures and purchasing cards. But the mass of opportunity that's available in the accounts payable side of the B2B universe is one that I don't know if we even fully appreciate at this point because we're still -- we're finding our way through and assembling what we think is a really good portfolio of assets and capabilities and technology to go after it. That's a long game, and it's one that we think can really be an important driver of growth for us for many years to come, decades to come.</p><p>LISA ANN DEJONG ELLIS: All right. We will leave it there. Thank you, Craig. Thanks for kicking us off this morning. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Okay. Thank you. Yes.

On behalf of the entire MasterCard team, I'd like to welcome those</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>It's great to have all of you here and I'd also like</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>We know you have a schedule today. Thank you. So it's hard to believe that (inaudible) great. I hope they're (inaudible) all the best.</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>All right. Can you hear me now? All right. Very good.</p><p>Anyways, welcome. And -- so we'll just get started here. We've got a great program for you. This event slide.</p><p>As you can see, we're going to start with presentations from a number of our executives. That will take us through most of the morning. We'll wrap up with a question-and-answer session and then we'll take a break, grab a quick boxed lunch, and then we have number of breakout sessions for you to choose from. We're actually going to do 2 rounds this year, so we'd be able to go to 1 breakout session and then go to another breakout session after that.</p><p>In parallel to that, we are running our product showcase, so we have over a dozen product demonstrations for you to see. And I encourage you to go to that, see some of our product experts and see the innovation that we have there.</p><p>The slides that we are using today are in your handouts, so if you want to take some notes, they're there. And for those of you on the webcast, we have them posted on our website at mastercard.com.</p><p>In addition to the presenters, we have a number of other MasterCard executives with us here today and their pictures are in your handouts on Page 6. So hopefully, you have a chance to meet them and get their additional perspectives on the business. They'll be available in breaks, at the breakout sessions and in the product showcase.</p><p>In terms of logistics, again, we'll be in this room. This morning, we'll take a break shortly after 10 and then shortly after noon for lunch. I'll be back up at that time just to give you a little bit more details on the plan for the afternoon.</p><p>I would like to thank all the people who helped make today's event possible, the Investor Relations team, Gina, Tina, Jayzel and Sebastian, in particular, but there's a huge group that I just can't say all their names, so thank you very much for that.</p><p>And then without further ado, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations and other future events that could differ materially from our actual results. I'd like to refer you to our SEC filings for a description of our business and associated risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.</p><p>In addition, if we use any non-GAAP financial measures, you can find the required reconciliations to GAAP on our website and in your handouts.</p><p>So with that, let's get right to it. Please join me in welcoming MasterCard's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga. Ajay?</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA, CEO, PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: They say wiring matters, microphone wiring matters more than anything else, right? Good morning, everybody, and thank you for being here. I'm going to spend just about 15 minutes, hopefully, walking you through my view of how I feel about where we are and where our future looks like being planned for. You will see connections between what I'm saying and what you're going to hear over the course of the day from my colleagues as well as from what you see in the product showcase. That's obviously trying to paint the picture for you from our eyes.</p><p>So first of all, this slide is actually looking back. So it's interesting, but I'm going to move forward very quickly because you know this, and this is why you've been investors with us for many years and it's really our cumulative average growth rate of revenue as well as EPS that speaks for itself. We've done that while investing both organically and inorganically in the company. Whether it be the acquisitions that have enabled us to build out our capacity and our capabilities in terms of technology, geography, product, some forms of specialty that we did not possess earlier, or whether it be the organic investments in digital, in expanding offices, in growing geographies, in salespeople, in the training of those salespeople and how they interact with customers, those investments have happened while this EPS growth and this revenue growth has given us the ability to make that happen.</p><p>The TSR chart is an obvious one. The one interesting factor that we've learned from Fortune 500 -- the Fortune 500 actually that we were #4 in the last 10 years of TSR, which is great. But again, I guess that's why my photograph has appeared miraculously this morning on that wall up above. I'm convinced it will be gone tomorrow, when the next company comes to do a session with their Investor Relations. It's like when I was younger at Citibank, you kind of did these openings of branches, so they were foundation stones. I'm convinced that the same branch was opened by at least 7 people with 7 different foundation stones. Same thing will happen here.</p><p>But more importantly, all this aside, you've already read that deck, I guess, and you've all gone to the last page to see that Martina is going to improve the forecast of what we're going to do between now and 2018, so I know you are all very happy with that idea. The point I'm trying to make here is, yes, this is past-looking, but it informs us because we are determined to keep doing good stuff for the company in the coming years, that's what this chart is about.</p><p>So, those of you who have had the opportunity to be here for a number of years, you've seen us put up this grow, diversify, build chart. And truly this is what we're focused on. We're focused on growing our core business. That's the credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses. It's not a card, a card is just a form factor. Whether that's delivered through a selfie or a fingerprint or a phone or, tomorrow, through a connected car, or as you will see upstairs in the product demonstration, a connected mirror, to me, these are all just methodologies of delivering that same idea of consumers paying in advance, that's prepaid; paying now, that's debit; paying later, that's credit. There is no other way to pay. And so staying focused on prepaid, debit and credit is the essence of what we do. That, combined with the opportunity in commercial and the B2B space, which you will hear more about as my colleagues get up to speak, it's kind of what we are trying to do with our core business. Doing it in a way that our product teams and our sales team think seamlessly about digital and physical is part of what our team does.</p><p>So as a simple example, we're not trying to write APIs for products. We're trying to design products where the APIs are written as a part of the product design. So it's a whole way of thinking about how we deliver our products seamlessly, physically and digitally. And that extends to how we work in the company from everything from the way our personal expenses are cleared, where the idea is to not go through paper where you take expense receipts and you clip them with staples and you send them to somebody and they have to clear them, but you should be able to do all that digitally. That's what we're doing. So it's -- you're going to make your employees feel the power of digital so they can sell the power of the physical digital conversions that we are building in our products and services. That's how important this is to us. It's in what we're doing. So that's the core, that's what we are building.</p><p>There's a lot of opportunity there still. Cash conversion is still an enormous opportunity. I'm going to talk about it just now. But you will hear today from Ari about India, he's sitting right here, and Ling Hai about China as just 2 markets where the opportunity for cash conversion is still substantial. And we think we have line of sight to be able to implement our learnings from many markets and adapt them and have new innovations for those markets that enable us to convert cash in those markets. You're going to hear that from the 2 of them.</p><p>You're going to hear about things like QR codes and you'll see QR codes in the product showcase. Why is the QR code so important? It's really important because it expands acceptance in a much differentiated cost into a completely new set of merchants who traditionally have not participated in electronic payments for various reasons, one of which was the cost of acceptance. And this changes that dynamic in a completely different way. Another one was the infrastructure. If you're living in a country where phone lines don't work very well, terminals aren't your answer to the future of mankind. Then came mobile POS. Well, there are problems with that too. But QR codes allow you to go past that in a very simple way, and you will see demos upstairs of that.</p><p>More importantly, what it really shows is the comprehension in our company of how to construct our products and services at the front end in a way that suits the government and the society of the country we're operating in. We're not trying to give them American solutions for every country. We're trying to find solutions that make sense for the circumstances or what's important to that government, to that society, to those banks, to those merchants and to those consumers. So QR codes were developed out of Middle East, Africa and launched in certain markets there, entered into India. We actually facilitated the standardization of QR codes so that India could roll it out in part of the Prime Minister's method of getting cash out of the system.</p><p>What that does for us is the Indian government starts to view us as a willing partner in what we are trying to do together. As you know, governments around the world ought to have their own view of payments, how much of it should be run globally and openly and transparently, and how much of it should be around in a form that enables local governments to have some control, some methodology of participating and influencing the way the payment system works.</p><p>Some years back, we made sure that our country managers, whose bosses are here, the regional folks, the people who work for them are completely in charge of managing that local relationship all the time. Therefore, their sensitivity and their listening power has added many times to our capacity and our capability to comprehend what will make a difference for that country.</p><p>If you listen well, you can find solutions. If a country is telling you, \"We want you to put everything on soil,\" what are they really solving for? If what they're solving for is then the undersea cable from their country gets cut due to an earthquake or something else, will their payment system come down? That's solvable in many ways that does not have to be only on soil. And therefore, having that sensitivity built into us is a large part of our DNA. And to me, working with governments to provide them with the ability to do a QR code, to do financial inclusion payments in South Africa and Nigeria and Egypt and to also enable them to understand the importance of our global technology for their local effort, that is all inside this grow, diversify, build. It's the core and the foundation of how our brand and our people, and our technology, and our data interact in countries around the world.</p><p>The last part on this slide I want to talk about for a minute and then I'm going to get off the slide because it's longer than I thought I'd spend on it, I care deeply about this issue of being locally relevant for a global company, is that Fast ACH.</p><p>I was talking to some of you outside, you will see just now in the slide coming up of the importance of how Fast ACH plays into our strategy. So let me come to that in a second.</p><p>This slide, you can see yourself, it's in your deck. It just tells you that we are conscious of all the movement. You've heard me talk a little bit about the bottom one, regulatory interest and nationalism. You will hear a great deal about security and cybersecurity from Ajay Bhalla. You know that as a company, we have adopted a very serious thought leadership profile on that topic. It really matters. I believe that as the Internet of Thing progresses, this would become an even more important issue. Companies that are seemed to be on the right side of helping consumers get access to convenience in a form that is safe will be companies that'll win the next battle in this space. And so we are determined to do this the right way. That's kind of what that's about.</p><p>And services, I'm going to talk about just now. So first of all, why is Fast ACH important? It's laid out in the big picture of how our total market size and scope is looked at. We've always talked about the first part, the PCE, personal consumption expenditure, and you've heard Martina and me go on and on about how 85% of the transactions in that space are still not done through cards. That number is still 80% plus. That's -- it's lower than it was, but it's still 80% plus because the emerging markets tend to grow faster in PCE. And as they grow faster, their higher ratio of contribution to cash transactions biases the weighted average towards the higher number. That's a good thing. It gives us a runway for growth.</p><p>Now in terms of actual GDV of volume, it's about half, roughly, that's in cards and about half that's not. But look at the other 2 opportunities. Look at P2P and B2C, the things we're doing in Mastercard Send within Uber or a Lyft, which enables them to pay their drivers, that's a B2C example. Another one is at Allstate Insurance, where they are paying out people for their claims. That's another example of using technology to connect differently from traditional card rail connections to enable B2C payments to happen. To me, that opportunity in the P2P, B2C space, that cannot be tackled without thinking outside of card rails.</p><p>You can use card rails, but you also need the ability to use what's in the yellow bar there, ACH, and more and more quick Fast ACH, which is where the regulators are also going, in that direction. So that's kind of what we're looking at.</p><p>Same thing with B2B. Yes, we've done things with commercial cards, with P cards and teeny cards, and fleet cards, and launched cards, and virtual cards and card, card, card. But the thing is all that goes into that little orange line at the bottom.</p><p>To get to the rest of B2B, which is a really good opportunity, you need different products and methods which provide better data and better messaging formats for vendors and buyers to be able to pay each other's bills seamlessly. Again, you will see this upstairs in the demonstration hub. You will see a B2B hub that we are bidding. Take a look at it. But the real fact is when you add Fast ACH payments into that mix and you provide these companies the opportunity to pay by card, to pay by Fast ACH or to pay by check and to optimize that payment, that's when you win the game. That's what the B2B hub is all about. And you will year about all of these over the course of the rest of today.</p><p>Services. So I want to make sure you understand the importance of services and the context in which we are dealing with them. We've talked about this last year and at individual meetings between the year. I'm not doing services for the sake of being in services. We're doing services that, one, build off the core transaction. So we see the data that comes off the core transaction, remember, credit, debit, prepaid and commercial transactions. And with ACH, we see many more of those transactions. You use that information, those insights, that capability and that connectivity to the core transaction to provide services that can build off that and, at the same time, create differentiation and, at the same time, hopefully, create the stickiness in a number of the cases where we can hold on to clients the right way with this repertoire that we offer as compared to just credit, debit, prepaid or commercial. And that's what this is about. We do it organically and inorganically. Actually, the packaging and bundling of these is pretty interesting. When you do a data-analytics bundle out of advisers with something that users applied predictive technologies for testing and learning in addition to information and analytics, in addition to safety and security, you really get the client's attention. Because they're all dealing with very complex problems. They're not dealing with, I want to give a credit card. They're dealing with safety and security. They're dealing with cost. They're dealing with attrition. They're dealing with the cost of acquiring new consumers. They're dealing with a digital revolution. We can help with a repertoire of services that goes beyond just the core payment. That's the idea of what we are trying to do here.</p><p>And so I've got 45 seconds left, so I'm going to tell you what this slide is about. I think we have that significant untapped opportunity, which was the slide you saw with the 3-bar charts, not just in PCE, but also in B2B payments, and also in P2P and B2C payments. We are building the tools and repertoire to be able to go after the bigger opportunity that extends beyond PCE. That's what we've been doing. That's part of the strategy that we've been executing on the grow, the core while diversifying our customer base and building new businesses and new services.</p><p>Making sure that we understand the local market and understand the trends in that market, be it the use of blockchain, be it the use of QR codes and technology, you will see some of that and you will hear some of that when Garry comes up and (inaudible) upstairs and when Michael comes up and they talk about the products. You will hear it from the regions in their conversations as to how that's being implemented on the ground.</p><p>I continue to believe that it's the willingness to execute day-to-day while putting aside the effort, energy and money to make sure that we are focused on the longer term that makes our company interesting and unique. And it's a lot of fun to work in, aside from that.</p><p>So thank you all for your faith and your investment over the past many years. I'm going to get off here and pass this on to Mr. Michael Miebach, who will take you through the product strategy.</p><p>MICHAEL MIEBACH, CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Thank you, Ajay. Good morning, everybody. So our corporate strategy grow, diversify, build. The first comment I want to make from a product perspective is that our products are designed to enable all 3 pillars of this corporate strategy. But the starting point always is a deep understanding of who we are serving, and we take a distinctly different approach here with partners on one side and the consumers on the other side. So when it comes to partners, we take a partner-first approach. Partners, it's financial institutions, it's government, it's digital partners, it's merchants. And the partner-first approach very simply means, we're creating products and solutions that enable their business to enable them to serve their customers and compete in their market.</p><p>We do that with products that are really designed to do 2 things mainly. First is drive choice and the other is drive convenience when it comes to payments.</p><p>With regards to the consumers, we go a very long way to truly understand the consumer needs and to solve for the pain points that consumers have. So based on that understanding of what our partners need, what our consumer's need, we then design products that reflect those requirements. A differentiated set of products -- Ajay called out 2 of them, the B2B hub and Mastercard Send. However the course of the morning, you'll hear more about our products and you'll see more in the showcase later on, but I think we can safely say that there are uniquely differentiated product that only MasterCard provides.</p><p>Those products are then enhanced in terms of their functionality and their value by our diverse range of services. Ones that matter truly for our core product our safety and security solutions, make our products perform better; our loyalty assets; and the data analytics capabilities. You take differentiated products, you take our services, you combine that with a world-class brand, you get a pretty powerful combination. World-class brands, MasterCard brand, the interlocking circles, is amongst the top brands in the world, very well regarded, very well known. And I think that strong brand performance that we have is a reflection of our commitment to our partners and to our consumers.</p><p>So what we build clearly matters, but how we deliver against that matters just as much. So on the how question, the first thing I want to call out is -- Ajay touched on that before, it's the importance of our digital capability. So delivering what we offer in a seamless digitized technology fashion is absolutely top of mind for us. It manifests itself from a partner perspective through APIs. So every service and every asset that we have is exposed through a best-in-class API through a MasterCard Developer Zone. Take that same logic to the consumer, seamless digitized technology, what does it means there? It simply means the best digital experience everywhere with MasterCard, for example, through Masterpass. Now, stating the obvious here, our core products aren't just in the physical space. The combination of our core products, credit, debit, prepaid, this is our digital asset it's absolutely critical. More of that with Garry Lyons in a moment.</p><p>Grow, diversify, build. Absolutely critical to keep a focus on growing the ecosystem. So our focus on acceptance solution, making it easier for merchants to really drive the ecosystem, a big focus of our product strategy. And finally, the shift from a card-rail based company into a multi-rail network now enables us to provide an even broader set of product and solutions and it'd be a much more relevant partner to our customers.</p><p>It's, in a nutshell, our product strategy. Now advancing to next slide. So the $225 trillion, the 4x larger opportunity that Ajay talked about just now, take a look at the assets that we have accumulated across all these flows and you will see that we are enabled through all these assets to capture every one of these flows out there.</p><p>Now the reverse of the statement is also true. If you do not have all of these assets, you will not be positioned to capture all of this -- all of these flows and capture that opportunity. As far as I know, we're the only network that has that range of assets. And I think that gives us more reach than anybody else and makes us a more relevant partner than anybody else.</p><p>So let's take a look at our core business. Credit, debit, prepaid, commercial. I want to start off by saying we have grown share in 2016. And give you some perspective on that, we see strong performance in debit, strong performance in prepaid and in commercial. On credit, I would describe it as we're holding our own, with strong performance internationally and very positive momentum in the United States, where we're starting to put points on the board. We'll take a bit of a deep dive into credit in a moment and commercial, but take this time right now and take a look at how well we're doing in debit.</p><p>Debit is a fantastic story. We're outpacing the market by 1.5x in average over the last 3 years. And the way we're doing that at least from a product perspective is to create products that truly drive retail brand performance. So deep understanding with our partners require: improving the user experience, instant digital card issuance, for example, spend alerts that drive peace of mind for the end-user. That is the direction that we're taking and it works very well for us.</p><p>I'll give you an example here. Our partnership with Intesa Sanpaolo, one of the largest banks in Italy, a very innovative market and a particularly innovative bank. It is picture of the Italian market. Debit business there is dominated by a local scheme called Bancomat and debit is nothing else than a cash access to an ATM card. So Intesa partners with us and we're putting together a very feature-rich debit MasterCard, the next card. We bring it to market. It comes along with our priceless assets to drive engagement of the debit customer for the retail bank. It has MasterCard identity protection, drives peace of mind. All in, you get a very engaged retail bank customer of Intesa Sanpaolo, drives cross-sell for the retail bank. Intesa Sanpaolo is happy and the consumers are happy. And they are so happy they're paying for this product while the utility product is free, which helps if you're in a low interchange market. So a great example, I think, of our debit strategy.</p><p>Now let's take a look at prepaid. If debit was a great story, prepaid is an even better story. We're the undisputed global leader when it comes to prepaid. We've been innovating in products around prepaid for many years. We've just recently launched a very new prepaid travel product, MasterCard Platinum. And here, we take our multicurrency functionality and we partner that with some of the features of our affluent credit cards, which creates a very successful product that we're now rolling out around the world.</p><p>Now prepaid matters for a number of other reasons. Ajay talked about financial inclusion. So prepaid is the cornerstone of our financial inclusion activity, but it's also the cornerstone of our millennial products. It's the perfect entry product. Later on at the showcase you will see [Bloom], a really interesting product that is a combination of a digital prepaid account, a money management app and a physical card -- a physical companion card. And at the tip of your fingers you can manage all your money matters, sending money, receiving money, budgeting. It is now piloting here in the United States. Again, I think we're positioning prepaid for further growth, but we are the global leader in prepaid.</p><p>Now I think it's a good time to take a look at credit. So I said before that we see strong performance internationally. What does that specifically mean? We're #1 in Europe. We're #1 in Brazil. We're #1 in Mexico. We're seeing strong growth in Middle East and Africa, strong new account growth in Asia, and as I said before, really strong momentum in the United States. More about that from Craig later on.</p><p>I want to unpack credit a little bit. There's a segment in credit that matters more than others, one that we're particularly well-positioned in, which is affluent. Affluent grows from a market perspective 1.5x faster than the rest of the credit market. And for us, it drives 70% more net revenue in average than our overall credit book. So here, we have leading share in the U.K. and we're having nice traction in some of the other regions. I'll spare you all those details. You can read it on the slide.</p><p>Why are we so successful in affluent? It is because -- I come back to our deep -- under the point of a deep understanding of the changing consumer needs. You see all those trends here. That is what the affluent consumer is looking for. And we started to build product assets that cater to those needs, and one I want to call out, the desire for hyper-personalization. Everybody wants a solution -- everyone wants a solution that caters specifically to them. So hyper-personalization is really hard to deliver for our banking partners and our co-brand partners. How do we do it? Through technology like personal card link offers or MasterCard Benefit Optimizer.</p><p>Picture this, on your phone, the slide of a digital button, you switch on a benefit. I'm doing a trip this month, I want to switch on my lounge benefit. Next month, I'm not traveling, I want to switch on purchase protection. That is how simple and easy it is and those assets we have developed and I think they position us well for further growth in credit.</p><p>Recognizing different types of customers is important in all of our product lines, especially here we've seen some really good success in partnering on co-creation of products with our large customers. You saw an example here of American Airlines earlier in the video. That was a great example of co-creation, and we have more that we can share about -- share later in the U.S. section.</p><p>For smaller banks, they're looking to us for turnkey solutions. And here it's really end-to-end standardizations we can leverage some of our managed services assets.</p><p>So in credit, I think we're well-positioned for growth. And I think that is going to be a good story, continues to be a good story for us.</p><p>Now commercial, we haven't touched on commercial yet. Last year, I stood up here to talk you about commercial and it was with the focus on our credit products. Ajay mentioned it before, fleet cards, purchasing cards, all that, and we're having great success. We're outpacing the market by a factor of 1.3 in average over the last 3 years. But if you look at it through a different lens, it is really the smaller portion of the $120 trillion B2B opportunity that we have been successfully penetrating with those products. The much bigger opportunity is the $100 trillion opportunity in the accounts payable space. We've made some successful entry here with our virtual card product. Virtual card is really a single-use credit card that drives efficiency and effectiveness and control in invoice reconciliation and it's largely used by large companies.</p><p>So good success for us, we're taking that into new verticals. And it -- I'm very happy to say that we are the leaders in the virtual card markets, we're the only network that has that functionality.</p><p>Now when you look at $100 trillion and ask yourself, well, if that is what the large corps are using, what about the small- and medium-sized companies? Now the B2B hub that Ajay talked about earlier, that's exactly how we're getting add the needs of the small and medium-sized companies. What are they looking for? They also want control and they want efficiency and so forth, but they also want to get rid of the complexity of managing an accounts payable file. So B2B hub is nothing else than a fully outsourced accounts payable solution that optimizes payments across all payment types.</p><p>So for us, that is a cornerstone of our B2B accounts payable strategy. Needless to say, it doesn't stop there. As companies go more international, we will be able to leverage Mastercard Send and our Fast ACH capabilities. I'll talk about that in a moment.</p><p>So we talked about our core business. Think about the $225 trillion. What that actually means is, why us being able to reach all these flows, the total opportunity out there, we will be the one network that can connect more senders with more receivers than anybody else out there.</p><p>So let's now look at those products that enable us to really complete that circle, and that would be Fast ACH and Mastercard Send.</p><p>Now actually you will hear all the detail about Mastercard Send from Garry Lyons after me, but I want to head -- take one question head-on that you asked us, it's actually just asked before we came into this room. And that is you have Mastercard Send, why did you go into Fast ACH? Do you actually need that? Why was that not sufficient what you had before? I want to explain that to you. The first thing is on Mastercard Send, you have a P2P solution that allows to reach pretty much all debit cards in the United States, MasterCard branded and non-MasterCard branded. And through our joint venture with HomeSend, we can reach 100 markets in terms of cross-border payments. And the end destination points, thinking about connecting senders and receivers, cash out locations, mobile wallets, bank accounts, everything. So Mastercard Send alone is a truly differentiated product to start with in terms of its reach. But then you think back about all these B2B flows and the P2P flows that we laid out earlier. Mastercard Send will not serve all of them.</p><p>I'll give you in the statistic to prove that point. The World Bank has said that there's 1 billion bank account holders out there that do not have a card associated with their bank account. That's just in the consumer space. Didn't expect that there are many businesses that have a business account but they don't have a card associated with that. How will you reach them? Well, that's why we said we need to extend into bank account-based payments, go beyond card-based payments into bank account-based payments. So that's the answer to your question. I will now spend some time to take a look at Fast ACH.</p><p>We spoke about reach already, so I don't need to cover that. That's a particularly important reason to go on to Fast ACH. There's a few other things that Fast ACH does that I think we all need to understand. First of all, enhanced data. You have a data standard in Fast ACH called ISO 20022. It's a broad and rich standard, and I will spare you the details. But the important thing is regulators and national payment schemes are pushing for that standard. If your network is not enabled for ISO 20022, you have a problem to respond to those request.</p><p>On the messaging side, you think that Fast ACH is just a push payment. Well, it's a little bit more. There's some functionality in there in terms of messaging and mix and particularly useful for B2B and for bill pay. It's a request for pay. So if I'm a payer, you send me a request for pay messages. All the payment details, I look at it and say, \"That's exactly what I want to pay.\" And then you press the payment. Very, very helpful for B2B and bill pay solutions.</p><p>So we talked about reach, talked about data, we talked about messaging. The last one I want to talk about is, of course, speed. After all, it's Fast ACH. Now here, the difference to card isn't actually all that dramatic. Cards brought immediacy for many years, so does Fast ACH. The alternative is, really, now with Fast ACH technology versus basic ACH, suddenly, the utility of Fast ACH is a real alternative out there, and that's why a lot of governments and national payment systems are using -- are pushing for Fast ACH. You combined the reach and the functionality, now we have everything in a toolset that we need.</p><p>Now VocaLink was our route into Fast ACH we considered building, but then we felt to that, acquiring a market leader is the best way to go. It's a great team, good technology with proven multi-market deployments. The U.K., of course, the home market, Singapore, Thailand, the United States. So we feel we're on a very good track here with VocaLink. Question earlier in the audience was how is the integration going? It's going very well. We have David Yates here, the Chairman of VocaLink, and you can ask him all the questions later on in the breakout session.</p><p>So we have this capability now. How do we take it to market? We take it to market across all levels of the ACH market, and it's our desire to play across the 3 levels of the ACH market. It's the infrastructure level, the scheme and application level and the services level. Looks awfully similar than what we have in the card world, if you think about it.</p><p>So on the infrastructure side, this is really the technology layer. This is where clearing and authorization takes place and this is where VocaLink is exceptionally well-positioned. This is where all these RFPs are coming out from various countries to modernize their national payment system, we have the answer for that.</p><p>Now we want to be very thoughtful on where we want to be an infrastructure provider. We want to do this in strategically relevant markets but not in all markets, because in many ways, it's a country-by-country business model. A little bit more on the business models from Martina later on.</p><p>Scheme and applications. So we are a scheme for many, many years and we have a lot of experience in that and so does VocaLink by dealing with the U.K. scheme companies. The organizing body. So how do you organize the access to the infrastructure, the operating rules and how do you define the most appropriate business models to scale up the investment that everybody in the market has made? And we believe playing an infrastructure in critically important markets positions us to be a voice at the table of the schemes and be partnering with the schemes. Now what else do you need to make such infrastructure work? Well, you need products that allow participants and banks, for example, to monetize the investment and the underlying infrastructure.</p><p>In the world of cards, we talked about it. It's credit, debit, prepaid. In the world of ACH, it's applications that drive bill pay, that drive B2B, drive P2P and retail payments. We believe the focus is going to be around the world in B2B and bill payments, but there will be markets where retail payments matter. Case in point, the U.K., which is the home market of VocaLink. Here, our retail bank, Fast ACH-based solution called Pay By Bank app, I think we need to do a bit of -- maybe a few changes in the marketing of the name here. But Pay By Bank, this lies in the U.K., and you can actually look at it later in the product showcase. It's a pretty sleek user experience. It matters to us in the U.K. because our debit share is a bit challenged, so it's a great alternative for us and it's a great alternative for the banks to have another option for everyday spend.</p><p>In the U.S., we'll have to see where things go when the TCH switches on the infrastructure later in the year, but at least we're the one network that is equipped to partner with our banks when it comes to retail payments or bill pay or B2B, and we have the capability and we can have the dialogue on how to build the right kind of solutions and compete in this Fast ACH market.</p><p>Finally, services. On the services side, we have built a services business in cards. I told you about this differentiating aspect that it has for our core product, and we expect the very same in the Fast ACH space. There's a set of services that VocaLink has already developed. One of them is an AML product, anti-money laundering, which usually happens through bank accounts, you can see it in the demo showcase later on. We are extending that around the world as we speak, but there will be services in the safety and security space that Ajay Bhalla will talk about, where you can -- it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see they make their way into the world of ACH.</p><p>So a thoughtful go-to-market, the way you should picture this in the end is that in all critical markets we operate on all 3 levels, and it will take some time to build that out, needless to say.</p><p>So let's change the focus. We talked about core product. We talked about Fast ACH. Now I want to talk about acceptance. Now acceptance is critically important as we grow the ecosystem. Displacing cash is -- remains an absolute priority for us. And from a product perspective, we really need to provide the solutions that make it easier for merchants to accept electronic payments.</p><p>QR code, we heard from Ajay one very successful example. I give you another one. If we take every smartphone in this room, every Android smartphone in this room, and you were to able to -- you were now accessing your app store and you download an application that is basically turning your phone into a POS device, no dongle, no nothing, all software driven. We've developed that in partnership with banks and merchants, and that is something that we believe has a significant future because what it does is it lowers the acquisition cost for acquirers, makes it very easy to grow the footprint of merchants that accept electronic payments.</p><p>Now -- so more merchants will drive more acceptance. It's a first lens that we have when we look at acceptance. Merchants beyond acceptance. Now the more motivation we give a merchant to accept electronic payments beyond just the simple acceptance of it, what else does it do for me if I'm the merchant, the better it is. And I'll give you an example here, it's our installment product. So MasterCard installments provided at the POS, you go and swipe your card, and basically the terminal prompts you for a loan right there and you just accept it, here's the rate, done. Wonderful product, piloted in Europe and currently rolled out across the region. Again, another unique solution provided by MasterCard.</p><p>And finally, coming back to Fast ACH. In the world of push payments, acceptance pretty much changes when you think about push payments. If I send the payment from me to you, well, what acceptance has to be created there? It's already there just simply through the connection. Well, it isn't quite as easy as that. In such a world, there will be a whole new set of needs emerging. For example, how do I find you? In a world of all these connected senders and receivers, how do I identify you? So direct to reserves, for example, are going to play a very critical role in driving the growth of the ecosystem. VocaLink has that capability and is having some great success with its prompt pay service recently deployed in Thailand.</p><p>So let me wrap it all up. I have 1 minute to go. Differentiated value propositions, the hub, send, direct 3 services, installment, you heard about a range of them. I believe we can -- we are well positioned to drive further growth in our core business with these solutions. With our expansion now beyond card-based solutions into bank account-based solutions and a wide range of solutions in that space, I think MasterCard is really positioned to be that one-stop-shop critical payment partner that no other network can be with those types of solutions.</p><p>And finally, recognizing our focus and recognizing the importance of acceptance and the additional fuel that it brings to our growth by growing the overall ecosystem, I think, puts us in a great position for continuing share gains and continuing growth. And with that, I'm going to hand over to Garry Lyons.</p><p>GARRY LYONS, CHIEF INNOVATION OFFICER, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: So thanks very much, Michael, and good morning, everyone.</p><p>As Ajay wrapped up, he said there's significantly untapped opportunity ahead of us. And to my mind, nowhere is that more relevant than the digital channels, where we are seeing tremendous growth and tremendous demand.</p><p>Now by way of a level set for those people that were here last year, at a macro level, the technology, the landscape of the consumer trends that we talked about, they remain largely consistent since we last spoke to you.</p><p>Now as all of you in the room and those on the webcast know extremely well, everyone and everything is becoming more connected and consumers are continually looking at new technologies; they're exploring new ways of doing things. They're using multiple devices and then moving between these devices seamlessly throughout the day. And this behavior is increasingly extending into the ways that they determine how they're going to shop, how they are going to pay and beyond. And this is already driving huge benefit to our businesses. It's driving growth across all-digital channels. And for a high level, we believe that digital commerce is going to reach approximately 17% of all global retail sales by 2021.</p><p>Now in our border strategy, which Ajay outlined earlier and Michael added a lot of color to, our approach to digital remains consistent to what we told you last year. And we made significant progress across all 5 pillars. We are a B2B2C company. We take a partner-centric approach to everything that we do. We remain focused on helping our customers to win in digital, not compete with them. And we do this in simple terms. Firstly, by delivering a fantastic experience across all channels and all devices, so we allow our customers to deliver a fantastic best-in-class experience in developed markets via Masterpass, and we do a similar experience in emerging markets with both Masterpass and Masterpass QR.</p><p>Secondly, safety and security is absolutely critical as you will hear more about that from Ajay Bhalla. We focus on securing every transaction with tokenization, biometrics and machine learning, which is baked into the heart of our network. Basically, our approach is we want to deliver EMV-level security and EMV-level benefits through every device and every channel. And this has been augmented, some of the additions since last year, with the acquisition of both NuData and Brighterion, which Ajay will talk about.</p><p>Thirdly, and this is something that's Michael covered in a lot of detail, we want to address new payment flows. We have a goal here, it's a massive opportunity. We have a goal, we want to be able to move money from any funding source, cash, card, bank account, mobile money account, to any destination globally, securely and in real time. And we're making massive progress in this space. And this allows us to address new flows, B2B, B2C, P2P, P2M, G2C and so on and so forth, both domestically and across borders.</p><p>Fourthly, we want to make it easy for our customers and partners to leverage the money-digital assets that we have and to easily integrate them into their digital solutions. We have a best-in-class developer portal, which you can see at developers.mastercard.com. And it's the front door to access all of our services and as well as the tools to cost effectively take new solutions to markets.</p><p>And finally, within MasterCard Labs, we want to continue to bring our customers access to thought leadership, new innovation methodologies, new solutions, new technologies and the best and most relevant early-stage fintech players.</p><p>Let's dig a little bit deeper into some of the pillars. When we talk about delivering a fantastic digital experience, we mean enabling the consumer to pay, how they want to pay, where they want to pay, whether it's online, in-app or in-store. And we want to make the experience as secure and as frictionless as possible. The Masterpass remains the strategic priority for us, as it allows consumers to make fast, simple, secure transactions on every device and every channel whether in-store, online or in-app so to say.</p><p>Today, we have Masterpass live in 38 markets. And over the last year, we rolled out some new features. We've enhanced the browser and in-app checkout experience globally, and we've also made significant in-app platform improvements to make it simpler and faster for consumers to check out and for merchants to accept Masterpass.</p><p>The new merchant onboarding experience is designed to allow merchants to take less than 5 minutes to implement Masterpass. And Ajay touched on this area, we believe that what you offer is very, very important, but also how you offer it is extremely important. We want to make it as simple as possible for our partners to take advantage of our technology. We think about it as reducing the time to revenue. Internally, we sort of call this process 5-minute Masterpass. Merchants should be able to be live with Masterpass in a matter of minutes.</p><p>We also believe that we can go further and we can make it easier for Masterpass-enabled merchants to accept all cards and all brands without some of the confusion that exists in the market today as to what wallets they should support and how many buttons they need to present to their consumers. And we've made significant progress, as I've said. We're live with 140 issuers around the world. We signed some new issuers in the U.S. like U.S. Bank and Scotiabank, (inaudible) and Santander in Latin America, [La Caxia] Bank in Europe, Indosat PayPro and CIMB in Asia Pacific. We signed National Commerce Back -- National Commercial Bank and Credit Max in Middle East and Africa. But that's only one side. It's obviously a 2-sided market acceptance, it's absolutely critical as well. We've made massive strides there from an acceptance perspective. We've recently brought onboard Walgreens, AT&amp;T, Dunkin' Donuts in the U.S.; brought onboard Costco in Canada and Pizza Hut in the U.K.; Pizza Express and Shell in Europe; and quite recently McDonald's in Latin America to name but a few.</p><p>And in the showcase area, which I would encourage you to visit, you will actually see our digital-by-default strategy in action. And you get the opportunity to see all the various different ways that consumers can pay, whether online, in-app from a connected device. But one thing will hold true, we retain the ability to ensure that the issuer remains at the heart of this transaction, because we totally understand that the consumer has the trust relationship with its issuer.</p><p>We also see a massive opportunity to digitize the way consumers pay and the way merchants get paid in emerging markets. Ajay mentioned that we launched Masterpass QR, which is a QR-based payment platform. We're live in 8 markets so far, and we've technically enabled another 22. So we're rolling out in 22 markets -- 22 more markets in the very near future.</p><p>And in simple terms, what this enables the consumer to do is to scan the QR codes and effectively put in the amount to pay and push that payment through to the merchant in real time. This basically allows us to attack opportunities that traditionally were cash-only. As Michael noted at the end of his presentation, acceptance is getting extremely complex. So with something like Masterpass QR, you have the ability to offer acceptance in markets where traditional acceptance just isn't appropriate. It could be open because of high costs or a need to provide expensive POS equipment. So basically with QR, we are enabling our issuers to get into new flows and we're enabling us to grow significantly our acceptance space.</p><p>Today, we're live in Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa. We've got over 400,000 accepting merchants today. And by the end of the year, we expect to more than double that number.</p><p>Ajay also mentioned about BharatQR because we believe that standardization is extremely important. We don't want merchants to have to represent one QR code for our brand and different QR codes for our competitors, so what we've actually done is we've created a standard called BharatQR in partnership with the Indian government and the other payment networks, which simplifies the process for the merchant to accept QR codes. They only need to integrate once for that one QR code and basically they can support all payment brands. Now it goes further than that because we are also presenting standards for consumer-presented QR. This is the example whereby a consumer scans at the merchant, the previous Masterpass QR, but we are also enabling the consumer to present a QR code for situations where the merchant scans out. And we've actually done that as part of EMVCo. So this is going to join with other standards like the contactless standards, 3-D Secure standards, and tokenization standards, which we launched a number of years ago. So we announced the new QR code standards on July 20, and this is going to give us scale, but it's also going to ensure that the merchants have that simple experience that I already talked about. One single QR code for all brands. It's also going to mean the consumers have a simple and consistent experience when they go to pay.</p><p>So tokenization. So we think about tokenization as being absolutely critical to the heart of our network. So when we think about securing digital payment transactions and we think about enabling new payment experiences, we see network tokens as being a key enabler of this. So network tokens, I'm sure many of you know this, in simple terms, are an alternate payment number, which replaces the primary account number that's typically on the front of the consumer's card. So along with a generated cryptogram, this token is typically stored on the device or on the merchant so as to secure the transaction and to better manage the account life cycle. Typically, tokens are locked to a device or to a merchant, so basically, the user can control how, when or where it's used and the uses if they're compromised.</p><p>So we've seen significant growth today with our MDES platform, which is a tokenization service. Today, we have over 1,100 issuers live on the platform. We're live in 29 countries and we've actually seen significant growth. We've seen 60% growth in activated tokens and we've seen 140% year-on-year growth in transactions.</p><p>We're also expanding this service to provide tokenized card on file, enabling the merchants to have a network-tokenized token in their stored -- in their facility. It's giving the consumer peace of mind. Their real numbers are not stored with the merchants. And it also enables greater convenience for the merchant when cards expire or get lost or stolen.</p><p>In the showcase area today, you are going to see how we're working with auto manufacturers like General Motors and digital players to create context-transaction-relevant and personalized-commerce experiences that also present new opportunities and new revenue opportunities both for us and for our competitors. Ajay already mentioned the digital mirror that enables Masterpass experience and you'll also see the ability to pay directly from your connected car.</p><p>So let's actually bring this to life. So we've got a challenge today, and that's consumer and business cards are stored. All of us in this room, we have our cards stored in locations such as websites, streaming services, utility providers on connected devices. And we largely have limited knowledge or recollection of where these cards are, and we've even less control of how, when and where they are used. And we've actually just recently launched a service or a series of APIs that allow issuers to enable consumers to control how, when or where they are used and to add tokens to connected devices in a simple and frictionless manner directly from their mobile banking application.</p><p>So I'm just going to show you on my phone here. I've got my mobile banking application. I'm going to log in as normal; that way the bank can let me log in. I can see my cards, I can see my balance, I can see recent transactions, I can see my points on a whole suite of value-added service that Michael talked about in his presentation. I'm going to show you a card management service that we've created. So today, I don't know where all my cards are, but with this service, I'm able to see that my cards are with Penguin Music, All Night Gym, Seven Day Grocery and so on. So Penguin Music is my streaming service. I'm able to go in there. I can suspend the card, I can delete the card and I can get notifications when transactions occur. I can also set a spend limit. I'm going to set this to $50, I can set it per week, per month or per quarter. And I've just set that directly from a mobile banking application the ability to now control the usage of that card. But it goes further.</p><p>So my cards are also in my connected devices, my Smart Fridge, my Smart Ring, my connected car and so on. And I'm actually wearing the new Fitbit Ionic device. We actually announced the partnership with both Fitbit and Garmin at the end of last month. And inside my mobile banking application, I am going to tokenize -- basically, put my card number or token representing my card number -- into my watch so that I can use this for contactless payments. So I'll just click \"add a device,\" searching, my Fitbit is there. Select that, I can the cards that I have with that financial institution, my personal card, my corporate card, my debit card. I've being told not to add my corporate card. So I'll take that advice for once. So I'm going to add my personal card, I can set spend limits if I wish, I'm just going to confirm. And what it's going to it's actually going to create a token, a secure token and a cryptogram, and it's going to put it directly into my Fitbit Ionic, so I can buy you guys a coffee later on, literally by just tapping this at the terminal.</p><p>So if we can go back. So as you can see from this, it makes the management and the knowledge of where my cards are so much easier than what I've had before. We're giving consumers the ability to view the merchants and devices where the cards are stored. It gives them the ability to add a card to a device directly from a banking application. I can set spend controls and alerts. I can activate the suspend and delete devices. And I can do all of this directly from within, something I'm very, very comfortable with and all of us today have a mobile banking application. Now some of these services are available today and others are being rolled out to all of our issuers within the early and mid-part of 2018.</p><p>So this is not a duplicate, this is here intentionally. Both Ajay and Michael mentioned earlier, PCE is about a $45 trillion opportunity, and this has been a historical focus for us. We're actively targeting going beyond that B2B, P2P and B2C and they're significantly underpenetrated and are a massive new opportunity for us. So combined, as you've heard before, the opportunity is $225 trillion. So in addition to using the assets that we have on VocaLink that Michael talked about, we're going to bring these things together to enable us to go after flows that traditionally would've been unavailable to us.</p><p>So let me tell you a little bit more about Mastercard Send. So Mastercard Send is a first of its kind, interoperable global push-payment service, and it facilitates the delivery of funds quickly and easily both domestically and across borders. This allows us, so to say, to go after person-to-person, person-to-merchant, business-to-government and so on and so forth. With Send, we're providing a better, faster and smarter way to digitize flows. And as Michael mentioned, there's 1 billion consumers today that have a bank account but don't have a card account. By actually taking the best of Send and the best of VocaLink, it allows us to reach flows that traditionally wouldn't be reached with the traditional card network. And this is not vaporware; this is actually live in market, and we're actually partnered with some fantastic players. We're powering Facebook, Square, Zelle and Google person-to-person payments. And as Ajay mentioned, we've been able to fast secure and convenient disbursements for companies like Uber, Lyft, Allstate and Allianz. And it goes further. It's not just the capabilities of going direct to ACH and go and use in the card network. We have a HomeSend joint venture, which allows us to enable global B2B payments to bank accounts, to cash, to mobile money accounts. And recently, we entered into a partnership with Standard Chartered Bank in Middle East and Africa to enable an alternate solution for cross-border payments from 11 Middle East and Africa markets into key corridors, enabling faster payments across the key channels that they have, which are bank accounts, card accounts and their own mobile wallet. We also have extended our partnership with HomeSend to offer cross-border remittances with people like KEB Hana, Western Union, Atlas Mara, to name but a few.</p><p>So on to APIs. APIs are in my mind extremely critical. It's absolutely imperative as a company that we enable our services going forward so they work as well online, on a connected device, in a mobile app as they have worked on a piece of plastic for the last 50 years or so. And so we do this largely through the provision of APIs. And API is in simple terms are like the Lego bricks that you can join together to effectively use these services to create better solutions for consumers and businesses. It also -- not only that, it means you don't need to keep reinventing the wheel, but it also means you can reduce costs, you can be more efficient and you can also increase the time to market, which is absolutely critical in today's connected world. Now we went live with our developer platform about 6 years ago. We're extremely happy with the breadth, the depth and the maturity of the APIs, but we're continuing to invest in this. We're continuing to invest in this. We've got 6 of the top programming languages, so if I'm PHP programmer or a Java programmer or a C Sharp programmer, whatever programming language I want, I have the ability to quickly and easily look at the APIs, test the APIs, download the sample code, download the reference and limitation, and move extremely quickly. We've embedded -- and this is something we've done for a while, but we really, really formalized it over the last 18 months or so. We've embedded an API for everything strategy inside the company. That means that everything we create, if appropriate, inside the company, will have APIs. So some of them will be internally, so that we can actually plug our technology components together. They won't necessarily be exposed to the outside world, but it will actually mean that we can be better, faster and cheaper going to market. But many of the services will be available through the developer zone and they will be available in a consistent manner. Because one thing we set a standard or a bar in terms of what we expect these APIs to have in terms of sample codes, standardized documentation, FDKs, references and limitations, a sandbox, the ability to test that API literally 30 seconds after I go on to the site, prebuilt components and automation and test frameworks. So you see that we've doubled the number of APIs in the last year. We have 60 APIs across 40 different services, and we expect to double that over the next year as well, because more and more of the organization is opening up its services via APIs.</p><p>We -- if you're looking at the APIs, you'll actually see they're typically broken into 3 categories: payments, security and data services. And we've also opened up some new and experimental ones from MasterCard Labs. And over the last year, we've opened up things like Masterpass QR -- it didn't exist this time last year -- our blockchain, spend alerts and controls and also installments.</p><p>So the other thing that's quite close to my heart and a key part of our approach to experiment with new technology, it's to experiment with new technologies, to work with the fintech community and also to co-innovate with our customers and our partners using design thinking and agile development methodology. And we created our labs a number of years ago and we created it, in my mind, for 4 reasons: firstly, we wanted to look at the future from a fresh perspective. We wanted to understand how emerging trends, technologies and new entrants, new fintech players are going to impact our industry, and we wanted to be able to experiment and create prototypes in that space. Secondly, we wanted to be able to incubate new products and solutions in partnership with the product teams within the organization, but also in partnership with our customers. Thirdly, we wanted to embrace new ways of innovating. We wanted to embrace best practices. We wanted to drive a design-thinking focus into the organization. So the key thing here was experiment with new ways of working and then drive that into the core organization for scale. And then fourthly, and this is a critical one and it really came about due to customer demand, is we wanted to augment the innovation and product development capabilities of our customers. And we did that through our labs at the service division, which we created in partnership with MasterCard Advisors, and that allows us to enable our customers to go from a problem to a solution to market in a rapid time.</p><p>We've made massive strides across all of these areas, and you're going to see in the showcase area today that many of the initiatives that you'll see will have had -- some of them would've begun in labs or some of them labs would've been involved in. And you're going to see examples such as the connected car with General Motor. And you're also going to see a pretty interesting financial inclusion play, a product called Qkr!, which is designed to digitize and simplify the process of school payments in East Africa. And believe it or not, one of the biggest challenges in Uganda is school payments. So again, focus on addressing real problems, leverage new technologies, leverage new ways of working and work with the fintech community. And we have, in our Star Path program, you can check this out at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.starpath.com\">www.starpath.com</url>, we've actually worked with over 150 relevant startups. And what we do with them is we actually, in my mind, we happen to be successful, which is a key. If we do that, we win, they win, we actually get access to new ways of thinking, new products. But we also these startups to our customers and we partner with them to co-innovate and bring solutions to market at great pace. And we've done this with many, many of our customers around the world.</p><p>So I'm going to wrap up as I began. There's a significantly untapped opportunity ahead of us. And really, we have a very, very straightforward approach. Our strategy remains consistent with what it was last year. We think we're extremely well positioned to address this opportunity. I know this is a whistle-stop tour and we do have breakout sessions where we go into more in detail later on. But we enable -- we're prepared to address this opportunity across these 6 pillars: We want to deliver a great experience, enable our customers to deliver a great experience across every device and every channel; we want to restlessly focus on securing the transaction with tokenization, biometrics and artificial intelligence, which are baked into the heart of our network; we want to support the movement of money from any funding source to any destination securely, globally and in real time, we want to make it easy for our partners to take advantage of the services that we create, both our services and those of our partners and our startups; and we want to experiment and co-innovate with our consumers and partners and bring them access to best-in-breed technology companies; and then finally, as a B2B2C company, we want to be partner-centric in everything that we do. We do not want to sit in between our customers and their customers. We want to enable them to be successful in this new age.</p><p>So now, I'm going to hand over to Ajay Bhalla, whose our President of Enterprise Security Solutions. And he's going to talk about how we're securing and advancing e-commerce. Thanks very much.</p><p>AJAY BHALLA, PRESIDENT OF ENTERPRISE SECURITY SOLUTIONS, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Good morning. The world around us is changing at a very fast pace. And technological innovation and artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things is making a new world of opportunities for us and our customers. Ajay spoke about our grow, diversify and build strategy and how we are building our services business. I am going to share with you how we are enhancing and securing our ecosystem, how we are building new solutions to serve the needs of our customers and building a completely new services business for us.</p><p>Some key trends that are shaping this new world of opportunities for us and our customers, the Internet of Things. It's estimated that there will be 30 billion devices connected to the Internet of Things by 2020. It's a world of opportunity for us and our customers. 90% of the data that we see today has been created in the last 2 years, that is a lot of data creation happening. That also brings the opportunity of insights and personalization. We are seeing new concepts of cloud thrust in the sharing economy with companies like Airbnb, Uber, TripAdvisor, where new reliance on cloud thrust is emerging. And finally, all these trends are happening when the first digital native generation is coming on, which is completely digital, with multiple devices, multiple applications on and hungry for digital experiences.</p><p>Now while we get all these opportunities in front of us, it's also coming with some problems, expectedly. We are seeing a lot of cyberattacks on infrastructure, on many, many industries, many organizations. We've seen it in health care. We've seen it in banking. We've seen governments being attacked. We've seen payment processes being attacked. The Bangladesh Central Bank is an excellent example, where hackers tried to steal almost $1 billion and finally got away with about $100 million. The Mirai botnet attack, the WannaCry attack earlier this year brought big, large organizations to a halt.</p><p>We've also seen a lot of data breaches. More than 1.4 billion identities were compromised in 2016 alone. Now our customers and our clients are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to solve for these problems and are asking us for help with solutions to handle these issues.</p><p>So I'm going to share with you the strategy that we have to help our customers handle some of the issues that I spoke of. The payment ecosystem is a very complex ecosystem, with millions of merchants, thousands of banks, billions of cards and billions of transactions happening on the system. There is no single silver bullet to handle security in such an ecosystem. So what we have is multiple layers that help our customers to handle security and protect the overall ecosystem.</p><p>Very simply put, think of your own house where you put multiple doors, so there are multiple layers. So if one layer fails, the second layer kicks in. If second layer fails, the third layer kicks in and so on. We look at 4 layers to protect the ecosystem and our customers: it's prevention of infrastructure, devices and data against cyberattacks; it's detecting fraudulent behavior because we know that whatever preventive technologies we use, there will be some smart people around the world who will find ways to circumvent these technologies. So we've got a number of technologies, which help in detection of anomalous behavior; and then the third layer is experience. Now we can have a lot of security and we can have security which makes transactions very difficult, but we can also have security which creates for a very smart, seamless and smooth experience. So our third layer is focused on solutions that gives great consumer experience for our stakeholders; and finally, our fourth layer is identifying the cardholder, so that we know that the transaction is being done by a genuine cardholder. That is of extreme performance, especially in the digital world, where fraud is a big number now. It's 50% of the total fraud that we see is already from the digital world, which is only from a very small base of transactions. We have tailor-made solutions for our stakeholders, for consumers, for merchants, for governments and for our issuers.</p><p>Let me now take you through how our strategy is coming to life and how our stakeholders are embracing some of our solutions to enhance their own security. So if you look at the prevention space, we have the EMV chip technology, which uses sophisticated cryptography to secure transactions. That means that these cards cannot be counterfeited like magnetic stripe cards. We now have more than 1.7 billion EMV chip cards around the world. 77% of our transactions around the world are now done on EMV chip, and we believe that we will have most of our transactions on cards as EMV chip by 2021.</p><p>The U.S. has been our single biggest accomplishment in the last 2 years, where we have done a big migration to EMV chip cards. U.S. is now the largest EMV chip market in the world.</p><p>What we've also done is that we've found a solution to use the same cryptographic technology that secures the physical world to take you to the digital world to secure transactions that you do in the digital world on your mobile phones, on your wearables, so that technology is now powering more than 600 programs around the world. The Apple Pay, Masterpass, Samsung Pay, Android Pay, all these wallets that we talk of are all using our EMV digital chip technology to secure transactions.</p><p>In the detection space, Safety Net is our flagship product to handle cyber hacking at a processor or at one of the banks. This solution -- we shared that last year -- has really gained scale. We screened more than 48 billion transactions on Safety Net in the last 12 months. It's caught hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud, which could have happened at our banks. Just this year alone, in the last 2 months, it saved our banks more than $100 million of fraud that could have happened.</p><p>Decision Intelligence is our fraud-screening and risk-scoring product, which has our stakeholders assess the risk of a transaction. And if they do better assessment of a risk, that means better chances of approval of a transactions and that means better consumer approval for our consumers when they are out at the stores.</p><p>We've had large banks embrace our fraud screening solutions from Bank of America to Capital One to Ita\u00c3\u00ba. Many of these customers are using our fraud-screening solutions. We have found that our risk-screening solutions have been catching fraud 40% more than competing solutions around the world.</p><p>The experience phase, as I had said earlier, is critical to us. We have several interesting programs, which are customers have embraced from account continuity to IQ series. Account continuity is a program where card numbers can be automatically replaced at card-on-file merchants. We have Netflix and Microsoft, which has embraced, and they have found that their card declines have gone down by 30% by accepting this solution. IQ series is a solution which analyzes the spend patterns of consumers and shares that information between merchants and issuers, which enables better assessment of the transactions.</p><p>And finally, in the identity space, we verified more than 4.5 billion transactions in the last 12 months. And for merchants like Uber and Google, who are using this, we have found that globally we find that approvals increase by more than 10% when they use our identity products.</p><p>Let me now share 2 quick examples of how we are further enhancing our capabilities in some new areas. The world -- the new world, as you can see, is your watch is connected to your phone and your phone is connected to your card and your card is connected to your home and your home is connected to your fridge, your microwave and so on. We in this age see all these as secure transaction devices for us. Now to enable that, we also need to make sure that there is good security on these devices because the more the devices, the more the potential hacking opportunity for hackers.</p><p>We built a portfolio of solutions to handle the Internet of Things space, our EMV digital technology, our tokenization technology, our risk-screening systems are all solutions that help in this space. We recently acquired a new company, Nudata Security, which has some very cool technology in the device space, which enables us to actually know that it's really you who are using the device. Things like how you hold the phone, how you press the buttons on the phone, what kind of operating system are you using, all these technologies help our customers handle the opportunity in the Internet of Things space.</p><p>Finally, we are also leveraging artificial intelligence in a very big way on our network. Artificial intelligence is the biggest transformation our society will see in the coming years, and we have found it to be extremely useful in changing and enhancing consumer experience. We see mountains of data from consumer data, behavior data, device data, merchant data, ATM data. And artificial intelligence is helping us analyze the data better, get insights better, which results in better insights for our stakeholders, which results in more transactions and more volume and better consumer experience for our customers.</p><p>We recently acquired Brighterion, which is an artificial intelligence company. We have been partnering with Brighterion for some years now and know their technology well and have seen the results. And we are very excited in this space and are working on some very new, cool technologies for our customers.</p><p>Finally, in summary, we are very excited about this space. We believe this is critical for the success of our business, for our customers' business. We have a very secure ecosystem running, we processed more than 55 billion transactions last year. Hence, many of the cool solutions that I spoke about, like Decision Intelligence, like the IQ series, are helping us build differentiation and competitive advantage for us and are enabling new growth opportunities for our businesses and our customers' businesses. Thank you.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Please welcome President, North America, Craig Vosburg.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG, PRESIDENT OF NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Good morning. That video from American is actually a great transition for us. We're going to segue with content a little bit from what you've Michael and Garry and Ajay talk about products in terms of our products, our technology, the capabilities that we're bringing to market, the things we're developing to bring to market into the next 2 sessions that Ann and I are going to lead to share some examples of the progress we're making in actually putting those things to work, bringing our business to where it happens, making it happen on the ground.</p><p>So it's interesting, I don't think anyone's mentioned it yet. But it's literally a year to the day since we were last together in this forum, sharing our progress with investors. And I can tell you from a North America perspective, in that time period, a lot has changed, but a lot hasn't. One thing that has changed is that Ajay Bhalla took the slide-turning thing with him. Last year, it was on the podium when I got here. This year, it isn't. Thank you. He doesn't trust anyone with it, you're right. So this is what we deal with.</p><p>Anyway, a lot's changed and a lot hasn't. I'm going to start by talking through a couple of things that haven't changed for us, and in particular, what hasn't changed. North America continues to be the largest payments market in the world, continues to be our largest region at Mastercard and one that's delivering strong results. You can see that it accounts for 41% of our global revenue. And over the last 5 years, we've posted a compound annual growth rate in revenue of 10%.</p><p>There continues to be significant growth opportunities. You've heard us often talk about the things that drive growth for our company, things like expansion of PCE, expansion of electronic payments to displace cash and checks, opportunities we have to continue to increase our share and win market share from the competition. All of those things hold true in North America as much today as they have in the past. You can see from a PCE perspective, we -- the North American markets of the U.S. and Canada are posting solid growth, in excess of 4%. And within that category, which as we've mentioned, has typically been where we've focused a lot of our attention over the years, we still have opportunity to expand the penetration of electronic payments too, expand the height of orange bar to penetrate a greater percentage of PCE and win share within that. And I will touch on our progress with respect to those things this morning.</p><p>What also is true is we continue to have a significant untapped opportunity to penetrate into new payments flows, specifically in B2B, P2P and B2C. And if you look at the magnitude of those bars, 40% of North American payments flows, $23 trillion, are still in cash and check. Another 40%, $24 trillion in flows, are in ACH. So as Michael, Garry, Ajay have alluded to already, we are developing the capabilities and products to go after those in an aggressive way and we think that gives us some very significant runway to continue to grow our business not just globally, but in these important markets for us in North America.</p><p>So I'm going to talk a little bit about how we're doing that. This is another thing that hasn't changed since last year, so for those of you who were here last year, you'll recognize this slide. I think I used the same one. It lays out the things that we are focusing on as priorities to grow our business in North America, and these haven't changed. You can see they align with our global strategy of grow, diversify and building our business. And there are 5 areas in particular that we're driving to grow our business here: One is expanding product distribution across all of our core products that Michael talked about, principally through our issuing partners; the second is expanding acceptance into new verticals and new segments; the third is driving digital, winning in digital as a means of driving growth in our core business; fourth is scaling services to deliver value-added to our customers, both to help us grow the core and generate incremental revenues; and then finally, building the new payments businesses to go after those B2B, P2P and B2C opportunities that we've talked about.</p><p>So I've spent a little bit of time talking about things that haven't changed. You may be asking yourselves what actually has changed in the last year? And what has changed is the progress that we've made against each of these 5 areas. With some tangible results in each that I'm going to share as I go through each of these in turn over the next few minutes. So let me start with product distribution. This is really where it all begins with our business in getting products into the market through our partners. And let me just start by saying while it's easy to focus on individual deals as examples of making progress in product distribution, I want to emphasize, for our business in North America, as is the case in the rest of the world, we're fortunate to have a very broad base of high-quality partners that we work with. And a broader -- which gives a broad and solid foundation upon which to build the business. That being said, there are specific examples of progress, and I'll go through each of the core product areas in turn here. In the United States, with U.S. consumer credit, we are positioned to grow our share with 6 of the top 8 consumer credit issuers who collectively represent about 2/3 of the 4-party market. And we feel very good about the progress that we're making there. As an example, and this is an example of a specific deal, I'm pleased to announce that beginning next year, new Bank of America cash-rewards credit cards and non-rewards credit cards will be Mastercard branded. This win adds to our growing partnership with Bank of America, which covers all of their payments business lines. And one that we're particularly excited about, given the importance of these products in the bank's portfolio and the presence that they have across all of the bank's acquisition channels. Now that's in addition to partnerships that we've renewed over the course of this year with partners like SunTrust, Santander, Huntington, to name a few, as well as growth that's been driven by the product propositions we're putting in the marketplace. Michael talked about some specific credit product platforms, and in particular those that are most relevant for the affluent segment. Our World and World Elite product platforms are helping us to grow share with important partners like Citibank, Capital One, Barclays and HSBC in the U.S., and in Canada, with Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada. And in fact, in Canada, over the course of the last 3 years, we've increased our market share by 400 basis points, so, pleased with the progress there.</p><p>Let me touch briefly on co-brands. You've heard us often talk about co-brands, and Ajay has shared some results that we've announced over the last several quarterly earnings calls. Co-brands continue to be a really important part of our business. In the U.S., we've won 25 new programs in the last 2.5 years, including the largest global co-brand program with American Airlines, the great partner you heard from at the start of this segment, and recently announced wins with Kroger, which we won in partnership with U.S. Bank. A new program with both Belk and PayPal, both of which we are working with</p><p>Synchrony.</p><p>So we are very happy about that. If you look over the course of the last 4 years, we have launched almost 40 co-brand programs in North America, including 14 conversions from other networks, and those represent programs that have converted from all of the other networks. And we've had more conversions than any network. So we're very happy with the progress there.</p><p>Debit also continues to be a really important part of our business. In the U.S., as you all know, things change significantly in the debit landscape post Durbin, which has resulted in us really having to win in 2 steps. The first step is making sure we have Mastercard available on debit cards as a routing option either on the front or the back of a card. The second step is making sure that routing option is exercised by a merchant or an acquirer and that the transaction comes our way.</p><p>With respect to getting our brand and our network enabled on cards, we are available as an option on more than 60% of all debit cards in the U.S. market. I'll say that again, more than 60% of all cards, which we feel really good about. And we're continuing to grow that with renewed or new partnerships, expanded partnerships, in many cases, with partners like Capital One, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, SunTrust, Huntington and Bank of the West, to name a few. In Canada, we launched Debit MasterCard, and we're seeing good momentum there with more than 1 million cards in the market at this point.</p><p>Commercial also continues to be a real bright spot in our portfolio. We work across the leading players in the commercial space, including the major wholesale banks like Citi, Chase and Bank of America, and with commercial specialists like WEX and FLEETCOR. And I am happy to share that we're growing our market share with 3 of the top 4 players in the commercial space. And in Canada, we're growing at twice the rate of the market, so, progress there is well.</p><p>And finally, last but not least. Prepaid's also an important part of our overall portfolio. In the U.S., we enjoy some really strong presence as the exclusive brand on the largest prepaid program in the market, with Direct Express. The prepaid payroll program for the largest employer in the country, with Walmart. The brand on the largest prepaid tax program, with H&amp;R Block. And we're well positioned in working with program managers across the market to continue to expand our presence in payroll programs, in government and social benefits distribution, and in the healthcare sector, with HSC. So all in all, we're feeling good about the progress on the product distribution front.</p><p>Let me turn my attention now to acceptance as the second priority. Acceptance, it's interesting. It's hard to overstate the importance of acceptance in our business and growing it is a priority for us not just in the U.S. but everywhere around the world. This is an area where, again, we continue to make great progress and you can see the slope of the curve here. Our acceptance network is unsurpassed globally, and it's unsurpassed in the United States and North America overall, where we have more than 10 million acceptance locations. You can see there's been some inflection points as we've continued to expand the number of locations where MasterCard is accepted. That's been driven by a number of things: One has been our continued focus on working with partners in underpenetrated verticals, areas like health care, areas like charitable organizations, rent payments, education, that haven't traditionally been cards-accepting merchant categories, but where we continue to make progress in expanding the availability of the Mastercard network as a means to</p><p>make payment.</p><p>We're also working increasingly with partners who are bringing new merchants and new segments into the ecosystem with new technology, whether that's a lower-cost technology to enable acceptance, as has been the case with Square bringing so many in, or a technology platform that reaches a long tail of merchants in a new category like e-commerce, where partners like Stripe and Braintree have been essential in helping us expand the reach of the network. Embedded within this, I will point out the CAGR here before I go on, growing acceptance by 11% on a compound-annual basis over the last 4, 5 years. That's a number we feel pretty good about, given the length of time that we've at it in these markets and what you might think of as the relative maturity of the U.S. and Canada as electronic payments markets. We're growing at a nice clip and we've got even more room more to grow. And we're continuing to work hard to make sure we're doing that. At the same time, we are working within that universe to ensure that we've got good penetration of Masterpass acceptance. That's embedded within these numbers. Garry shared some of the major merchants as a few examples of those who are accepting Masterpass. We are also working not just with individual merchants but, importantly, with our partners that help scale in larger numbers by offering Masterpass to a greater number of merchants seamlessly. Braintree, for example, now has Masterpass live in its technology stack and available to its customers as an option to accept payments. We've announced partnerships with both [Vancive] and First Data to make Masterpass available within their technology platforms and on their gateways. And in Canada, Masterpass will be available as a standard offering with several of the leading acquirers in the market starting in 2018. So we're making good progress there. I fully anticipate that as we continue to look at this in the future, the trajectory of this is going to change even more steeply, given what we've been talking about this morning with the Internet of Things, the advent of connected commerce. When we think about acceptance moving from merchant locations to connected devices, it completely changes the frame in terms of where our network can reach and where it can enable payments to be transacted. And we're excited about the possibilities that that brings for us and our business. We're preparing and investing in the kinds of capabilities that Michael and Garry talked about to make sure that the products are there and that Ajay talked about to make sure they are safe and secure, so that as connected commerce continues to expand, we're positioned to be the backbone of payments capabilities within that universe. So good progress on the acceptance front. The -- actually the conversation about the Internet of Things is a nice segue into the next priority area, which is digital.</p><p>A lot of our work in digital, you hear us talk about Masterpass a lot. Masterpass is obviously a very important part of our digital strategy. But there's much more to it than that when think about how we are driving towards the digital future. An important aspect of this is taking a lot of the capabilities that you heard Garry talk about that are enabling both us and our partners to prepare for and participate in a digital future, and making sure we're getting them out across the marketplace through our partners to enable their businesses. And we are making great progress there as well in a couple of particular areas.</p><p>Our tokenization capability with MDES is now available to 80% of our accounts in North America. MasterCard Express, which is the program that sort of the franchise rules, if you will, that govern the rules of the road for how tokens are used how -- by those who create them as well as those who request their use for using all of these connected kinds of environments, whether that's a wallet or a connected device, is also scaling nicely with more than 600 participants in that program today and growing rapidly. And we've got more than 40 million accounts enabled on Masterpass through our digital-by-default approach that you've heard us talk about on a number of occasions. The recent launch of Citi Pay is a great example of this that we're very excited about and if you happen to be a Citi credit card customer and you haven't signed up yet for Citi Pay Masterpass, I'd encourage you to do so. It's a terrific experience.</p><p>Other things that we're looking at in the digital space and working hard, continuing to engage with partners across the ecosystem, whether those are wallet players, whether those are e-commerce players, whether those are gateways, other kinds of service providers that are helping to expand the digital universe. We're working closing with their mono variety of things, including commercial partnerships, setting standards, distribution partnerships, marketing arrangements, et cetera. And we are working closely with those players who are at the forefront of creating that digital future of the Internet of Things and connected commerce. A couple of examples here that you'll see later in the demo area with General Motors and Marie Claire, both of which have been referred to earlier with the connected car. And a new sort of retail experience, where you can shop literally on a mirror or on a window. And other partners like Cisco, Intel and Fitbit, many other who we're with to bring to market new retail experiences and new payment experiences that our consumers can take advantage of.</p><p>Next area is services. You've heard us talk a lot about services over the course of the last couple of years. The relevance -- the significance for us here is developing these great capabilities that help us differentiate our offerings to our customers both to help us win more share of our core business and drive growth in our core credit, debit, commercial and prepaid businesses as well as deliver incremental revenues. And the main takeaway here is that we're having success in scaling these things. If you look across our portfolio of services, we are consistently deepening the penetration of those services within our customer base in North America. So with the MasterCard Advisors, for example, more than 50% of our large customers are working with MasterCard Advisors on a variety of topics, including things like digital payment strategy, on portfolio optimization, on an enterprise information management and other topics.</p><p>Our data and analytics services, which includes everything from macro-economic data to portfolio-specific data to APT and the kinds of things we do with APT on an individual counter-party basis to look at, test and evaluate the effectiveness of different campaigns, different investment options so the decisions can be made on a more-informed basis and increase the ROI of those decisions. We've got more than 60% of our customers in North America using those kinds of services. The fraud solutions, that Ajay just talked about, almost half of our transactions in North America are utilizing optional fraud services that either issuers or merchants are deploying as part of their processes to help them identify and eliminate fraudulent transactions and, importantly, make sure that we're approving transactions that are in fact legitimate transactions and not being declined because of unnecessarily restrictive parameters set around those approvals. And that's in addition to things that are available across all of our transactions like Safety Net that Ajay talked about.</p><p>Loyalty. We've got 65 million accounts on our loyalty platform. Our processing business continues to grow and is a key enabler in helping us connect to partners, deliver our products and solutions, enable growth on the Internet of Things strategy, and labs as a service, as Garry talked about, is consistently in high demand by our customers and is really helping us differentiate with our partners and working on their innovation agenda, so, good progress there as well.</p><p>I am going to pause for a minute before I go on to the fifth area, and just talk a little bit about how some of these things come together. I've been talking about our core products, acceptance, services, digital as if they are discrete, which of course they are not. The real power of these things comes when we bring them together to work with our partners and utilize them to address the needs that are most relevant to them. And I've got 3 examples here of ways in which these things are coming together to help us serve some of our most important partners more effectively. The first that you see is PayPal. Of course, last year, we announced an agreement with PayPal that enables MasterCard products to be established as a default payment option within the PayPal wallet. We've seen an increase in MasterCard transactions as a result of that and have since expanded that relationship with them to include Asia Pacific and Europe. But our relationship with PayPal goes way beyond that. And I've talked about Braintree and the availability of Masterpass and their technology stack. PayPal is using Mastercard Send as a way to help distribute or disperse funds from the PayPal wallet into consumers' DDA accounts. PayPal is leveraging our core product platforms in consumer credit and debit as the basis for putting co-brand programs into the marketplace for both consumers and small businesses. And in fact every co-brand program that PayPal has in the United States is Mastercard branded.</p><p>American Airlines, you heard about it at the top of this segment. A terrific partner who we not only align with on values, as Kurt said in the video, but we're also aligned on an awful a lot of really exciting business opportunities. American is taking advantage of things like MasterCard Advisors, APT, our loyalty platform, and our marketing assets to drive deeper engagement with consumers and not just consumers who are cardholders, but consumers who are also buyers of airline tickets. So we're working with them to grow both the cards portfolio and their core business.</p><p>And finally, Citibank. Citi with whom we enjoy a very broad relationship across the branded cards business, Citi retail services, the retail bank with the debit portfolio as well as treasury and trade services, where we have a commercial partnerships with them, Citi is utilizing a broad range of capabilities as well including data analytics and fraud solutions to help optimize the performance of those portfolios. And as you'll hear a little bit later in the video from them as well, Masterpass and MDES as the backbone of creating and launching the Citi Pay wallet. And that's a terrific example of collaboration on what has been a very important initiative for both of us.</p><p>So back to priority number 5, building new payments businesses. You've heard a lot about this, so I want belabor these points, I will just call out a couple of things for you to note. One, you see an awful a lot of these things stacked against B2B, which we're excited about. Because as we've often discussed, B2B is an enormous opportunity that is very underpenetrated at this point from a cards perspective. We continue to have cards products that we market into the B2B space, and we are doing that effectively with TNE cards, procurement cards, virtual cards, where, in each case in North America, we're growing at a rate faster than our forecast of market growth, so we think we're gaining share there, but, again, the applicability of those products is to a relatively small subset of the overall B2B opportunity. So expanding that solution set with the kinds of capabilities Michael talked about is really important in helping us get after that.</p><p>Mastercard Send and Homesend, Garry touched on this. It has -- these 2 things combined actually have applicability across each of these areas of new flows. Across border example that Garry talked about with Standard Chartered is also something that we have coming to market with partners in the U.S. and Canada. The P2P applicability of Mastercard Send is live in market with EWS as part of the Zelle solution. And the B2C capability of that continues to grow as well. So -- and we're doing that in working as we were with Masterpass distribution, working with partners who can help us get that to scale quickly across the market. We have reseller agreements in place with the likes of Wells Fargo, with Stripe, with Green Dot, who are offering these to their customers as part of their product proposition and we're excited about that.</p><p>We're also finding new applications for this literally every day. And I will mention one that we are hopeful is going to be live tomorrow and that is utilizing Mastercard Send, working with a major aid agency to help disperse aid to those in need as a result of Hurricane Harvey and, potentially, Hurricane Irma. There are needs that people have that are difficult to meet when disaster strikes through established financial intermediation channels. And Mastercard Send is a great example of being able to meet those flexibly, quickly and seamlessly for consumers.</p><p>So the B2B hub, you've heard what that is. The key point here for us in North America is that we are out there in the marketplace. We've got an active pipeline of conversations with a number of important partners. Several of whom are moving to the contract stage. So we feel good about that. And Fast ACH is coming live to a theater near you in North America, in the U.S. quickly, as a result of the work the Clearing House is doing on their real-time payments platform. And we look forward to working with the Clearing House and its member banks to develop applications for that technology to be used in this market very, very soon.</p><p>So in summary, I would say that North America continues to be a strong market for us and one with significant opportunity for growth in growing the core and expanding our presence in the digital realm and continuing to penetrate these new flows that we've assembled a great portfolio of products and technology to go after. We're fortunate in these markets to have a terrific roster of partners who continue to invest in growing their payments business, and we continue to invest in capturing a greater share of that business. And we're working with them to both accelerate and sustain our momentum in these markets, both now and in the future, so we can deliver the kind of results you've come to expect from us.</p><p>And with that, I will close on North America, and I believe we will head to a break.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will take a 10-minute break. Our session will resume at 10:36. If you are participating by webcast, there is no need to reconnect, just stay on the line. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS, PRESIDENT OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Hello, everyone. It's always great to be back after the coffee break. At least you've all had a chance to stretch and get some sustenance. So this is a great video actually from London. And I use the underground every day that I'm in London, and it truly is a wonderful, contactless experience. It works with your card, with your phone, and I often think that contactless is the first step actually into digital because it's a very easy step to make from the tapping your card to actually using your telephone.</p><p>And we have a fantastic opportunity across the whole of International Markets. You heard Craig talk about the North American strategy. Ours is somewhat similar, as you would expect. But we have the great opportunity to actually replicate things across over 200 countries. And with that comes also great challenges because we're actually dealing with many local and global competitors and we're also dealing with lots of different regulators. And we're dealing with increasingly nationalistic regimes around the world. I mean, Ajay we started by talking about on [silent], what does this really mean? So these are the kinds of questions that we look at as we're trying to roll out our capability on a global basis.</p><p>The transit video is really great because I think it's serves to illustrate that in our world, we're dealing with a fast-changing, dynamic, young population who are digitally savvy and adopting new ways to pay. We absolutely have 100 cities that we're working on across the world, and many of them are rolled out already. And the thing about this is that we're actually creating infrastructures that build MasterCard into the fabric of the smart cities of the future, which is a really exciting proposition.</p><p>Now let's look a little bit at the financial side of things. I actually love this new format that we've got to look at our business here in terms of trillions of flow. And you see here that the PCE in our world is pretty big. It's 31 trillion PCE. And not only that, but it's actually growing at a rate of 7% a year, which is pretty great. But apart from that, if you look at the B2B space and you look at the P2P and B2C, that's $140 trillion worth of flow that we can now go after. And just to kind of put that in perspective, that's about 3.5x the flow in this space that you have in North America. But remember, it is the rest of the world, but it's a great opportunity.</p><p>And of course, it brings challenges, but what I would say is that over the last 5 years, we've been growing at a compound growth rate of 15% in International Markets, which is way outstripping the PCE growth, and it's creating a very healthy margin of growth. And the reason for this is not only are we seeing the secular shift of cash to electronic, but actually, we're seeing real share gains in practically every geography in the world, which is really encouraging.</p><p>What's more? The future is very bright, because many people in our markets are young. They're already connected to the Internet. They already have smartphones. But yes, that hasn't actually translated to e-comm yet, except in a few places, Britain, China, markets like that. But in most places in the world, that e-comm is nascent, and that bodes really well for the future because already, e-comm growth is over 23%.</p><p>Now the travel sector is one of those areas that's driving cross-border growth. And Craig mentioned the wonderful deals that we've done with American Airlines over the last 30 years and most recently in all the packaging and bundling of our products and services. But actually, we have relationships with 150 major airlines around the world, and that's the power of replication. And we've won some significant deals not just with the airlines but with some of the infrastructure players such as Travelport, such as Amadeus. And with these players, we've actually put virtual card solutions in place, which I think you heard from earlier when we went through the product talks with Michael.</p><p>Now turning to the actual strategy, away from the flows. As you'd expect, like everyone in MasterCard, we're all are working in the same agenda of grow, diversify and build. And for us, winning in digital is really at the center of everything that we do. So I quite like this Venn diagram approach because I think it puts it at the heart of things. In terms of growth, we, of course, got our core business, and Michael has already mentioned our debit and credit business. But just to say that we've actually got a very, very strong credit position in some key geographies around the world such as the U.K., Italy, the Nordics, Brazil, Egypt. But as Michael mentioned, many of our emerging markets are actually debit and prepaid markets. And that's where we've had consistent market share gains around the world, in Asia-Pacific, EMEA, in Latin America, putting us into leading positions in many of these geographies. And not only that, though, we have been in leading positions on debit in Europe and some of the most advanced geographies in the world, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, for a number of years.</p><p>And this winning in digital, which is at the core of everything we want to do, you've heard Craig talk about the rollout of MDES across North America. Well, we will have 2/3 of the targeted flow of the international markets actually rolled out tokenized before the end of the year, which is a great platform on which to connect to everyone around the world.</p><p>Now what about the diversity side? Well, we've been working very hard with governments around the world. Ajay mentioned his passion about understanding governments and what they were trying to achieve for their company and -- country and really fitting in with that. We have been working with them and the big NGOs such as the World Food Programme to drive financial inclusion. And we've been very sensitive to geopolitical changes as well.</p><p>A couple of years ago, I was up here talking to you about Russia. The good news, our business in Russia is growing really well today, and that's because we're cooperating with the new Russian payment system. In Europe, we've been very intelligent about the way we handle changes in ownership of our main competitor and also very intelligent on the way that we work with the regulators there. You're going to hear much more about this when we go into our European panel. In India, India has gone through big changes lately such as demonetization, and, again, we've been very proactive with the government and the market as this has been happening.</p><p>And of course, we've been working with the gig economy around the world. We've already mentioned Uber. There are many, many lookalikes around the world. And we're working with Uber and all their lookalikes to actually drive volume through our platform using our priceless experience, actually, in 30 major countries around the world to actually accelerate that growth. And we're building big partnerships, not -- we're working with Craig and his team, who look after the Silicon Valley tech giants and helping them around the world, but also, we're working with the big tech giants in the other geographies, the likes of Rakuten, Alibaba, Tencent, Samsung. If you move to Europe, KORONA, [Advia, the big acquirer] and Worldpay. So there are many players that out there that are great partners to us, which are helping us diversify.</p><p>And what about the future? Well, the future is very bright because obviously, we are rolling out our new capabilities. You've heard about our Applied Predictive Technologies. That's rolled out across 26 countries now. Ajay Bhalla talked to you about Safety Net. Just last week, we saved an African bank tens of millions by capturing potential fraud in our Safety Net. Biometrical sensitization is becoming huge across our markets and particularly in places like Africa or India and so on and even in developed markets. We've obviously launched Selfie Pay in 30 markets. It's very popular. That's the sort of pet name for it. I think it's called something like Identity Check Mobile Product. But in any case, it's -- I heard that millennials actually take something like 12 selfies of themselves a day. So I mean, it's not sort of linked to the transaction flow, I'm happy.</p><p>And so in terms of diversifying our payment flow, you're going to hear more about VocaLink during the European panel. I come from Britain. I live in Britain, and I use Voca every day to pay my bills, to send money to my mother and my sister, to actually sort of just live everyday life and be able to make payments from my bank account. So I know it's an absolutely fantastic platform. And I know that it's going to be incredibly successful around the world.</p><p>So I would now like to move on and actually introduce you to my fantastically talented and diverse team who are helping me manage this business around the world. We're going to start with our European team, with our President, Mr. Javier Perez; with our President of the U.K. and Ireland and the Nordics, Mark Barnett; with Carlo Enrico, who runs everything from the Netherlands to Benelux to Spain to Italy to France -- did I miss any, Carlo? I don't think so -- Western Europe. After which, we're going to have the pleasure of having our Asia-Pacific and Latin America President come up here and talk about their geographies. But let me join my European panel. Got everyone with a clicker.</p><p>So, Javier, great to have you here with your team. Would you like to give us an overview of Europe?</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ, PRESIDENT OF EUROPE REGION, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Sure. So as you heard a little bit this morning, Europe, great opportunities. Still a lot of money to go after, right? A lot of cash there, as you can see in the slide, a lot of ACH, even bigger than that, right? So a large opportunity, a lot of cash to be had, a lot of ACH to be had. So great opportunity. Good acceptance. We have 17 million terminals already deployed in Europe, and about half of them already are NFC capable. And by 2020, all of them will be.</p><p>And we have -- occasionally, we get some help from legislation. Yes, you probably all remember the interchange legislation, the 2030, which, in fact, has enabled us to continue to expand on acceptance. And some of the large retailers in countries like Germany or the Netherlands or Belgium and many others who were reluctant to accept MasterCard, today they do accept MasterCard. So -- and it's not over. We have another big piece of legislation coming down our way, which is PSD2.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: I know you're dying to talk about that, Javier. But before you launch into that, how about telling us a little bit about the competitive landscape and how you see us positioned?</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: So Europe is competitive for sure, no question about that. You all know all the domestic schemes and all the stuff that is going on there. It's very dynamic. But we're doing very well. I mean, if you go to pretty much any external source, but I would say, for example, you go to the Nielsen report, you will see that we have been growing number of cards and volumes for 6 years year-on-year, 6 years in a row. So we're doing well. And many times, I get the question, so why is that?</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Yes. Well, it's actually from me.</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: Yes, you do actually, yes. So why is that? And very strong people, some of them sitting in this very room, that think that all schemes are created equal. And that is certainly not the case. So let me just bring 4 points. I'm going to bring 4 points to you that I think that differentiates, certainly in Europe, very much MasterCard from other schemes. Let me start by telling you that we have a different product offering. You've seen this today, whether it's internally generated, like digital will be a good example, or whether it's through acquisitions, and Voca will be a good example of that. We have the best brand platform of any scheme in Europe. We're very close to our clients, and we are able to develop service and technologies to them.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Well, I mean, Javier mentioned digital. Carlo, what do you think about digital in Europe?</p><p>CARLO ENRICO, DIVISION PRESIDENT OF CENTRAL EASTERN EUROPE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: We're pretty happy with where we are in digital in Europe. And I would add a little bit more. I would say that we are recognized to be the only true partner in digital for both banks and digital players. Why is that? Well, first of all, we are the only one that actually delivered a wallet strategy. We have all our key issuing partners distributing Masterpass. We even have banks that are not necessarily large MasterCard issuers that are distributing Masterpass. We have more than 100,000 merchants with the Button displayed, and we have really rolled out MDES, the tokenization, as a standard in the marketplace. So that's done. Not only we have built around it. We have built security and very consumer friendly services.</p><p>Let me give you a few examples. We are releasing right now, immediately after the PSD2 regulation, the new authentication standards that will require biometrics, will require Decision Intelligence that Ajay Bhalla illustrated before. We are requiring nice features such as Automatic Biller Update. What is it? It's a feature that gives you, as a consumer, with your carbon file at Netflix, Spotify, Uber, you name it, when your card is stolen store or expired, your card credentials are updated automatically without the need of reentering them. So I think all this focus we have, all this engagement we have with our partners definitely give us a better recognized partnership.</p><p>Let me give 2 examples of 2 very strong partnership. One, BBVA. BBVA is now serving all their merchants with their own proprietary commercial acquiring services now combined with MasterCard Gateway Services in order to offer an omnichannel solution. This is, like in Spain, being rolled out across the globe.</p><p>Last but not the least, a partnership we've had with PayPal. It's not a new one, dates back to 2011, when we started in Italy and in U.K., very successful prepaid programs, has evoluted over time, of course. And today, in Europe, we have a partnership which is along the same lines we have in U.S. So we have a mutual agreement on acceptance. PayPal will access our contactless acceptance footprint via MDES. Braintree will incorporate Masterpass in their offering. But I think the most relevant and interesting part of the partnership is what lies ahead, which is partnership in push payments, in ACH leveraging our Mastercard Send and VocaLink. So I think we have a very strong recognized leadership in digital.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: And you've given a really broad view of digital. There's a lot of consumer payments in there. Michael actually talked about how well we were doing in commercial. Mark, what about the commercial side of things?</p><p>MARK BARNETT, GROUP EXECUTIVE, CONSULTING SERVICES, MASTERCARD ADVISORS, LLC: So, Ann, yes, we've seen tremendous growth in commercial. And it really comes from 3 areas. The first is with small businesses, SMEs. A lot of small businesses either use personal cards or cash for their business transactions. And working with our Advisors colleagues, we're able to work with 60 issuers across Europe, identify those flows that are truly commercial and make sure they operate on commercial products. It's a great win for the small business just making about the product, and it's a great win for our banks and for us because it's new flows. So that's the small business side of things.</p><p>In the T&amp;E segment, I just think we got a better product. Our large card product, for example, our smart data, online solution, our issuer -- the issuers just prefer those products. So we have a lot of success there. And then finally, something that Michael talked a lot about, which is the B2B space, $120 trillion opportunity globally. We really are getting after those payment flows in Europe. It's mainly through a virtual card number solution. It's mainly operating with infrastructure players, in the travel space, but we're beginning to attract new verticals. And it's really exciting because that's where enormous growth can come from.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: So the other thing, Mark, I mean, obviously, you're sitting in the U.K. And I know we're desperate to talk about Voca. But what about the inorganic side? When Javier was referring to product differentiation, you sort of said organic, inorganic. What about the other acquisitions?</p><p>MARK BARNETT: Absolutely. Let me give you a couple of examples. So we have -- if you're shopping online in the U.K. or indeed across Europe, there's a good chance that the payment page that you see on your retailer's website is handled by a company we acquired many years ago called DataCash. It's a gateway company. Because we've been able to integrate that fully into MasterCard. We can now have conversations with those retailers that a stand-alone gateway just can't have. We can talk to them about loyalty. We can talk to them about fraud. We can talk to them about analytics. And not only has that helped us renew the business we have, but we've driven some pretty impressive growth rates. Staying with retailers, another example:</p><p>We have a lot of conversations with retailers about using our marketing assets, for example. Some of those bigger retailers, hundreds of stores, thousands of stores even, it's obvious that they should be looking at the test and learn capability of the [ATP] company that we bought a couple of years ago. So we've made that introduction. And again, we've had lots of success across Europe of cross-selling there.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: So, Javier, back to you again. You mentioned product, and then you went on to say, well, we've got a great brand, platform, and we got proximity. Maybe you -- do you want to...</p><p>Maybe you want to sort of expand that.</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: Sure. Let me give you a few examples. So what I was referring to is we have a huge number of sponsorships, of assets in pretty much every country in Europe. Now -- so we go from massive platforms like the Champions League, which is the biggest event in Europe by far, bigger than the Super Bowl, up to the Cannes Film Festival. So that's an opportunity for us to work with our clients. We also touch millions of people. Remember, priceless. We have priceless cities. We have priceless surprises. We have priceless experiences. We have priceless events. We have priceless causes. And today, consumers, certainly in Europe, they want something different. They want an experience. They want to feel that their card is doing things for them, that their providers are doing things for them. So we partnered with our clients, the banks, if you like, to provide those experiences to the consumer, which brings me to the next point that we were talking about, which is proximity. I -- remember that we have been a single company in Europe, a single public company in Europe for more than 10 years. And we have used that time. We have continuously leveraged, used, structured and customized our global products for the European scenario. We have developed also, overall these years, a very well sophisticated and trained sales force. We have groups of experts deployed across the region in delivery, implementation, digital, safety, our advisers, which add a lot of value to our clients. And we have, therefore, expanded the consumer base and the customer base. So we now deal with governments. We now deal with travel industry leaders, with retailers, with digital giants and many others, so we have expanded the client base.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Now I certainly think that the adviser story is really good in Europe. I know that, practically, every single relationship that we have uses the advisers there.</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: That's right. That's absolutely right.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: But I think on your last point, about expanding the customer base, maybe, Carlo, you'd like to tell us a bit more about that.</p><p>CARLO ENRICO: So we were willing to expand the customer base, but we also had to expand the customer base because this intermediation is actually taking place in Europe, and with the PSD2, this intermediation of banks will even accelerate. So we had and we wanted to embrace governments, merchants and fintech, which is now a bucket of partners, which is growing 5 to 10x faster than traditional banks. Let me give you some example. In the government space, we have the cooperation with the Swedish government for the disbursement of benefits to migrants; or we launched a preprogram in Spain with a post office; or, again, we have very strong relationships with the governments in Central-Eastern Europe that will have payments at the top of their agenda. And as an example, I would mention the landmark agreement we have in Poland, where the government, ourselves and the banks all mutually committed to increase the number of POS terminals by 2 in 4 years. So that's a market transformation. And of course, we have the smart cities agenda that we have seen in the video. We have now more than 60 cities where we are knowledge partners. In most of them, we are exclusive knowledge partners to open up closed-loop or paper-based ticketing systems into open-loop and contactless models. So that's the government example. In the merchant space, of course, we're going after co-brands. And the last few months, we signed pretty big deals with Amazon, InterContinental Hotel and Marriott. But also, we are cooperating with Coca-Cola and its vendors for a quite innovative mobile application for vending machines. And we have launched in January the largest debit program for a retailer with Carrefour in France. Finally, something that was very marginal a few years ago but actually is gaining traction and size is the fintech space. We are lucky enough or good enough to be the exclusive partner of the largest fintech challengers in all the continental markets and in U.K. as well. We are the exclusive partner for N26 in Germany, [Konikel] in France and the 4 digital banks in U.K., right?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes. Absolutely, so let me just build on that, because what we're finding across Europe is that, increasingly, our customers, whether they're banks, they're merchants, they're governments, need partners who can work hand in hand with them to solve complex business problems. So in Europe, over the past few years, we've been re-equipping our customers-facing staff to be what I call solution builders rather than just product sales. Let me give you a couple of examples. So in the U.K., there's a government portal where government departments can acquire services and supplies and so on. We've payment-enabled that portal. What does that mean? It means when somebody makes a procurement, with one click, they do the order, the payment, the reconciliation and the settlement. It saves the government a fortune in procurement costs. We reckon it can reduce it by up to 80%. Doing something like that isn't easy. It's not an off-the-shelf product. We have to work with our banking partners and our technology partners and obviously government. So an example in the government side. Carlo just mentioned the digital banks. We gathered fantastic momentum in the U.K. with the challenger banks, so likes the Metro and Virgin, the 4 digital banks Carlo just mentioned. The biggest of the challenger banks recently, TSB, just said they're coming exclusively with us. TSB represents 5 million debit cards that will be flipping over to Mastercard. Why do we gather that momentum? Well, the reason isn't one silver bullet. It's all the things that Michael and Ajay and Garry talked about added to the ability to marshal those capabilities and solutions to the client that will create value for the issuer, in this case, but also great products and services for the end consumer. And then just finally, one other example of this deep engagement. So we got a great partnership with Tesco. We're helping them build their wallet. They want to drive retail sales. We want to drive Mastercard volume. Working together, we can do both. But to give you just a feeling for the level of engagement. They have a big project team working on this, a big development team, and we have Mastercard staff with passes on-site working with our client to develop that. So it's -- we do have to have all the fabulous products and services, but we need to have this solution-creation ability, which I think is part of the secret sauce Javier has created in Europe.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: And how many loyalty cards does Tesco have today?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Well, it's got 22 million cardholders, so we will settle.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Yes, so it's very significant, a very significant player. So I mean, obviously, we have these deep relationships. Javier said we have a brilliant sales team. That's what he says to me at the end of every year, actually, at a certain time of year. But Carlo, what about winning deals? What's happening with the deal pipeline and the momentum in Europe?</p><p>CARLO ENRICO: The momentum has been pretty strong for quite some time now. Javier said it before. We've been gaining market share. I think that according to Nielsen, we've been gaining more than 1 percentage point per year; actually, accelerating over time, which is very encouraging. And this is a combination of factors. So first of all, what we have done over the past 12 months is really to secure the markets where we are leaders. So now we have nailed down and renewed for 5 years and more markets such as Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Sweden; the credit business in U.K., Hungary, Poland. So that's locked down. Then we have, of course, 2 main segments where the deals and the revenues are coming in and the driver for market share gain. One is the small and medium accounts. And this is, again, something that we have been creating over the past few years, which is a dedicated sales force to really engage with the smaller accounts, which require more agility, which requires a good engagement, both remotely and locally. There's a long list of deals that I don't think we need to discuss today, but it's definitely a very important contributor to our market share gain. And then we have, of course, the large flips, the large national champions such as [Citi] Debit in Sweden that we signed 2 months ago; the flip of Poste Italiane prepaid portfolio in Italy; the large market transformational deal in debit U.K. with TSB; and also, in Central-Eastern Europe in many markets, but I would mention one in particular where we have completely changed our competitive position, which is Romania, where BCR and Raiffeisen have decided to bring all their portfolios with us. So that's pretty much the reason for our market share gain over time.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: So I'm going to go on to another couple of topics before we close. I mean, we mentioned VocaLink. Mark, what does VocaLink mean to you in the U.K.? How do you see it fitting into market? And then, Carlo, I'd like you to come in and talk a little bit about how that works across Europe.</p><p>MARK BARNETT: Well, I think you know, Ann, that we're super excited about the prospect of VocaLink in the U.K. Let me put it in a bit of perspective. So the total payment flows in the U.K. that VocaLink handle is about $8 trillion. On the Fast ACH platform, that's over $1.5 trillion. If you look at total card payment flows in the U.K. across all schemes, it's just a little under $1 trillion. So what am I saying? ACH volume is already huge. The Fast ACH, which is the latest development in the ACH world, is already huge. And so we can do 2 things, and that's what the 2 opportunities. One is we can try and add value to the already existing flows. And the other is try and capture new flows. So there's a great example in the showcase that was referred to earlier by Michael. Something we were very good at in the advisers group was monetizing or adding value and insight to the data on our card payment network and then monetizing that. There's no reason if we transfer that skill in that knowledge that we can't do exactly the same thing with those payments flows. The first example of that is in upstairs in the showcase today, and it's a [Forbes] product. It's called AML Insight. But effectively, what it does is it identifies money -- fraudulent money muling accounts where money jumps from bank to bank. Individual banks find it very difficult to identify it, but because VocaLink has to look across all the banks, it can pick up that sort of -- the fraudulent activity. So do go and have a look at that. But I think the other big thing we can do is, again, Michael talked about it, was Pay By Bank app. So at the moment, 60% of the U.K. population use their mobile banking apps, 60%, and that number is growing all the time. What you can do, of course, is use it -- as Ann said, you can use your mobile bank app to make payments to people that you've already set up as payees. But what you can't do is use it to go shopping. You can't use it in store, in app or online to buy stuff. But what Pay By Bank app enables us to do is exactly that. It's exciting because it will just be added as new functionality into your mobile banking app. Therefore, 60% of the U.K. population will be able to use it overnight once it's switched on. So we got a lot of momentum. The big banks getting behind it or are behind it, so we're very, very excited about the prospect of that.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: And, Carlo, Europe?</p><p>CARLO ENRICO: Well, in Europe, we are very excited about the opportunity as well. The natural and obvious ambition is to take the Fast ACH capability of VocaLink and to bring them in Continental Europe. The opportunity is huge. We're talking about $40 trillion, 10x the size the card payment business, and the landscape is pretty promising. The landscape in Europe is, we have 26 ACH, different technologies, different standards, different governance models. And they have 3 features in common. All the ACH in Europe are domestic. All the ACH in Europe are talking about bringing ACH capabilities into P2P space, in the digital space, at the point of sale, but they don't have acceptance. And all the ACH are stating, I wouldn't, but they state that they have a level of frauds that are currently experiencing, which is concerning. And the more they're exposing current account credentials to digital, the more the problem gets bigger. So we come in a scenario which, I would say, pretty fragmented and pretty fragile. And we're coming with VocaLink and Mastercard. So VocaLink is well-known to be the first one that brought Faster ACH in the marketplace. It's well-known for having the best services in Europe. And this couples with Mastercard that brings in the scheme nature of our business, so the ability to bring in governance and rules. Mastercard brings in the acceptance, the acceptance that is global; omnichannel, because we have contactless and e-commerce, which is interoperable. And Mastercard also brings in the plumbing, because we are already connected to all the European banks. So the combination of VocaLink and Mastercard in Europe is a tremendous opportunity. What we are doing now with Michael and David is to go market by market. We need to go by market by market, and that is whether we want to go in cooperation with the local ACH, the local legacy, the local processors, or whether we want to go in competition with them, but definitely, it's a very clear opportunity, and we have a very clear road map ahead.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: That's brilliant. We've got about 2 minutes left, Javier.</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: All right.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: And I know you're desperate to talk to us about the PSD2. So is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? What does it mean?</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: It's a good thing, Ann. It's a good thing. It's a very good thing. So you heard how well prepared we are, right, because probably the most important thing about PSD2 is open banking. And if I have to summarize open banking, is the ability for almost anyone to get into your bank account, which is ACH. So -- and it's really interesting to see what's going on in the market. The different stakeholders are taking very different positions, right? So we see the banks fear this intermediation. Now anybody can go into my bank account. It's not that difficult to get a license in Europe, especially it will be. Retailers now are saying, well, I want to own my own data. I want to own my own payments. I want to generate my own information. I now can convince my clients to go straight to the bank account, right? We have the large tech players who are increasing their interest in payments. You have it with Facebook, Amazon, PayPal, Apple, so many and so many more; and the fintechs who want to capitalize on the disruption, but so do we. We can and we will capitalize on the disruption as well. So what are the things that we see that are popping up as opportunities for Mastercard? One is offering the services we already offer, not only to our existing clients but to the new entries. Second, you just heard it, one-stop shop. Now Mastercard can offer you the opportunity to route transactions, whether it will be through the card rails or through the ACH rails. And last but not least, part of the PSD2 is also information flow. So we will now be able to participate in those information flows and do things like, for example, permission management, which will be necessary for data transfer. So we are really excited about PSD2.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Only you could be excited about new regulations. All right. With that, I'd just like to thank the panel for coming up. Obviously, if you're interested in Europe, they're all around later. And it gives me great pleasure to move on to the next part of the program.</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: Thank you, Ann.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Thank you. So now we're going to hear about Asia-Pacific and Latin America. And to talk to us about Asia-Pacific, we've got our 2 copresidents who are Ling Hai and Ari Sarker, and they will be followed by Gilberto Caldart, who will talk to you about the great growth we've seen in Latin America. Thank you.</p><p>LING HAI, CO-PRESIDENT OF ASIA PACIFIC, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Thank you, Ann. I am Ling Hai. It's a pleasure to be here and sharing the stage with Ari to talk to you about how exciting Asia-Pacific is for all of us. When I -- thank you. So when I think about Asia-Pacific, 3 words come to my mind: big, diverse and vibrant. We have some of the world's most vibrant and important economies in Asia-Pacific: India, China, Australia, Korea, Japan. We also have more than 60% of the global population living in Asia, some of whom are the wealthiest in the world and most of whom are digitally savvy and connected. So we're very excited about the opportunities this presents for all of us in Asia. Let me tell you why. First of all, we actually see huge opportunities in the affluent segment and cross-border travel, really our sweet spot, because of the rising wealth and a growing middle class in Asia-Pacific. We have done 2 things that have positioned Mastercard really well in the region. First of all, under the leadership of Michael and his product team, I think we have a fantastic product platform, with best-in-class benefits that speak directly to the needs of our affluent customers. What are those? Well, family. Affluent people in Asia have money but no time, so saving time. And also, money cannot buy priceless experiences. The second thing is really airline co-brands, a very relevant proposition to the world travelers living in Asia. We're very, very proud of all the airline partnerships that we have developed in Asia-Pacific, including Asia Miles, Qantas, Japan Airlines, Thai Airways, Singapore Airlines, just to name a few.</p><p>The second opportunity that we are really, really excited about is really in commercial. Now here, I am talking about large corporate T&amp;E. I'm talking about small business payments. I'm also talking about B2B flows. B2B alone in Asia-Pacific is about USD 54 trillion. So what are we doing about this? Well, we're making huge progress in the online travel vertical. We are also doing something called supplier enablement. It's the simple task of just enabling suppliers to take card payments or being able to accept virtual card numbers. We're working with governments to embed our payment solutions into national trade platforms, and a great example is Singapore. And more importantly, now we are piloting some of the most innovative solutions such as block chain in our trade corridors.</p><p>The third opportunity that we're very excited about is actually debit, right? As you can see on this slide, Asia's addressable cash opportunity is about USD 39 trillion, and debit is a great cash conversion tool. Now we see this in very developed markets such as Australia and Singapore because of contactless payments. We also see this in emerging markets, where almost every single government has a national agenda of financial inclusion and cashless payments. We're very proud to tell you today that in markets such as India and Indonesia, we are the leader in debit. We're the market leader in debit, so, very exciting.</p><p>We continue to see huge room in driving acceptance development. In AP, our aim is to triple our acceptance coverage, led by China, India and APMEA, expanding e-commerce, low-value payments, telcos and transit, which is also a very important area for us. Our list of priorities also include digital and domestic relevance. I'm not going into a lot of detail right now because Ari and I will talk about those when we cover China and India. But in summary, we see huge opportunities in Asia, and MasterCard is really well positioned in this region.</p><p>All right. Now I'm going to talk about -- let's go on to the 2 important markets in Asia-Pacific. First, China and then India. I do have a disclaimer here, very quickly. The sequencing -- I'm going to read this, too, so I'm not going to screw this up. The sequencing of the discussions is merely in alphabetical order because C comes before I. And it is -- in no way reflects the relative importance of these 2 countries. And, Martina, I don't think this message has been approved by Warren yet.</p><p>All right. Jokes aside, let me start with China. China is really about 2 things: new opportunities and existing businesses. And I know you're very anxious to know about our market entry in China, so let me get this one out of the way first.</p><p>Market entry will remain our strategic focus for the next 12 to 24 months. Now it is worth noting the China opportunity will continue to be a medium- to long-term opportunity. Here's why. The licensing process itself will probably take another 12 months to 1.5 years at a minimum. And also, getting the license really is one step in a very long journey. There are many, many pieces we have to put in place. For instance, the on-soil infrastructure, domestic acceptance, talent and people acquisition. Those are the things we're working on very, very fast. And the important thing to remember is also, we're getting huge support around the world within Mastercard. I'm very grateful to all the colleagues sitting here, safety, security, digital products. Those are all the things that would become very important for us to be more effective once we enter China.</p><p>So now let me tell you a little bit about the existing business, how we are doing, what we are doing about it. As you know, Mastercard has been in China for over 30 years now. We have actually built a very sizable and vibrant cross-border business, which is still growing this year. And while we make our domestic inroads, it's very important for all of us to focus on protecting and continuing to expand our cross-border business. And we're seeing very solid growth on the cross-border spend this year.</p><p>On the issuing side, we're doing several things. First of all, we are managing the dual-brand to single-brand transition, and that's going really well. We'll continue to do both. But this year, we have quadrupled our single-brand issuing. We will continue to develop relevant cross-border propositions that speak directly to our target segments, things such as merchant-funded rewards and cash-back offers. And the other thing that we're doing is really on the debit front. We have launched our first single-branded debit card with Bank of China, and we have more in the pipeline to come. This is going to be a long-term growth driver for us, and we're very, very excited.</p><p>On acceptance, our plan is to really expand and grow both physical and digital acceptance to a -- to reach the critical mass that's needed. And on digital, I think Craig Vosburg talked about both digital enablement but also digital partnership. And I think that's the formula in China as well. We need to enable our traditional bank customers to compete effectively using our digital assets, but we're also working really intensely with the digital players in China.</p><p>Last but not least, let me also touch on our service differentiation in China. I do believe Mastercard has unparalleled service assets in the world. That includes loyalty. That includes data and analytics, safety and security. When Mastercard can touch all the transactions on our card in China, that service differentiation become even more powerful and more meaningful.</p><p>So this concludes my discussion on China. And there's another country, which I said -- which is called India that I wake up every morning thinking about. But thank goodness, I only need to do the thinking because India is in the very capable hands of my twin brother and partner in crime, Mr. Ari Sarker. Ari, the stage is all yours, and I'm leaving the clicker here. I'm not stealing that.</p><p>ARI SARKER, CO-PRESIDENT FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Thank you, Ling Hai, for that introduction. Good morning, everyone. I must admit Shanghai is the big brother of the Asia-Pacific region, so I do pay my respects to Ling Hai every morning when I see him in the office. So I'm here to talk about India. And what I'd like to do is give you a sense of where India is today. India, over the last many decades, has had the cycles of rising optimism, with less than satisfactory delivery on the promise. We believe India is breaking away from their past challenges and did set an inflection point, and let's talk about why that's the case.</p><p>Growth outlook at $2.5 trillion economy, which, in the coming decade, will more than double to cross over $5 trillion. Infrastructure, hard infrastructure investments is gaining momentum; tremendous progress on power; and multibillions of dollars of investment in road, rail and airport infrastructure, both for expansion as well as modernization. On digital enablement, very significant progress. A country with 1.2 billion citizens on a digital ID biometric system will have a profound impact on digital services in the country in the coming decade. Many of those things have already started to happen. The other big play for enabling digital India is the infrastructure that India is laying on the telecom side. 4G, LTE technology with fiber broadband going deep into rural India is, again, going to have a very major impact on digital services in general, and more importantly, for us, payment is going to be a very vital piece of enabling commerce deep into rural India.</p><p>I'll talk about government policy, but fintech activity is at a heightened pace in India with multibillions of dollars of investment, both from domestic players as well as international players at the likes of Alibaba, WeChat, Tencent and others who are already present in India. And we are seeing some very significant innovation from local fintech start-ups in India. The reason I left governments for last is it is a real enabler, and the kind of political leadership we are seeing in India today, we haven't seen that in decades. And the implications of that is a government which is driven to go after what we call the parallel economy and bring that to mainstream. Last year, India went through some very significant changes. Our tax amnesty scheme was followed with a currency demonetization drive, and that, in the current year, has led to the next wave of change with the radical tax reform with the goods and services tax reform. And I'll spend 30 seconds on what GST really means.</p><p>GST really will be the real game changer for digital payments in India. At a merchant level, the previous tax regime created an incentive for the merchant to take cash transactions from consumers to avoid taxes. The current GST rules provides the merchant the opportunity to offset the input taxes the merchant would have paid from the output taxes they recover from the consumer. Therefore, there is no incentive for the merchant to let the consumer not pay the taxes. I think that's going to have a very profound impact in the coming decade.</p><p>So what's the size of the prize? If we were to look ahead, India today is at roughly -- depending on what research you read, is at 3% to 5% penetration of PCE. The outlook on India is in the coming decade, you could well see 10x penetration on that number. And that's only talking about retail consumer payments. Many of my colleagues have talked about commercial, which is an equally significant opportunity in the Indian market.</p><p>So what's our call to action? And where are we today? Current core business is in great health. We are really excited that the growth in the market and our current position with debit, despite the emergence of a domestic network and scheme, by the way, of a name called RuPay, we are market leaders in India with debit, and this is the fastest growth vertical on spends in the Indian market. We are making great traction on the affluent card propositions. We've gone through a major product revitalize across the region and have a really strong pipeline in India for the affluent product. I'm really excited that this will also have some very significant traction for us in the coming decade.</p><p>Acceptance environment, which is critical, as you can imagine, for our industry and the scale that we can bring will -- building a really robust acceptance environment. India has a merchant universe of 60 million merchants. And we are now looking at an outlook, which, in the last 12 months alone, India has added over 1 million new merchants to electronic payments. And with QR code innovation and MPOS and other enablers, you're going to see this number from around 2.9 million merchant universe on electronic payments growing roughly 5x from the current level in the coming decade.</p><p>We're also looking at and working on some very significant partnerships in the digital space. The entrance of new telcos in India and the entry of payment banks with Reliance Jio and Airtel and others who've come in, we have partnered with them, bringing a suite of digital payments capabilities in an open, interoperable environment is also going to have some very profound impact on our growth story in India.</p><p>We've talked about QR. It's at the showcase as well. In the coming years, the lower price point for merchant usage on QR is going to have a very profound impact with the GST and other such regulations to drive digital in India. We've also led on the front foot on policy engagements in India with respect to transit and new capabilities. You saw the video on [TFL], and we've used that very effectively with regulators and development agencies in India to espouse the case for open-loop transit payments. And we must admit we're making some great progress. 6 out of 8 bids have gone Mastercard's way and will have again major implications for us in the years ahead.</p><p>We've spoken a lot about commercial, so I won't spend more time on that. We will essentially build our global capabilities in the India market. We're seeing some good traction in the local market. Above all, really exciting market opportunity. We're expanding our teams. We're investing in marketing on the brand and are very enthusiastic about what this market opportunity will emerge in the coming decade.</p><p>With that, I will invite my colleague and friend, Gilberto Caldart, President of Latin America, to provide an update on LatAm.</p><p>GILBERTO CALDART, PRESIDENT OF LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN REGION, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Thanks, Ari. Some things don't change, right? Great. So thanks, Ari, for the introduction. Glad to be here to be talking about the LAC region, the performance and the growth opportunities. And I want to start by saying that in spite of the political and economic turbulences that you've been seeing in the region, we've been a growth engine for Mastercard for the last couple of years. Actually, over the last 18 quarters, we've been outperforming the market in a row, and we still see a lot of growth opportunities in the region. So we really feel excited about the region momentum today and going forward. And let me tell you why we feel good.</p><p>First, we have a very positive demographics, if you will. We are a young and vibrant continent, where 50% of our population is under the age of 30 years old, and 67% will be on the working age by the year 2025. This is going to continue fueling consumption. The region PCE has reached $3 trillion, has been growing at a CAGR of 9% over the last couple of years and is expected to continue growing at 8% going forward. Second, we are the most urbanized region in the world. 80% of the population lives in cities. And third, we are one of the most digitally connected populations in the world. Over 40% of our population has smartphones. And then when all of that now translates into payments, the opportunity lying in front of us is tremendous. In consumer payments, for example, we are still underpenetrated. Only 21% of PCE is with electronic payments, as we speak. In countries outside of Brazil and Chile, the penetration issuing recipient is on the mid-teens. So it's a lot of potential. There is still a lot of untapped payment flows, as you can see on this slide, $5 trillion in cash and checks, $7 trillion in ACH, spaces that we'll be able to penetrate more with our new digital and ACH capabilities in the region.</p><p>So on our strategy execution, you heard a lot about the grow, diversify and build. It has clearly enabled us in Latin America to have achieved and established market leadership in a couple of very important markets. We achieved market leadership in Brazil, in Chile, in Colombia, in Venezuela, in Uruguay. These countries together represent 45% to 50% of the purchase volume in the region. And this growth has been really kind of a consequence, if you will, of a strong local presence and solid partnerships with players like Ita\u00c3\u00ba, Santander, Scotiabank, Bank Colombia, Davivienda, Citibanamex, just to name a few. At the same time, as you heard throughout the day today, we have diversified our services strategy and done a lot of the services that you heard a lot in terms of data services and so on. So I'm not going to go long in there.</p><p>So as we look forward, we continue to kind of focus on executing our strategy in sustaining the growth of our core business and partnership; displacing cash while growing acceptance and penetrating new flows; winning digital by expanding the Masterpass presence beyond Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, where we already are; and deploying tokenization and authentication services in support to our issuer wallets.</p><p>So now I cannot talk about Latin America without talking about Brazil. And so let me kind of talk about Brazil. Brazil is a great example of how Mastercard has been executing our strategy in the market and outperforming our competitors. As you know, Brazil is the largest market in the region, still kind of -- although developed, the most developed payments industry in the region, we only have a 27% over PCE, and we still see a lot of underpenetrated flows, similar to the rest of the region of -- in Masterpass.</p><p>We're also very pleased, as I mentioned before, to share that we have, at the end of 2016, achieved leadership in the Brazilian market. And then this is clearly demonstrating that our strategy execution is actually working well, and we'll continue to focus on deploying it and actually perfecting the execution.</p><p>I have a couple of examples, my time is almost up, but just on the growth side, we have very strong partnerships, as I mentioned. Here's a couple of examples of these partners of Ita\u00c3\u00ba, Santander and Caixa, just to name a few. We also have diversified our partnerships, not only with banks but with retailers, innovative players, as you see on this slide, which have opened up spaces for us in the issuing, the acquiring space and in card on file spaces that kind of helped us to continue growing in the country.</p><p>And in the service side in Brazil where we kind of switched 100% of the purchase volume, we have actually a privileged position to offer differentiating services to our customers. Just 2 quick examples of it. First, offering test and learning capabilities through our APG tool, which we have been doing a lot in the country. Second, enhancing the security in the digital space by offering fraud tools such as MDES and authentication.</p><p>When it comes to loyalty, we have Surpreenda, which is our merchant-funded loyalty platform in the country with more than 6 billion cardholders subscribed, which is a clear kind of differentiator for us in the marketplace. In the transit space, as you've seen in other regions, we have 3 major projects going on in the urban areas of S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Rio and Curitiba. And we continue to expand and grow our commercial business and exploring more opportunities to capture new flows on ACH, B2B, P2P, spaces where VocaLink actually will be a great asset for us to explore.</p><p>So really feel excited about what's happening in the region. There's a good momentum going on, and there's growth ahead of us. So we feel good about it. And with that, I want to pass to Ann to kind of wrap up and closing remarks on international market. Thanks.</p><p>ANN M. CAIRNS: Thanks, Gilberto. And you've left me the clicker, which is great. Look, I understand that I'm standing in front of an audience of analysts and the CFO, which has got to be a precarious place to be. So just to conclude this section, I would like to say the international markets is vibrant, has some of the world's biggest economies. The great news is we still got very high cash usage, and we've got young and digitally savvy populations. We've got incredibly strong relationships across all of our markets. And of course, we're moving to that nirvana of the one-stop shop. So the real thing for us and the reason that we're focused on winning in digital is that digital conversion is really driving the migration of cash to electronic in our markets, which is the big goal that we have around the world.</p><p>And with that, I'd love to invite Martina to the stage -- the video, sorry. I'd love to queue the video. And that's the problem because I thought Martina should come up here and you can see us in our corporate colors, but okay. Thank you.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN, CFO, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us either here in the room or on the webcast. And for those of you here in the room, I hope you enjoy these absolutely beautiful facilities. We are right now in the boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange. And the New York Stock Exchange has actually redone these facilities. Now I tell you why I really like these kind of facilities. I like them because when you are a New York Stock Exchange registered company, you get them for free. So if you guys complain that we're not in Midtown but that we're in downtown and you have to take a $2.50 subway ride, I'm sorry about that. Now what I didn't realize, okay, what I didn't realize is that Warren seems to have taken this whole cost management thing to a whole another level. The chairs that you're seeing actually here on the stage are the chairs that we're using in Purchase. So he ships them in from Purchase. He didn't want to pay the rentals furniture company for that kind of fee. So, Warren, I love it. They're actually from Ajay's office, for those of you who know Ajay's office.</p><p>So anyhow, as the last presenter before the Q&amp;A session, I would like to pull our story together from a financial perspective. So let me queue up here the first chart. So let's start with our 2017 financial outlook. And I know you guys have been feverishly looking for our quarter-to-date drivers update, and you couldn't find any charts in there. I'm just going to talk about that for a minute. All of the drivers, business drivers are either similar to what we have seen from the numbers that we actually talked about at the July earnings call for the July 21 period, so until the end of August. It's similar drivers with the exception of one, which is GDV, which is slightly better than what we have seen in that period.</p><p>So for the full year 2017, our expectations for net revenue growth have slightly improved since our July earnings call, and it's primarily due to the stronger performance of our various services lines as well as some of the business drivers. So we now expect net revenue to grow near the high end of the low double-digit growth range, and that is up from low double-digit. We continue to expect on operating expenses to grow them in the high single-digit range. There's absolutely no change from what we had said before. And with that, we anticipate positive operating leverage for the full year of 2017. Now all of these numbers, by the way, are on a currency-neutral basis. They exclude acquisitions as well as exclude special items. Our recent acquisitions, they're still forecasted to be about $0.05 to $0.06 dilutive for 2017, and that's primarily driven because of the purchase accounting as well as the integration costs. And there's no change, by the way, to our expectation for the tax rate. And we now expect, given the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, a slight benefit from foreign exchange for the year.</p><p>So let me get you to the next chart. And here, I want to talk a little bit about our investment priorities and the focus that we have. You heard my colleagues talk about a lot of these areas. I'm not going to regurgitate all of these areas, but I'm going to just pick out a few and just let me touch on that. So first of all, in terms of growing our core business, digital is super important for us, right? It's right at the top of the list. And Michael and Garry have talked about this. We've made significant progress. When -- but there's still quite a bit to do. And I hope you heard that through all of the sessions as we touched on digital. Now with our tokenization solutions, so -- as we call it affectionately, MDES, I don't know who comes up with these kind of words. But okay, our tokenization solutions -- not Michael -- we are enabling the proliferation of secure payment potentials across a variety of device types. And we continue to develop and deploy Masterpass, and we're supporting it, as you have seen, for a big, big part of this year with an awareness campaign. We're also continuing our focus on growing acceptance around the world.</p><p>Now secondly, with the relatively low penetration of electronic forms of payments in emerging markets, investing in geographic expansion remains at the top of our agenda. So you've heard from Ann, from Ling Hai, from Ari and from Gilberto on some of the more significant opportunities that we are pursuing, and we do believe that, that is very important for our long-term growth.</p><p>Thirdly, from a safety and security point of view, you heard this remains to be a very strong growth driver for us. And as Ajay Bhalla outlined, we have made both organic and inorganic investments to address this opportunity, and you should expect that to continue.</p><p>And finally, with the addition of Fast ACH capabilities, we're investing and going after new payment flows. And this includes not only investing in the technology and the related apps and services, as Michael talked about, but it's also in the business development effort to drive expanded customer relationships and to, of course, expand the geographic footprint.</p><p>So at this point in time, it would be good to just take a minute and talk about the business model for Fast ACH. We get a lot of your questions through our various meetings that we have. As Michael laid out, there are really 3 different levers -- or levels on which we can operate: the infrastructure level, the scheme end or the app level, as well as the services level. And we have, by the way, capabilities to address each of these levels. At the infrastructure level, over 25 countries have or are looking to implement Fast ACH systems. And the approach in the ownership of these kind of networks will vary by country. And we may participate in many different forms. So one form how we could be participating is as an owner-operator, similar to what we do in the U.K., or we might be participating as a technology provider like in the United States with a clearinghouse. And as you can see from the chart, depending on how we participate, the economic model is different. So if it's an operator model, based on our current contracts, we have fixed pricing based on the capacity that is actually provided to the banks. And in the case when we are a technology provider, we would have a licensing arrangement in place that can be nicely scaled. At the scheme or the app level, whether it be a P2M app, such as the Pay By Bank in the U.K., or a bill pay service or a B2B application, we will pursue value-based pricing. So in the case of the Pay By Bank example, that's the push debit payment that Mark Barnett was talking about in the U.K., these economics are similar to debit economics. And in each case, the goal is to capture additional electronic payment flows with a scalable economic model. And at the services level, we are offering value-added services such as the fraud detection product, again, that Mark was describing, the AML Insights product. I think Michael referenced that, too. And we are demoing it up in the showcase, as we have said before. But that's one example of these type of services that we can provide. And by the way, from a value proposition point of view, we believe that those services would be developed and priced fairly similar to what we have already done versus our many different other services that we had developed over the last many years and that we're offering today.</p><p>So overall, I hope you can get the sense from our management team that we're pretty excited about this opportunity for generating new flows with our Fast ACH technology, but I also believe that it will take a few years to have a meaningful contribution to our top line. There's a lot of work that the team has to do.</p><p>So let me move on and switch gears and talk a little bit about our capital structure. So our capital planning priorities have not changed.</p><p>Again, we want to preserve a strong balance sheet, liquidity and credit rating, and that enables us, by the way, to make the investments that are needed to drive the long-term growth of our business. But given the strong cash flow capability of this business, we continue to expect to have excess cash, and we would continue to be returning that excess cash to our shareholders. And our -- at this point, our buyers continue to remain towards share repurchases, as they provide more flexibility for the business overall. Now we intend to move towards a more normalized debt-to-equity ratio over time, as we have been doing over the last 3 years or so. But we need to keep in mind that we do have to keep and preserve our strong credit rating, which is important considerations when our customers choose with whom to do business from a payments point of view, given the settlement counterparty risk that is between those parties and us.</p><p>Now having said all of this, I just want to show you the chart of what we did since the IPO in 2006. So we have returned more than $23 billion to our shareholders, either through dividends or share repurchases. And as you can see on this slide, over the past several years, we have actually increased the capital return. So in 2016, you see a number of $4.3 billion. And we have continued that very strong trajectory into this year. So year-to-date, this is until the end of August, we have already returned $3.2 billion, and this includes the 16% dividend increase that we had announced last December, which is, by the way, the sixth consecutive year of dividend increases. And at the moment, we have about $2.5 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.</p><p>I want to come to this next chart. This is a little different for you. So this is, for the first time in many years, where we updated this chart which depicts our long-term growth opportunity. So as you know, we have always talked about PCE growth and the secular shift to electronic forms of payment as the primary driver of volume growth. But with the acquisition of VocaLink and how we have actually widened our purview in terms of looking at new payment flows, so I'm pegging to that $225 trillion that we're talking about today, we are updating this chart in order to reflect this broader set of opportunities.</p><p>So globally, we continue to expect PCE to be about 5% growth. This is no change from what you have -- had heard from us before. Different, obviously, by country. It obviously also differs by the macroeconomic cycles, but from a long-term average point of view, we kind of expect 5%. That's where it has been historically, too.</p><p>Now while we cannot really influence PCE, we have been and continue to do a lot of work to drive the secular trend from cash and check to electronic forms and payments, and that, we believe, continues to be in the 4% to 5% range annually, and that's adjusted for the available market due to domestic schemes that are operating quite a few markets. And by the way, these numbers, again, no different than what you have seen from us before.</p><p>So during this morning's presentation, you have heard many examples to drive the secular growth such as, from Craig, you heard expanding into new verticals like rent, health care and utilities; you heard from our emerging markets, but also in Europe, partnering with the new digital banks; you heard from Ann making cities smarter; and you heard from Garry and from Michael giving merchants and consumers an inexpensive and easy way to accept or to make payments through the use of QR codes.</p><p>So our lead on virtual card technology, the Mastercard B2B hub and the Mastercard Send capabilities and our Fast ACH assets, all of those comprehensively together allow us to go after these B2B, the B2C, the B2B, the P2P and the disbursement opportunity. So there's $225 trillion of opportunities, and that's essentially summed up in this orange box that you can see on the chart. And then on top of that, on top of this volume and transaction opportunity, there are a number of factors that influence our revenues, including services growth, the mix, pricing and, of course, share. Now putting all of this together, we continue to believe that the long-term revenue growth opportunity for our business is in the low- to mid-teens range over the long term.</p><p>So I want to just pick out one more thing on this, which is our many different services that we are offering to our customers, and you heard quite a few examples of that. They just remain a very important differentiator from us, right? You heard a lot of examples on this. And you may recall that I showed a very similar chart to this last year at the Investor Day. What we've done here is we've just updated the chart for you. So services, when you take them all in totality together, remains a significant portion of our revenue, so about 25% of the net revenues. The growth remains very robust. You see the updated numbers here, with the net revenue CAGR from the 2014 to 2018 period of over 25% -- well over 25%, inclusive acquisitions. And when you just peel apart the acquisitions, it's about 6 percentage points. And as a reminder, some of these revenues show up in the transaction processing fee, so that is when they are priced on a per-transaction basis. So a lot of our safety and security services are priced that way as well as our Gateway, by the way. And then the balance of the revenues under these various services show up in the other revenue line and so just priced differently, separately. So these are like things like our consulting business and our loyalty business. So we believe that our value-added services will continue to be a key enabler to our long-term growth objectives and aspirations. As these services expand in scale, they're increasingly contributing to our overall profitability.</p><p>So now let me switch gears a little bit and get into something more mundane, okay? The new revenue recognition rules. You -- lots of you have always asked us something about that and what the impact would be to us in MasterCard. And just as a reminder, the primary impact is that certain customer incentives will be recognized over the life of a customer contract rather than when earned by a customer. And there was some debate when, the initial accounting and the P&amp;L, these incentives would actually occur. And we now finally have clarity on that, and they will be treated as contra revenue similar to how we have treated them up to this point. And we will adopt these new rules, actually prospectively as of January 1, 2018, and we did a preliminary analysis for 2017 and determined that the impact to 2017 -- on 2017 revenues will actually be minimal.</p><p>So now let me go back and talk a little bit about our long-term performance -- or financial performance objectives. And again, I want to remind you, they are currency neutral. They exclude acquisitions, they are normalized for tax and they are based on the current revenue recognition world.</p><p>So our underlying business fundamentals, as you just have seen this morning, remain strong, and our investments are really showing some tremendous results. We're now expecting that our business can deliver a net revenue CAGR at the high end of the low double-digit range during the 2016 to '18 performance period. And this is up primarily due to increased services revenues and stronger business drivers just due to the terrific work that all of our people are doing around the world. And we continue to manage the business to deliver an operating margin above a minimum of 50% each year. That's the minimum when you put all of the businesses together. And we now expect earnings per share CAGR during that period of approximately 20%, up from the mid-teens, due primarily to the stronger revenues.</p><p>So just want to sum up for you our investment thesis. We have a significant untapped opportunity ahead of us, both with the secular trend and the new flows that we're going after. We have a comprehensive strategy, and we executed well against it. We are building new capabilities and differentiating with services. And we're investing in the right areas, and at the same time, we're returning significant capital to our investors. So overall, we believe that we are very well-positioned for long-term growth.</p><p>With that, I would like to thank you, and my colleagues are going to come up now and so that we can start the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back Ajay Banga, Ann Cairns and Craig Vosburg. As well as President, Global Products and Solutions, Gary Flood; President, Operations and Technology, Ed McLaughlin; General Counsel and Chief Franchise Officer, Tim Murphy; and moderated by Warren Kneeshaw.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: All right, great. So it looks like we're ready to go. I'm going to moderate things here and direct traffic a little bit. There's some mics that we're going to hand out. If you could just please state your name and company affiliation before asking your question. We're going to cut this Q&amp;A a little shorter, so we're going to do this rapid, both questions and answers.</p><p>So, David?</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT, SENIOR MD AND FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI, RESEARCH DIVISION: David Togut with Evercore ISI. Martina, question for you. On Slide 76, your long-term revenue growth slide, in that last bucket, you include pricing as a driver. Can you talk about pricing quantitatively going forward? And more specifically, how do you think about the pricing opportunity in Europe now that [VC] Europe is moving from association-based pricing to market-based pricing?</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: So I'll start a little bit overall from a [very broad] perspective, and then, I'm going to hand it over to Javier to talk a bit about Europe. But from a pricing point of view, our philosophy really has not changed, right? We do value-based pricing, so it depends on what kind of value we are bringing to the customer, and that's how we recognize it. So nothing has changed. And you guys probably remember, when we put out the 2016 to 2018 objectives out there, we said there will be a little bit of pricing, minimal pricing included in that. We have not changed our view from that point of view. You want to talk a little bit about Europe?</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: So nothing to add there. I think you've seen how, in Europe, we really price for value. So price is not a -- it is always, of course, something we discuss with clients, but it's not the driver of the decision-making.</p><p>DAVID MARK TOGUT: Just as a quick follow-up, new markets for virtual payments were highlighted today. You're already strong in travel, technology and fleet cards. What are the big new verticals you're looking at for virtual payments and B2B?</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: Do we call on Sachin? Okay. You need a microphone. Just introduce yourself, Sachin.</p><p>SACHIN MEHRA, BUSINESS FINANCIAL OFFICER OF NORTH AMERICA REGION, MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED: I'm Sachin Mehra. I'm responsible for global commercial products at MasterCard. Some of the verticals which are actually particularly attractive in the virtual card space are the media space, the construction space, commercial real estate, insurance, health care. So these are some really, really interesting areas in which we are seeing real opportunity and potential for growth.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Okay. Lisa?</p><p>LISA DEJONG ELLIS, SENIOR ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So it's Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Can you guys directly address how you're dealing with the competitive threat from Alipay as they're making, aggressively, investments ex China through MoneyGram, through Paytm, through HelloPay, et cetera?</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: Let me get that to start off with. I would say, first of all, Alipay's model outside of China is still unproven to me. I think in China, the unique combination of circumstances that enabled Alibaba, Alipay, WeChat and all them -- all of them to play really important role there, that isn't quite the case in a number of other markets. And so I want to watch how that develops and goes. Having said that, I'm not going to respond to them without thinking about what we're doing in the space. What are they doing, really? They're enabling digital commerce to proceed. They want to spend a lot of time on everything they're doing on digital commerce. We're doing it in all the markets where those people are also investing. And so our approach to this is both do what you need to do to be there in that market and meet unmet needs, but also keep an eye on them and, in some ways, partner with them when our assets are complementary. So we're actually helping and discussing with a number of them, everything from diagnosing fraudulent tools on their websites to what they could be doing in different spaces that could use data or that could use ForEx, foreign exchange, clearing systems. There's things we could do together. I don't know what that'll lead to, but I do know that what we need to do is to keep our foot forward on what we are doing in digital. That's the best way to grow and protect and develop what we've got in our asset base, right? And, Ling Hai, you've got something else on your favorite friends in China? Sorry, but there were very few Indian names there. They were all Chinese names. So I have no answer.</p><p>LING HAI: The other thing I think that's worth pointing out is Alibaba, today, is a customer of ours as well on the cross-border side. I mean, AliExpress, which is their SME trading platform, many people are paying with credit cards. So we'll continue to treat them as a customer on cross-border, and we'll continue to explore with them broader partnerships on the cross-border side. And that's true for Alibaba, but that's also true for other digital players in China. And then once we enter China, we'll figure out what other things we can do together.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: You should take the perspective of what we did at PayPal, where everybody thought of us only as being competitive. But in actual fact, there's a lot we can do together while ensuring that our brands are still competitive at the front end with a consumer in a marketplace. That's not dissimilar to our learnings and approaches to the big giants from other countries.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Great. Next question, please. Darrin, at the back.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER, MD, BARCLAYS PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Darrin from Barclays. Ajay, just the first question is around the services opportunities. You've done a pretty big initiative over the past few years investing in different areas, building that out, and that's clearly helped your growth profile. I guess, where are you now? Where is your mind in terms of incremental? Do you still need more? Was VocaLink the sort of capstone for now? Or are we going to see more deals like that around the world to complement?</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: So VocaLink to me is actually not a service as much as a whole different way of attacking alternative payment flows that traditionally were stronger in noncard rails than card rails. But services, actually, like NuData, Brighterion, those are real examples of services. And I would say that it's really hard for me to tell you that there's a time to put pencils down on services because these are continually evolving in today's circumstance. They have all, with the technology; and NuData, as a firm would not have been on our radar screen 5 years ago. But today, they're critically relevant to providing safety and security for devices so you can read what -- as Bhalla was saying, you can read how people use their device. How they type, what they type, the frequency, the speed, the manner. That kind of thing enables you to get intellectual heft at applying to whether that device is being used by me or by Ajay Bhalla, who's masquerading as me, which he could, and get away with my salary, right? Which he has tried to do in the past. So the point is that and the thing is that NuData would not have been on my radar 3 and 4, 5 years ago. And therefore, I can't tell you that there will be another one in a year's time, 6 months' time, in 3 months' time and any point of time. Martina's team is looking at somewhere between 5 and 10 acquisitions. We'll probably end up doing 1 or 2 out of those on the average year. And our strike rate of 10%, 20% is at best what we will get. So they're a little overworked about the M&amp;A deal, but we are actually very careful what we actually do. It's got to fit into the portfolio of services that you saw in Martina's listing. It's got to bring us either technology we don't have, a geographic footprint we don't have, some people skills we don't possess in some way or some forward distribution with an embedded client base that we would find impossible to break into. It has to bring one of those or multiple of those things for us to work with them.</p><p>DARRIN DAVID PELLER: Okay. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up for Martina. On the FASB adjustments, I know you mentioned, for 2017, not a material impact. But just so we could help understand 2018, just longer term, I mean, you're going to amortize some of these over a few years now, obviously. Is that something we should be expecting to have very little in terms of material impact on '18 and beyond as well in revenues? Or...</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: That's very hard to forecast at this point in time because it also depends what kind of deals you're actually signing in 2018. And that obviously impacts the amortization of those incentives. So at the moment, I can only tell you, for 2017, it had a minimal impact.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Bryan? Just behind you there, Jason.</p><p>BRYAN KEANE, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. The B2B opportunity comes up a lot. It's starting to feel real to me, though, this time. Can you explain, how do you convert that volume? How do you get it on to MasterCard rails? And what kind of yields are we talking about in that?</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: Okay. Sachin, you want to give that a try?</p><p>SACHIN MEHRA: So as we think about the B2B opportunity, I think it's important to recognize, as we did up there, that the channels of B2B payments can go across point of sale or the point of interaction and the accounts payable channel. And there are multiple ways to go after this. It's not just about cards. Cards will be a big part of it as it relates to the virtual card strategy, which we have in place. We've been executing on that. It's been growing at a very nice pace, and it will continue to go down that path based on some of the new verticals which we want to penetrate and the new segments we want to get into as it relates to virtual card and the B2B space. But there is more to it than just the card side of the business, and it's around business -- and very big need in the B2B space as it relates to data. Data, particularly as it relates to reconciliation for folks who are receiving money, i.e., the payees, and their ability to actually get data associated with what they're getting paid for. And there's a real opportunity to actually work across the ACH rails to enhance that ACH payment flow with enhanced data and monetize that. And that would be the other approach for us to be taking, and that's what we're going down the path of. In fact, the B2B hub which we talked about is around providing both card and noncard rails to allow to meet the needs for working capital, data, efficiency and control in the B2B space and allowing us to monetize both through the card rails as well as noncard rails.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: The only thing I'd add to that is you should think of us -- we've been growing in the commercial business, the overall business, and we've been able to tackle with the tools we had until now. We've been growing at a faster rate than the typical core product growth rate. I don't think you should expect that to change, but figuring out how to monetize the opportunity that VocaLink and their technology and their people and their skills represent and what that'll do to our growth rate going in the future, that is still a year or 2 away because of the reason that the business model in that space tends to vary a little country by country, opportunity by opportunity, whether they get it at the infrastructure level or the app level or the services level or a combination of all 3, that's all right now WIP. And so we understand the business opportunity to address that, read that space. What we don't yet know adequately to give you clear guidance on is how does that translate into dollars and cents tomorrow morning? Don't presume that because I can't give it to you. If I gave it to you, it will be a mistake. It'll change every time for the next 2 years. We're going to learn our way through that because VocaLink has had experiences in how many countries, now, [David]? 5 countries. And will you -- give him a microphone for a second. Talk to us a little bit about your experiences on revenue-generating opportunities in those 5 countries and others that you're talking to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I think this is a piece of work in progress, because prior to being acquired by MasterCard, VocaLink's had a steady, constrained balance sheet. So we always chose to go to market in collaboration with somebody else as an operator, and we allowed the local countries to determine what scheme roles they wanted to have. But if you look at ACH as a way of making payments, it's quite localized for every market. It really needs a high degree of professionalization and the opportunity to drive business' business flows in a profitable way across this is opened up quite dramatically once you can invest in scheme structures and the rules, the sorts of things you see in card. The characteristic of ACH is they are intently national, and they probably shouldn't be. Think about the ability of moving money real time within the U.S. Should it stop at the U.S. borders or should it move beyond that? What do businesses need? So long term, as Ajay says, it actually sounds like a great opportunity.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: Well, one of the things we were trying to do today was to make you see what we are seeing with VocaLink and its capabilities that goes beyond Mastercard Send, even with Mastercard Send being enhanced by our HomeSend collaboration, which allows us to go beyond debit card-to-debit card connectivity and all the way into mobile phones and a Western Union pickup center. That itself is more than the -- than Mastercard Send could do by itself, which, by the way, is what our competitors also have. They don't have HomeSend. Beyond that, the data, messaging and instant payment systems that a Fast ACH system bring to us is yet another level of opportunity. That's what we were trying to make sure you understood and you knew that our eyes were very clearly focused on that opportunity. That's why we did that transaction. Getting a transaction done to get 17 banks to approve a sale to one party is not a transaction I want to do again. But I did it, because it's worth that opportunity that I can see.</p><p>BRYAN KEANE: Okay, very helpful. And just a quick follow-up for Martina. The guidance increased in the '16 to '18 in the performance objectives. Is there an implied acceleration in those numbers for '18? And if that's true, what would be a result?</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: I'm not going to give you the split by year.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: That's a good try. That's a good try.</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: It's a good try. You just have to figure out what you want to do with your model at this point.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Great. Let's go to this side of the room. Sanjay?</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI, MD, KEEFE, BRUYETTE, &amp; WOODS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. I wanted to follow up on the M&amp;A question. Just in terms of the current environment, is there any identifiable need that you might see for yourselves? And then maybe size and scope? A lot of the deals that you've done have been more bolt-on type outside of maybe VocaLink. Just in terms of the size and scope, that would be helpful.</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: So I'm just going to take this one. So first of all, I mean, one thing I hope you took away from today is that the payment space is extremely dynamic and growing. And when such a space is dynamic and growing, you will see opportunities that you can't all deliver on from an organic investment point of view. And -- but we will evaluate at any point in time in terms of how much does it cost? How long would it take us to develop the capability if you want to develop it internally? Do we have the right kind of skill set, people, resources, et cetera, in order to do it and get it to market in the right time? And there are certain circumstances, as you have seen us do in the past, where you will decide or we will decide, it's not going to be an organic opportunity, we have to buy something in the market space. From an overall -- where we are looking, we continue to look in the safety and security space, we continue to look in the data analytics space, we continue to look in the loyalty space. And so those are kind of the main spaces. In terms of ZIP codes, it's really hard, and I hope you saw that over the last 6, 7 years, to find bigger companies. Most of the companies that operate in these kind of spaces are rather small. So at this point in time, I could not foresee that we're going to have a large change in terms of the kind of ZIP codes that we're looking at from a purchase price point of view.</p><p>SANJAY HARKISHIN SAKHRANI: And just one follow-up question. Congratulations on the Bank of America win. When we think about the opportunity in terms of size and scope, maybe you could just talk about that in timing, like how that's pushed through into the numbers. Is that a 2018 event or is it thereafter?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Well, I'll leave it to Martina to tell you that she's not going to tell you when it's going to show up in the first place. But I can provide a little more color on it. The -- as I said in the remarks, it's -- beginning next year is when we'll see that activity start to be issued as part of the MasterCard network. Something we're really excited about. We've been working with Bank of America for a long time. We've got a great relationship with them in the debit space. We do small business. We've got a lot of activity in the commercial space, and we've been active with them in consumer credit but in a relatively -- on a relatively smaller scale. These portfolios are important parts of Bank of America's overall consumer credit book, the Cash 123 and the non-rewards credit cards are -- Cash 123 in particular is an important part of the affluent and mass affluent offering that they have. And I can tell you we'll significantly increase our presence with them in the consumer credit space.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: One thing you should know, it's not a back-book flip. It's a forward issuance, therefore, don't do any numbers in 2018. How's that for an answer?</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: In the center here, Tien-tsin.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG, SENIOR ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, just a couple of questions. Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. First, just I want to ask a B2B question maybe a different way. Why has card penetration in B2B been so low? Is it a cost interchange issue? Is it distribution? Just curious. And are you going to be shifting resources from card to ACH, given what you guys talked about today? And I have a follow-up.</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: Sachin, you are up again. Your turn.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Sachin, do you want my seat?</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: Actually, he may want your job. Be careful.</p><p>SACHIN MEHRA: It's important to understand needs, and this is where the channel of payment comes into play. When you think about a point-of-sale channel, you think about what the most important need at point-of-sale is, which is to establish trust between a buyer and a seller, i.e., you walk into a store, Target, you fill up a basket of goods, and when you're checking out, you need a valid authorization code in order to check out, because when I walk out, the person who is checking me out doesn't know me. And the only way they can let you walk out is with a valid auth code. That's where cards come into play. Cards work really well in that point-of-sale channel. Now think about the accounts payable channel. In the accounts payable channel, typically, the buyer and supplier of goods and services know each other. They actually have entered into a contract, a purchase order. Goods and services have been delivered. There's an invoice which has been sent, and typically, that invoice gets paid 30 or 60 days later. They know each other. They don't need real-time authentication or validation between a buyer and a seller. And this is where, cards, while they're important from an overall liquidity and a working capital standpoint, what they don't necessarily provide is, other than virtual cards, the data capability which is required. So in B2B channel, we should think about the needs being more around the need for data, the need for a controlled payment environment and need for a more efficient accounts payable process, all of which actually happen with virtual cards and will happen more extensively as we go down the ACH path to actually create applications over ACH to provide those needs -- or rather meet those needs. So -- and that's the reason why penetration of cards, when you think about it in the whole stack of B2B opportunity, seems really low. When you think about penetration of cards as a percentage of point of sale, it's roughly about 10%, and it's growing. And it's growing pretty rapidly. So you need to break this up by point of sale versus accounts payable and what the needs in each channel are, and then the solutions come after that.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: Tien-tsin, the other thing is the B2B hub idea is to ensure that we are not biasing the offering that we're giving to the company, in this case, the B2B space, based on what we think we can shore on into what suits us. Instead, it's about optimizing the way of paying for that vendor and that supplier and that purchaser to each other, whether it be a check payment, an ACH payment, a virtual card payment. That's actually what we're trying to build. So that, in theory, it turns with the agnostic system could help that buyer and seller interact in the most efficient way for that particular transaction. That's kind of what Sachin has built with the B2B hub in our partnership with a couple of other players.</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: Sure. That makes sense. Maybe just to bring Tim Murphy into the conversation, just a question on...</p><p>TIMOTHY H. MURPHY, CHIEF FRANCHISE OFFICER AND GENERAL COUNSEL, MASTERCARD INCORPORATED: Thank you.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: We actually planned that somebody was going to ask a question, another person would answer it and say, \"Tim, it's yours.\"</p><p>TIEN-TSIN HUANG: I'm prepared for a very long answer for whatever you ask. I'm paid by the minute or second. Yes, just you talked about a lot of the regulations that's just going on in Europe and the U.K. We've been focusing on the litigation side of it. What's going on, on U.K. litigation? And what's the implication for Mastercard in the sector?</p><p>TIMOTHY H. MURPHY: Yes, so thank you for that. I actually will be brief. I think our job on the legal side is to continue to take down the overall litigation risk. Broadly, I think we're making decent -- I think we're making good progress. It doesn't mean it's gone away, but I'm seeing positive signs. Some of that is because of, frankly, regulation. We are seeing -- you know the trend in the payment system is to see more regulation. Frankly, when you've got a regulated environment, you don't have litigation risk because you're following a law. And that is an unintended benefit of the regulatory environment. So I see our current litigation challenges as mostly about addressing legacy issues. We've got an ongoing challenge in the U.S., which you didn't ask about, which I can talk about off-line. I see real good progress in Europe. So you asked about the U.K. We won the Steward's judgment earlier this year. That was the first the time interchange has been affirmatively, positively found to be lawful in Europe, set a new standard requiring the courts to look at 2 sides of the market, which we think is critical. And I think that's going to be very helpful to us in terms of taking down the ongoing merchant risk, and we've seen good progress on that so far. We'll try to work to continue to get the cases behind us. We also got rid of the U.K. consumer case this year. So a lot of you had questions last year about that claim. Very inflated numbers. We have been able to dispose of consumer claims now, not just in the U.K. but previously in the U.S. Interchange fundamentally benefits consumers, so we thought that case was wrong from the beginning, and we're happy to see it excluded. We are seeing the export of U.S.-style class action litigations into Europe and into other markets, so this is an important precedent for us. So we've -- I don't get paid on my batting average and I don't want to be in this job, but we actually have had a pretty good year.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: If that's a hint, it's a very poor hint.</p><p>TIMOTHY H. MURPHY: That was like -- by the way, that was my -- that was the getting in my year-end review with Sachin. Now he won't know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Tim wants to be paid well.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: (inaudible) was paying attention to the last part. It's the only part that made sense.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Jason, Tom, right here in front of me. Forward, to your right. Yes. There you go.</p><p>THOMAS CRAIG MCCROHAN, MD OF AMERICAS RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES USA LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom McCrohan from Mizuho Securities. Question on contactless. What's your sense of the market readiness in the U.S. for contactless to take off? And how do you expect to overcome -- there seems to be some reluctance by the larger retailers to turn on the NFC capability.</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I think that the question around contactless starts with enablement of the technology. And the fact that the United States has gone through a massive reterminalization over the last couple of years, driven in large part by the EMV migration, has resulted in hardware now being deployed across the marketplace that largely is capable of facilitating a contactless transaction. So there's one significant hurdle that's been overcome. There's a question around, So does the hardware get enabled? You need to turn on the software for it to work. There are pockets of the market, I'd say, in the merchant community where there are sort of philosophical issues or concerns with a couple of large merchants in particular that, for strategic reasons, they probably will not enable it. But by and large, I think, with the hardware in place and with the ability to turn that on with software relatively easily and some increasing interest on the issuing side and getting contactless-enabled cards into the marketplace, we're seeing that now with several issuers, with portfolios contactless enabled and more issuers evaluating that, I think we'll start to see kind of a slow and steady increase in that. I don't -- it's not going to happen overnight, I don't think, because it's going to take both of the -- both sides of the issuing and merchant communities to activate that in parallel.</p><p>MICHAEL MIEBACH: But this is something we've seen happen in markets around the world. And what you have to remember is contactless is a fundamentally better consumer experience. When you look at the data, once people tap 2 or 3 times, they don't go back to the way they did before. So the experience transit in London, where now I think it was 40% of the rides are contactless transaction from nothing 18, 24 months ago. And that experience is now going across the merchant community there. So as you see transit systems come up, as you see more consumers getting exposed to it in environments, I think savvy retailers will want to provide the best checkout experience to their customers. And now that they have the equipment to do it, the question whether or not the enable it, I think you'll see that roll across the market, just like we've seen across Australia, Canada, U.K. and many similar markets to the U.S., because consumers like it better.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: I'm actually going to take a question off the web. Craig Maurer, who had hoped to be here, was unable to be here at the last moment. Regarding India, so, Ari, get ready. I am concerned about Mastercard losing the market to Paytm the way China went Alipay and WeChat Pay, though the circumstances were different in China. Why are you confident you're going to win in India and other EMs versus disruptors like Ant who are willing to lose money? No motive interchange like in the U.S.</p><p>ARI SARKER: Well, Paytm has made good progress with respect to the proprietary QR code-based payment system, and now with BharatQR, which is the interoperable EMV standard, Paytm is looking to adopt BharatQR as well. So what you're going to end up having is a universe where Paytm builds out its own merchants acceptance environment, and with MasterCard, with our 250 million cardholders, who will be enabled for BharatQR through their mobile banking app, becomes an extremely attractive opportunity for Paytm to enable at their merchant sites. So I think this is where, I think Ajay referred to it as well, there will be areas of partnership. And if we can bring standards, we can bring higher safety and security products, we'll be able to monetize in a market where there will be competition and yet collaboration.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Great. Thank you. I think we have time for just maybe a couple of questions, maybe in the back. This gentleman here.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. I wanted to ask another question, Craig, about Bank of America and that win. Are there any other kind of replicate-able factors that you can point to in this win maybe that would -- could apply to other credit issuers in the U.S.? Things like wanting to balance out the issuance or differentiated product capabilities. Is this a kind of a fit into the wedge for increased pace of wins in U.S. credit? Or is this sort of a one-off?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I'll take it this way. The way in which we approach Bank of America is not dissimilar to the way we're approaching other partners of ours across the marketplace, and it's leveraging all of these capabilities and assets and services that we spent much of the morning talking about to use them in ways that we align with our partner to address challenges they're having with their business or opportunities that they see to grow faster or tackle new segments of the market, to whether that's leveraging innovation through the things we do in MasterCard Labs to help co-create new concepts, whether that's leveraging our core product capabilities to -- and our product team working collaboratively with our partners to think about the right value proposition to target a particular consumer segment with, services capabilities like this, fraud solutions to tackle a problem that any partner may be having in trying to get those costs down. These are things that we're doing across the board with our partners, and it was no different with Bank of America. And it's a -- that's the basis on which we try to build relationships with our partners and make them see us as the network that's most aligned with helping them grow their business and differentiated in giving them the products and capabilities and technology they need.</p><p>RAMSEY CLARK EL-ASSAL: One super-quick follow-up on PSD2. You kind of couched that as an opportunity, and I kind -- I get where you're coming from. At the same time, is there a disruptive threat there? It seems like the bank account is a bit of a walled garden and card payments are a bit of a preferred payment method there. Could this also be letting a lot of other players into a territory where you kind of had some dominance before?</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: Javier? Would you like to...</p><p>JAVIER PEREZ: So yes, absolutely. Of course, there is a challenge, right? So every time there is an opportunity, there is also a threat. Now I don't totally disagree. You said one thing, is that we're dominant on those flow of payments, and that's not exactly the case. You probably saw that the ACH volumes in Europe, I'm sure, are much larger than the card payments today. So the question is really, are we going to be able to -- and capable of displacing some of that -- I'm sorry, I'm going to call it dumb ACH flows today with something much more intelligent? And if we are able to do that well, we will do well. And yes, there could be some movement between rails, but at the end of the day, if we are strong in both rails, we ought to be better off than not.</p><p>MARTINA HUND-MEJEAN: Just to jump in for a minute. What Javier means with dumb ACH ways are the old badge systems, not the fast ACH. So in terms of going after the opportunity that is opening up for PSD2, of course, our card rails, including Mastercard Send, HomeSend, et cetera, will be aboard. But the Fast ACH capability out of VocaLink will be very important on that, too.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: One thing I'd say is that from a bank in Europe right now, PSD2 has enormous implications. Enormous. Whether you're a bank or you're a merchant who has become a bank, be it a Tesco, a Carrefour, it has enormous implications. Please do not, for a minute, believe that we are not cognizant of those challenges for our banking partners. In fact, when I travel in Europe with Javier and his team, that's the discussion every single bank CEO raises with us. We are actually trying to find a way to give them a roadway and a pathway to enabling them through this change in a constructive way, whereby they can see a road to getting -- protecting their consumer information, protecting their consumer relationship, keeping themselves in the primacy of that relationship and not becoming a commoditized back-office service provider as compared to their current role, which is a consumer-linked role. That's what we're talking about. That's the opportunity. We recognize the issue and the threat. We believe that we have a real chance here to be an even better partner of those institutions because so much more of that payment rail was ACH than card. And they know us in the card business as being a good partner. We think we can bring all those skills into that ACH space, particularly with Fast ACH, which is even better than the older ACH. That's the segment of things we're talking about. And you add to that what we could provide with safety and security and the identification of consumers, which in turn becomes the bank's responsibility in PSD2, and you'll begin to see why we think that the repertoire of things they're building actually can solve for a real emerging pain point for institutions in Europe.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: And a final question, [James]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just wanted to ask, I guess, just kind of a big-picture question. I'll leave it open. When we look at the adoption of electronic payments among consumers, your issuer partners have been willing in many parts of the world to incent consumers through rewards, et cetera, to make the transition, and I think that's been really successful. How do you think that dynamic plays out as you start to move into B2B payments? Is it the cost savings and convenience, will that be sufficient? Or are you going to have to create incentives for businesses to move?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: I'll start, and then we can go from there. I think when you think about -- when you're looking at the B2B space, you're dealing with a different end user, a different buyer, if you will, that's going to be motivated by different things. And there are different sets of motivations for B2B buyers, whether it's a large corporate down to a small business, that will vary depending on the need of that business. But they have less to do with rewards. There's obviously an economic equation that may revolve more around the cost of the transaction. But importantly, other things drive value, most significantly data and the information that's involved in reconciling a payment with an invoice. The difficulty in doing that drives huge cost burdens and inefficiencies in a lot of corporate environments. So being able to add to a value proposition around -- at the right price point, with the right set of data to enable seamless reconciliation, with the right sort of speed and finality of the payment transaction is just a different bundle that goes into the value proposition that is much less rewards driven, with the exception of maybe when you get down into the small business segment, that feels an awful lot more like a consumer. And the value propositions that are aimed at small businesses are sort of consumer-plus, I would say, where there's some motivations that look and feel like a consumer. Yes, they want rewards, but they're also time-starved and there's a need for recognition around their business, et cetera. So that's what Sachin and our commercial team spend a lot of time doing is thinking about the needs of those different segments and making sure we have the value proposition to line up against it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So -- and that makes sense to me. I guess, I wonder, though, how does that impact MasterCard as an organizationally to make sure that you can deliver that? Or is that something you have to deliver directly? Or do you continue to rely on your partners throughout?</p><p>CRAIG VOSBURG: Yes, these will continue to be products and capabilities that we deliver through our partners, principally banks, who are serving the needs of the B2B segment, of large corporates, mid-markets, small businesses, in some cases, commercial specialty players like WEX and FLEETCOR. But it's going to be through our distribution partners who are focused on those segments of the market.</p><p>AJAYPAL S. BANGA: We have no intention of becoming a direct vendor of these services between a payer and a buyer. That's not what we're into. We're very clear that the B2B2C idea, which operated as, I think Garry Lyons was mentioning it when he stood up here, that operated in the consumer payment space, it's very much the same logic in the commercial space. We're not in the issuing or -- of banking or -- that's not our business. That's not our core strength, and we will probably do very badly if we tried to do it. We are very clear that we will play with our partners in the right sandbox, functioning as their true partner, putting them at the center of that relationship. We're not trying to get in between them. And thank you for that question, because I'm glad that you raised that because it's actually integral to everything we are doing, is to recognize our role and not try and play outside our role.</p><p>WARREN KNEESHAW: Great.

In 2016, we won three rust-belt states by a point each, and that was when nobody thought Donald Trump could win.\u201d</p><p>Although Trump was <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/26/donald-trump-twitter-fact-check-mail-ballot/\">fact-checked</url> by Twitter after he criticized mail-in voting, he has been angry with Facebook and Twitter before - saying       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/09/05/trump-social-media-interference-election/\">they interfered</url> in both the 2016 presidential election and 2018 midterm elections on behalf of Democrats. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/26/twitter-will-not-remove-donald-trump-tweets-joe-scarborough-intern-lori-klausutis/\">(RELATED: Twitter Says It Will Not Remove Trump's Tweets About Scarborough's Dead Intern)</url></emphasis></p><p>\u201cIn 2020 we have lost the element of surprise, so we have to be as aggressive as they are,\u201d Gaetz said.</p><p>\u201cTwitter is interfering with an election. I've heard Democrats say that Russia was interfering with an election. That was a hoax. We have domestic interference right now,\u201d the congressman noted, saying he will be \u201cfiling a complaint\u201d Friday with the Federal Election Commission to investigate the actions of social media giants against the president. <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/28/trump-fake-news-twitter-jack-dorsey-fact-checking-misinformation/\">(RELATED: Trump Says He'd Delete His Twitter Account 'In A Heartbeat' If It Weren't For 'Fake News')</url></p><p>Gaetz said he doesn't accept donations from social media companies because he believes they want to keep Congress on their side.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-e1587404543880.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks about the new Facebook News feature at the Paley Center For Media on October 25, 2019 in New York City.

We actually have to have investigative work done, transparency, disclosures. If we give these folks the privileges you would give a public utility company, maybe we need to start regulating tech like the public utilities that they are.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rep.

Consolidation of transaction data to identify cross-selling opportunities. The explosion in customer data alongside technological innovations has improved financial services providers' ability to tailor products and create better efficiencies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the use of data also poses urgent questions around ethics, fairness and accessibility. In this regard, social media companies such as Facebook provide a cautionary tale. Ultimately, the customer data questions must be answered in full, or they could erode customers' trust in financial institutions. Conversely, a cautious and diligent approach may offer financial firms a chance to redeem themselves, and give other sectors a blueprint to act towards, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPOTLIGHT ON CUSTOMER DATA Working with the World Economic Forum (WEF), two years ago senior leaders from the finance world identified the use of customer data - and cyber-security - as the major risk facing the financial system. Looking at the problems some tech giants faced in 2018, it was a provident perspective. Finance 'stakeholders' used 2018 to develop global principles for the appropriate use of customer data. The result is a set of guidelines and recommendations all institutions can use.</p><p>It is a very timely initiative. Scrutiny on how businesses should respond to the data challenges will only increase. Those with a proactive approach will win out; those with a reactive one will end up in a situation of 'too little, too late', risking legal trouble or losing clients. At Davos at the end of January, the financial services sector has an opportunity to take a leadership role defining what the appropriate use of customer data means. It is one the industry is well advised not to waste.</p><p>The expanded use of data holds enormous promise for both consumers and businesses. Customers stand to benefit from new products and services tailored to their individual needs, an enhanced user experience, and a means to access products that historically may have been out of reach. Businesses benefit as data enables better risk management, leads to cost savings from more efficient internal operations, and allows for the development of new and enhanced offerings.</p><p>But the world's growing reliance on digital data also presents consumers and businesses with serious risks. Customers may fall victim to fraud and theft whenever their data is leaked and stolen, their privacy is threatened when their data is used without consent, and instead of gaining enhanced access to the financial system they may find themselves excluded from services due to real or perceived concerns highlighted by big data analytics.</p><p>WEF GLOBAL PRINCIPLES In response, businesses and regulatory agencies working with the WEF developed a set of global principles to guide the collection, use and sharing of customer data in financial services. These principles acknowledge the regional differences in societal and cultural beliefs particularly around the idea of privacy. They do not attempt to substitute for country- or industry-specific guidance. They offer a tool to business leaders and policy-makers as they try to enable the benefits of data availability while managing associated risks.</p><p>What are they? The principles developed by the WEF-convened stakeholder group cover five dimensions: control, security, personalisation, advanced analytics and portability. They also highlight a number of trade-offs inherent in data and privacy policies that stakeholders must understand, many of them carrying important ethical considerations.</p><p>Take 'control', for example. The group of banks, insurance companies, law firms, technology companies, public sector actors, trade unions and religious bodies working with the WEF determined that companies should be clear about their use of customer data, attain customer agreement to their customer data policies and, where appropriate, seek consent for specific uses.</p><p>In short, and at a high level, the group thought that it is the customer that controls their data, not the business. This is an important determination that has been picked up in a number of data regulations that have come into effect over the past year, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation or various data localisation laws.</p><p>INDIVIDUAL VS COLLECTIVE RISKS Yet not everybody agrees. Critics warn of overprotection of the individual and their privacy, not only because it limits business' ability to target and market products to them but also because it creates significant challenges for combating financial crime. Effective anti-money-laundering efforts rely on the ability of banks to share data with each other and with regulators. Stringent privacy protections prohibit sharing. Ultimately, what is more important: to protect an individual's privacy and thus their personal data, or prevent heinous crimes such as human trafficking or terrorism financing? Or take the principle on advanced analytics: companies should be able to comprehensively test, validate and explain their use of data analytics and models to customers. As companies increasingly rely on machine intelligence to reach decisions, the spirit of this principle again has found its way into regulations and regulatory guidance documents such as the Feat principles published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (based on fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency).</p><p>Customers should have the right to understand why a decision was reached and why the model methodology is appropriate, say proponents of greater transparency. But 'explainability' comes at a cost. The very promise of artificial intelligence algorithms is that they can enhance themselves - often in ways that even their creators do not always understand. What then if an unexplainable model - a black box algorithm - leads to outcomes resulting in 80% financial inclusion of a certain population while the explainable model only allows for 60% inclusion? Should 'explainability' trump inclusion potential? A SAFE PAIR OF HANDS The trade-offs tackled by the WEF-convened group are specific to financial services. The larger ethical questions they raise are not. The ethics of data collection, use and sharing touch every industry and every stakeholder group. But given the amount of data that financial services firms possess and handle, and the sensitivity of the information they look after, the industry has the opportunity to take leadership in setting standards. It should embrace that opportunity and it has a good story to tell.</p><p>Banks are notoriously conservative. Their risk aversion and natural hesitance to embrace change put them on the backfoot when customers started embracing new and exciting fintech offerings such as peer-to-peer lending or robo-advice. Unable to innovate at the speed at which both big and small techs can, incumbents feared being sidelined.</p><p>Some in the industry predicted a future in which traditional banks would be stuck with the low-return, unsexy pieces of the revenue pie while technology companies would cherry-pick the most desirable, unregulated pieces. This scenario did not play out (at least not yet). The move-fast-and-break-things attitude of some technology companies might play well when disrupting retail or the travel market. It becomes a more problematic mantra when taking on people's retirement savings, life insurance or mortgage.</p><p>Watching one's most personal data being revealed by Equifax, passport and credit card data leaked by Cathay Pacific and British Airways, and user profiles shared with questionable third parties by Facebook, many consumers re-appreciated the often staid but usually reliable financial institutions that hold their savings, fund their student loans and manage their pension assets.</p><p>DEVELOPING A BLUEPRINT If anything, banks in the past had been criticised for sharing data too reluctantly with third parties. Data aggregators such as Yodlee complained about limitations banks introduced on the data that third parties are pulling and thus hindering the ability of consumers to optimise their finances. Banks responded to the criticism, arguing they were merely protecting their customers from security risks and pointing out that few standards exist for how third parties can use customer data or how they must protect it.</p><p>Some fintechs have been criticised for selling data to hedge funds and other investment firms that then harvest transactional data for trading signals. Does a financial institution's fiduciary duty supersede the customer's agency of who to share their data with? Financial institutions have answers to these questions and they must be transparent with their customers. By communicating clearly what data they collect and possess; why they collect it and what they then do with it; and who they share it with for what purposes, financial institutions would deepen trust. They would also position themselves as stewards of their customers' data, a role more likely to be entrusted to them than to big tech.</p><p>Ultimately, the financial services sector may develop a blueprint defining the appropriate use of customer data that could serve as an example and be adopted by other industries. To realise this strategic opportunity, the industry should embrace the principles developed by the WEF stakeholders.</p><p>Matthew Blake is head of future of financial and Monetary SYSTEMS and a MEMBER of the executive COMMITTEE at the world ECONOMIC FORUM.</p><p>Does a financial institution's FIDUCIARY Duty SUPERSEDE the customer's agency of who to share their Data with?

Markets this morning are higher, take a look, we are once again near the highs of the morning with the Dow Industrials up almost 90 points right now. The Dow is set to cross the 24,000 mark right at the open. S&amp;P, NASDAQ also higher this morning. We're waiting by the way on U.S. personal income and spending as well as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and some news out of OPEC this morning. European markets look like this. FT-100 has turned negative and down just a fraction but the CAC quarante is up a quarter of a percent and the DAX Index is up a half of a percent. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower at the close with the exception of Japan. Japan was up two-thirds of one percent. Former Today show host <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>is speaking out this morning, what he has to say coming up, he made a statement. Plus, there are new allegations this morning against him.</p><p>And it could be a turbulent holiday for American airlines passengers, how a computer glitch has the airline scrambling to find pilots to cover 15,000 flights. Then Alexa eyeing the office now, we've got a look at Amazon's plans to enter your workplace. All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Riverfront Investment Group chairman and chief investment officer, Michael Jones, and Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, Fox NewsContributor, Pete Hegseth. Great to see you.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning.</p><p>MICHAEL JONES, CEO, RIVERFRONT INVESTMENT GROUP: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: One quick point, the New York Times tweeting the phone numbers of Republican lawmakers. If -- just imagine if someone on Fox News, a primetime host or the Fox Business Channel started tweeting and giving out the phone numbers of Democratic lawmakers they --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like Chuck Schumer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The widespread outrage across the country that would ensue and harassment and hate and belittling and demeaning language that those people would face online.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HEGSETH: You know, it's true but like Fox --and Fox Business also have opinion hosts who can do just that. The New York Times reports to be buttoned up and independent and only straight down middle, except they are the exact opposite. They're clearly out to get this president no matter what.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Incredible. Really, it is. And the push at every turn, look what just happened with the Consumer Protection Agency.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, how bizarre. All right. We got all that coming up this morning. Joining the conversation, UBS Chairman Axel Weber here in an exclusive. New Jersey Congressman Josh Gottheimer is here along with Texas Congressman Roger Williams. Policy adviser for America First Policies and former CEO of CKE Restaurants, and Andy Puzder joins us, along with the host of VARNEY &amp; COMPANY, Stuart Varney weighs in as well. You won't want to miss a moment of it. Big hour right now. We kick it off right now with this top story. Tax reform in focus on Capitol Hill. The Republican Tax overhaul clear a hurdle yesterday advancing on a 52 to 48 party line vote opening the floor for Senate debate. Blake Burman joins us live at the White House right now with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. That was a very key procedural hurdle that Senate Republicans were able to clear yesterday but there is still much to hash outgoing forward before this final vote. For example among the issues before Senate Republicans potentially or at least the talk of raising the corporate tax rate from 20 percent as it's proposed now up to 22 percent. That is the idea of Senators Rubio and Lee to further expand the child tax credit. However 20 percent has been a firm red line set by President Trump. Then later today Senators Johnson and Graham will introduce an amendment to eliminate SALT deductions for corporations and Senators Corker, Flake and Lankford want to see a trigger mechanism in case growth does not cover the cost of this tax package. Senator Bill Kennedy yesterday said that is issue is still very much a work in progress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: We're looking at a number of options on what I call the trigger issue but we haven't resolved them yet. I will not let them (INAUDIBLE) to be the enemy of the good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: President Trump returned to the road yesterday to pitch tax reform. He did so in Missouri, or to pitch tax cuts as he likes to call them. And the president essentially said, it is gut check time for lawmakers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: But now comes the moment of truth. In coming days the American people will learn which politicians are part of the swamp and which politicians want to drain the swamp.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Maria, as you know, timing on the Hill is always fluid. It is possible that this final vote happened sometime later tonight or in the overnight hours either way expecting to happen before the end of the workweek. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Big week, Blake. Thanks so much. Blake Burman with the latest there. Joining me right now from Capitol Hill, House Financial Services Committee Member, Republican Congressman Roger Williams of Texas along with House Financial Services Member, Co-chair of the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Democrat Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. Good to see you both, gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D). NEW JERSEY: Good to see you.</p><p>SEN. ROGER WILLIAMS (R), TEXAS: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to kick it off right now, Congressman Williams with this trigger, in case growth doesn't cover the cost of tax cuts. What's your take on this? So a trigger is in place, if you don't see the kind of revenue that you have been talking about from this tax plan, a trigger goes in and tax rates go up. Good idea?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. I don't like it at all. You know, as a businessperson, I think it's -- I think it's wrong, the problem is we need a trigger to -- if we don't reach certain thresholds, we need to cut expenses, we don't need raise taxes. I mean, we're talking about tax reform for crying out loud and we don't need to tell American people and small business we're going to raise taxes because that would literally stop long-term planning. If we're short, we need to get it through cuts and Federal government, massive cuts in the Federal government. That's the trigger I was saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what -- that's a great point actually. So where would that be? What do you cut because we're talking about this every morning, and it just seems like there's no money around, you're trying to get a hundred billion dollars here and a hundred billion dollars there, scrap together some money to pay for this corporate tax cut. So, what would you cut in spending? You just -- you just did a $47 trillion budget over 10 years with virtually no cuts in spending.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, there is a lot of waste fraud and abuse in Washington and a lot of people just don't want to cut but I can tell you, people listen to your show in Main Street America, if they're short $1,000 they find $1,000 to cut. We can do that up here if that's -- if we have the desire to do it. So there are plenty of room to cut but we don't need to be raising taxes and same time telling people we're cutting taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Representative Gottheimer, let me turn to you. What's your take on this tax bill?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well I agree they're going to need to be raising taxes which is why coming from New Jersey, you know, this is a huge call in our stocking here for Christmas. It's going to be a huge tax hike on New Jersey and the northeast. Ousted by eliminating the state and local tax deduction and property tax deductions. We're facing a huge tax increase in New Jersey over this. And at the same time, of course we're loading up the deficit here and going to add to our national debt. So, there's no fiscal responsibility in this bill. The only thing I'm seeing are tax hikes which is why I can't believe we're facing this and what they're going to do to gut my economy in New Jersey.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait, well, Congressman Gottheimer, let me ask you about that because much has been said about the certain states that are so-called donor states which are giving more to the Federal government than they're actually getting back whether it's New Jersey or New York or Connecticut or Illinois, California. The biggest user of that state and local deduction SALT, six million Californians use it. One other category of so-called Federal spending bill in state is retirement benefits, right? I mean, three-quarters of which consist of Social Security payments including payments to veterans, retirement benefits to Federal workers, disability payments, these are the largest classifications of funds flowing to the state. That's a big reason why the blue states are failing poorly in the total capping of the Federal dollars, isn't it? Can you -- it's not apples to apples because your state is also getting a lot in terms of these kinds of benefits.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Now listen, there's going to -- of course, you're not going to mess people's Social Security and I think we -- Roger and I both agree about that but here is my issue, it doesn't make sense. We actually dissect the numbers and look at it. There's a lot more in there. There's a reason why Mississippi is getting $4.38, for every dollar they're paying Federal taxes and we're getting 33 cents back for every dollar in my district.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're getting more money on benefits.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: No matter what -- no matter what -- no matter what you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're getting more money on benefits. That's my --</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: That does not make -- I know but I understand, but that does not make up $4.38. I mean, I'll break down the Math for you and what's very clear is you've got other states that are moochers and others states like mine that are -- that are paying way more in into the -- into the Senate and they're getting back. Now what's happening --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or they're saying you're a moocher because you're getting all this benefit.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Or I would say actually this was a clear tax hike bill, it's now adding on to what we're paying into the middle and so I'll do the math for you and for everybody and show you that after this tax hike bill, how we're going to just get even more crushed in my state and we're expected to pay even more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Do the math. Do the -- do the math. Go ahead.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Sure. If you look at the $4.38 and if you break down the dollar, what you've got is a ton of money that's going in for things like roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that aren't going to our state. If you look at between New York and New Jersey where we have clearly a -- we have a -- the northeast corridor as you know which is a clear center of commerce in the country, we've got roads and bridges that are literally falling part and we can't get a -- we can't get a nickel back for the dollars we're paying in to fix those roads and bridges. I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. But you're not --you're not mentioning the money you're getting for Social Security --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Of course. All states are getting money for Social Security.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The money you're getting for veterans, the retirement that is - - look, I'm with you, I live in New York and my taxes will go up. I totally understand what you're saying.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Maria, it's a red -- it's a -- it's a red herring.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Let's say it's a clear red herring, it's a piece of it but there's more, there's much more waste that's going into these places and it's ridiculous, they should cut the waste and actually make sure that we're getting better return on investment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's funny that you say, look, I think we both agree and you turn to Roger Williams saying, we both agree, we're not going to touch Social Security. Roger Williams, you just said a second ago we need cut spending. If you're not going to reform Social Security, what are you talking about in terms of cutting spending? Where are you going to cut spending? We know what's going on, we know all the growth of spending is in Social Security and other benefits. So what do you say?</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's no -- there's no question about that that we need to begin to start cutting something for crying outside loud. I mean, you know, we --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are you going to cut?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, look, I mean, if you want to start talking about cut, we need to look at every department. I mean, you can -- I'm the 10th amendment guy, past power the state, getting government smaller. I think government should do three things, collect my taxes, defend my borders, cut me with infrastructure and then -- and then get out of the way and let the -- this great engine of capitalism and main street begin to work. That's what we need to be doing but we got to get serious about it and we need to cut expenses, not raise expenses. And I'm excited -- I'm excited Maria about this tax bill. This is going to be great. I'm a businessperson. People are so excited out there about the chance to get more money in January with less withholding. They're going to spend that money, we're consumption-driven nation. It's going to be good for this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But just -- let's not forget what Josh is saying here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Basically saying, yes, you are looking at a corporate tax cut that's going to be impactful but partly you're paying for it by removing that state and local tax deduction which will mean higher taxes for some people. Congressman Williams, are you comfortable with a corporate rate -- at a pass-through rate of 22 percent should it go that way?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I've always been a 20 percent. I think -- I think corporate tax should be around 20 percent and so I want to stick with that. Again, we're talking about raising it to 21 or 22 percent to pay for something. The pay-for should be the reduction of size of Federal government, not raising taxes. So 20 percent is a great rate, it will let corporations and people make more money. Put more people to work, let them realize the American dream. Now, I will say 21 or 22 percent is not deal breaker, for me it's much less than what we're paying now.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I'm worried about that -- I'm worried about that trillion and a half dollar deficit. I'm also worried about the fact that you're a competent teacher in Paramus, New Jersey. This bill tax like will go $5,000, Maria. Businesses are going to leave. I want to cut the corporate tax rate, that's my position but you can't also then load it up in our backs in New Jersey.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally understand that.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: And expect us to carry the bill and your point, I get your point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Congressman, the first thing that Mr. Murphy did as soon as he won governor of New Jersey was to talk about millionaire's tax. The first thing that he said --</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I don't think we should --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know. Now he doesn't want to do it because he's got to rethink it because he sees this deduction going away. But don't you think overtime, a plan like this which removes this deduction is going to correct some of these governors and state legislators that all they can do is raise taxes on the rich? I mean, maybe they need to start thinking about their state taxes bringing them lower and pulling in to spending. Isn't this the kind of thing that's actually going to change that kind of behavior overtime?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think of course, every single state has got to open their books and make sure we get more physically responsible including my state. But you can't overnight flip the switch and suddenly say, you can't deduct your property taxes, you can't deduct your state and local taxes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how do you do it?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Because home value --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you move Mr. Murphy? How do you get these guys to say, oh, we better rethink this, maybe millionaire's tax is not such a good idea.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think you already hear everyone saying we're going to rethink this, right? That's the clear -- that's the clear language.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because of the SALT elimination.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Of course we got to rethink this. We're facing now a huge tax hike from the Federal government, that's suddenly going to be on our backs and we're going to have housing prices free-fall, and with housing prices free-fall, that puts a ton of pressure on local government and businesses will leave.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: And people will be underwater in their homes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you're right.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Right. Just watch the recession impact and then you want to load up -- I don't understand how we keep ignoring the fact that this adds to the deficit and it's going to pile on our national debt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, Congressman, let's be honest, President Obama doubled the debt in eighth years. I didn't hear peep out of anybody when he doubling debt from 10 trillion to 20 trillion.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: So talk to me. I was peeping, you were peeping.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maria, the best way to fix some of these states and these issues, still to move to Texas. We got no personal income tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know that. I know that. I think you're going to see it in place --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: We're pay -- we're paying by the way because that's -- because I'm paying for it. Yes, I got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, look, I -- there's no doubt, we're going to see mobility here. People will leave these high-tax states, I agree. We'll see if it actually moves the needle on behavior here. Congressman, great conversation. Really appreciate both of you joining us this morning. We are talking about all the important issues, sir.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. Roger Williams Josh Gottheimer there. Breaking news, President Trump just tweeted this, the stock market hits a new record-high, confidence and enthusiasm abound, more great numbers coming out. He is right. Yesterday an all-time high and the markets rallying again today. Coming up. Today show turmoil. New allegations emerge this morning against <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>as he speaks out for the first time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New details this morning about accusations against <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>after fired he was fired by NBC for appropriate sexual behavior. Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren, what can you tell us?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: We got that news that <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>was fired yesterday morning and now about 24 hours later, there is a statement from the former Today show co-host that's given by Savannah Guthrie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Moments ago received a statement from Matt and let me read it to you. There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. To the people I have hurt I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depths and damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC. Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized that there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul-searching I'm committed to beginning that effort. it is now my full- time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It's been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by people I love. I thank them for patience and grace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. He's not denying anything. He -- to highlight what he said, there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed. So all this went down on Monday. When we believe an intern was working with Matt at the Sochi Olympics three years ago and she had text messages reportedly from the New York Post, that's what they're saying and she had pictures and she presented to NBC News 24 hours later. He is fired and since then, we are hearing other allegations from other women. Variety had a very explicit story that they were actually working on because in light of Harvey Weinstein, et cetera, they working on expose for about two months' time. And they have several women saying that to this, he had the secret button in his -- in his office where he could close the door, and the New York Times and this has been confirmed by NBC News that two more women came forward with allegations of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>after the firing. So now, we're starting to learn about the depths of this. And the question is, did NBC news know they say no, they did not. And, you know, as we try to protect an industry, the Today show, 500 million a year in revenue and <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>made over $20 million a year. He was fixture on that show and for the network. Do you protect him at the expense of what was going on in the workplace?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point out, this is a network, NBC overall, MSNBC killing the Ronan Farrow piece that he's working on on Harvey Weinstein and he ended up having to take it somewhere else publishing the details that he uncovered in the New Yorker after the original New York Times story on Harvey Weinstein. It just worth pointing out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which lends to the belief that they were sort of stamping it down, no big deal.</p><p>JONES: Covering from one another.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's awkward would it be for <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>to have to present that story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Working in T.V., I just want to raise this question, was he really the only individual who could sit in that chair on that show? Of all the people who are terrific on television.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what you're saying is why protect somebody so much if in fact there's bad behavior going on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: Everyone is at some level replaceable, it's an important principal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we all have to remember that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And remember that. Again, every minute is a gift, in life and work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're absolutely right. Lauren, thank you. Thank you for that. Coming up, failing the job on Wells Fargo. How the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dropped all the balls on actually protecting consumers from the bank's myriad of scandals. And then chipotle looks to wrap up a new CEO as its found -- as its founder steps down over falling sales and health scares. We take a look at what it will take to turn around this flagging franchise. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau supposed to be the ultimately consumer advocate against bank fraud but when it came to Wells Fargo, it was quite a different story. Gerri Willis is here now with the very latest. Gerri, good morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning to you, and you've been on this for weeks now. Listen to this, two staff reports, I've got them right here, written for House Financial Service Committee members and obtained by Fox Business show that far from protecting consumers from bank fraud, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ignored early warnings of trouble at Wells Fargo. The reports issued in June and September of this year reveal a bureau slow to react an investigation that failed to be either comprehensive or independent. Details of the scandal came to light back on December 21st, 2013 when L.A. Times published an article about Wells Fargo employees opening millions of consumer accounts without their knowledge to generate fees. The Los Angeles City attorney launched an investigation and filed a civil suit in May, 2015.</p><p>Now, despite having in beds working inside Wells Fargo and at least one whistle-blower report about the fraudulent accounts as early as 2013, the CFPB apparently did precious little to follow the money according to this September report, committee investigators were 'unable to corroborator\", the CFPB was actively investigating or conducting active supervision of Wells Fargo fraudulent branch sales practices. When the committee subpoenaed support materials, the bureau in its investigation they were press clippings and the bank zone records. I mean, I think this is $600 million every year wasted but the most amazing thing I found is that what the CFPB was actually interested in following not the big case that was ultimately settled but they were interested in race discrimination, they thought Wells Fargo had race discrimination in credit card operations that they gave whites higher lines of credits than they gave with African- Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well -- and the reason that we're looking at this is because of all of the brouhaha over the Consumer Financial Protection Agency where the president wanted to vote Mick Mulvaney in and the number two person said, no, no, I want to run it. Well, really? You're supposed to be defending consumers, where were you with all of these scams?</p><p>HEGSETH: That's right. And one thing you focused on is racial disparity and you're saying none was found.</p><p>WILLIS: None was found and, you know, look, they could have got onto these other problems at Wells Fargo earlier. The problem with the auto loans, you name it, you know, what was being charged to people who were doing business internationally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: Lots of things they could have done, not to they totally missed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And of course, this was an Elizabeth Warren sort of baby and she just wanted to just stick it to the banks.</p><p>JONES: How much do you think this comes of, you know, Congress can write reports on this agency but they can't actually supervisor it. They don't actually --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JONES: It was built with no accountability to Congress. How much do you think this failure to look at the big problem and pursue whatever the interests of the director was, how much do you think that comes from the way it was structured with no accountability?</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I think it's a huge thing obviously, I think it's a big problem and now Mick Mulvaney is running the bureau, you got to think some things will change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And he said the other day, you can't believe how much power I have running this. Wait until you see how much power I have when you actually take a look at the power and the independence and the no accountability of the Consumer Final Protection Agency. Gerri, thank you for pointing all of that out for us. Joining us to talk more about it is America First Policy adviser and former CEO of CKE Restaurants, Andy Puzder. Andy, good to see you. Thank so much you for joining us.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CEO, CKE RESTAURANT: Glad to be here, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the CFPB's failure to investigate Wells Fargo, what are they doing?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, I think it's a problem with all of these Dodd-Frank agencies, the Dodd-Frank legislation in general. It really -- it really doesn't do what it was supposed to do which is regulate these large banks to try and prevent financial problems. In fact, the fines that Wells Fargo paid total, for all agencies totaled about 185 million for -- in a quarter where they made 5.6 billion. So it's not really a very big punishment. What Dodd-Frank does, what this agency does, they hurt the small banks, they hurt the community banks. I got to believe that if a small bank did what Wells Fargo did they'd be out of business now. So it -- the law is defective, Mulvaney is right, that agency has too much power, it's unregulated, it's not responsible to any other branch of government as it should be. I would hope the courts would strike it down. I think this is -- the agency is a disaster and I'm not surprised by the result.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Andy, it's Dagen McDowell to quote the great <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>the reason the economy is firing the way that it is and growing north of three percent is because of this rollback in regulations. Because the stranglehold on business is over according to this administration. How much do you think is related to the economic growth, how much of that is related to the big rollback in regulations?</p><p>PUZDER: A tremendous amount. If you look at -- you look at the different agencies, the different independent organizations that measure consumer confidence and confidence in the business community, they all -- they all shot right up after the election, it wasn't a pre-election event, it was a postelection event and when businesses are optimistic they invest, when consumers are optimistic, they spend and we're seeing the results of that in the second and third quarter with two quarters of three percent plus GDP growth which we haven't seen for years. So, I think -- I think Maria is absolutely right, it is deregulation. You know, I don't know if you followed this much but there was recently a report out that said the Federal register's page number has been reduced by 32 percent --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PUZDER: -- in the first nine months of the Trump administration. Reagan reduced it 33 percent but it took years. He is going to be most deregulating president in history and we will continue to see the results in the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. They dealt --</p><p>PUZDER: Particularly if we can get tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They joke in Congress that the number of pages that President Obama increased is equivalent to 15 King James's bibles. No really, that's the joking Congress, Michael Jones.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JONES: Yes. I think it's the actual regulations coming down but I think it's also the attitude of the regulatory agency.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, yes.</p><p>JONES: So, you know, I -- as small businessman I can tell you for the last -- a lot of last eight or nine years, you didn't feel like your regulators were coming in to help make things better. They were coming in to see what they could catch you at and they cost you tremendous amount in legal bills and things that were not actually adding to growth and adding to employment. With a new attitude from the regulatory bodies, we're here to see if we can improve things for your employees, improve things for your customers as supposed to we're here to get fines out of you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Focus on growth.</p><p>JONES: Exactly. That I think is as important as the actual regulations themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HEGSETH: Absolutely.</p><p>PUZDER: I wish we start calling them business -- our facilitators instead of regulatory, maybe they feel like they have to facilitate instead of regulate. I think it would be a big boom for the economy.</p><p>HEGSETH: That's the mindset. If you feel like the regular -- your government is trying to enable you to do business better as supposed to hold you back, that totally change the psyche about large or small business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's the whole point of a 20 percent corporate tax rate by the way. Let me get your take Andy before you go on Chipotle. Obviously, issues there, CEO and founder Steve Ells announcing his plan to step down. Company struggled to come back from that series of negative headlines including the E, coli and neurovirus scandals. The stock was up by five percent following the announcement. What's your take on this? Can chipotle get back on track?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, it can, you know, it's a very good brand. The currency, you know, created it, he was a chef. It focused on healthy food and original - - and source, the way it source things. The problem is that they made a lot of people sick and the way you solve that, the real problem, the reason they made people sick was either their supply chain was defective or the way they prepared the food was defective and you need an operator to come in and solve those problems. And I think the market is perceiving that they'll an operator to solve those problems and could well get back on track. So, it's a very positive move and I think the market reacted appropriately.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>PUZDER: Good to be here. Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy Puzder joining us there. We'll be right back. The chairman of UBS, Axel Weber, up next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining me. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>and it is Thursday, November 30th. Your top stories right now, 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Tackling tax reform, the Senate could vote as early as tonight to cut taxes but reports say that there is a chance the corporate rate won't go as low as we expected which was 20 percent. Investors are optimistic thought about the reform, take a look at these markets once again, the momentum is fierce. Dow Industrials set to hit 24,000 at the open this morning, up another 90 points right now as we speak. Futures indicting a big rally at the start of trading. European markets are also higher this morning by the way, pretty much off of the highs but firmer tone with the exception of the Ft- 100 which is down just a fraction.</p><p>President Trump, tweeted earlier this hour, the stock market hits new record high, confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out. Global market action you saw Europe just a moments ago. Let's check Asia overnight and there you actually saw weakness almost across the board with the exception of Japan which is up one-half of one percent. It could be a turbulent holiday for American Airlines passengers, how a computer glitch has the airlines scrambling to find pilots to cover 15,000 flights that are already booked.</p><p>Plus, wild swings for Bitcoin, as fast as the cryptocurrency soared to $11,000, it did come crashing down for a while yesterday. Look at mixed reaction from Wall Street's biggest banks. Apple going out on its own, the technology giant reportedly planning in-house chip production, those chips will go into the iPhone starting next year according to the Nikkei. Amazon's Alexa moving in to the office now, how the technology giant wants to transform your workday.</p><p>Toping our news though this half an hour, the strong economy in tax reform, the Senate vote on the tax overhaul plan could come as early as tonight. The bill is expected to add $1-1/2 trillion to the deficit but many Republicans believe that the tax cuts will spark business owners to expand and encourage growth. GDP growth in the third quarter now sitting at 3.3 percent. Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is the chairman of UBS, Axel Weber. Good to see you, sir. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS: Good morning, Maria. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How would you characterize things right now? Were you surprised to see 3.3 percent growth yesterday?</p><p>WEBER: No, I think they're in a pretty much goldilocks environment. It's as good as it can get, it's the best environment we've seen 10 years after the crisis. But we're in a late cycle, so the economy is very strong, unemployment is at a very low level and the inflation that has been sort of subdued for a while, is starting to pick up. We're going to see more of that coming out in next one or two years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Isn't it interesting to see that it's not the U.S., there is this synchronized global story going on right now. And now you've got firms like Goldman Sachs and Barclays talking about four percent global growth next year. Is that what you're seeing globally?</p><p>WEBER: No, actually, if you look at the -- why it happened, it's all down to energy. The energy rebound has been driving almost the entire pickup of growth in the developed market economies. It's been driving around 80 percent of the rebound of prices and consumer inflation. And so really, the big story behind it is the oil rebound which has been very important for investment. You know, you can almost say what China is to trade in the global economy, energy is to investment and energy related investments particularly here in the U.S. are really biggest part of what is behind these numbers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I hadn't really looked at that, that's a really interesting point that you make. And look, UBS the largest wealth manager, $2-1/2 trillion in assets right now. How do you invest? What do you tell clients right now who are looking at these markets and saying, OK, things are good but we're talking about $5-1/2 trillion in market value gain just since the election here in the U.S.</p><p>WEBER: Yes. But you also talk to people, it will most likely be very soon, a tax reform and that will basically help corporates a lot. So, we expect if tax rates go down to something like 20 percent, this could easily mean that we get another 10 percent move in the next couple of months on the markets up because, you know, corporates will invest, they can basically claim five years of investment costs, upfront and they're going to pay much lower taxes. Big tax reduction of corporate taxes is going to do really well for stock market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about that, Axel because the truth is some people have problems with the individual side of this tax plan but it's the corporate side of the tax plan that really is being seen as having the impact. You're a business manager, chairman of the largest asset manager out there, wealth manager rather, and you're talking about this actually moving the needle on the economy. How does that happen? Do you think that companies will see a 20 percent corporate rate and then they will say, OK, we've got money saved down from 35 percent, I'll invest more in the business and hire more workers.</p><p>WEBER: They'll invest more in the business. You will also see corporates that have been basically showing profits abroad, that was a big discussion about base erosion and profit shifting with very high taxes in the U.S., more favorable than taxes abroad, that is getting reversed. So, you get higher tax income, you get more investment as a result of that, and the dynamic effects will be positive. It's very hard to say at this point whether actually the 1.5 trillion increasing debt that you also talked about but that would not short-term lead to an increase in debt. Medium to long-term is going to positively influence fiscal behavior as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do we know that the companies are actually going to hire more workers and invest in the business and not just buy back stock. Is that a worry or as President Trump said once, that's OK too.</p><p>WEBER: Well, as I said before, so even if they do it later it will be very positive on the stock market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true. Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And so what I talked about is basically it will provide some further momentum and, you know, asking what do we tell our clients, you know, this is not the point in time where you want to move out of your investments and go liquid. The economy still got one or two more years to go, the Fed in my view will continue to raise rates slowly. So, you know, before we did, you know, one more rate rise this year, we're only expecting two next year and maybe three the year after. But at that point in time short-term rates will be at around 2.5 to 2.7. So, you know, quite a different rate, that's probably around neutral and that's probably as far as the Fed will get in this cycle. We're expecting the economy to show somewhat more weakness two, three years out but over next two years, it's still on a pretty good environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get back to the Fed in a second, so I want to get your take on the winding down of the balance sheet. But in terms of allocating capital, you had a strong quarter just recently even in the emerging markets business. So our clients also looking internationally not just the U.S. in terms of buying stocks.</p><p>WEBER: Well, it's particular, our client based, you know, every second billionaire in Asia is a UBS client. So we're a very strong bank, not just in the U.S. where we have 20,000 people but also in Asia Pacific. And at the moment, you saw a lot of dynamics in particular in emerging markets and that's been very favorable. As rates continue to normalize emerging markets will normalize as well but some of the Asian pacific markets have been pretty dynamic and, you know, the bigger issue there is the emergence of millionaires and billionaires because if you look on the technology side, if you look at how Asia is catching up, you know, most population of the population of the world now it is in Asia-Pacific, so it's a great consumer environment and for us as a financial intermediary, that's good place to be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>WEBER: So it's more of regional composition in the business, it helps us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. By the way, in terms of the Fed, are you worried that they have to wind down a $4-1/2 trillion balance sheet? Is that going to be a disruption?</p><p>WEBER: They can make it less disruptive by basically phasing it in over a very short -- long period of time and that's what they're doing. I think what you will see is there's going to be a lot of treasuries in place in the market over the next three to four years. I think the plan the Fed is currently following, is not going to be very disruptive. Our plan -- you know, looking at the Fed, we actually (INAUDIBLE) that the Fed will start buying treasuries again three years' time because most of the 10-year programs the Fed did actually will mean that in order to limit what rolls off balance sheet the Fed has to control that and being, you know, partly buying -- in particular if they want to have all the mortgage-related stuff roll of the back, they might have to buy some treasuries three years out. So, they're going to control it in a very clear fashion and I think there's no uncertainty now that we've seen the transition of the Fed leadership that we'll see a lot of continuity in this program. So it is not going to be an acceleration of that program, at least we don't expect that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As a former head of the Bundesbank, you're watching global markets, you're watching the Federal Reserve. It sounds like you're quite comfortable with where they're going --</p><p>WEBER: I don't have concern about the course, I mean, the Fed has taken very dragged out steps to normalize interest rates, given that we come out of the largest crisis in financial markets, this is probably an appropriate action. The one thing that for me is a big question mark, how will the Fed react if there is a big physical stimulus program, because in the past they've actually made noises that if there is other forms stimulus kicking in they might have to revisit their own. And so, that's something we're -- it's very early to say because we don't know the program.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really, really good point. Real quick on Bitcoin, any plans for Bitcoin trading at UBS?</p><p>WEBER: No, we don't, and we absolutely phenomenon with very cautious, we want clients that -- this is something that unlike a currency, there's nobody that controls the supply of it, so for me, it's not a currency, for me it is an investment, and it is an investment that has no intrinsic value. It's a transaction device and people have to be cautious if they look at it as a store of value or as an investment that has long-lasting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's pretty extraordinary what's happening in Bitcoin, isn't it?</p><p>WEBER: I think it's a massive journey up but, you know, I wouldn't exclude that (INAUDIBLE) it's more frequent, there could be sporadic moves where actually the market falls a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dr. Axel Weber, great to see you, sir.</p><p>WEBER: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chairman of UBS. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Sears reporting results this morning and it is 24 straight quarters of falling sales. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange now. Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So we talk about Sears and they have Kmart under their umbrella and the stock really has been under pressure. You see an up arrow today, it's been up at 536, that is a 27 percent gain. This is because, a few reasons, but you have to remember this has been a real laggard for the last year. The big picture here is that overall, they narrowed their loss by about 200 million but that was right in line, they have been using a real estate proceed to cut the debt, but the light at the tunnel here is moving into specialty stores for Sears, so that would be appliance and mattresses and car services, so that's what they are touting. But as you noted, three years, every quarter for the past three years they've seen falling sales. Let's take a look American Airlines, oh, my goodness, a glitch, this is unbelievable. About 15,000 air travelers, I mean, these are particular flights during the time of December 17th through December 31st don't have pilots. It was a glitch that's supposed to be done by seniority and now American Airlines going to have to pay up and try to get these booked. Last but not least, Amazon is really pushing Echo and Alexa into the workplace, they're trying to have you book conference rooms, launch your meeting using Echo in every conference room but there's obviously a lot of skepticism. Apparently she's sleeping until you call her name, not sending stuff to the cloud but the question is whether or not, we'll be able to transform that into the office. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Thank you. We'll be watching that. Meanwhile, markets are expected to open higher again this morning, futures on fire after a big move yesterday. Rough air for the tech sector though, the worse since June. Joining us now to weigh in, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney. Stu, we got the broader market looking good but certainly tech turned over yesterday.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: Well, we got to test the theory, aren't we? Because that was a big diff in the big tech companies yesterday. I mean, some were down big time. So here we test the theory. Do you buy on the dip and win? I'd looked at the premarket and some of the big text are coming back just a little but nowhere near back to where they were before yesterday. So, I think we're going to test that theory, buy on the dip and win or buy on the dip and it goes further down and you lose. Either way, this is a great time to be in the financial news business because we are going to hit 24,000 in about --I'm trying to do the math here, that will be 41 minutes' time, you're with me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I'm with you. Absolutely You know, it's incredible, the momentum in this market.</p><p>VARNEY: It's great. You know, why don't we smiling more, for heaven's sake we go from 18,000 on the Election Day to 24,000 now. This is good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It absolutely is good news, Stu. I know you're going to have a lot on it in about 10 minutes, we'll see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA join Stuart. Do you want to jump in here?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I was just going to say we don't smile because then again we have to talk about the nincompoops in Washington fouling everything up. How conservatives are -- you know, how Democrats are posing as conservatives, Marco Rubio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes.</p><p>JONES: Stuart is hitting a really important point and that is I travel around the country, we have gone a year without a three percent pullback in market and yet no one feels confident, no one is yet like -- felt like the heat, the scars of 2008 have healed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>HEGSETH: Maybe another year of great markets will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So get this, America Unplugged, that is what one Australian family is calling their three-year road trip across the country. The family of four plans to travel across all 50 U.S. States. They are documenting their trip along the way for fellow globetrotters. Joining me right now is Caroline Makepeace, the cofounder of yTravelblog.com. Caroline, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CAROLINE MAKEPEACE, COFOUNDER, YTRAVELBLOG.COM: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So your blog is extremely popular, this idea is getting so many comments from everybody. How did you come up with this idea to take your family on this trip across the country?</p><p>MAKEPEACE: We had done it around Australia, we've been writing the book since the 2010. And we road tripped Australia for a month and we just saw the enthusiasm that came from our community and following our trip and sharing their secrets with us. And we loved to get local tips when we travel. So we thought why not go over to America, our country we love. We have a big American community and get their tips and discover those unplugged secrets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is so cool. So where are you here in New York in terms of the states you've already been to? How many states have you been to already?</p><p>MAKEPEACE: We have been through eight states already.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Yes. But being in the country since March, they were being fairly busy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You went to Tennessee, Alabama.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Florida, Hawaii, North Carolina, North Carolina is (INAUDIBLE) so we've been there quite a bit, and New Hampshire, Vermont.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Anything strike you more than others?</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Really love Tennessee. We had about a month road tripping through there, love the musical store and the great smoking (INAUDIBLE) really special.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about difficulties, any difficulties? What have been the big setbacks?</p><p>MAKEPEACE: The big -- I guess, traveling with children is, you know, very time-consuming, traveling slow, other than that, we haven't had any really great challenges, we're having a really, really awesome time so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about it, I mean, what strikes you, how is the trip going?</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Trip is going well, our children having of a wonderful time, it's so good to see their experiences walking through New York yesterday and we saw someone rollerblading through the city streets (INAUDIBLE) and my daughter was like, oh, my goodness, mommy, this city crazy. So just to be with them and see their reactions to what we're discovering is really awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We New Yorkers like to do lots of stuff at once, lots of balls in the air. The top five most costly travel mistakes, share them with us.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: I think not having travel insurance is one, it's one we don't want to pay but it can end up very costly if we need it. And not being prepared in doing enough research. Not really understanding what you want to have the travel experience can cause you to waste a lot of money. And I think traveling in peak season can be very costly and not accessing your money in the correct ways.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peak season meaning it's so busy that everything is more expensive.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've got -- how many more cities you've got -- you've only done eight, so, 42 states to go.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Yes. So, 42 left to go. Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAKEPEACE: We usually like to travel slow, we travel with kids, it's great to travel slow. So we're going slow and it's deep and as wide as we can.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What state are you looking forward to that maybe you don't know enough about?</p><p>MAKEPEACE: I think over the about pacific northwest, it's the reason region I haven't been to yet. I'm very excited to go there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are excited to hear all about it. Caroline, thanks for sharing.</p><p>MAKEPEACE: Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's good to see you. Caroline Makepeace. Stay with us final with our thoughts from our all-star panel today. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great show, everybody. Thanks for being here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: See you tomorrow, everybody. Here's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\". Stuart, over to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017113003cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2Y-R8B1-JB20-G0FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8631\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 30, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Chicago Purchasing Managers Index</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alexa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>America First Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Main Street America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SALT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NBC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sochi Olympics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer Financial Protection Agency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dodd-Frank</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chipotle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bitcoin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alexa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bundesbank</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>UBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>American Airlines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>America Unplugged</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The idea of an initial coin offering is that a company builds, or promises to build, some blockchain-based platform that allows people to buy or sell some product or service. (It seems like it's usually cloud storage.) And then it creates a digital token -- its own \"coin\" -- that you have to use to buy or sell the product. And then it sells the coins, all at once, to the public, often before the product is fully up and running; the buyers can use the coins to buy the product, or try to sell them to someone else for a profit. And then the company goes to conferences to gloat about how it has disrupted the venture-capital funding model and shown the way to the future of capitalism and so forth:</p><p>More and more startups are offering tokens as a way to raise money upfront in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), a nod to traditional initial public offerings of securities. So far this year, 63 sales have raised $521 million, according to blockchain research firm Smith + Crown. That has already far surpassed the $260 million raised in 2016, says Emma Channing, general counsel at Argon Group, a year-old digital finance investment bank in Los Angeles.</p><p>One thing you could think about is what this tells us about how businesses should be funded. Most companies want to sell a product, don't have enough money to build it, and so go to investors to get the money. Then they build the product, sell it to customers, get money from the customers, and give some of the money back to the investors. Raising money from customers rather than investors, as ICOs notionally do, has some obvious appeal: It cuts out the middleman, in a sense, and it also lets the company share some of its profits with early-adopter customers rather than investors. The company and the customers are necessary components to the system; the investor, in the new model of blockchain capitalism, is just an interloper, and can be dispensed with.</p><p>On the other hand, if a company has raised tens of millions of dollars by pre-selling its product to customers before ever building the product, why would it build the product? (\"When ICO's deliver 100% of the company's expected receivables at launch, founders are incentivized to leave their project immediately thereafter,\" writes Chris DeRose.) This is a problem for investors too -- if a company has raised tens of millions of dollars by selling shares to investors before ever building a product, why not run off to Belize rather than build the product? -- but there is a well-developed set of legal protections for investors, for exactly that reason. The legal status of coin-buying customers is a little vaguer.</p><p>Another thing you could think is: Well, is it vaguer? One obvious worry about ICOs is that some of them might \"really\" be securities offerings, that \"coins\" are in many cases just quasi-equity interests in blockchain-based businesses and should be subject to all of the standard securities regulations. Here is a December white paper on the subject, but one overly simplistic and not-at-all-legal-advice way of thinking about it is: If customers are buying coins as a way to fund their eventual purchase of cloud storage or whatever, then the coins are not securities, but if speculators are buying coins as a way to profit from the growth of the business (or the speculative frenzy around ICOs), then they probably are, and are probably subject to securities regulation. Which do you think it is?</p><p>\"It seems as if there's this enormous financial pressure of money that wants to move into this space, but there's really limited places for it to go,\" says Brian Lio, chief executive officer of Smith + Crown. But an offering that sells out in seconds may work against some of the bigger goals of a blockchain enterprise. Tokens are supposed to be used by customers. \"If your token instantaneously sells out to a few institutional investors, you're missing a big point of tokens, which is to get them to users and build a community,\" says Lio.</p><p>One way to tell the story is that bitcoin demonstrated definitively that a privately created digital currency can become worth tens of billions of dollars based solely on ... I don't know, based solely on some sort of psycho-sociological thing that you can give your own name to: \"trust\" would be a good word to fill in the blank, or \"widespread acceptance,\" or \"speculative frenzy\" would work almost as well. Everyone vaguely knew that -- it's how, like, dollars work -- but bitcoin demonstrated it in a particularly pure and salient way.</p><p>But it's hard to repeat that pure feat: \"Bitcoin will replace fiat currency\" is a good pitch for a new cryptocurrency, but \"mattcoin will replace ether which will replace bitcoin which will replace fiat currency\" is less compelling. But you can tap into it obliquely. If you are a company with a digital product, or an idea for a product, you can yoke that product to the bitcoin phenomenon: \"Buy one unit of cloud storage and we'll throw in five free units of speculative frenzy!\" And people who want cloud storage might buy your coins, or not. (There are other cloud storage companies.) But people who want speculative frenzy will definitely buy your coins, because initial coin offerings are the main way to get in-on-the-ground-floor bitcoin-style speculative frenzy these days.</p><p>By the way, I say \"it's usually cloud storage,\" but in fact there are ICOs for all sorts of internet businesses, and some not-quite internet businesses:</p><p>Which may (sort of) explain LGD, the digital token for the Legends Room, which describes itself as \"a world class Las Vegas gentlemen's cabaret ccrcccce-imagined using blockchain technology,\" according to the website. It sold about $1 million in LGD in an ICO that closed in May, says Peter Klamka, a consultant who set up the token strategy for the business.</p><p>Here's the website, which is perhaps not entirely safe for work. I was vaguely hoping that the club would exist entirely on the blockchain -- that would be innovative! -- but no, there seems to be a physical location.</p><p>Uber.</p><p>I like that Uber Technologies Inc. is applying the principles of the \"sharing economy\" to the job of its chief executive officer:</p><p>The decision by Uber Technologies Inc.'s chief executive to take an indefinite leave of absence will put management of the world's most valuable startup in the collective hands of more than a dozen managers\"ca challenging structure for a company that has favored a strong central leader and pitted executives against each other.</p><p>It's the future of work! No one has a full-time job; you just set your own schedule based on supply and demand. Need some extra money? Be CEO of Uber for a couple of hours in the morning, after dropping your kids off at school. You're a night owl? Run Uber between midnight and 4 a.m. \"Surge pricing\" means that you'll get paid more for being the Uber CEO at high-demand times, like during board meetings or in the wake of public-relations disasters. Really they should build an app, and if an Uber employee needs a chief executive officer, she can open up the app and it will tell her like \"your CEO will arrive in four minutes,\" and then nine minutes later one of the \"14 senior executives\" who are holding down CEO Travis Kalanick's spot in his absence will show up at her office and make an executive decision, and she will rate him from one to five stars.</p><p>Whoever deals with this will presumably get surge CEO pay:</p><p>One of the U.S. government's most powerful consumer protection watchdogs appears to be quietly probing Uber and the company's privacy practices.</p><p>The inquiry is under way at the Federal Trade Commission, according to four sources familiar with the matter, where the agency's investigative staff appears to have focused its attention on some of the data-handling mishaps that have plagued the company in recent years \"c perhaps including employees' misuse of \"god view,\" a tool that had previously allowed some at Uber to spy on the whereabouts of politicians, celebrities and others using the ride-hailing app.</p><p>And Naked Capitalism has Part Ten (!) of Hubert Horan's series predicting Uber's doom: \"Uber's narrative that its powerful business model will inevitably achieve global dominance is no longer credible and can no longer divert public attention from Uber's dismal economics.\"</p><p>Bad loans.</p><p>Here's a story about how Prosper Marketplace Inc. and LendingClub Corp. \"don't always check whether borrowers are lying to them, and if they find errors in an application, they may still approve the loan\":</p><p>Alia Dudum, a LendingClub representative, said the company uses \"machine learning and other techniques to build robust models that segment which borrower applications need verification and which do not.\"</p><p>Doesn't that seem ... fine? Like, in theory, I mean. Lending, as a business, is essentially statistical; the point is not to have all your loans pay off, but to have enough of them pay off that your losses are covered by the interest that you charge. Even if you verify income on every loan, some of those loans will default anyway. And while verifying income, or whatever, on every loan might help your statistics, you don't have to believe that a priori. You could just test it out: Your machine learning could look at the statistics and tell you, you know what, if you skip verification on half your loans, your default numbers won't go up materially.</p><p>Of course you could still be wrong:</p><p>Loans made on platforms including Prosper and LendingClub have gone bad faster than security underwriters had expected, according to data from Morgan Stanley, and most of the startups have seen their funding costs rise over the last year.</p><p>But never mind that. One basic tension in modern finance is that the financial industry largely thinks of itself in statistical terms, while regulators and the public tend to think about individual cases. When Wells Fargo fired 5,300 employees for opening fake accounts, the public was aghast, but Wells Fargo executives \"received the figure positively, believing it proved that a vast majority of individuals were behaving appropriately.\" Banks and securitizers and online loan marketplaces know that there will be defaults, and want to optimize the level of defaults for maximum profit. The public wants lenders to take appropriate care with each loan.</p><p>Bad LinkedIn.</p><p>\"It's Probably Not Okay to Send Naked Pictures on LinkedIn,\" is the headline here, but that is actually a novel and interesting legal question. I mean, it is a straightforward and obvious question of aesthetics and internet etiquette -- it is not okay to send naked pictures on LinkedIn! -- but the legal question is, if you send naked pictures on LinkedIn, is your company responsible?</p><p>In a lawsuit filed Tuesday night in Los Angeles, a mid-level financial industry professional identified only as Jane Doe alleged that a recruitment conversation on LinkedIn took a turn for the inappropriate when she received sexual messages from a banker\"cusing his corporate account\"cwho had been trying to recruit her. One of the messages included a photograph of his genitals.</p><p>Women have long complained of unsavory conduct on LinkedIn, but in the California state court complaint (filed by the law firm of celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos), Doe argues that an employer is responsible for employee behavior on the platform. LinkedIn is an extension of the workplace, similar to going into the office or attending a corporate networking event, the theory of the case goes.</p><p>I don't know about that theory, but the good news is that if it works then employers will have to be much more careful about letting their employees use LinkedIn unsupervised. If this lawsuit leads to widespread workplace bans on LinkedIn, we might all be better off for it.</p><p>Also here is how this allegedly went down:</p><p>The two met when Doe, at a previous employer, worked on a deal that involved Eichler's company, Doe said in an interview. Eichler initially messaged Doe about potential job opportunities. When Doe expressed interest in hearing more, the messages shifted from professional, she alleged. \"So what are you doing up so late?! Here's my number if you wanna play,\" wrote Eichler, according to court filings. He later added that it could be a \"late night secret\" before sending a graphic photograph, she alleged. After Doe didn't reply, he wrote \"Ugh, I guess I screwed up :( bummer dude.\"</p><p>While I cannot recommend sending nudes on LinkedIn, I will admit that \":( bummer dude\" really is the perfect way to respond to rejection, whether romantic or professional, on LinkedIn.</p><p>Bad email.</p><p>There is this prankster who keeps emailing bank chief executive officers pretending to be their colleagues and trying to trick them into saying impolitic things, and they reply with bland politeness, and he gloats \"got 'em again,\" and articles are written about how he tricked the CEOs and exposed flaws in the banks' email security, and I don't know, man. The latest is an exchange with James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, in which the prankster impersonates former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer (and Morgan Stanley board member) Alistair Darling, and Gorman is polite and vague. \"Security experts warned that the episodes have exposed weak spots in the big banks' defences, at a time when they are under near-constant bombardment from criminals, 'hacktivists' and disaffected insiders,\" writes the Financial Times. I tend to take the other side of it: After five attempts, no bank CEO has actually been tricked into saying something inappropriate or giving away any information. Eventually a bank CEO will reply \"hello, I see you are emailing me from a fake email address, so I will not engage any further,\" and the hoaxer will post that exchange online and be like \"yes, another flawless victory!\"</p><p>Rules-based trading.</p><p>Here is Robin Wigglesworth on last Friday's sell-off in tech stocks, which he attributes to selling by factor-driven systematic funds that sold off when big tech companies weakened on their momentum and low-volatility factors:</p><p>Marko Kolanovic, a senior JPMorgan strategist, estimates that passive and quantitative investors now account for about 60 per cent of the US equity asset management industry, up from under 30 per cent a decade ago, and reckons that only roughly 10 per cent of trading is done by traditional, \"discretionary\" traders, as opposed to systematic rules-based ones.</p><p>We have talked occasionally about the possibility that the modern low-volatility environment might be not so much a sign of complacency as a real evolution in the markets: Stock prices famously overreact to news, but as markets are increasingly run by coldly logical machines, those overreactions will diminish, and stock prices will become less volatile. I guess that is one way to interpret the fact that only 10 percent of trading is done by humans making their own decisions? The other is that volatility is being smoothed day to day but concentrated into the tails: The systematic funds will all flock together, mostly keeping prices smooth and stable, but when they do panic, they will all panic at the same time.</p><p>Share-count investing.</p><p>Yesterday I asked:</p><p>To what extent is there a viable investing strategy of (1) actually reading corporate filings, (2) buying companies that have fewer shares than the market thinks they have, and (3) shorting companies that have more shares than the market thinks they have?</p><p>I was half-kidding, but a reader pointed out that in 2015 Muddy Waters Research put out a note arguing that Bollorcc SA was undervalued because it had fewer shares than the market thought it had:</p><p>BOL effectively owns a significant portion of itself. Most of the market seems to take at face value BOL's reported shares outstanding of 2.5 billion. We estimate that the effective shares outstanding are only 1.1 billion (57.2% lower than reported).</p><p>Muddy Waters forecasted a 95 percent upside, and the stock is actually down almost 10 percent since then, but still, share-count investing: could be a thing.</p><p>People are worried about vampires.</p><p>\"No, Peter Thiel is not harvesting the blood of the young,\" is the headline here, and next they will be telling me that he doesn't sleep hanging upside-down from his ankles in a crypt. I ask you: Would you rather live in a world in which Peter Thiel is harvesting the blood of the young, or one in which he isn't? Do you want to be disabused of your belief that Peter Thiel might, just might, get himself injected with the blood of young people to become immortal?

It is that they were allowed to make so much money, for so long, without being subject to almost any scrutiny at all.</p><p>  I was raised on the products created by these companies. I read their financial statements, sought out the wisdom of their founders, and watched as their stock prices invariably trended in one direction: upward. For a long time, this seemed proper. Capitalism has winners. They competed, and won.</p><p>  Until recently this narrative was rarely challenged. It was nurtured by the Obama administration. In a famous photograph from 2011 (see right), the then-president toasted a dozen tech leaders as he sat between Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg. When EU regulators investigated Google in 2015, Obama warned them off punishing American companies for their success. And a year later, in Obama\\x92s final summer as president, his family hosted a gathering of the tech elite at the White House in imitation of South by Southwest, the fashionable digital conference. Meanwhile, the stock market value of the four Big Tech companies soared, from $204bn when Obama took office in 2009 to $1.95trn when he left (Facebook was floated in 2012).</p><p>  In the past three years, the value of these companies has continued to climb; it is now $3.5trn, considerably more than the UK\\x92s GDP ($2.7trn). But their reputation has collapsed. Big Tech is now a pejorative term, akin to Big Oil and Big Pharma. And the men who run these companies are viewed as the robber barons of a new capitalist age.</p><p>  Just as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Vanderbilt once controlled America\\x92s oil, steel and railroads respectively, so do another handful of men now control how we search, shop and share; watch, message and travel. Today\\x92s titans are arguably more powerful. They control not only the raw materials of industry, but much of our time and even perhaps part of our minds. There was nothing inevitable about this concentration of power \\x96 and it would have stunned many 20th-century politicians, who devoted their energy to ensuring no one would ever reacquire the might of America\\x92s first\u00a0industrial kings.</p><p>  This is the story Matt Stoller tells in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</emphasis>. Stoller, a Fellow at the Washington, DC-based Open Markets Institute, has a searing message: in the 1970s, a new generation of Democrats shed one of the party\\x92s central beliefs \\x96 that private monopolies are always and everywhere a threat to democracy. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> is overlong in places, at times repetitive, and key figures are not always vividly portrayed. But Stoller\\x92s point remains vital. And his book complements the work of Lina Khan, a former colleague of his at the Open Markets Institute, who, in a viral <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Yale Law Journal</emphasis> article in 2017, forensically exposed Amazon\\x92s many monopolistic practices.</p><p>  Khan explained that Amazon\\x92s stranglehold over commerce was made possible by a silent legal revolution that began 40 years ago, at around the same time the Democrats\u00a0 lost what Stoller calls their \\x93populist soul\\x94. In the 1970s, in both politics and the law, monopoly power was redefined out of\u00a0existence, and entirely dismissed as a\u00a0national threat.</p><p>  This was a remarkable shift. It undid six decades of anti-monopoly law, or \\x93antitrust\\x94, dating back to 1911, when JD Rockefeller\\x92s Standard Oil, which controlled 90 per cent of America\\x92s oil supply, was broken up into 34 pieces by the Supreme Court. Soon afterwards the banker JP Morgan was hauled before a major congressional committee, to explain the \\x93vast and growing concentration\\x85 of money and credit in the hands of comparatively few men\\x94. Over the next two generations, many American lawmakers spent their careers opposing such dominance.</p><p>  Stoller\\x92s story centres around one such man, Wright Patman, a Texan Democrat who paid for law school with \\x93bales of hay\\x94 and served in the House of Representatives from 1929 to 1976. Men like Patman were the practitioners of antitrust, but its architect was Louis Brandeis, a crusading lawyer and perennial antagonist of Morgan\\x92s, who Woodrow Wilson put on to the Supreme Court in 1916.</p><p>Brandeis was animated by a simple belief. America was either a democracy, or it was a nation where wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, but it could not be both. A democracy required not only political and religious liberty, but \\x93industrial liberty\\x94 \\x96 the freedom for people to \\x93do for themselves\\x94. Every American, argued Brandeis, should be able to set up a business and thrive in a competitive market. Anyone living under a monopoly, subject to the whim and caprice of a few self-appointed industrialists, was not a free citizen.</p><p>  This belief inspired not only Wright\u00a0Patman but Franklin D Roosevelt, in both the creation of his New Deal and his opposition to Hitler. The language of industrial liberty became part of a mid-century American consensus. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Goliath</emphasis> explores this era in depth, and shows how antitrust went hand in hand with strong labour unions, higher tax rates, and constraints on banking power. Populism, Stoller stresses, was not invented by Trump. It was once the foundation of the Democratic Party.</p><p>  The sea-change undergone by the party in the 1970s can, in part, be traced to one man: Robert Bork. In 1978, Bork published a book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Antitrust Paradox</emphasis>, which not only rejected Brandeis\\x92 central idea \\x96 that monopolies are anti-democratic \\x96 but dismissed it as irrelevant. Forget the dangers of concentrated power, said Bork, a leading Republican jurist, and forget a competitive democracy. Such concepts were nothing but \\x93unarticulated social values\\x94. In markets, only one thing mattered: consumer welfare.</p><p>  For Bork, liberty was nebulous, but welfare was tangible. You could plot it on a graph. If goods were created and allocated with maximal efficiency, the market worked, by definition. How did one know if markets were efficient? Not through competition, the traditional guarantor of cheap goods, but simply through low prices. If prices were low, ran Bork\\x92s logic, the market must be competitive. And if a big firm drove a minnow out by aggressively slashing its prices, it must be the more efficient.</p><p>  Almost overnight, antitrust was reinterpreted. The Supreme Court began citing Bork\\x92s work; they soon accepted it entirely. Meanwhile, a new generation of Democrats swept to power in Congress, dethroning populists like Patman. Politics shifted all at once. An era of severe inflation made radical change possible. The radical simplicity of Bork\\x92s theory became increasingly appealing. Markets needed fixing. Low prices were part of the answer. Americans also stopped crediting antitrust for the world they lived in. Having been contained, monopolies became less fearful.</p><p>  Into this void stepped Amazon, whose story Stoller does not tell, but whose power epitomises the threat now posed by Big Tech. For two decades, Amazon has acted as a monopolist. But by focusing relentlessly on the customer, by praying at the Borkian altar of low prices, it has avoided all scrutiny. It is now far more than the \\x93everything store\\x94. It is inescapable.</p><p>  Even if you renounce its products, you almost certainly help to fund the company. The internet runs on its infrastructure. Anything that exists online needs computing power, servers and databases. Amazon\\x92s web services division has become the global leader in providing these ingredients; you could call them the oil, steel and railroads of the internet age. And  everyone, from Netflix to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Guardian</emphasis>, buys from Amazon.</p><p>  America was founded in opposition to a tea monopoly. Its creed is liberty, not low prices. Under a President Warren or Sanders, the language of industrial liberty could be rediscovered, with as much speed as it was lost. But tackling these Goliath-like companies may demand more than that. Presidential terms end. The tech titans believe their story has only just begun.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between\u00a0Monopoly Power and Democracy</emphasis>  Matt Stoller  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Simon &amp; Schuster, 608pp, $29.99</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNR-PX61-DYX2-C1WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1373\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Statesman Ltd.

Congressional aides told POLITICO that the company seems unprepared for the attacks it is about to receive and that it's failing to address key questions in briefings ahead of hearings scheduled for July 16-17 in the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees.</p><p>Facebook has yet to respond to questions that the Banking Committee sent to Zuckerberg in May regarding its then-unannounced digital currency plans and how it handles consumers' financial information.</p><p>In a political climate that has turned hostile to Big Tech, it's all fueling concerns that Facebook can't be trusted to become a major force in the financial system, after drawing widespread condemnation for failing to protect the privacy of its 2.4 billion users and facilitating Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>\"There would have been serious questions about Libra no matter who was attempting to bring it to market,\" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research &amp; Trading. \"But Washington's interest was dialed up to 10 due to Facebook's role.\"</p><p>Facebook is planning to launch Libra on its services next year and is showing no signs of backing down.</p><p>\"The lead up to the launch of Libra in 2020 builds in the time for conversations with regulators and policymakers around the world to take their questions into account,\" said Dante Disparte, the head of policy and communications for a new Geneva, Switzerland-based independent association that will oversee the digital currency. Mastercard, Paypal and Visa are among the Libra Association's founding members, in addition to Facebook.</p><p>The group has published a \"white paper\" outlining its goals for Libra and its \"mission to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.\"</p><p>But there are signs that Facebook is ramping up damage-control efforts. </p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive who will testify in the hearings, published a 1,500-word post Wednesday that attempted to address some of the questions being raised about Libra. </p><p>In an attempt to put some distance between the company and the currency, Marcus said Facebook won't control Libra and will be one of more than a hundred members of the Libra Association by its launch. Facebook will operate a digital wallet service on top of Libra, he said, but won't see financial data, and Libra users will be able to use payments services offered by other companies.</p><p>\"Bottom line: You won't have to trust Facebook to get the benefit of Libra,\" he said.</p><p>Among the expanding list of questions posed by lawmakers and watchdog groups: What privacy and consumer protections will be in place? What anti-money laundering safeguards will apply? What risks are being posed to the broader financial system?</p><p>\"There is a growing sense that the Libra project may not be ready for prime time,\" said Dan Murphy, a senior associate at the Milken Institute's Center for Financial Markets. \"While I expect them to be as prepared as possible for the hearings, there is an open question as to whether or not they fully considered the regulatory and economic implications of Libra before releasing the white paper.\"</p><p>\"We look forward to working with lawmakers as this process moves forward, including answering their questions at the upcoming House Financial Services and Senate Banking Committee hearings,\" Facebook spokesperson Joshua Gunter said in an emailed statement.</p><p>So far, Facebook appears to be stumbling in addressing the concerns. Waters in her new letter to Facebook said it had offered \"scant\" information regarding its intent for the currency, its potential use and security. One House Democratic aide briefed on Facebook's plans said there were \"lots of practical questions that Facebook didn't have answers to\" and it was \"pretty clear they want to more or less self-regulate.\"</p><p>Some of the concerns are bipartisan. Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), in a joint letter with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), was the first on Capitol Hill to demand answers from Facebook in May before it announced Libra.

Lawmakers want them to answer publicly about Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. </p><p>      But one congressman isn't waiting until them to challenge Silicon Valley.  Representative Ro Khanna of California has spend a stirring Op-Ed in the Washington Post titled \"Trump beat Silicon Valley at its own game.  Now, it must prove itself.\"  </p><p>      In it, he takes big tech to task over a variety of issues from election meddling to diversity and more, he joins me now from Washington.  Representative Khanna, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>      So you say Trump used the tools of technology to win despite Silicon Valley's overwhelming support for Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>      It's almost as if Trump bested tech leaders at the game they invented, how so?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, Trump was very effective in using Twitter and Facebook to get passionate support to get his message out.  </p><p>      But a lot of these platforms, of course, we're abused.  They amplified fake voices, extreme voices that pretended to be 10,000 people even though there was only one person they've crafted in false news.  </p><p>      And so tech needs to help figure out how to solve some of these issues.  We know it can empower individuals in extraordinary ways but we need to fix the excess that we saw in the 2016 election cycle.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Right, you say tech tools should strengthen not weaken democracy and Russia interference aside.  Someone argue that, you know, social media has dramatically increase the number of voices that are being heard.  You know, can tech companies really be responsible for all of this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I actually think tech has played a very positive role overall.  I mean, it gave a rise -- give rise to Barack Obama and to Bernie Sanders.  </p><p>      I often joke at town halls that the average person could have more of a voice by having a clever tweet or Facebook posts than I can by speaking to an empty chamber in congress.  </p><p>      So tech has empowered individuals in extraordinary ways, but that said there are things that now that they have become a platform where almost 50 percent of Americans get their news there that they need to do.  </p><p>      One if having some basic differentiation between fact and opinion on newspapers, TV stations like yours have third-party verification and they independently checked facts.  </p><p>      There can be third-party verification on some of the posts.  They should look at providing perhaps an alternative perspective if viewers want that alternative perspective.  </p><p>      They just need to look at what their journalistic responsibilities can be without suppressing the freedom of expression. </p><p>      And I'm encouraged that the number of tech companies are doing that and that dialogue has begun.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  You wonder though how far these companies can go?  How well companies can distinguish between fact and opinion when our own president may have a different opinion of the facts than the facts?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  I agree, it's a very difficult issue.  But there are independent third-party sites which can at least rate content so if some part one that's out there saying the sky is green or that, you know, Barack Obama isn't an American citizen.  </p><p>      They could at least have a rating and verification.  Just like newspapers do, just like television stations do where they could provide a link to say, \"Here are some alternative perspectives if you saw the truth.\"  </p><p>      I think these tech companies -- tech company and social media is very different than television.  </p><p>      Television is an as interactive, people aren't responding to me. It's  a broadcast, two individuals and tech is a person-to-person communication.  </p><p>      So tech can't be responsible for every single post in the content of every single post.  </p><p>      That said they do need to move towards adopting some journalistic standards of third-party verification, fact verification so they could give users an informed perspective.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  That said, I wonder how much can we rely on companies to do the right thing or whatever is in the best interest of society rather than what's in the best interest of their business.  </p><p>      And how much should the government actually be in charge of figuring out whether there's Russia interference on these platforms? Should there be government regulation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I think there are two different questions.  In terms of the best interest of society, I think that was Silicon Valley's tradition with David Packard and Hewlett-Packard and some of the early founders, Andy Grove.  </p><p>      They talked about building technology in a way that would help society, help empower people.  </p><p>      And if you talk to tech leaders that's what they really hope that their platforms would help improve communication, lead to a more connected world, create more jobs.  </p><p>      Tim Cook recently said that business leaders have a moral responsibility to care about education and jobs.  </p><p>      Sundar Pichai recently announced a one billion dollar initiative to prepare folks for the tech jobs of the future. </p><p>      And so I think there is an ongoing awareness with tech leaders that they have to care about their contribution to jobs in places that don't have them and to the democratic conversation.  </p><p>      Given that they are some of the largest companies in the nation and some of them have such great responsibility in so many viewers.  </p><p>      On the Russia issue, I think their -- we definitely need better intelligent sharing between tech companies and the government so that they can get advance notice if there is suspicious activity and act on it.  </p><p>      And tech companies need to help adapt exceptional processing to look at false accounts or bad accounts, bad actors, the way some bank (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>      Some of it is hiring more people, but even if they hire a thousand of more people given the volume, they probably need investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence to be able to do some of that work.  </p><p>      So I'm hopeful a lot of it will be tech coming to its own conclusion but some -- there will probably be a role for congress and lawmakers as well to have constructive rules that tech can follow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Similarly, you talk about the importance of increasing diversity at these companies upward mobility, is this something that you think companies can do on their own?  </p><p>      We know that the representation of women in minorities at tech companies is very low or is this something that the government should regulate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's in the tech companies own advantage to expand their imagination in recruiting.  Let me give you a concrete example, 45 percent of African-Americans who have STEM degrees go to a historically black college or university, 45 percent.  </p><p>      Now, if tech companies want to expand where there's talent, they should form partnerships with some of the best historically black colleges and universities in the country and recruit from there.  </p><p>      The NFL in the 1960s, the Oakland Raiders did that.  They started recruiting at the HPCUs and it gave them a whole competitive advantage over the rest of the teams in the NFL.  </p><p>      At the time where it have such scarcity for engineers and tech talent and everyone is concern that Google and Facebook and Apple is getting all the talent, expanding the pool and going to places to like HPCUs would make a difference.  Same with in -- you know, go ahead.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  But the question -- the question is whether or not they should, it's whether the government should force them to do so or legislate, you know, various requirements for representation of women in minorities in your ranks? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KHANNA</emphasis>:  Well, I'm not for quote our government regulating that but I do think government can make investment and women's schools that focus on STEM and HPCUs in providing greater opportunities and pathways in getting incentives for corporate mentorship for women leaders.  </p><p>      I think government can incentivize the creation of the pipeline and in getting people in to those leadership ranks.  </p><p>      But I don't think they should regulate a number of that tech companies have to fill as a quote I think that will be going too far.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right.  Representative Ro Khanna, thank you so much for joining us.  Great to have you here on the show.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

RO KHANNA, D-CALIF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      CHANG:  Well, on November 1st, three of the top tech firms will testify before congress.  Lawmakers want them to answer publicly about Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.      But one congressman isn't waiting until them to challenge Silicon Valley.  Representative Ro Khanna of California has spend a stirring Op-Ed in the Washington Post titled \"Trump beat Silicon Valley at its own game.  Now, it must prove itself.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In it, he takes big tech to task over a variety of issues from election meddling to diversity and more, he joins me now from Washington.  Representative Khanna, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you say Trump used the tools of technology to win despite Silicon Valley's overwhelming support for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>It's almost as if Trump bested tech leaders at the game they invented, how so?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, Trump was very effective in using Twitter and Facebook to get passionate support to get his message out.</p><p>But a lot of these platforms, of course, we're abused.  They amplified fake voices, extreme voices that pretended to be 10,000 people even though there was only one person they've crafted in false news.</p><p>And so tech needs to help figure out how to solve some of these issues.  We know it can empower individuals in extraordinary ways but we need to fix the excess that we saw in the 2016 election cycle.</p><p>CHANG:  Right, you say tech tools should strengthen not weaken democracy and Russia interference aside.  Someone argue that, you know, social media has dramatically increase the number of voices that are being heard.  You know, can tech companies really be responsible for all of this?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I actually think tech has played a very positive role overall.  I mean, it gave a rise -- give rise to Barack Obama and to Bernie Sanders.</p><p>I often joke at town halls that the average person could have more of a voice by having a clever tweet or Facebook posts than I can by speaking to an empty chamber in congress.</p><p>So tech has empowered individuals in extraordinary ways, but that said there are things that now that they have become a platform where almost 50 percent of Americans get their news there that they need to do.</p><p>One if having some basic differentiation between fact and opinion on newspapers, TV stations like yours have third-party verification and they independently checked facts.</p><p>There can be third-party verification on some of the posts.  They should look at providing perhaps an alternative perspective if viewers want that alternative perspective.</p><p>They just need to look at what their journalistic responsibilities can be without suppressing the freedom of expression.      And I'm encouraged that the number of tech companies are doing that and that dialogue has begun.</p><p>CHANG:  You wonder though how far these companies can go?  How well companies can distinguish between fact and opinion when our own president may have a different opinion of the facts than the facts?</p><p>KHANNA:  I agree, it's a very difficult issue.  But there are independent third-party sites which can at least rate content so if some part one that's out there saying the sky is green or that, you know, Barack Obama isn't an American citizen.</p><p>They could at least have a rating and verification.  Just like newspapers do, just like television stations do where they could provide a link to say, \"Here are some alternative perspectives if you saw the truth.\"</p><p>I think these tech companies -- tech company and social media is very different than television.</p><p>Television is an as interactive, people aren't responding to me. It's  a broadcast, two individuals and tech is a person-to-person communication.</p><p>So tech can't be responsible for every single post in the content of every single post.</p><p>That said they do need to move towards adopting some journalistic standards of third-party verification, fact verification so they could give users an informed perspective.</p><p>CHANG:  That said, I wonder how much can we rely on companies to do the right thing or whatever is in the best interest of society rather than what's in the best interest of their business.</p><p>And how much should the government actually be in charge of figuring out whether there's Russia interference on these platforms? Should there be government regulation?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think there are two different questions.  In terms of the best interest of society, I think that was Silicon Valley's tradition with David Packard and Hewlett-Packard and some of the early founders, Andy Grove.</p><p>They talked about building technology in a way that would help society, help empower people.</p><p>And if you talk to tech leaders that's what they really hope that their platforms would help improve communication, lead to a more connected world, create more jobs.</p><p>Tim Cook recently said that business leaders have a moral responsibility to care about education and jobs.</p><p>Sundar Pichai recently announced a one billion dollar initiative to prepare folks for the tech jobs of the future.      And so I think there is an ongoing awareness with tech leaders that they have to care about their contribution to jobs in places that don't have them and to the democratic conversation.</p><p>Given that they are some of the largest companies in the nation and some of them have such great responsibility in so many viewers.</p><p>On the Russia issue, I think their -- we definitely need better intelligent sharing between tech companies and the government so that they can get advance notice if there is suspicious activity and act on it.</p><p>And tech companies need to help adapt exceptional processing to look at false accounts or bad accounts, bad actors, the way some bank (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>Some of it is hiring more people, but even if they hire a thousand of more people given the volume, they probably need investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence to be able to do some of that work.</p><p>So I'm hopeful a lot of it will be tech coming to its own conclusion but some -- there will probably be a role for congress and lawmakers as well to have constructive rules that tech can follow.</p><p>CHANG:  Similarly, you talk about the importance of increasing diversity at these companies upward mobility, is this something that you think companies can do on their own?</p><p>We know that the representation of women in minorities at tech companies is very low or is this something that the government should regulate?</p><p>KHANNA:  Well, I think it's in the tech companies own advantage to expand their imagination in recruiting.  Let me give you a concrete example, 45 percent of African-Americans who have STEM degrees go to a historically black college or university, 45 percent.</p><p>Now, if tech companies want to expand where there's talent, they should form partnerships with some of the best historically black colleges and universities in the country and recruit from there.</p><p>The NFL in the 1960s, the Oakland Raiders did that.  They started recruiting at the HPCUs and it gave them a whole competitive advantage over the rest of the teams in the NFL.</p><p>At the time where it have such scarcity for engineers and tech talent and everyone is concern that Google and Facebook and Apple is getting all the talent, expanding the pool and going to places to like HPCUs would make a difference.  Same with in -- you know, go ahead.</p><p>CHANG:  But the question -- the question is whether or not they should, it's whether the government should force them to do so or legislate, you know, various requirements for representation of women in minorities in your ranks?      KHANNA:  Well, I'm not for quote our government regulating that but I do think government can make investment and women's schools that focus on STEM and HPCUs in providing greater opportunities and pathways in getting incentives for corporate mentorship for women leaders.</p><p>I think government can incentivize the creation of the pipeline and in getting people in to those leadership ranks.</p><p>But I don't think they should regulate a number of that tech companies have to fill as a quote I think that will be going too far.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Representative Ro Khanna, thank you so much for joining us.  Great to have you here on the show.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Thousands of businesses make use of SCCs to carry out EU to US transfers of personal data, sometimes in addition to the now defunct Privacy Shield framework. An earlier ruling by the CJEU - following another Schrems complaint which also drew on the 2013 Snowden disclosures of US government mass surveillance programs - struck down the prior transatlantic 'Safe Harbor' arrangement.<br/>SCCs were an existing alternative for businesses to plug the gap then until Privacy Shield came into effect. But the CJEU ruling of no US adequacy with EU privacy standards casts doubt on their continued use for these transfers. Facebook was using SCCs in the Safe Harbor era. Now, in the wake of the CJEU decision, it's said it's moving its Privacy Shield transfers to SCCs. So the tech giant has no visible 'plan B' if it's ordered to suspend these data flows too.<br/>In Schrems' views the only way Facebook will be able to comply with the CJEU ruling is if it splits its infrastructure into two. And while other types of companies - such as cloud storage providers - may already separate data by regions owing to factors like latency or even cost, Facebook's business simply doesn't operate like that. It's designed to draws data to its center.<br/>\"Facebook is probably the most [susceptible] to all of this,\" says Schrems, discussing the ramifications of the CJEU ruling in an interview with TechCrunch. \"For Facebook it's really, really complicated as a company to comply with any of this.\"<br/>\"There are parts that are necessary data transfers, and [Facebook] can continue to do that. So basically the message that I sent to an American friend, stuff like that. But that's only a small percentage,\" he continues. \"So I think technically the approach they'd have to do is basically split Facebook in two. And then kind of reconnect the necessary data transfers. So you've basically federated. A bit like Diaspora was always designed to be; a federated social network where you basically have different parts and what's necessary is communicated and what's not necessary is not communicated.\"<br/>\"They're not going to do that without heaven and hell moving onto them,\" he adds. \"I guess - especially for Facebook - that the problem is we kind of have a case where the consequences are so extreme the pushback is obviously as extreme as possible... They know that without fundamentally restructuring the whole system they will never be able to comply with any of this - so they don't.\"<br/>Schrems points to what happened historically with SWIFT financial data exchanges as a comparable scenario - where the fix was to move backups from the US to Switzerland \"so only the data that is international and US is actually stored in the US and all the other transfer data is kept in Belgium and Switzerland\". \"So you separate your backups and your situations and so on,\" he says, adding: \"It's a lot of engineering.\"<br/>At this point most of the big tech companies have data centers in Europe. While newer social video sharing app TikTok recently announced plans to establish one Ireland for EU users' data. But Schrems reckons there's no easy way for Facebook to unpick all its EU data flows.<br/>We asked Facebook for details on its legal basis for continuing to use SCCs but the company did not engage with questions on the topic. Nor did it respond when we asked for clarity on any 'plan B' if it's ordered to stop using SCCs.\u00a0Update:\u00a0The company has since provided some background information in which it claims it has safeguards in place for SCCs that include legal, organisational, technical and security measures - without providing any specific detail on what those might be. It also noted the policy landscape around SCCs is evolving and said it is watching developments closely - including looking for further guidance from regulators.<br/>Beyond a massive engineering headache for the company, Schrems doesn't see huge legal significance in a federated version of Facebook's service that holds EU users' data in Europe. But he argues such a split would send an important message about the rule of law.<br/>\"The law doesn't differentiate if the data is processed in Europe or in the US on having to be compliant with it... So I don't really think we can probably gain much from it. To me it's more of a general question of companies having to respect the law or just getting away with it, over and over again, without really complying. I don't think [it would be a gain] for direct compliance - it's probably more of a big message that you don't get away with it that would be important to send,\" he says.<br/>Can SCCs still be used for US transfers?In the clash between EU privacy rights and US surveillance law, Europe's highest court has made it clear it isn't budging. At the same time, lawyers all over the region are busy grappling with the apparent contradiction of the CJEU finding US surveillance practices fatal to Privacy Shield yet not putting an indelible blocker on SCCs for data transfers over the pond. This other long-standing transfer mechanism - sometimes also referred to as 'model clauses' - could have been struck down too but wasn't. So the court left the door ajar.<br/>Law firms have seized on that to shape strategies for businesses to proceed using SCCs for US data transfers in a way that minimizes their risk - via performing detailed risk assessments and/or applying 'special measures', where possible. Given the rich seam of paid advice opportunities opening up it's not hard to find European lawyers who believe SCCs can be made to work for some data controllers who want to continue (or start) bulk processing EU users' data in the US.<br/>This advice boils down to handling all of the associated bureaucracy around performing risk assessments over a particular data transfer and whether/how it falls under US surveillance law; for some it may also mean investigating technical and operational solutions, such as whether data could be encrypted in transit and the keys held by a EU entity that's not subject to US law; and perhaps seeing whether policies can be applied and contractual language beefed up so that a US receiving entity which gets a law enforcement request for data is obliged to take steps to make sure there's a real legal compulsion underpinning it.<br/>In a public discussion on the topic hosted by the International Association of Privacy Professionals last month, Hogan Lovells partner, Eduardo Ustaran - one of the more bullish voices touting the ongoing value of SCCs for US transfers - made the case for building policy protections into contracts to require a level of push back and interrogation of US government agency requests for data.<br/>\"When the court talked about additional safeguards and making up for the lack of protection in the regime of the recipients... they're talking about precisely that: Having that legal process in place - a contractual obligation - to question that request. And you will probably find that if that is in place only a very, very, very small minority of cases will lead to something that is a true conflict where the prohibition of data really needs to be given,\" he argued.<br/>\"Even in that case, one needs to question whether that is actually within the parameters of what European law provides. Or outside those parameters. Because, again, what the court didn't say was that all access to data is unlawful; it's the one that's not necessary, it's disproportionate. So that's what you need to get at. And that's what we're saying. I think there is definitely room for manoeuvre in that contractual document for the parties to that document to agree to what level of scrutiny they're going to undertake when one of them receives a request.\"<br/>In the same discussion, Fieldfisher privacy, security and information partner, Renzo Marchini, suggested some data controllers may be able to determine they do not have any risk of European standards not being met for their particular data transfer.<br/>\"For some vanilla transfers there might simply be no risks,\" he posited. \"They might be outside of FISA [the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] and so on. And you only get to additional safeguards, additional measures if you conclude that you need to do something more - and the court has allowed you to do something more.\"<br/>\"They haven't said what that's got to be,\" he added. \"I hope the EDPB [European Data Protection Board] will give some certainty here and tell us what those things are.\"<br/>The lack of judicial redress linked to US surveillance law is a stickier problem, though. One Marchini accepted can't be fixed with any amount of contractual spit and polish - and which, for businesses subject to FISA, will carry through as what he couched as \"residual risk\".<br/>\"That simply goes to the risk assessment that's carried out beforehand,\" he said when pressed on that point. \"So if you're at risk and you can't fix it technically, operationally, then you're left with the residual risk that you haven't fulfilled essential equivalence. There's no way of avoiding that, I think. You're not going to fix that gap in US law which the court found either... There's a lack of judicial redress under FISA 702; you can't fix it, but you might be able to conclude you're not at risk under FISA 702.\"<br/>In Facebook's case, there's no plausible dispute the company falls under US surveillance laws - which means its wiggle room in the face of Schrems II is minimal. And so suddenly the company throwing all its eggs into the SCCs' basket in the hopes that Europe's regulators will ignore the CJEU's instruction to step in looks high risk.<br/>\"One of the holdings of the Court of Justice was there is simply no legal redress whatsoever as a foreigner,\" notes Schrems, adding: \"I've had calls with people from industry and they said we know that we actually don't have a legal basis but we just hope they're going to be reasonable and not enforce it. Which is basically saying you're working illegally and you hope the law doesn't apply to you.\"<br/>\"We're now asking different companies and most of them say we don't really know the legal basis - we're waiting for guidance,\" he adds. \"The reality is the vast majority of them is simply now working illegally. Google and Microsoft and even Facebook put out 'oh we're still using SCCs because we read the judgement differently'.\"<br/>In another example, the IAB Europe suggests in an Q&amp;A on the CJEU ruling that worried advertisers \"seek guidance from your lead supervisory authority\" - and then immediately suggests DPAs \"may give leniency towards data transfers that took place under the Privacy Shield due to the sudden nature of this change in the law\". Although, on SCCs, the ad industry body is more circumspect, writing that compliance is now determined on a case-by-case basis and \"will depend on the companies sending and receiving the personal data, the regulator in the target country, and the types of personal data\".<br/>\"To be honest I'm not super enthusiastic about data transfers because we have so many other privacy problems there probably are bigger issues. But the reason why I'm really getting more and more excited about this case is it just shows the vast ignorance on any of these decisions,\" adds Schrems. \"If the Supreme Court of the EU says for the second time you can't do that and they're just saying 'oh I guess the law doesn't apply to us or is not going to be enforced anyways'.<br/>\"With the data transfers you kind of understand why it's complicated and you can't change it overnight. Even in the Facebook complaint I filed in 2015 - back then I said you know they should at least have an order where, within a certain time period, they should have to stop the data transfers than say you've got to stop it overnight because that's not going to happen. But they could, theoretically, order them to stop the data transfers within a year, for example. Which would give them enough time to actually comply with it.\"<br/>What happens next?Individual EU regulators have generally been keeping their cards close to their chest since the CJEU ruling. And it remains to be seen what action Facebook's lead supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), will take as its next steps vis-a-vis Schrems' seven-year-old complaint. All eyes are on Dublin.<br/>More than two years since the application of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the regulator is no stranger to complaints that it needs to pick up the pace and get on with the job of enforcing major cross-border complaints against tech giants like Facebook. Though its counter argument to such criticism is that building robust cases that will stand up to legal challenge takes time.<br/>In the meanwhile, guidance on the CJEU ruling put out by the EDPB emphasizes that international data transfers via SCC must be assessed on a case by case basis; and, if a data controller intends to keep using SCCs, it must inform the relevant EU supervisory authority - inviting scrutiny of these flows.<br/>Combine that with the CJEU telling EU data protection agencies they have a duty to intervene and stop data transfers to places where they suspect people's information is at risk and it's hard to see how regulators can keep sitting on their hands in obvious cases involving FISA-subject entities.<br/>One thing looks clear: The era of 'tickbox' data transfers to any international jurisdiction that lacks an EU data adequacy agreement is toast.<br/>Taking that further, any third country that lacks a comprehensive data protection framework akin to GDPR probably isn't going to be able to sustain 'seamless' access to the European market for long, if at all - which means, yes, the US; but also China, India, and so on (a post-Brexit UK also looks dicey on the adequacy front given its penchant for surveillance overreach; though some of that has already been dialled back via the courts).<br/>And even though there are now noises on both sides of the Atlantic about cooking up a 'Privacy Shield 2', barring enlightened reform of US surveillance law - or the impossible flip-side of Europe tearing up its charter of fundamental rights - any such respawned instrument would soon follow its predecessors into legal history.<br/>As we said last month, all this sums to a lot more work for lawyers. And right on cue law firms are talking up contractual risk reduction strategies to sell concerned data controllers a way forward.<br/>Cash-strapped regulators are also going to find more work piled on their plates now they have unequivocal instruction not to look the other way at lawbreaking data transfer 'business as usual'.<br/>Pressure is being applied to regulators by EU lawmakers too who want to see more joint working to ensure harmonious application of major rulings across the bloc's patchwork of data authorities. Businesses need clarity, is the common refrain. And the role of the EDPB - whose current duties include issuing guidance and promoting pan-EU cooperation and consistency of regulatory application - looks set to become increasingly pivotal as more of these cross-border cases and pinch-points flare up.<br/>The EDPB will need to take on more of a leadership, decision-making role vs its customary talking shop, per Schrems. \"They will have to become a proper legal entity that does proper legal decisions because they will be tested in court,\" he argues. \"So far they got away with more political statements and so on. In both directions. There's some things that they put out that are just going way too far, which the GDPR does not provide for. And there are other things where they're miles away from the basics of what the GDPR says. [Their output] will have to become more like a proper legal analysis - that says this is what you have to do now.\"<br/>Unsurprisingly, for a privacy activist who's been petitioning regulators to uphold his fundamental rights for so many years - and now with two adequacy-crushing CJEU rulings that bear his name - Schrems expresses plenty of frustration at the DPAs' performance to date.<br/>After so much time and legal energy it's amazing to think his original complaint against Facebook's use of SCCs is still unresolved. And that's just one of many he's filed, having spun up noyb: A not-for-profit European digital rights group dedicated to strategic litigation to defend privacy.<br/>\"The other problem is that that the authorities locally then also have to enforce [EDPB guidance] because there's still a lot of talk,\" he says. \"We have decisions that, I can't name them publicly - but we have 'in between' decision from the Irish DPC where they literally say yeah that's what the EDPB says but we have a different view and we're just going to decide the opposite way. And they're not technically bound by these guidelines but if structurally they're not upheld in Member States then, yeah, nothing's going to happen.\"<br/>noyb also has pending cases that have been sitting with DPAs for as much as 1.5 years without a key authority providing feedback - because \"they simply don't talk to each other\".<br/>\"I mean just in daily practice. We have cases that are pending - like the forced consent stuff - where the Germans said they now called them every month in Ireland and there's simply no answer,\" he adds. \"And so it's not working on such a childish, basic level.<br/>\"So the problem that we're having is this whole cooperation system is just so fundamentally not working. It could work if everybody tries to pull in the same direction. But right now they are rather all pulling in different directions.\"<br/>What does Schrems believe will happen with his Facebook SCCs complaint now the CJEU has finally weighed in?<br/>\"I have no clue to be honest. We're now planning to do more and more turning up the heat a bit,\" he says, nodding to the 101 complaints just filed by noyb against the use of SCCs for Facebook Connect and Google Analytics data transfers. \"Fundamentally it's a question of whether the data protection authorities take themselves seriously or if they continue to be like 'FAQs' that are just like 'blah, blah, we don't really tell you anything'. And which of the DPAs are going to start to take some enforcement measures.\"<br/>\"People complain about the US a lot and US companies not being compliant with EU law... But the reality is we're simply not enforcing these laws. And it's a fundamental European problem that we don't do that,\" he adds. \"I'm usually joking in Austria; one Google penalty would buy us up to four high speed rail tunnels through the Alps!\"<br/>There has been one Google penalty since the GDPR began being applied in May 2018 - levied by France's CNIL in early 2019. But Schrems argues the (EURO)50M fine was woefully low, pointing out Austria slapped a larger penalty on its postal service ((EURO)80M) for trying to calculate people's political interests based on their location and age in order to run a direct mailing service. And it's clear Google's behavioral ad-targeting personal-data-sink goes a lot deeper than a spreadsheet to sell direct mailing.<br/>\"If you never really enforce the law, if you never really put out a penalty, if the maximum penalty even from the CNIL was (EURO)50M - which was nothing - then there's no reason to wonder why [tech giants] don't comply,\" adds Schrems.<br/>The Irish DPC has also sought to package product launch delays as annual-report-worthy enforcement wins. But Schrems argues such stuff \"fundamentally underestimates their power\". He also notes that noyb has instigated legal action against the DPC \"for being inactive\", as he puts it.<br/>\"They're oftentimes more happy to write a press release than to actually take the law and take the options that they have on the law and go for it,\" Schrems adds, discussing the problem of EU DPAs generally not feeling willing or able to enforce. \"That's the reason why we've tried to push them with these complaints, the 101 complaints. Basically they can't say that they haven't a case on their table anymore.\"<br/>He likens the impact on Europeans' fundamental rights of so much regulatory inaction as akin to having the right to vote but without access to a polling station most of the time.<br/>\"That's a bit of how we do privacy,\" he suggests. \"And that's a part of what we're trying to do at noyb; just dig into that and just see, you know, there is a law, you breached it, now you pay for it. Because unless we actually push for that structurally, and bit by bit, we're just going to be in this endless debate about privacy for the next 30, 40 years.<br/>\"I'm always telling myself it's a bit normal because when we had the first time that we talked about workers' rights - it still is a 100+ years ongoing debate about actually getting paid what your collective, bargaining agreement says. It's not like any of these problems are done tomorrow or done forever but here the gap between reality and law is just so huge - and even huge companies just fundamentally do not comply - and that's a bit exceptional. Because in other areas they at least pretend to comply. Or somehow comply if they're a larger company with some reputation.\"<br/>Of course even massive financial penalties can amount to a parking ticket for tech giants. Witness Facebook's smiles-all-round $5BN FTC settlement. Or Google's $5BN antitrust fine for a still dominant Android OS. But Schrems' point is you have to actually have functioning institutions issuing penalties to stand any chance of tackling such massive rights asymmetries. And, well, a law that's not enforced is like a footpath no one walks; soon enough there's weeds growing over it and pretty quickly you couldn't even walk it if you tried.<br/>\"We're not going to police the world by having a DPA behind each bush and ogling each click that everybody does. But if they, in general, have an enforcement pressure that companies have the feeling that ok if I don't comply, bit by bit, I'm going to get caught for something... It's a bit like with traffic,\" says Schrems. \"You know I'm not a fan of having a speeding camera around every corner but if once in a while you get a speeding ticket you kind of realize that going 160 on an autobahn is not a good idea and it generally keeps people to drive at 140 if 130 is legal. It keeps it somehow at a format that is somehow acceptable - and that's totally missing in the privacy world.\"<br/>For now, the enforcement gap is being challenged by not-for-profits like noyb. It's also increasingly viewed as an opportunity by class action style litigation funders - hoping to profit off of population-scale damages even if regulators won't.<br/>Schrems says noyb has managed to attract a crowdfunded annual budget of around (EURO)600k-(EURO)700k at this point - \"all donated money for doing the job that regulators are actually paid to do\" - although he's recently been running ads on social media to try to get it to full target funding. \"Technically noyb shouldn't exist,\" he jokes.<br/>Clearly, though, Schrems has tapped into an appetite among Europeans for someone to champion their rights.<br/>After years of regulatory inaction that has allowed data-mining giants to exploit people's privacy without any meaningful consequences - sewing up the attention economic in the process - there's a vacancy for privacy heroes to tackle the sorts of abuses Schrems and his team are worried about. Problems regulators have failed historically to act on, and which Europeans are still waiting for action on. (A two-year Commission review of GDPR in June acknowledged a lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement.)<br/>\"Right now we're looking into a lot of the data brokers on the advertisement stuff,\" says Schrems, when asked about his biggest privacy concern. \"What's kind of interesting in some countries - not all - the credit ranking agencies and what they do and why they think they can have data on every European and their financial situation without ever having consent or anything. So there's tonnes of stuff that we're looking on right now. I'm luckily not involved in all of it at the same time anymore.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1449531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SM-3ND1-DYDW-71RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 7, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Today, at 30, he is one of the most public faces in the global fight for privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As he sits in a caf\u00e9 in Vienna, spiky-haired and wearing a black T-shirt, he could have just come from work at a tech company. Instead, he spent his twenties pursuing Facebook - and the Irish regulator meant to watch over it - in a case that went all the way to the European Court of Justice. His victory caused an international crisis and brought down Safe Harbour, a data-transfer mechanism used by thousands of companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The recent public backlash against Big Tech has been just that: a lashing out, strong words in editorials coupled with abstract talk of regulation. Schrems believes in action instead. He has now launched None of Your Business, a non-profit that aims to challenge more companies with privacy lawsuits, empowered by the threat of new, fatter fines under legislation that comes into force in Europe in May.</p><p>\"Can you use lawsuits to give Silicon Valley morals?\" I ask. \"I don't think so,\" he says with a laugh. But Schrems believes that courts can curtail companies' ability to poke around in our private lives and wean them off their idea that, \" 'We're Silicon Valley, we know what's right for everybody else.'?\"</p><p>Schrems' journey started when, as a 23-year-old law student, he requested his personal data from Facebook for a college paper. He was shocked to find the social network had amassed 1,200 pages - everything he'd ever \"Liked\" and every private message he'd ever sent. Even sensitive messages about a friend's health that he had deleted still remained on Facebook's servers. \"That was obviously wrong,\" he says. </p><p>He filed 22 complaints claiming that Facebook was breaking European data protection law, undermining the fundamental right to privacy. Back in 2011, Schrems was already arguing that Facebook was a \"monopoly\" that needed special attention from regulators.</p><p>Last month, The<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Observer</emphasis> and The<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> New York Times</emphasis> revealed that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the Facebook data of 50 million users . </p><h>Irish legal case Schrems is not surprised. He had identified the specific flaw that Cambridge Analytica was able to exploit in 2011. \"Now they say it was a hack, back then they said it was a feature,\" he says. \"This is exactly what we debated in Ireland seven years ago. If they had followed the law right away, we wouldn't be in this debate now.\"</h><p>Back then, the Irish regulator - responsible for overseeing Facebook because the company's international headquarters are in Dublin - simply asked it to make the language of the privacy policy clearer, before declaring the arrangement \"satisfactory\".</p><p>In 2015, Facebook made changes to restrict developers' access to data, and since the latest revelations it has pledged more privacy improvements. But by far the bigger concern, Schrems says, is how much data Facebook itself holds. </p><p>Privacy law in Europe is about to undergo a seismic change. The General Data Protection Regulation will come into force on May 25th, weaponising regulators with the ability to impose much larger fines than before. These will rise to a possible $20 million or up to 4 per cent in global revenue, which for Facebook would have been $1.6 billion last year alone. It also allows for lawsuits led by non-profits such as NOYB, helping consumers unite to protect their right to privacy.</p><p>\"If it came up now, it would be the perfect class action,\" Schrems says of the users whose data were shared with Cambridge Analytica without their knowledge. \"It could ruin Facebook. Under European data protection law, if 50 million people sued for $2,000 each, [it could] possibly kill them. Even for Facebook, that's an insane amount of money.\" </p><p>But under the law at the time, it appeared to be compliant. Facebook is now examining more closely what data it collects.</p><p>Part of the problem, Schrems says, is that privacy settings and terms of service are often incomprehensible to the average person. \"How can a user work for 10 hours a day, then go back home and understand how Facebook's algorithm works? I don't understand and I've been doing that for seven years,\" he says. \"The average user is stupid - in the sense that I'm stupid about building codes or how a building holds up. I just walk in and expect that it doesn't fall on my head.\"</p><h>Disrupters </h><p>Schrems is not anti-tech: he still uses Facebook and is prolific with snark and emojis on Twitter. </p><p>He is just three years younger than Mark Zuckerberg, the social network's founder, both born in a generation where geeks were recast as disrupters, and disruption was a worthy goal. Both spent their college years on side projects that they believed could make the world a better place. Both harnessed the power of online tools: Zuckerberg to build a network of two billion users, Schrems to raise the money and media attention to challenge it.</p><p>Zuckerberg is convinced that connecting people on a global social network spreads democracy (or at least he was, until the Russians used Facebook to spread disinformation during the US election). </p><p>But Schrems believes we risk shifting power over our lives from laws made by elected officials to a self-appointed cabal in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Schrems grew up in the city of Salzburg, not far from Vienna. Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone who puts such a priority on privacy, he is cautious about talking about his background. His mother gave him two apartments, one he lives in, and another he rents out, and he supplements this income with speaking fees. But he is careful not to give talks directly about his cases, of which there are currently two - one continuing the battle about transatlantic data flows in Ireland and another civil privacy lawsuit in Austria.</p><p>Schrems thinks it's funny that he has been characterised as the underdog taking on a giant. He originally did not even want his name and face connected with his campaign, before realising that for many, he was the story: \"You need some David v Goliath blah blah blah,\" he says.</p><p>After his shock over the amount of his data Facebook held, he started to complain to the regulator. He complained that Facebook was using Like buttons to track unwitting users as they wandered around the web. He complained about a facial-recognition technology that automatically tagged users in photos, giving them no choice over whether they were identified in their friends' pictures. He complained about shadow profiles that mapped the connections of people who had never joined Facebook, leaving them powerless about how their personal data were used.</p><p>Schrems sent the complaints to the Irish data protection commissioner in Portarlington. From a modest office above a supermarket, the Irish DPC was responsible for regulating all the tech companies that nominated their Dublin-based subsidiaries as \"data controllers\". Despite its role protecting millions of EU citizens, the commissioner had just 26 staff at the time.</p><p>The DPC decided to informally resolve Schrems' complaints by handing Facebook a \"to do\" list. Facebook did make changes. For example, it turned off facial recognition for EU users, improved its tool allowing users to access their information, and made it clearer how third-party apps would use their data.</p><p>But Schrems felt Facebook needed to do more, and that he should be shown the evidence about its systems and privacy protections it had provided to the regulator. In February 2012 he arranged a meeting with Facebook, who sent two staff to Austria: Richard Allan and Katherine Tassi, a privacy lawyer. The pair flew to Vienna and sat down with Schrems in an airport hotel.</p><p>The meeting dragged on for six hours. Schrems felt Facebook wanted to fob him off with \"bullshit arguments\", such as the fact that its features were \"really cool for the people\". </p><p>Schrems also pursued the Irish commissioner. Once, he called the office and was told no one was available. He called back every hour until the deputy commissioner texted him to say no one was going to talk to him. </p><p>\"It was like the authority breaking up with you through text message,\" Schrems laughs.</p><p>In June 2013, the Snowden leaks provided Schrems with new material. \"Snowden was the Chernobyl of data protection,\" Schrems says. \"It was for me the major change. Suddenly it became a much more mainstream debate than it was before.\"</p><p>Snowden showed that Facebook user data were being harvested by the NSA as part of a mass-surveillance campaign. US companies including Facebook had signed up to the Safe Harbour mechanism, agreeing that Europeans' data could be looked after just as well in the US. Suddenly that promise looked shaky.</p><p>Schrems returned to the Irish DPC with a 23rd complaint. The Irish High Court shunted it to the European Court of Justice. A breakthrough came when Schrems saw the questions the European judges handed out ahead of the only hearing on the case. They were tackling the legality of Safe Harbour head on, when they could have stuck to the question of whether the complaint was in the jurisdiction of the Irish DPC. \"I knew we were going to win it,\" he says.</p><p>In September 2015, Yves Bot, the advocate general and a crucial adviser to the ECJ, issued his opinion that the Safe Harbour protection should be struck down. Shockwaves spread through Washington DC and Silicon Valley. Three weeks later, the judges ruled that transferring data to the US under Safe Harbour was now illegal.</p><p>Suddenly, chief executives of major companies were lobbying the US government to find an alternative, fast. Transatlantic data flows looked so precarious that President Obama was briefed on the case, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>Within months, the US and the EU had negotiated one - Privacy Shield. It contained added protections, such as an ombudsman in the US that Europeans could appeal to if they thought their data were being hoovered up unfairly by the intelligence agencies. </p><p>But Schrems says he was \"pissed\" the commission wasted its opportunity to restrict Silicon Valley companies. It could have pushed for more. Yet Schrems is pleased that the decision that bears his name clarifies a key point: mass surveillance is illegal under articles seven and eight of the charter for fundamental human rights - respect for private and family life and the protection of personal data. \"It has a huge influence on the whole legal structure in Europe,\" he says.</p><p>The central problem can only really be solved if the US adds more judicial oversight of its surveillance, Schrems believes: \"That is, I think, not going to happen in the next 10 years.\"</p><h>Policing the platforms </h><p>Schrems thinks privacy is the \"most unenforced right\" in Europe. \"If you go through the list of fundamental rights, it really is not enforced at all.\" He is motivated by a belief that rights should be enforced, rather than by a passion for personal privacy, and hates to think that tech companies believe they are above the law. \"Emotionally, it gets me much more that they get away with it,\" he says.</p><p>In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg espoused the idea that \"social norms\" around privacy were changing, with people becoming more willing to share personal information. (He has since rolled back from that statement.) I ask Schrems whether people just don't care any more. \"They don't care in the sense that they don't worry about it all day long. But I don't worry about climate change all day long,\" he says.</p><p>The way we regulate privacy at the moment, he adds, is akin to putting a sticker on something saying: \"This may kill you - and now it's your responsibility if this device kills you or not.\" - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3452232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1V-2KT1-JC8Y-82NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 6, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Bloomberg\u2019s database of regulatory filings shows no mention of either blockchain or Bitcoin in these companies\u2019 disclosures since 2008.

Yet almost a decade after Bitcoin\u2019s creation, Zuckerberg only recently pledged to study encryption and virtual currencies; he has now reportedly put a dozen people on the case.</p><p>The dinosaurs on Wall Street have been more aggressive. Financial firms have the biggest share of blockchain patents, according to law firm EnvisionIP, more than tech firms. Even then, the latter group is dominated by old-school brands like IBM.</p><p>Are tech firms simply reluctant to embrace blockchain because they see it as an existential threat? True believers argue that the technology is anathema to the powerful Silicon Valley elite, who through sheer size and market share have become incumbents themselves \u2014 like banks.</p><p>Take Facebook: it\u2019s a centralised, entrenched middleman that sells $40 billion of ads annually thanks to user data surrendered for free. Is it any wonder that Zuckerberg might drag his feet in tinkering with this?</p><p>Blockchain startups are already being pitched that target the economics of this business: French think tank Generation Libre is proposing to help people control, authenticate and sell their data to platforms for a transparent price via a blockchain. If that took off, one could (just) imagine Facebook losing users and being forced to reinvent itself.</p><p>But maybe the tech elite knows something we don\u2019t. If big banks have survived the past decade of fintech and crypto-disruption, and dabbled with blockchain experiments to reap the benefit of a buzzword, then maybe the wealthy and entrenched forces of Silicon Valley can do likewise without needing to panic.</p><p>The recent proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings was supposed to disrupt the venture capital funding model, but it seems to have been co-opted: witness WhatsApp rival Telegram ditching its public ICO plan after raising $1.7 billion privately.</p><p>Facebook isn\u2019t going to torpedo its business model for the fun of it, and it\u2019s unlikely to view rival start-ups as a threat until users sign off en masse and seize control of their data \u2014 which hasn\u2019t happened.</p><p>Sure, big tech companies and big banks probably suffer from the innovator\u2019s dilemma, and lean towards conservatism.

John Dickerson, Slate's chief political correspondent, always on time, always his best self, is here in the DC studio with me. Hello John.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Hello, David.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Joining us from New Haven is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Slate</emphasis></emphasis> senior editor Emily Bazelon. Hello, Emily.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Hello. Am I always my best self? No, definitely not.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You're often your best self. You were your best self in the thing that we saw this week about you. Gabfest listener, Maura Pierce-longtime friend of the Gabfest, Maura Pearce, stumbled across a 1996 Woman on the Street CSPAN interview with Emily this week. And she sent it to us, and we've posted it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>And, boy, do I look 12 years old.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>In which both you and Paul had a pretty good working knowledge of the Pentagon Papers, and why they were important.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I mean, to be just stopped on the street and asked about the Pentagon Papers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>It could have been worse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>So, Emily and her fianc\u00e9-then fianc\u00e9, now husband--were stopped on the Mall and asked about the Pentagon Papers, and they showed separate interviews with them. And you were your best self. You were very charming -</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I was a little loopy, though. You have to say that-in the beginning, in particular.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Not at all. Did you have a law degree at that point?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>No. Not at all. No, I had not started law school.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>For not having a law degree, you were very together. You were very calm, poised, spoke in complete sentences. You hair looked great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>My hair is hilarious. It's in a pompadour for an engagement party that Paul remembers-and my grandmother was throwing for us. Everyone can go amuse themselves if they really want to.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>It was great. You should definitely watch it. We will post the link to it.</p><p>This week on your Political Gabfest: The Healthcare.com fiasco continues as the Secretary of HHS is flayed, mildly flayed, before Congress, and President Obama tries to recover from a campaign lie, or fib, or perhaps truth about whether you can keep your insurance in the age of Obamacare-but if you like your insurance, can you actually keep it?</p><p>Then, our second topic: The NSA has been spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a decade, more than a decade; also the Cardinals at Vatican City. Also, apparently, most of the people of France and Spain. And who knows who else? We will talk about whether the NSA is finally in deep trouble for its excessive surveillance, and whether spy world is going to be reformed after all.</p><p>Then, is it ever okay for a department store to practice racial profiling? Plus, we will have Cocktail Chatter, of course. And before we get started, an exciting-even a thrilling announcement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Really?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yes, the Gabfest is coming to Brooklyn.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Oh, right. Oh, of course; I forgot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>The borough of my ancestry. November 19, our very first Brooklyn show will be at the Bell House. The tickets are now available at slate.com/nygabfest. I think the show is at eight. There's a cocktail party before. Tickets will go fast for the cocktail party, and maybe they'll go fast for the show. So, you might want to get there quickly. Slate.com/nygabfest.</p><p>We're going to focus-it's the week of the Kennedy Assassination that week. And we decided we're going to do a show where we're going to focus on John F. Kennedy, the assassination, Kennedy's legacy. So, please come; can't wait to see you in Brooklyn.</p><p>The ongoing fiasco of Healthcare.gov continued and metastasized this week, as the president vowed to have the healthcare marketplace working by the end of November, and touted the likely benefits of the plan. The administration was being besieged in several directions. Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of HHS, and other top officials were summoned before Congress to self-flagellate, to do penance about how they messed up the website.</p><p>Americans on certain plans began receiving cancellation notices, despite President Obama's promise during the campaign, was it, John, or later-during the rollout?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, during the rollout and after.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>During the rollout he promised-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Repeatedly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>He promised repeatedly that if you like your plan you can keep it, but now plans are being canceled. The administration, will they have an answer for that? We'll talk about their answer in a minute.</p><p>Also, the site crashed again this weekend, by the way-although it seems to be back up, sort of.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Just kind of. And, John, I loved yesterday-you did a great Gabfest extra with David Auerbach, a software engineer, who has been writing for us about this. And it was so fascinating to learn all about his sense about what the serious bugs were and weren't, and where the problems were. I strongly commend anyone to listen to that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah. He was just great. He was really great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>So, let's talk about this issue of people's plans getting canceled. So, the president had said, if you like your plan, you can keep it. Now, it appears that people are getting cancellation notices, Emily, from their insurers. Mostly these are people who are not on employee plans; are also not on Medicaid or Medicare. They're getting cancellation notices from their insurers saying that, because of Obamacare we're cancelling your plan; meaning you're going to have to go sign up for a new individual plan in the healthcare exchanges.</p><p>Of course, you're unable to do that right now. The Republicans and, in fact, many Democrats are saying, \"Hey, Obama, you promised that we could keep our plans. Now we can't. What's the deal?\"</p><p>Do you think the president has a legitimate response here, Emily?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Well, I mean, their response is that he was talking about people who are on employer-based plans. And what we're now focusing on are the five percent people who are on individual plans. And the reason they can't keep their individual plans is that they're bad plans, according to the administration, that don't provide enough coverage and are too expensive.</p><p>And so under the new rules of Obamacare, they will be eligible for better coverage. Okay, but the problem is there's this huge time lag disaster here, right, where people are getting the cancellation notices now, but the new plans won't kick in for a couple months. And so if something bad happens to them in the meantime, they feel vulnerable. And, also, just the storytelling and theater of this is terrible, because instead of people feeling like, \"Oh good, I'm happily switched over to this better plan. Who needs this old bad pair of shoes I was wearing?\" it's like they're being left barefoot in the desert with all this worry that this website is never going to work, and the whole thing just seems so wobbly that I think that is focusing a lot of attention on these people with individual plans.</p><p>And if I was them, I would also feel worried and upset.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>John, is Emily right that the president really doesn't have a good comeback here?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>He has an okay comeback, absent the context. So, the reason he said for four years that if you have your plan it won't change is that he was trying to sell people on what was going to be a disruptive change to the healthcare market. And the biggest political challenge he had was that people who had existing plans through their employers, the 80% of the population, were terrified that whatever he was going to was going to destroy what they had and what they liked.</p><p>So, he was promising a kind of controlled chaos. He was promising to change the status quo, which was terrible. People even who had insurance were getting bankruptcies as a result of going into the hospital and having more costs that they were expecting. And he was saying, \"I'm going to change dramatically the healthcare system, but only in this very narrow and controlled way.\" And that's what this promise was all about.</p><p>It was the central promise, because it was basically saying, \"I will do something but it will be a controlled business.\" And in that context, then, now when you say, well, for this five percent of the population, for these 11 million or so people, it's not really true that they're going to be able to keep their doctor, but what they're going to get is going to be better. And even though in some cases what they get isn't necessarily going to be better, what starts to happen is, you get into the kind of dissembling that, compared to the original way he talked about this, the ironclad, nothing's going to change, there's obviously a disconnect there.</p><p>And since what he's in the middle of-and, in some ways, always been a part of the Affordable Healthcare Act-has been a credibility question. Are the promises he's making going to actually turn to be true? And as the website has its issues, which is, in a sense, a credibility problem-we said it was going to work like this, and now it's not working like that, it adds to this feeling that the law is not as it was advertised. And, therefore, it reignites the initial worry among people who are not even affected by the Affordable Care Act directly, and that's everybody who has regular insurance, thinking, \"Geez, I was promised all these things about how it wasn't going to screw up my healthcare. Now these promises are not turning out to be true.\" And that just makes people worry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Someone made this point-I wrote it down in my notes, but I didn't write down who made it. So, whoever made it, good job.</p><p>The healthcare narrative for the past-really, for the past 20 years, practically, has been a story in which some poor person-the exemplar story has been about some poor person, a sick person cannot get insurance because of horrible HMOs, because of laws about preexisting conditions, whatever, and getting screwed. Now, we have-that was a narrative that really favored the Democratic story on healthcare reform.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>And people were going bankrupt and suffering mightily.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>And going bankrupt and suffering. And the narrative has been flipped, which is, because of this overregulation, because of the octopus of Obamacare, which is putting its horrible, greasy tentacles into every aspect of American insurance life, it's poor innocent do-gooding citizens who have had insurance are getting crushed by this horror in Washington, by Sebelius and Obama. And that's in a narrative, obviously, which aligns with what the Republicans have been saying.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I mean, it's not really a true narrative in the long run, if Obamacare works the way it's supposed to. Because what happens to people who are on plans with huge copayments and bad coverage is, they get better plans. And other people's insurance premiums go up, because the insurance companies can't reject sick people anymore, and you're spreading risk. And so it is true that young, healthy people will be paying somewhat more, but that's a good thing overall.</p><p>It's just we haven't seen any of that actually materialize yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>But I think the most controlling story in healthcare is still the one that affects the people, the largest number of people, which is all the people in the employer-based system. And those people are worried that what they have now, as imperfect as it may be, will get worse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>But, John, we don't have any real reason to feel that way rationally-right? I understand the anxiety, but it's not like something is happening to the employer-based healthcare plans that would make us rationally expect that, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I mean, what killed the Clinton's attempt to do this-and then what made Obama's attempt to do it never really popular, and always the weight and the problem he always had, and the reason he never really had a moment where it was super popular-except in the very beginnings where people said they want the system to change, but then it was so unspecific that people were for that. But the minute it got specific, people worried. The whole problem was always that the huge group of people who were in the employer-based system said, \"Once you start monkeying with it over here, to help these people who are not being covered because of preexisting conditions, who are getting into plans where they're getting screwed-once you start helping them you're going to mess with the whole system and that's going to slop over and affect me.\"</p><p>And that's always been the political thing the president's been fighting against. And he's never really fixed that because it's-how do you? I mean, it's basically the fear of change. The only way you can overcome the fear of change is if this website had worked and all these people had gotten better plans. And then the whole healthcare system had kind of settled out, and it had been no problem. And so all of the fear-mongering, or what Republicans would say is accurate prediction of what would happen-there would be some resolution. You'd get some proof to the fears and the questions of the last four years.</p><p>But we still haven't gotten that. And so the people who were fearful in the first place are getting evidence that maybe their fears were founded on something.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What I find so bizarre about all of this is that the Republican criticisms of what's happening are 100 percent legitimate. They are absolutely vindicated in the incompetence of the rollout. And yet there is so little willingness to offer any ideas, any alternatives. Because if you think about what Obamacare consists of, it consists of things which Republicans now all support.</p><p>For example, the ban on preexisting conditions, being able to deny people insurance, that will never come back. You cannot bring that back. People with preexisting conditions are going to be allowed to get insurance.</p><p>Covering things like pregnancy and mental health, those are things which are going to be covered in the future. You cannot get rid of them. Basically, what it comes down to is, how much are we going to subsidize the insurance for the people who are not super poor but moderately poor? That's the only thing that really is at issue now.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Well, but I feel like that's not totally true, because, also, what's at issue is whether this whole notion of an exchange, which is the private market operating in this government-constructed universe, whether that's going to succeed or not. And it seems like the evidence for some of the states that are actually having functional websites, and the evidence from Massachusetts is that it can work perfectly fine. And then we will see these benefits.</p><p>But, nationally speaking, we don't have anything to show for that yet. And so that's the thing that seems to me, rationally, would be the problem that people could legitimately be fearing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>I don't really understand that, but maybe that's because I didn't understand what I just said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>No, this whole problem we were talking about last week, which I know you understand, that the only way for the exchange market to function is if lots of people sign up, some of them healthy who are lower cost and spread risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I mean, it seems like that's still a question mark. If we see that working, then this basically market-oriented Heritage Foundation dreamed-up solution to the problem of people with moderate incomes having no health insurance, then we'll know that can work. But until we see that, that is this big question that is unresolved. Right? John, am I correct in-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah, yeah. That's the policy danger for the Obama administration at the heart of the healthcare website not working, is not only do you-under what they had hoped the healthcare website would be there. People would be able to comparison shop. They would get these letters from their insurers saying you're losing your insurance. And they'd say, \"Well that doesn't matter because I have a choice of four plans, and they're better plans, and I'm really happy because I've either signed up for a new plan, or I am about to sign up for a new plan. And so the fact that my old clunky plan is getting canceled doesn't bother me.\"</p><p>Well, the healthcare website has denied supporters of the president's plan those stories. But then the real worry is the policy impact of the fact that people aren't signing up.</p><p>Now, they say in Massachusetts, people signed up late. The question is whether a sufficient number of people can sign up for non-Medicaid coverage, people who are young enough, to work these pools out in the various regions in the country. And we won't know that until the middle of next year, probably.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Right. No, it's still possible these could all turn out to be short term disasters, but not long term killers of the legislation, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah. The only thing I would say is that the administration was so anxious to get these younger people signed up from the second they could. And that it was going to be a hard proposition to begin with, to get the young invincibles to sign up.</p><p>And so the fact that a month has been lost-and in the end maybe two months has been lost-we do have time, but-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Maybe they should launch a campaign where they go out and cause crippling injury to lots of young, uninsured people that will be then highly publicized. That could be like a full employment government program where you send people out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Where you just go around, and just-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Run them over.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Just hit them with cars. That would be the easiest method.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Hit them with cars. Yeah. That would be awesome. That's a good idea.</p><p>I want to do one more question about the politics of this before we wrap it up-which is, just a couple of weeks ago, we were having this conversation about the catastrophic fate that the Republican Party seemed to have consigned itself to.</p><p>I cannot recall in my life a political situation turning around as rapidly, and as comprehensively, and as legitimately, for legitimate reasons, as this situation has. John, can you think of an example? And is there any reason for the president to hope, \"Oh, this is going to subside, and everything will be back, and people will remember how outrageously the Republicans behaved in September.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>What was Clinton's standing right before everybody learned about Monica?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah. I was trying to remember whether the economy was doing well enough, and the deficit was down, and it all seemed hunky-dory, and then-poof.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yeah, it was okay. Things were okay there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>And in the end, Monica was not a fatal strike against the president. And so President Obama has seen-his approval ratings in the Wall Street Journal poll are as low as they've been in his presidency. And his personal approval ratings, which used to be good, even though his job performance numbers were bad, his personal performance numbers are now upside down for the first time, which just means more people don't like him than do like him.</p><p>I think what's happened, David, is you have two things in decline. One is the Republican Party. And the other is the president. The president is in a slower rate of decline, but he's gone through a tiny little burst in the last week. But the Republican Party's decline still continues. And they still have all of the problems.</p><p>Having said that, two things about this are good for Republicans. One, it takes the focus off of them. And, two, on the Obamacare front, it allows some to say, \"Well, you see? This is why we were really interested in Obamacare, and why we wanted to stop it, because it has all these inherent flaws.\" And that allows them to both feel validated, but, also, more broadly, it allows them to say, \"We're not only sort of soothsayers, and we could predict all this in the future, but all of our 48 votes and everything, they weren't wasted effort, because it's been this bad.\"</p><p>Now, whether that actually is the case doesn't really matter. It gives them an argument that they can sustain, whereas, before, people might have been like, \"Your obsession with healthcare, over the Obamacare, years after it had passed, was kind of proof of the fact that you have no ideas, and you're kind of off on these crusades, and not doing anything that affects us and has anything to do with our lives.\"</p><p>[Sponsorship]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Now, for today's breakthrough: How positive are you that the memories inside your head are real? Most of us think that are memories are full proof but Professor Elizabeth Loftus knows better. Her research has found that memories are easily manipulated, and much of what we think we remember may actually be the result of suggestion.</p><p>To read about her and uncover more ground-breaking innovations by the University of California, visit slate.com/breakthroughs.</p><p>I don't know if you remember-Will Saletan did a fantastic series for us about Elizabeth Loftus.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I was just going to say that she is such a fascinating researcher, and everyone should go read that wonderful piece that Will wrote.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yeah. And I now know that she's a UC professor. That's great.</p><p>I'm not confident at all of any of my memories. Not even of what happened five minutes ago, really.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I agree.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Gracious; how stressful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What's your earliest memory? Do you think you have an earliest legitimate memory? Do you think it's all planted?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I don't. But I think anything that is narratively coherent is planted. I think I have memories of kind of images, snatches from periods when I was a little kid. But I have such a bad memory from all of those concussions in high school that I barely know your name-or my own, for that matter. It's really-it's tragic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What's your earliest legitimate memory, Emily?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I have the idea that I remember when Nixon resigned, that I remember the red carpet that he walked on, or some red velvet something in the room. But I've never looked to see if that is actually possible that I remember it-that there was red velvet or red something, or whether I just have been told about it or saw it later.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>I definitely remember Nixon's resignation. I remember that. But I'm a year older than you are, I think.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>So, that's four. You probably remember that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I don't. No. I remember Carter's inauguration. But I don't remember Nixon's resignation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>I don't think anyone remembers Jimmy Carter's inauguration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I know.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You're the only person.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Carter's inauguration is years later, also.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, the reason I remember is we had a-Mom, for work, had a Betamax to tape television, which, at the time, was like having a spaceship in your backyard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>You better have an earlier memory than that, John, because you must have been seven or eight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, no, I'm not saying-no, no, no.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Can you let him tell his great story?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Sorry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I'm just saying that this is my first, I think, political memory. Anyway-and she taped the inauguration. Can you imagine the least useful thing to do? But it was like, \"We can tape the television!\" I mean, you were in that early period where that was such a crazy thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>No, why would that be least-there's nothing. First of all, there' s only one channel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I still feel that way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I know. But inaugurations are really kind of-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Dullsville.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah. They're pretty dull. But I definitely remember that. And I think she had to work, so there was a bunch of, \"Will it work when we set the dial?\" which you had to set by turning the little wheel manually, the way you now do on an iPhone. But you had to like turn the little wheels and then you had to put some coal in the boiler. It was a really involved thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>That was a great story. I like that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Why are we talking about this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>That was the best part of the show so far. All right; let's move on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I think I still have those tapes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Really?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah. They're in the small little Betamax. It looks so cute and quaint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Aw. Healthcare.gov had a bad week; the NSA had a worse one. Thanks to the latest Snowden revelations published in various newspapers around the world, it now appears that the NSA has been eavesdropping on friendly world leaders, including Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as the Cardinals who gather to elect the Pope. As well as sweeping up millions of French and Spanish phone calls and text messages. perhaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Don't you just feel like if you were halfway important and in Europe, and you weren't being eavesdropped on, you should be mortally wounded at this point?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What I want to know is why Angela Merkel, and not somebody fun? I mean, I presume they're also doing-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Who's fun?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Berlusconi. Wouldn't you want to eavesdrop on Berlusconi?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Oh right; Berlusconi.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I'm sure they were eavesdropping on Berlusconi.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Maybe they were listening to him, too.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Wouldn't you love to catch Putin-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Except the thing is, Berlusconi wouldn't be doing anything useful in terms of the US intelligence, right? He'd be just be on the phone to teenage girls.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>There would be a lot more hot sex in the Berlusconi calls, though.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>That's, well, that-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>That would be so great to get those files-or Prince William.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>But, I mean, there's a chance that Angela Merkel would be doing something useful , because she's a very purposeful and useful person. I wonder if they did-they did, of course, have-I mean, I'm sure they had something on Berlusconi. And I wonder, what would happen if what you got was illegal? I guess you would just hold onto it, and use it as leverage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What do you mean? If you got him-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Saying-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Talking and having phone sex with 15 year old girls?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Working out his prostitution ring for 15-year-old-yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>It would be like the usual.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Right. But, in a way, you couldn't wring anything out of him, really, other than some good first-press olive oil or anything. I mean, because he wouldn't be a useful-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right. Also, it wouldn't have been actually a revelation to anyone that he was running a prostitution ring with 15-year-old girls.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Right. So, maybe it wouldn't deem leverage. Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>How about-also, it just seems like this whole program was on autopilot, and its purpose is lost in the midst. We were just listening.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right. Well, let's talk about that. So, let me just finish the introduction, so that we have-the president now appears to be telling foreign leaders that he didn't know about this until recently. There is absolute fury in Europe over this surveillance-although, some of it is of the Casablanca-shocked that there's gambling in this establishment going on.</p><p>But there does appear to be genuine rage among some Europeans; maybe not that it's going on, but that it's going on so expansively , so easily, so thoughtlessly, so purposelessly, almost. And you even have Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic senator who has been very, very supportive-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Who is usually a huge apologist for all of our intelligence gathering.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>And she's angry about the idea that we're tapping allies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, see, this is what-it would be fun to be able to strip away how much of this is BS. I mean, is she angry that we're tapping-I mean, I'm sure she's legitimately concerned. But, also ,the fact that she didn't know about this. She said, in one account I read, didn't know about this for a decade-which means she could equally be angry with the fact that basically she's being totally kept in the dark, not there's the underlying crime-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Even though she's supposed to be in charge of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Right. And what takes me to is back to our old discussions, where if you were sympathetic to the administration, or looking for some kind of clarity in terms of where the lines were being drawn, and so forth and so on, the Intelligence Committee was one way in which there was supposed to be some oversight for the NSA.</p><p>And that oversight is based on the Intelligence Committee actually knowing what's going on. And so this, it seems to me the most-one of the damning things is that if Feinstein didn't know about it -it was a necessary requirement of all her previous oversight that she knew what was going on. So, maybe she didn't know really what was going on about a lot of those other things, either. And so the oversight was-I mean, we always knew the oversight wasn't that great. But, this suggests oversight in general is even less good than we thought.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right. Well, this is where-this is why I'm in a snit about all of this, which is that I don't have any particular problem with bugging Angela Merkel or even bugging the Vatican. I mean, it seems like as stupid thing to do. It seems like it's a tremendous waste of resources. But as a matter of moral principle, I don't think we should be forbidden from spying on your allies as you see fit.</p><p>What drives me crazy-and I think why people like me who traditionally are sort of pro-surveillance and don't mind it as much are so angry-is that it's premised on the idea that there are checks, balances, there are people paying attention to it, that the NSA is telling the truth-that when they talk to Congress, they tell the truth-that they reveal what they're doing to the president, to his staffers. And that the people who do have to make the hard decisions about this actually have the knowledge to make the hard decisions, that they know what's going on.</p><p>And the fact that now we have a prominent senator saying she didn't know, you have Congress, members of the House Intelligence Committee saying they didn't know these things, you have lots of evidence that the NSA kind of lies or shades the truth when it testifies-all is a very strong push to me to say, \"I am not going to trust a single thing these people say ever again. If they want to get more surveillance, they are going to have to come publicly testify, say exactly what they're doing-because there's no reason to trust them anymore.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah. And we've been heading down this path for months, ever since the Snowden revelation started-and, indeed, before then. And it seems like the indications are, in the post-9/11 world in which we all got worried and were willing to do basically-give up anything, any civil liberty in order to feel safer, we created-or recreated-a version of the kind of government spymaster monster that then becomes incredibly difficult to tame.</p><p>And then we find out that it's so gargantuan, and it's like you were saying before about its tentacles; this is where the government's tentacles really are everywhere. And the president didn't apparently even know it was happening, or cared to ask, although that also seems kind of fishy, because he's actually getting these briefings every day that should have been referring to some of these wiretaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Well, but probably there was just what Angela Merkel is saying are private-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>She was too boring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>It was too boring. There was nothing in it of value. So, in fact, they're doing this thing which they're able to do because they have tremendous technology, but actually has no particular value.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Though you could imagine there was a time when it needed to have value, you wouldn't be able to quickly set it up.</p><p>But I think, going back to your point, David, is this idea that-and, Emily, you were saying this, too-the fact that this exists kind of outside of administrations. In the previous revelations from Snowden, the president was always saying, \"We've got to have a balance, and I'll look into this, and I want to have the conversation.\" But, at the back of it, there was always the feeling that he didn't really want to have the conversation. He pretty much would have preferred that this continue on so that he could use these tools himself, because he thinks they're useful.</p><p>In this case, the tools are being used, and he, apparently, doesn't know about them. That seems to me the best support for the idea that there is this national security apparatus that exists, regardless of what president we have, and regardless of what role the president has.</p><p>And so here you could have something that actually didn't have anything to do with Americans, but that puts a highlight on-in a way, for me, that it didn't when it was the spying on just Americans, which is presumably a greater thing to be exercised upon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>And to pile onto that, John, typically whenever anything has been raised, with the Snowden revelations, or earlier reporting from the New York Times and other places about the predations of the intelligence community. You have Keith Alexander, and James Clapper, and other people in national security come out and say, \"No, no, no. Security, this trumps all. We are protecting America. You have no idea. You can't know. The things that we do in the dark to make life safe for you are too valuable to be shared, and you have to trust us.\"</p><p>With the case of Merkel, or the College of fucking Cardinals, the College of Cardinals-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Strictly speaking, I don't think that's behavior in which they engage. But nonetheless.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Maybe that's what they were spying. You cannot possibly invoke some national security claim when you're talking about the College of Cardinals and Angela Merkel. You can't say-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, I think-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>We're doing this because this is going to protect us from terrorists. No, this is just pure straight-up espionage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, there is some national security, presumably.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Continuous.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, we don't know. We don't know. There is an element of theater here. Just the other element of theater in it is that for the Europeans, now that this is all public, they have to act outraged, because they use a lot of our intelligence that we gather through these kind of methods, and they have spied on us, and have been caught doing it.</p><p>Now, Merkel is a bridge too far. That's a new category. But it'll be interesting to see how much of this theater, which is done for their own domestic public consumption, once it kind of works its way out, what, really, the effect of this. Do they get-one of the things that's been talked about is the kind of agreement where, basically, we enter a new agreement with the French and the Germans, and say we-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>And the Five Eyes. Don't forget that new spooky word that has emerged.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, an agreement like the Five Eyes. So, the Five Eyes is, what, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and America agree not to spy on each other. And the question is whether we would have that kind of agreement with any of those other countries. And I doubt, in the end, that we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I think the Europeans have played it really in a smart way, though. They have genuine reason for outrage, faux or not, in the sense that the optics of this, of Merkel being able to say, \"Hey, wait a second,\" are useful. And they are likely to get more intelligence out of us from this. And, also, just highlight that the whole cost-benefit analysis of doing this kind of surveillance is completely out of whack.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>The other big surveillance story this week, I almost think is bigger than the European one, which is that the Washington Post, also based on Snowden, published a PowerPoint, a slide, supported by other evidence about NSA stealing data from Google and Yahoo!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Basically breaking into the collection center that we didn't, until now, know that they had access to, and then vacuuming up essentially everything.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Everything; as Google and Yahoo! sent data between their data centers, the NSA was able to siphon it all away.</p><p>This is going to turn out to be a huge, huge deal, because I think Google, and Yahoo!, and Microsoft, and Facebook are, depending on the company, more and less willing to cooperate with the national security state. They will go through the legal steps. They don't really want to be part of it, but they recognize that, if the government has legitimate court orders, if judges are saying they should do this, they'll do it.</p><p>The idea that the government is going behind their back and stealing all this stuff without any permission from them, without any say-so, is going to drive them crazy. And I think you're going to get a huge amount of resistance and pushback from these tech companies that will no longer sort of roll over and cooperate in the way that they have before, and then will use every method that they have to fight it. And they have-Google in particular-has significant political support in Washington. Congressmen in Washington, regulators in Washington, they don't want to mess with Google. They want Google doing what Google does well.</p><p>And when the big reforms come, NSA is going to pay a price for this, because the tech companies are going to come out against them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>And, to put this in context, we started the Snowden revelation ball rolling with PRISM, which was the program that meant that, oh, guess what-via the FISA core, the NSA can vacuum up metadata from all of these tech companies. But there was some court process for it, and then the numbers that came out of the numbers of requests the companies were getting were in the thousands. So, it was a lot, but it wasn't everything.</p><p>This new revelation means that that all is like a total little jokey sideshow that who even cares about, because outside of any kind of legal process, everything, everything, everything is getting trawled through.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>And is that because there's a loophole for data that's different than phone calls?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I don't know. That's a good question. Is this the same part of the Patriot Act that allows for taking business records that got so completely bent out of shape? Or is this some other justification for the use of metadata, because maybe someone involved is foreign, and so it's justified by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act? I'm not sure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>I think we're headed for-I don't know if we're headed for l a Church Commission level of revelation and peel back of the intelligence committee, but I think we're headed for something.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I'm not sure we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Please.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I'm not sure we are.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Bring it on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Because in this case, if you're going to get outraged, people are going to get outraged about domestic spying on Americans. But I don't know how much Americans really care about Angela Merkel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>No, I don't think they care about Angela Merkel. I think they-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>But what about the idea that none of the data that you thought was in your Gmail or any other of these online big companies that, actually, none of that belongs to them?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You have Congress annoyed. You have the big tech companies annoyed. You have the foreigners annoyed. You're starting to get the judges annoyed. The judges don't like the fact that, when they issue orders, the orders may not be enforced in exactly the way they think. You have the president annoyed. Every constituency here, except the intelligence committee, is really kind of irked at what the intelligence committee is doing.</p><p>And that, to me, suggests that there's enough bubbling that someone may go after it. You have members of both parties. It's a bipartisan issue, because you have a libertarian right and a libertarian left that both do not like what is happening.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah. I mean, could be.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>To be continued.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>We'll see.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>We'll see.</p><p>[Sponsorship]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>And now, the topic that John and Emily are baffled about. We'll see if it actually is a topic. So, there's excitement in New York tabloids this week about the policing polices at two New York City department stores, Barneys and Macy's; Barneys in the midst of two lawsuits, or one lawsuit and one kind of insipient lawsuit brought by black shoppers who said they were detained after shopping at their store in Manhattan. One, in one case, Trayon Christian, a 19-year-old man, had bought a Salvatore Ferragamo-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>You go for it, David. That sounds good enough to me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Let's just say a Ferragamo belt.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah. I think that's best. I leave all pronunciation up to Emily.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>That's safer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>He bought a $350 Ferragamo belt with his Chase debit card on April 29. He then says he was chased down on the street by plainclothes police officers several blocks away, who said he couldn't possibly have afforded to buy the belt, and detained him.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>And that the debit card had to be fake!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yeah. And the debit card was fake, which is just crazy. So, now he's suing both the city, because of the police officers, and then Barneys.</p><p>So, we have not really talked about Stop-and-Frisk and about New York's racial profiling problem much on this show. I suspect we're all pretty leery of it, to varying degrees. But I am interested, particularly having a conversation with you, Emily, about, when is it okay for a private business to engage in profiling practices? If a private business, the standards for a private business are different than they are for a public business. And is it okay for a private business to start singling out particular kinds of shoppers because they suspect them of theft, or they don't want them in the store, or whatever it is?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>No, it's not okay. That's why, when Macy's was accused of this a few years ago, the New York Attorney General investigated, and they entered into a settlement in 2005. So, it's true that private stores are not the government. It's not the same thing as the government engaging in racial profiling. But they are stores that are open to the public; they are not really private. And so for them to be doing this is illegal, if that is indeed what's going on.</p><p>I mean, these lawsuits are a very early stage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right, right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I don't think we completely know what this policy actually was. And there is a dispute between Barneys and the police department about who was doing what here. So, I'm not so sure about the facts. But if they were, indeed, racial profiling in this way, they're going to be in trouble.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>How much cause would they need to have to make it defensible? So, for example, they have records of people who have been either seen shoplifting or caught shoplifting with CCTV, and if they kept a record they could say, \"Well, the profile of the person who shoplifts here is age X and racial profile X. And, therefore, we're totally-we're just following the science here of what we know about who takes things, and that's what led us to pay a little bit more attention to that kind of customer.\"</p><p>Can they make that kind of a defense?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>If every single theft in Barneys was a young black male, and you started profiling young black males, would that be okay? There's no way that is true, right? I mean, that's the problem with racial profiling, is that it always ends up-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Well, I'm not suggesting...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What if it was just young males? Let's take race out of the equation. What if it's just young males?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Then you're profiling on the basis of sex and age.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>When you have a protected category-and age is not so much one, but gender is-and then you start treating people differently based on that category, you have to have an airtight legitimate reason to do that. And I just cannot imagine that they would really have statistics showing that only young black men were stealing stuff from their stores.</p><p>This is why stop-and-frisk fell apart for New York City in the lawsuit against New York City, because, in fact, the statistics showed that it was certainly true that young black men were being disproportionately stopped. But they were not really committing the crimes that justified that extra attention. And that, I bet, is what the pattern would show in Barneys and Macy's, too.</p><p>We kind of want this to be some simple world, and it just never really is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>No, you went beyond the limits of my question which was just whether they have-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I basically rejected the hypothetical as being implausible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>That's not-you're not allowed to reject the hypothetical?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I'm not allowed to do that? So, forget the legal question. I mean, let's just talk about this in policy terms. What would we want the rule to be? If it turns out that there is a much higher risk of young men shoplifting, do you guys think that stores should be able to racial profile, and follow them around, and handcuff them?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Well, I actually think there are two separate issues here. I think there is a racial profiling issue, which is, should they be able to, in the way that they monitor for loss, can they monitor and pay particular attention to young men? I think that's okay.</p><p>The problem that I run into is where that moves into kind of the private army element. The thing that was so deplorable about the Macy's situation a few years ago, Macy's, basically, was running a private prison in their basement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Oh, my God; it was amazing, yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah, they were handcuffing and holding onto them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>They handcuffed people, hold them in cells, and force them-kind of compelled them to pay fines on the spot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>But you assume part of that was just a deterrent, right? I mean, in other words, you make it hellish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>You've got to get the word out, and then people don't steal from you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right. Right. But what alarms me about what's happened in this country is that there are now so many kind of quasi-police, quasi-military organizations. If you're a private-if you think about a company like Exxon, Exxon has a huge security apparatus. Any company has a huge security apparatus. And they accrue quasi-police powers. And what's alarming is when the private industry holds onto the police powers that truly belong to the state.</p><p>So, I don't mind the monitoring and the attention to particular groups, as long as the actual enforcement, and prosecution, and authority remains with the state.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>But wait a second. That is troubling to me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>So, you're this guy who has bought this $350 belt. So, say Barneys thinks that young black men steal their belts, and so they're going to watch him. And then he leaves the store, and, in fact, this guy just bought the belt, so I can't really understand how he attracted the police's attention. But as long as, then, the Barneys employees call the NYPD instead of handcuffing him themselves, you're okay with them detaining someone for two hours who had a receipt and had a debit card? How is that okay?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>No, I mean, that's bad. I guess in that case, that's just bad work by Barneys and by the police.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Well, not necessarily. I mean, someone thought this was a fake card, I guess. I don't know. It's such a weird story. I cannot imagine going into a store, and buying something, and having a receipt, and having someone not believe me. But that's where we are. That's what this story sounds like it's about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You know what's interesting. Sorry-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>There's one thing that I was thinking about, as I was thinking about this: Sometimes, on occasion, very rarely, actually, with sad rareness in my life, I will end up in a poor neighborhood in Washington, or a poor neighborhood in New York, and shop in a place when I might not otherwise shop-a bodega or restaurant. And in a lot of poor neighborhoods, the assumption is of the criminality. The institution is designed around the criminality of customers, such that if you're trying to-if you're in a liquor store in much of DC, you have bulletproof glass between you and whoever is serving you, and between you and the money, and you and the booze.</p><p>Same at various kinds of fast food restaurants. And there's a stark dividing line. If you're in a better off neighborhood, the assumption, of course, is, your customer is your client, and your friend, and so forth. But what's weird is that so many Americans, so many poor Americans, live in a situation where they are constantly being treated as criminals when they shop to begin with.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>But how does that fit with your previous point that monitoring everyone is just fine? I'm still confused.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>My point here is just that it's a sad, terrible state, where store owners feel they have to do this because they've had so much loss and theft, and so they behave in this horrible way toward those customers, but they behave in this horrible way kind of for justified reasons. Either they've been held up, they've been shot at-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Well, but they're also treating everyone equally. Bulletproof glass does not distinguish between you, me, and a black person.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>It seems to me that Macy's and Barney have a lot of other remedies and a lot of other ways they could stop this from happening that don't require profiling. So, for example, on the credit card front, if you were worried about Chase debit cards being counterfeited, you can call up Chase and say, \"Hey, I got this Chase credit card; is this really from you?\"</p><p>And, presumably, if people have been passing fake cards, you would have a legitimate reason based on merely the color of the card; not the color of the owner. So, that's an easy remedy that doesn't require you to go chase the guy down the street.</p><p>How do people shoplift? I thought things always had tags on them and everything. I know those alarms are constantly and always going off. I mean, I guess it's a problem, because both of these stores said they were losing lots of merchandise to theft. But my guess is that they haven't exhausted every other opportunity to stop shoplifting available; this is just kind of maybe a cheaper way to do it.</p><p>[Sponsorship]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Let's go to cocktail chatter. John Dickerson, when you're having a post-Halloween cocktail on the porch of the Dickerson manse, what are you going to chatter about?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I think you need a pre kind of Halloween cocktail the way that Halloween-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah. I like to drink all the way through it, actually, with a little paper cup.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>This is my, I think, second week in a row from Kottke, I think is my-didn't I have one from last week?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You did.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>You did.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Either last week, or the week before.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>You're turning into David Plotz.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Oh, my God. I know, I am turning into David Plotz. And you know how hard-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>I see his head shrieking. Shrinking. Are you becoming a brunette?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>There could be worse things, I guess.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>That air of power and authority-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>This is a story about the Eager Beavers. Did you read this, David, on Kottke?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Oh my god.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Great story.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>So, basically this guy named Jay Zeamer, who was a misfit pilot, he wanted to fly, but he kept kind of flunking-and this was during World War II-and is not good enough to be a pilot. At one point, he's a copilot. He falls asleep in the middle of a run.</p><p>So, he starts doing photo reconnaissance, because that's what they'll let him do, because nobody is really at risk. But he really, really wants to be a pilot. And, basically, what happens is, over the course of his time in the Air Force, he creates this air group of other kind of misfits like him. These are all people who are of kind of-one reason or another, they're kind of oddball characters. And they aren't given a plan because they're oddball, not really proper, pilots.</p><p>So, they build one. They take an old beat up B-17, and they rebuild it, and it flies. So, they're sent on these photo reconnaissance runs. And in between their photo reconnaissance runs, they're apparently fixated on outfitting their B-17 with lots of guns, lots of machine guns and weaponry, because it's kind of this made up airplane, anyway, and so they're just outfitting it with all these different 50 caliber machine guns.</p><p>Okay. So they're sent in June of 1943 over Buka, which is in the Solomon Islands. There's a crucial landing strip that needs to be photographed, and they send these guys out. And when you go out to do photo reconnaissance, even if you're being attacked, you can't move because it messes up the pictures.</p><p>So they go and they get-they watch the Japanese fighter planes come at them, and they don't move. They keep on their trajectory. They take the pictures. Jay Zeamer, who's flying the plane, stays through the first raid of these fighter planes, which shoot it all to hell. A bunch of the guys get shot, and one of them nearly dies, but goes back to his gun, and is able to shoot down one of the planes coming in the second wave of attacks before he actually dies.</p><p>The plane is shot to hell on a second time, but they continue at their trajectory, not evading the people attacking them so that they can take the photographs. In the end, they take the photographs, which turn out to be incredibly useful and important about this landing strip that was later targeted. And the plane is basically barely in the air, and they all make it back, except for this one guy.</p><p>They're all shot to hell. They all have life-threatening injuries, and Zeamer is in the hospital for a year, I think. Anyway, they make it back. The plane lands.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>It's a movie.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>It's a movie. I can't believe there's not a movie.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>And then two guys got Congressional Medals of Honor for it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Zeamer and the guy who died.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Right.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Which happened on no other plane in World War II.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Oh, and my other favorite thing is the bombardier, Joseph Sarnoski, was three days away before this photo mission-was three days away from going home. So, he didn't have to do this incredibly dangerous photo run. But he was like, \"Well, my buddies are doing it, so I'm going to go do it.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Top that, Bazelon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I can't. I am chattering about the I Heart Boobies case. So, these are bracelets that are supposed to raise awareness about breast cancer. There are some kids around the country, I guess, particularly little girls, young girls, who wore these bracelets to school. They got suspended. Supposedly, this was lewd and lascivious speech.</p><p>They got the ACLU to represent them. They went to court. The girls in Easton, Pennsylvania, whose case is the farthest along, won a victory in front of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit last summer. This really should be the end of this case. This is ridiculous. The idea that the word \"boobies\" is lewd at all is crazy. And the idea that this is speech that can be banned from school-I mean, come on. If there's any, any meaning to the sentiment the Supreme Court has expressed that kids and teachers don't check their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate, this has to be that case.</p><p>But this ridiculous school district is actually planning to ask the Supreme Court to hear this case. The Supreme Court will not hear this case. This is a silly case. But what's frustrating to me about all of this is there are some really interesting questions going on about online speech-and particularly really mean online or threatening online speech that kids do off campus, and then parents or the kids themselves bring the printouts or screenshots into school and ask for help.</p><p>And this big burning question for school administrators right now about how much power they have to discipline kids in that circumstance, that's the interesting thing happening. And, meanwhile, we are talking about I Heart Boobies bracelets instead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>All right. My chatter: I was choosing between two different train chatters, so I'm going to choose the one that just rose up in conversation with our colleague, Will Dobson, at lunch today.</p><p>We were talking about, when is it appropriate to give up your seat on the Metro in Washington? And, John, I'm particularly interested talking to you about this. So, we were both being outraged at the general unwillingness of people to give up their seats for the elderly-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Who? When should you give up your seat? You mean for someone older, or pregnant, or who else?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yeah, older or pregnant. But I was expressing the sentiment, the possibly unfashionable chivalric sentiment that when-insofar as I am sitting on a train and there is any woman on the train of any age, I give up my seat for any woman.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Hmm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>There's no circumstances under which I do not give up a seat for a lady.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>And for some women, you'll sit on their lap.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>With pleasure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>What is that? Where did that come from?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I'm just trying to move this along.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>But Will Dobson was like, \"That's ridiculous.\" Will Dobson is like, \"If there is some 24-year-old woman, she's a lot healthier than you are, Plotz. Why would you do that?\"</p><p>And I was saying this is polite society. A man gives up his seat for a lady under all circumstances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I think that's nice and gallant. I'm not going to object to your seat-giving-up practices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>But am I-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>John, what do you do?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Just hopelessly outr\u00e9, or am I out of fashion?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>I don't know. I'm trying to imagine. If there were no seats, and there was just a woman? Yeah. I think I would, yeah. I think that's very good to hear that you do that, David. I don't have any real response to this, other than I think you're probably right.</p><p>I mean, I imagine that I might do the same thing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You're my band of honor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>You know the other thing about this is, I don't actually like sitting that much, so I never understand why it's such-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>I know. I don't sit on trains. I never-the question is moot. I never sit on trains.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>That's the problem for me, too. I know. This is the problem I'm having. I can't imagine myself in this position. I can't-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Come on; so you're not doing something nice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Well, no, it never happens, because I am never sitting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Right. That's my problem, too. So, I can't-but I think that-</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>But I do cast baleful glares at young men who are sitting while there are ladies standing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>So, when you're talking about the train, you're not talking about being on Amtrak for hours. You're talking about the Metro, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Yes, the Metro.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>On Amtrak, they usually don't oversell. There are seats for everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Well, right. But I will say the one thing I want a seat is on Amtrak. And when they do oversell, and I am the odd person out, I get sad. What? That's happened to me recently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Oh, that's sad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>And nobody offers you a seat at all?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>You're an old lady now. You're old.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Why should they? I'm perfectly healthy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>But you're an old lady.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>I'm old. Thank you. Okay, next time, I'll try and play the old card.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>You mean you have to stand for the hour and a half or something?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>No, I usually crouch in the little vestibule part in between. It usually doesn't last the whole time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>We should name this the Crouching in the Vestibule Edition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Oh, my God. I think you have remedies available to you, Emily.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>No, what are they? They're like, \"Sorry.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>You can find the conductor and say, \"Find me a seat,\" and then he'll get the dude who's piled up all of his bags next to him so that he doesn't have to endure the padding of another human.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Plotz: </emphasis>Right. That is a particular form of douchebaggery. It's unbearable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Dickerson: </emphasis>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emily Bazelon: </emphasis>Yeah. That's bad. That's bad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Thanks to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.paulmgarton.com/\">Paul M.

But over all the city has problems the rest of the country would love to have. Start-up technology companies are clamoring for the prestige of a Palo Alto address. The vibrancy of Stanford University keeps the city young and humming.</p><p>  In an election year, with nearly constant squawking from presidential candidates about well-paying jobs, the mayor of Palo Alto has an unusual message for some of the cash-flush tech companies based here: Go away. Please.</p><p>  ''Big tech companies are choking off the downtown,'' Mayor Patrick Burt said. ''It's not healthy.''</p><p>  As one walks down the sidewalks in residential areas, shaded by mature trees and basking in the city's sunny, mild weather, it's not too hard to understand why homeowners are trying to keep Palo Alto small despite its reputation for giving birth to the world's next big thing.</p><p>  Last year, the city of 66,000 people set a cap of less than 1 percent a year on the growth of office space in most of its parts. In the charming downtown, where battalions of tech workers from companies like Amazon stroll the streets, their eyes often glued to their smartphones, the mayor is looking to enforce, in some form, an all-but-forgotten zoning regulation that bans companies whose primary business is research and development, including software coding. (To repeat: The mayor is considering enforcing a ban on coding at ground zero of Silicon Valley.)</p><p>  ''This is crazy,'' said Kate Vershov Downing, a lawyer who lit up the internet this month when she announced that she was quitting the city's planning commission because she was moving someplace cheaper. ''This is Silicon Valley. We've been writing code here for decades.''</p><p>  I interviewed Ms. Downing on Facebook Live, but the connection kept cutting out. Her husband, Steve, works for Palantir Technologies, a software company, and joined the interview.</p><p>  The symbolism of the couple's departure from Palo Alto is poignant: Even a lawyer married to an engineer can't afford Palo Alto. (The median price of a home is around $2.5 million, making it one of the most expensive places in the country.)</p><p>  But as symbols go, it's hard to beat the paradox of bad cellphone reception in the cradle of cutting-edge technology.</p><p>  Brian Reid, a computer scientist and Palo Alto resident, blames ''an unbelievable, fanatical fear of cell towers'' among Palo Alto residents for the somewhat spotty coverage, and he said heavy data usage compounded the problem.</p><p>  Mr. Reid, who lives four doors from the house of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple who died in 2011, remembers the irony in 2007, a time of even worse cellphone coverage, when the iPhone was being introduced. Mr. Jobs had to leave his house to make calls, Mr. Reid said.</p><p>  ''He was trying to sell these phones, but he couldn't use one in his front yard,'' Mr. Reid said.</p><p>  Thomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times.

While not calling the recommendations an \u201cendorsement,\u201d the chamber said those four \u201cwould work to protect and promote local commercial enterprise, big and small, from over-regulation.\u201d</p><p> Chamber President and CEO Judy Kleinberg, a former Palo Alto mayor, said the letter was only intended for the organization\u2019s 600-plus members, to help them support \u201csmart\u201d candidates.</p><p> \u2018Voice for business\u2019</p><p> \u201cThe Chamber of Commerce was formed to be a voice for businesses,\u201d Kleinberg said. \u201cOur role and mission is to educate members of matters that\u2019d impact their business.\u201d</p><p> Kniss said she didn\u2019t know in advance that she would be recommended, and was concerned that the letter divides the candidates into slates, for and against business. She said that to her knowledge, no one is running on a slate, and she said she\u2019s not running on a slate with Fine, McDougall and Tanaka.</p><p> However, candidates Lydia Kou, Arthur Keller and Greer Stone all share the same campaign team.</p><p> The chamber\u2019s letter warned, \u201cOur current mayor has called for a ban on high-tech workers in the downtown district. Some of the current council candidates, if elected, could create a majority on the council to pass such a ban. Such a prohibition would mean businesses with employees who support our local businesses and economy might leave Palo Alto to other cities that are happy to welcome them.\u201d</p><p> No ban</p><p> Mayor Burt, however, hasn\u2019t called for a ban on high-tech workers downtown.</p><p> At a May 16 council meeting, Burt said that tech companies like Amazon and Palantir appeared to be operating in violation of the city\u2019s zoning code. The municipal code for the downtown commercial district lists appropriate office uses as \u201cadministrative office services,\u201d and \u201cmedical, professional and general business offices.\u201d Burt said at that time that while the description of \u201cadministrative offices\u201d could fit downtown, it doesn\u2019t when you add 1,000 software coders.</p><p> In the city, historically, large tech companies were located within the Stanford Research Park, while smaller companies were located in the East Bayshore area, Burt said.</p><p> This left the downtown area for smaller \u201ctraditional\u201d businesses, such as lawyers, insurance companies and other services for residents, he said.</p><p> Burt also said that he wants small start-ups to be in downtown Palo Alto.</p><p> But, Burt wants to be careful in allowing big tech companies to take up residency downtown.</p><p> \u201cOur downtown is a diverse community that\u2019s supported start-ups, but the small guys can\u2019t compete (in buying property) with well funded tech companies,\u201d Burt said.</p><p> Burt said that the comments made about him and his stance on tech workers downtown are unproductive to all of the work the council has done to better downtown.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because (the council and I) have been working hard the past two years to come to a consensus around community and development,\u201d Burt said.</p><p> Burt also said that there are things \u201cfundamentally untrue\u201d in the letter, such as the implications that the other council candidates are anti-business.</p><p> \u201cThey threw everything but the kitchen sink into creating alarm and hysteria \u201cI like to pitch when it\u2019s a sold-out crowd with everybody cheering for me or against me, and that kind of motivates me,\u201d Cueto said through a translator.</p><p> Lester had one of his worst starts of the year at San Francisco on May 21, lasting just 2 2/3 innings in a 5-3 loss. He responded with five consecutive wins and went 15-2 with a 2.38 ERA in his final 23 starts.</p><p> The status of All-Star Eduardo Nunez also was unclear. Nunez missed the wild-card win with a strained right hamstring, and Conor Gillaspie delivered in his absence with a three-run homer in the ninth \u2014 just another example of San Francisco\u2019s even-year magic.</p><p> \u201cCan he start tomorrow? No,\u201d Bochy said while providing an update on Nunez\u2019s status. \u201cBut it\u2019s a five-game series, if we think he can help coming off the bench, maybe start the back end of this series then we probably would activate him.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-15FDF6D827EEBE4B</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28985707A480D6 NWBKCA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KWM-W9X1-JD6S-R1D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Daily Post, L.L.C.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The thing that the reason that Biden is the front runner and the reason that people see this levy of him, every question he was able to bring a background of jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The climate peace. I mean, I worked with him on climate in the White House. He's talked about climate from the point of view of working folks, of working folks' needs. That type of stuff maybe for us and who cares. For a lot of people at home they want to hear that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And so, I just want, listen, we have beat the crap out of Biden after every debate. He deserves a lot more credit tonight.</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: And can I just, on that, you mentioned the moment which was really extraordinary. Towards the beginning when he talked about the fact that he's had obvious incoming from the president against him and against his son. As proof that he can go head to head with the president.</p><p>But he also of course has to win the nomination first. And towards the end that moment with Bernie Sanders was not just, you know, telling him let me interrupt. It was on the substance of one of the most important questions. Which is how are you going to pay for everything and is it realistic? Which is the kind of argument that Senator Klobuchar makes. That Pete Buttigieg makes in the very big divide, the philosophical divide that is this field.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Right.</p><p>BASH: And he did it more clearly with more strength in a more cogent way within that moment with Bernie than I've ever heard.</p><p>CUOMO: Well, two things. First of all, it should be known that Amy Klobuchar is getting a lot more attention from the media than I've seen in debates past.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>BASH: Right. Right.</p><p>CUOMO: She's not the only candidate in the room right now. So, obviously her performance tonight is resonating. Two,</p><p>Axe, I asked this question for a reason. I'm not to disrespect Democrats with the comparing it dead batman into a man with a stick.</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: But you're not having this debate with the president of the United States.</p><p>AXELROD: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: It's not going to go this way.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: And at some point, I know you have to impress the party.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: They have to go through this. They have to go through this.</p><p>CUOMO: But you have to start seeing the kinds of things that will allow you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: Chris, let me assure you this.</p><p>CUOMO: -- to win on that stage.</p><p>AXELROD: Let me assure you this. You have a lot of smart people around these candidates they do a lot of research. And they really probe to see what kinds of messages are going to resonate with voters. And if they thought that the way forward here to distinguish themselves was to go sort of scorched earth against the president, they would have done it.</p><p>I mean, I think they were reading the electorate. And I think that it is baked in the cake the Democrats deeply, deeply dislike Donald Trump and want to beat him. And so, but they need to distinguish themselves from each other. Each of them will claim to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CUOMO: And have a message that touches a little bit of the disaffection --</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: -- that dismisses everything he does because they are worried about something bigger than his behavior.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: And --</p><p>CUOMO: You got to touch that.</p><p>AXELROD: No, no, you do.</p><p>BORGER: Well they did. But they all did it at the beginning when they were talking about impeachment and they were given an opportunity to do that. And to essentially get it out of the way before they started discussing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: The thing about --</p><p>BORGER: -- their differences with each other. But --</p><p>AXELROD: I'm sorry. Go ahead.</p><p>BORGER: No. But they want it to, you know, get that out of the way. Discuss their -- discuss -- and then go into their differences. I just wanted to, if you want to add to that, that's fine. I just want to switch to Bernie Sanders. So, I'll let you go and do that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: Yes. Before you do, because we should do that.</p><p>BORGER: OK.</p><p>AXELROD: But the thing about Joe Biden and the reason why there is a sense that maybe he could be the guy who beats Trump and the reason Trump obviously feels that way because he bought an impeachment trying to retard Biden's progress is that he is culturally akin to many of these disaffected voters.</p><p>BORGER: Sure.</p><p>AXELROD: You're talking about he's an establishment figure but culturally he comes from a different place. And he can speak to the voters in the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CUOMO: And he's talking about spending less money.</p><p>BASH: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: I mean, I know we all hear it all the time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) BASH: That was the --</p><p>CUOMO: Everything costs money that you're hearing from these Democrats. Is that what's going to resonate with people who feel --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: But he also talks about --</p><p>CUOMO: -- that they are giving too much a route.</p><p>AXELROD: The dignity of this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CUOMO: Absolutely, he does.</p><p>AXELROD: And I think a lot of Democrats are insensitive to the sense of estrangement that this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JONES: But Bernie is not.</p><p>AXELROD: -- and disdain that these voters feel.</p><p>BORGER: But Bernie Sanders --</p><p>CUOMO: Look, and the pivot on that is Bernie Sanders had been that candidate up until about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: And he's -- yes.</p><p>CUOMO: -- three months ago where he gets the anger, he gets --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: And he still does. And he still does. But the Medicare for all which has become the talking point of every moderate. Which is you can't pay for it. How are you going to pay for it? I still think it's a real problem for him.</p><p>One thing I want to say about Bernie Sanders tonight who always by the way shows up and he's Bernie Sanders. He is.</p><p>AXELROD: He's done pretty well in that.</p><p>BORGER: The person you expect him to be. But we learned more about Bernie Sanders tonight. It was like his autobiography. He announced that he was proudly Jewish which was --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CUOMO: Proudly Jewish. BORGER: Proudly Jewish. That he lived in Israel.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BASH: I've never heard him --</p><p>BORGER: That he lived in Israel --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: Well, he's sort of --</p><p>BORGER: -- before he said --</p><p>AXELROD: -- making a point about --</p><p>BORGER: Well, before he said, before he said you must be pro- Palestinian as good.</p><p>JONES: It's good.</p><p>BORGER: But this was Bernie -- and I sat there and I thought wow, Bernie Sanders offered some --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: I think we never talk about Bernie Sanders. He's actually doing pretty well in this polling. He's actually picked up and the fact is Bernie Sanders is as consistent --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: Exactly.</p><p>[23:05:02]</p><p>AXELROD: -- as consistent can be. You know what he's going to say. I will say he's like a Billy Joel concert, you know, you hear the hits from the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s. Everybody knows the words and they sing along. But they love it and the (Inaudible) has got a very devoted following.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: And that's comforting. And that's comforting.</p><p>BASH: But there is something -- there is something that's new. And I'm going to sing from Van Jones song sheet right now. And that is the ascendants, I wouldn't say, you know, very, very high but certainly enough to get him on this debate stage of Andrew Yang. Andrew Yang has very similar messaging. Not entirely. A very similar messaging on the forgotten man and woman to Bernie Sanders. But he does it in such a different kind of person --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) CUOMO: Dana and I experienced it firsthand. He was talking about the biggest industrial revolution, you know, right now our fourth industrial revolution. What it means for young people.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: What they need. And the cheap seats.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: Up top where the younger people were a lot of the students were loving it.</p><p>BASH: Exactly.</p><p>CUOMO: Yet Bernie breaks in because he realizes this is my lane. Says I want to go back and talk about the environment for a second. And they didn't like it. There were moans and groans.</p><p>AXELROD: Andrew Yang is at third place among young votes. He is competing with Bernie Sanders for the vote.</p><p>BASH: Yes.</p><p>AXELROD: And the way he talks about the economy is actually different because of what you said.</p><p>JONES: Right.</p><p>AXELROD: Because his explanation for what's going on is a very contemporary one.</p><p>CUOMO: And a private sector one.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: He has a real acumen of what works in the economy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BASH: Absolutely. He does it with that but it's actually quite accessible.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>JONES: He is a threat to Pete in ways that I don't think we understand. He shows when Pete is telling. In other words, Pete tonight he got a little bit rattled. He was a little -- he was punching back Pete for a while. He did fight back. But he wasn't that optimistic happy warrior that he started with. He was a little bit more grim and determined. He needs to show that backbone but he was a little bit dower.</p><p>Andrew Yang brought the light. He brought the joy, he brought the funny. But he also brought really, really fresh ideas. Watch what happens with him. People have underestimated him from the very beginning. I think that he's doing something very, very extraordinary.</p><p>AXELROD: I think part of the difference --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: Well, he's not -- he's not --</p><p>AXELROD: Go ahead.</p><p>BORGER: He's not talking from talking points.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: This is somebody who is clearly thought about things. Digested things. Written a book as he told us. It's now going to be in all our mailboxes. But he is somebody who didn't just run for president because he wanted to be famous. He had ideas.</p><p>JONES: Ideas he's running on.</p><p>BORGER: And he had beliefs.</p><p>JONES: He has cause he's fighting for.</p><p>BORGER: And he decided OK, I'm going to give it a shot and he's the one who seems to be the most surprised and he's a joyful warrior.</p><p>JONES: Joyful.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AXELROD: He also mention he also speaks so I think authentically and movingly about his special needs' child. And I have a special needs child myself and I deeply, deeply appreciate it.</p><p>CUOMO: That was a huge point. Because when Yang said today, I mean talk about sometimes things hit you even though we've been through this so many times, so many iterations as journalists. Where it hits you with your own personal experience. When he said hey, I don't know how many of you are in schools out there, but having special needs is the new normal in this country.</p><p>AXELROD: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: Boy, if you have a kid in public or private school, do you know that that is the truth? That there's such an expanded understanding. But it hasn't been met by our cultural understanding and how we deal with education. He was on point about that.</p><p>Now to the point that everybody seemed strong tonight, the mayor from South Bend had people coming at him in two directions. He had women candidates coming at him. And it was a test of how he deals with it. It's good to know. Let's see if it's the same magic of where I make the suggestion creates the candidate. And sure enough, here he is. Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good to be with you.</p><p>CUOMO: So tonight, on that stage, we've been saying we think you guys were at your best tonight.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: Is that about less seats for you? Is that about you knowing who Mayor Pete the candidate is? To what do you ascribe strong great performance tonight.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, it certainly feel like our campaign our message continues to get stronger as we go. And I think the contrasts among us are coming into focus as well. What you've got up there is a good faith contest among different ideas, different world views, different experiences. Each of us making the case for why what we bring would be the best.</p><p>My focus of course is on making that we are capable of defeating Donald Trump so resoundingly that it puts an end not just to the Trump White House but to Trumpism. And realizing that this is by definition not just a contest for the nomination, it's a contest to be the president for the day after Trump.</p><p>And focusing on policies that are going to solve the big problems. And do it in a way that can actually unify a frighteningly divided and polarized American people.</p><p>CUOMO: So, let's shadow a couple of the swings that were taken at you tonight. Amy Klobuchar, fair criticism that part of the downside of your, look, I'm not part of this Washington, D.C. insider game is the criticism she made that you don't respect our collective experience enough. You haven't been here to do it that's why you don't understand it. Fair criticism?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think the suggestion is that I don't understand the ways of Washington. Realities that I understand them, I just don't accept them. The American people are fed up with the way things are going in Washington. And I think we need to bring change. It might just be a good idea for that change to come from outside the beltway.</p><p>[23:10:03]</p><p>CUOMO: Her follow was he's smart, he's good. He doesn't win big enough. He won statewide. He didn't make it. He tried to be head of the party, he didn't make it. fair point?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well here's the beauty of caucus, primary and election process. The best way to settle the question of whether you can win is to win.</p><p>CUOMO: Wine cave Pete. It's not the catchiest thing but it's working on Twitter right now. Let me play you a little sound for about that exchange. You take us through it from your perspective. BUTTIGIEG: Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I'm literally the only person on the stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire.</p><p>Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Now supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit. I know this isn't likely but stay with me -- and decided to go on to Peteforamerica.com and give the maximum allowable by law, $2,800. Would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No. I would be glad to have that support.</p><p>WARREN: I do not sell access to my time.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Hold on a second.</p><p>WARREN: I don't do call time, it's millionaires and billionaires --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Sorry, as of when, Senator? Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak is funded in part by money you transferred having raised it at those exact same big-ticket fundraisers you now denounce.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO: Now, you did your homework on this.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: You knew the record. You knew it was going to come at some point. It came tonight. But you can't -- it's not good enough to be in a who's worse situation. What is your take about money in your campaign and how you get it and what the truth is of the reality of politics?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well first of all, I'm the mayor of South Bend. That's not known as an establishment fundraising power house. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't worked a way to build grassroots support.</p><p>We got the better part of a million individuals who have given to this campaign. And last time I check our average contribution was 32 bucks. But I'm not going to define my campaign about who we exclude or who we reject.</p><p>This is a moment where we've got to bring together all of the resources that we can. Because I can tell you over on the other side, Donald Trump and his buddies they are not going to tie one hand behind their back. They've already put together over $300 million in order to keep their grip on power. They're just getting warmed up.</p><p>So, we got to go to this with everything that we've got. And the problem with this purity test is they distract from the effort to make sure that all of us bring everything that we can to the ultimate goal which is to defeat Donald Trump and set up the era that's going to come next.</p><p>CUOMO: All right. To the pros. Dana?</p><p>BASH: Well, I'm just curious about your prep for this. Because you knew that you had the incoming. You knew that you were going to get attacked from all of these opponents. I think you thought it was going happen the last debate. This time it happened. And you were ready to go.</p><p>I mean, did it feel different? Are we right about the fact that you clearly prepped in a big way for all of the -- and it's not just attack.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yes.</p><p>BASH: It was the specifics from the fundraising to from Senator Warren to the fact that your experience is a, you know, very limited from Senator Klobuchar.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: So, I think the bottom line is when you're doing well, folks might attack you. But you've just got to be ready to respond. I want to make sure that when my campaign or my ideas are attacked, I defend them. And you know, I think it's an honest debate up there about different ideas, different approaches. But I did think it was important that we move past the purity test, especially if they're coming from folks who wouldn't be able to pass them themselves.</p><p>BORGER: Well, when you said it was an honest debate, though. At one point you turn to Senator Warren and said, wait a minute, you're a millionaire and you're -- so, is she a hypocrite on this?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, my point is demonizing donors because they're millionaires is a strange thing to hear from a Democratic millionaire. I don't fault her. I don't have anything against her for having become wealthy. I'm saying that you can't say that and then contend that your campaign is somehow corrupted if you ever get support from wealthy Democrats.</p><p>CUOMO: Now the interesting thing here is, look, we all get the debate. We've heard it had, you know, for a generation and a half. I asked all of you guys the same question. When you were up there listening to it, do you guys think that you have your head on the fight that you're about to have when you get out of this.</p><p>Of course, every party has purity tests, we've all seen it. You've come to the convention. There's got to be a move back to the center because you have to be competitive.</p><p>This race is going to be different, Mr. Mayor. This man is the most judgment proof politician within his own party we've ever seen. BUTTIGIEG: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: He can say and do whatever he wants. He will lose no one. You will not have that advantage. You will not have Democrats behind you that way. Do you believe the Democrats are ready for the fight you or someone will be in?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I think we know what we're up against. And so, I do believe that we cannot only rally Democrats together. But am meeting so many independents and a lot of folks who I'd like to think of this future former Republicans. They come up to me at events. I meet them all the time who would ordinarily vote Republican.</p><p>[23:15:05]</p><p>I'm not tricking them. They know that we disagree on quite a few things. But they know that the biggest thing we've got to do right now as a country is bring an end to the Trump presidency and restore some level of decently to the White House.</p><p>CUOMO: Disagreement with decency was on display there tonight. Do you think you can do that opposite President Trump?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Look, the reality is you can't deal with Trump by having some kind of equal and opposite energy. You've got to be able to absorb and redirect and change the energy he throws at you. If you're playing his game, if you're on his show, even when you're winning, you're losing by definition.</p><p>And so, what is going to take is to bring at every turn. I mean, when he lies, we got to call it out. When he does some wrong, we got to confront it.</p><p>CUOMO: When he bullies you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yes, sure. You got to stand up for yourself. But you've got to deny him his signature quality which is the ability to change the subject. Because I believe every election is about this question.</p><p>From a voter's perspective, how is my life going to be different if you are president instead of you? We have the better answers on that on issue after issue from wages to paid family leave to health. To even areas where my party has been on defense in the past like guns and immigration. The American people are with us. Which is exactly why he needs us talking not about their lives but about him.</p><p>CUOMO: We're pointing out, Gloria pointed out, Dana pointed it out. Of course, the men were oblivious to it when you were each asked would you give a gift or ask for forgiveness. The women only said they'd ask for forgiveness. The rest of you were about the gifts.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: You know, I notice that too.</p><p>BORGER: We did.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And it's a -- I think there's an expect -- let me say this. Obviously, we, you know, we can each have our part in the debate, throw in elbow, defend ourselves. But no woman should ever have to apologize for being fired up.</p><p>JONES: That's right.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: For being angry. Especially about what's going on right now.</p><p>JONES: That's right.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Or for getting hot under the collar. We all do. And it is very gendered. It's expected of men. As a matter of fact, it's probably the case as a male candidate that you'd be viewed as having something kind wrong with you if you didn't get hot enough under the collar.</p><p>And one of the many effects we still have in sexism in our politics is quite likely a different set of expectations for female candidates and leaders.</p><p>CUOMO: Well, you saw two great female leaders up there tonight holding their own setting pace some of the times. So certainly, you guys have that part of the mix.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Women rights is what I'm actually going to say.</p><p>CUOMO: Right. Don. Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. Best for the holidays you and your husband and your family.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: We'll see you again soon.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: Congratulations on tonight.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Thanks very much.</p><p>BORGER: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: All right. Let's take a little bit of a break. We've been lucky here. We had two of the people who made very strong cases, and Senator Klobuchar and, of course, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>We're going to take a breather. When we come back, we'll have more coverage live from Los Angeles. We're trying to choral the candidates and figure out what resonated tonight. So, stay with CNN.</p><p>[23:20:00]</p><p>CUOMO: All right. We're back here in Los Angeles with our continuing coverage of the sixth Democratic debate. It was strong tonight. There was disagreement with decency. Is that the winning message for Democrats?</p><p>One of the people who certainly made gain today especially if you ask Van Jones but only because he wants to give himself credit for knowing that Andrew Yang would make a move. And now he joins us.</p><p>Andrew Yang, thank you very much. So, your analysis. Fewer people up there is that the end of the analysis of why people seemed on their game tonight? Or do you think it's also finding your footing?</p><p>ANDREW YANG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was a different dynamic. I have to say seven is a lot more compacted than 10. And so, you felt like the ball was going to come to you pretty quickly each time. I certainly enjoyed this dynamic much more.</p><p>CUOMO: Forget about better worse, smarter or less. Why do you think you speak about economics and movement of industry and evolution of industry in a different way than other people up there?</p><p>YANG: Well, I spend seven years running a national non-profit that helped create thousands of jobs in primarily the Midwest and the south. So, doing that work led me to see firsthand the impact of automation in many of these communities.</p><p>It's a little bit like if you want to try and convince some of the climate change you might bring them to a glacier in Alaska. If you want to convince some about the impact of automation you might bring them to Detroit or Cleveland or one of those cities.</p><p>So, I did that work for seven years, plus I'm a numbers guy. And they numbers are staggering. I also understand technology much better than the other candidates, frankly. And technology is now transforming our economy in more and more powerful and fundamental ways.</p><p>CUOMO: How do you deal with the fact that the reality of the tech sector of the private sector is often ahead of government?</p><p>YANG: No. My gosh.</p><p>CUOMO: But it's about you've got to speak their language. And you have to understand. Look, Schwarzenegger has a great quote on this. That he was used to getting things done in the private sector investing, moving and not just movies. He got in the government and he learned I've got to speak their language. I've got to build a coalition of where their heads are at on this or there is no progress. How do you do that?</p><p>YANG: Well, we all know that D.C. is 25 years behind on technology. We literally got rid of the office of technology assessment in 1995. So, we have to play catch up as quickly as possible.</p><p>Because with the rate of change you can't afford to be decades behind the curve. You might have been able to get away with that at earlier points in our history. But it's gone from being dangerous to disastrous very, very quickly.</p><p>I believe I can help us play catch up. And when I sat with the technologists in Silicon Valley some of them said something to me that you would not expect. They said we actually need government regulation and government input on this because we're making these decisions that we should not be making.</p><p>And one of them actually said that all of their incentives on artificial intelligence are going as fast as possible, and eventually they're going to do something deeply, deeply problematic if that's their incentive.</p><p>CUOMO: Now I want to open it up to the floor of the better minds here. But two things I thought really stood out tonight. One is that you said something that's so true for parents. You have a kid who's on the autism spectrum, has special needs you said, but that's the new normal. Is that everybody seems to need something.</p><p>Boy, that resonated with the room even with me has a kid -- with kids in lower school, middle school and high school.</p><p>[23:24:58]</p><p>But then you were ready. Of course, you were the only minority group represented, although you could really add women in that. You were ready for the question. You immediately turned it away from yourself in a way that was very non-normal for a politician.</p><p>And you had statistics ready to telescope the issue into an argument about African-American, Latino and emerging. So, you knew it was coming. Why go that way? Let me play it in case people missed it at here.</p><p>YANG: Sure.</p><p>CUOMO: Here's what I'm talking about.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YANG: It's both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>YANG: I grew up the son of immigrants and I had many racial epithets used against me as a kid. But black and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers.</p><p>The average net worth of a black household only 10 percent that of a white household. for Latinos it's 12 percent. These are the numbers that define race in our country. And the question is why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage?</p><p>Fewer than 5 percent of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) YANG: The way we fix it -- the way we fix this is we take Martin Luther King's message of a guaranteed minimum income, a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans. I guarantee if we had a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, I would not be the only candidate of color on the stage tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO: The Yang gang in full effect in the cheap seats of the students. When you said that you were mothing (Ph) it up. Making America think harder. Why did you instead of doing what a lot of politicians would do which was kind of milk it. You know, about what it means about me and this is about me. And I'm an Asian-American and this is what about our way. You telescoped it. Why?</p><p>YANG: Well, I would never put my experience growing up Asian-American and somehow frame that as representative of the experience of over 120 million Americans of color. Particularly because the Asian-American experience is distinct from the black experience and the Latino experience.</p><p>And it was 100 percent natural for me to try and give that perspective. No one wants to hear a sob story about some Asian kid, you know, getting like picked on for being scrawny. I mean, frankly, like no one cares. And they shouldn't care. Maybe they should care a tiny bit. Because I've got two Asian kids who are also, you know, a little bit scrawny.</p><p>CUOMO: Let's see whatever -- what's the rest of the floor have here?</p><p>BASH: I actually do have a question. At the very beginning of the debate, the questions were about impeachment. And I spent time with you in Iowa last month. You mention this to me there and you said it again now and it's even more relevant. And that is the Democrats are spending way too much time on impeachment.</p><p>Now that the president has been impeached and it's heading to the Senate for a trial do you still feel that way?</p><p>YANG: I've been campaigning non-stop since we spent time together in Iowa.</p><p>BASH: Yes.</p><p>YANG: I can't even remember anyone asking me a question about impeachment.</p><p>JONES: Right.</p><p>YANG: Americans are not focused on this in the same way that the networks are. And to me, there's just a crucial number of zero. That's the number of Republicans that have signaled that they are going to cross party lines and you need 20 in the Senate. So, until that number becomes greater than zero, unfortunately, this does seems like a foregone conclusion.</p><p>BASH: And it's -- and do you still think it's hurting your party and whomever the candidate who goes up against Trump will be?</p><p>YANG: I was disappointed that I seem to have the lone difference of opinion up there where everyone else was signaling impeachment, impeachment. And when I talk to Americans a lot of them are saying look, I don't care as much about impeachment as the fact that I'm choosing between my drugs and my heating oil. Or that my kid is depressed. Like those are the issues that voters tell me that they are focused on rightfully so.</p><p>BORGER: But you say -- you said you will have to stop being obsessed. Was the word you used. Obsessed over impeachment. Is that the media you're saying as obsessed as impeachment? I mean, this is the President of the United States who was impeached yesterday by the House.</p><p>CUOMO: It's OK. They can take it.</p><p>BORGER: Yes, you can, you know.</p><p>YANG: No, no. Well, you can't blame a TV network for saying impeachment is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BORGER: No, no.</p><p>YANG: -- like the news of the day like all the time.</p><p>BORGER: Sure.</p><p>YANG: Like -- and it is historic. As a candidate running for president, I need to be talking about things that are different from impeachment.</p><p>BORGER: Do you think it will it affect votes of moderates who might vote Republican might vote Democrat. I mean, do you see it affecting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YANG: What I see it doing --</p><p>BORGER: -- the election?</p><p>YANG: -- is reinforcing polarization. And it's also a missed opportunity for candidates to present a unifying vision of the country that can peel off people who are independent or disaffected Trump voters.</p><p>AXELROD: So, Andrew, you're making a marketing argument. And you're making -- and it's a sensible one. But what do you do -- I mean, there's a constitutional argument as well.</p><p>[23:30:00]</p><p>And do you not pursue so blatant violations of the constitution on the oath of office, if you -- if there's not an interest among in the market for it? I mean, where do you draw the line? How do you make those judgments?</p><p>ANDREW YANG, AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR AND PHILANTHROPIST, 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm pro-impeachment. I think that, Nancy Pelosi did the right thing by moving it forward. I will -- would say that I would be much more excited about impeachment if they manage to wrangle a Republican or two, before they decided to leave the station. Because it is a very poor message to the country where you have -- virtually all the Democrats on one side and virtually all the Republicans on the other. But -- I agree that Democrats did the right thing by moving forward.</p><p>VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: A lot of people are talking about impeachment. Nobody is talking about artificial intelligence and the actual national security threat that China's moving in that direction poses. Nobody is talking about putting real cash in people's pockets. People talking about jobs, people got a bunch of jobs and it ain't got no money.</p><p>You were somebody who brought completely fresh thinking. Because you are so future focused. But you also have this grip on American history as well. And you're starting to move. Why are you -- why do you think you've been able to survive? You have now out lasted governors, Senators. Billionaires. People in the House of Representatives. People who are household names are not on that stage. You are on the stage. Why?</p><p>YANG: I think, because we're having a conversation that Americans recognize. As the truth of what's happening in their community. We blasted away 40,000 manufacturing jobs in Iowa alone. And Iowa went to Trump by eight points. And this is playing out now on main streets around the country where Amazon is closing 30 percent of our stores and malls and being a retail clerk, the most common job in this communities. I have had the same message the entire time. And it's broken through to the American people that these are the real problems and we have real solutions.</p><p>JONES: You have got support from somebody who I didn't think you would ever get the support of. I didn't think any politician would, Donald Glover. You know, Childish Gambino, a hip hop legend. He comes out, he doesn't come out for Cory Booker. He doesn't come out for Kamala Harris. He doesn't come out for Obama, Biden. He comes out for you. And more are coming. There is something that is being shift around you. How did you get Childish Gambino on the Yang gang?</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: You stole my question.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Go ahead we know --</p><p>YANG: This is a thrill for me. Because I'm a huge Donald Glover fan. I was like, no way. This is crazy. So, someone on his team reached out to an agent that we knew in common and then said hey, next time you're in L.A. Donald wants to sit down with you. And we talk about our concerns and vision for the future. And we found that we were very, very aligned. And then from there we talk about different ways to collaborate. And I'm thrilled to be working with someone who sees the future as clearly as Donald does.</p><p>JONES: You're starting to steal from different parts of the Democratic Party coalition. Moderate, young blacks and others. I just think that I'm proud to see that you're starting to prove with a smaller stage you can get your argument across.</p><p>CUOMO: Let's see where it goes. Andrew Yang, the best to you and your family for the holidays.</p><p>YANG: Thank you all. You too.</p><p>Huge fan of these people. Real pros.</p><p>CUOMO: And just as a point of fact, not a little guy, 6'2, about 200 pounds. Not a little guy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>All right. We are going to take a break right now. After we take the break we are going to come back. Part of our live coverage will be, another candidate who made a lot of head way on the stage tonight, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Next. Stay with CNN. Thank you.</p><p>[23:35:00]</p><p>CUOMO: All right. A very strong night here at the sixth Democratic debate here at LMU in Los Angeles. We're joined by Senator Elizabeth Warren. Thank you.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), 2020 U.S. DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: In advance Merry Christmas for you and the family.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: It was an interesting night tonight. One of the skills, a great debater must have is how to change a perceived negative into a positive. You did that several times. One that stood out was this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Warren, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated. I'd like you to weigh in as well.</p><p>WARREN: I'll also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO: It's always good when the candidate is pleased with their own answer.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WARREN: I was enjoying the laughter.</p><p>CUOMO: The meaning of age, of viability, of strength. What have you learned about what it takes to win and lead?</p><p>WARREN: You know, I think of this in the context of this historic moment. The president of the United States was just impeached yesterday. And he was impeach, because of corruption. It's been going on throughout his administration, right?</p><p>He's had ambassador ships for sale. His been helping out his wealthy buddies. He goes around the government. He puts everyone's interest ahead of the interest of the people of the United States of America. And I think, the way that Democrats are going to be able to beat Donald Trump is to draw a sharp contrast on that as possible.</p><p>So, he's the corrupt one, we have to be able to say credibly we're out there fighting for the American people. We're fighting for folks who are struggling to pay student loans. We are fighting for the folks who can't rustle up child care. We are fighting for the folks who can't pay their medical bills. That's the distinction between us.</p><p>CUOMO: One policy point. One political point. We will open it on the floor. On the political side, you were talking to Pete Buttigieg tonight -- and I use the verb talking, because there was disagreement with decency. WARREN: Yes.</p><p>CUOMO: And I think that was good for the audience to see certainly ever (inaudible) to us. The idea of how he gets his money. He was ready for you to say that and he came back at you about what you've done in the past. And you are no different than he is. And why would you ignore the reality of the system. Were you ready for his response and do you think he made a good point?</p><p>WARREN: You know. I just fundamentally disagree. When I made the decision to get into this race, it was because I see a government that for decades has worked a little better and a little better and little better for those with money.</p><p>[23:40:10]</p><p>And worked worse and worse for everyone else. Look at one of the economy questions we got that I was waving my hand on. And didn't get to talk about. But the fact that GDP going up in this country. Record corporate profit. Yes, no kidding, you know why? It didn't happen just because of gravity. It happened because government just piece at a time made the world just a little nicer.</p><p>CUOMO: But those are the rules. So did you. He transferred that money the same way I did.</p><p>WARREN: Why did the rules just keep working better and better and better for those folks in a democracy?</p><p>CUOMO: Because money wins in Washington.</p><p>WARREN: Because money wins in Washington. We have to be willing and ready to credibly make the case that that's not who we are.</p><p>CUOMO: Are you better than Pete when it comes to money in the campaign?</p><p>WARREN: I have made it clear since the day I got in this race, my time is not for sale.</p><p>CUOMO: Is his?</p><p>WARREN: I don't hold close door fundraisers.</p><p>CUOMO: That was wasn't close door, you know, there was full representatives of sort of a media there.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, not at the dinner.</p><p>CUOMO: Oh, yes there was.</p><p>WARREN: No, I don't think that's right. I don't think there were people in the dinner.</p><p>CUOMO: The pool there was a pool there to cover it.</p><p>WARREN: The dinner, they were serving, the $900 wine. That is my understanding. They were at a reception but not at the dinner. And when the 50 donors who got the $900 bottle of wine in the wine cave --</p><p>CUOMO: So, you think having media there in the front part is not enough? It should be open the whole time.</p><p>WARREN: It means that nobody knows what was said behind closed doors.</p><p>CUOMO: I hear you on that.</p><p>WARREN: Now, he's opened his fundraisers right?</p><p>He said he opened them before that. But look, this is about how we're going to behave as Democrats. And whether we're going to be able to say credibly to the American people, I'm not here to fight for the billionaires. I'm not here to fight for the big corporations. I'm here to fight for a family like yours. I'm here to fight for your family.</p><p>JONES: How do you respond though when Pete says, you're a millionaire? You are a millionaire. Are you saying if I take money from you, I'm corrupt? I didn't hear you respond to that. If I run for office, but I will never will and I took money from you, would I be corrupt? WARREN: I said, I don't sell access to my time. So whether you give me $5 or whatever is the maximum. I'm not spending my time doing call time. I'm not spending my time having private conversations with you.</p><p>JONES: Are you worried about these whole idea --</p><p>WARREN: I'm selling a photograph for $5,000.</p><p>JONES: Well said. But are you worried, you know, when he says a thing, when he says thing purity test. That resonates with me. I do feel that there's something begin to happen in the party where you got to be pure on every issue, you got to be above and a lot of people start feeling left out and excluded by your kind of populism which can sometimes sound elitist? Would that make sense to you?</p><p>WARREN: You know, that's now how I see it. I don't think the American people are looking for purity. I think they are looking for someone who is trying. And that's what I'm doing. I'm out there trying. I said, I'm going to run a campaign from grass roots donation. I suppose that point I' supposed to say, please go to Elizabeth Warren.com and pitch in 5 bucks if you think that's how a campaign should run. I do call time. Do you know who I called in my last call time? A couple of people who gave 5 bucks each. Somebody who gave 20 bucks. Because --</p><p>AXELROD: Senator, you didn't answer Chris's question which is for six years you did raise money that way.</p><p>WARREN: Sure.</p><p>AXELROD: Did you feel corrupted by the money you were raising?</p><p>WARREN: I saw what it is that people expect in return. And I also understand --</p><p>AXELROD: But you didn't give it.</p><p>WARREN: I understand that the American people who watch this government worked better and better and better. For giant corporations and for rich people. Want to hear someone who credibly can say I will take on the billionaires. I will fight to beat back the influence of money in Washington. I'm building a grass roots movement and you know what the number one thing we start with this, is anticorruption. I'm the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. And it's about campaign contribution and so much more.</p><p>AXELROD: One last question.</p><p>WARREN: Sure.</p><p>AXELROD: He made -- the point he made at the end was the amount of money that is going to be thrust behind the Trump campaign and the Republican campaign. It's probably going to be historic. And is it responsible to disarm in the face of that and limit the amount of money that you can raise and spend?</p><p>CUOMO: Buttigieg said the Democrats are going to tie one hand behind their back if they continue on your road.</p><p>WARREN: Look, I have never asked other Democrats who are running against a Republican to unilaterally disarm. I don't believe in doing that. But I'm telling you how I run my campaign. I'm running it with the grass roots movement. Because here's the thing, you can only spend so much money on TV ads versus TV ads. So much money on internet ad vs. Internet ads. Do you know what our comparative advantage it's going to be as Democrats?</p><p>[23:45:16]</p><p>It's going to be the grass roots movement we build. The one thing that beats out the fake stuff that comes in over the internet or that comes across the air waves. It's face to face. It's hearing from the neighbor. It's somebody who knocks on your door. Somebody who makes a phone call. It's somebody who reaches out, at your church or somebody reaches out while you're waiting at the bus stop for the kids to get picked up for school.</p><p>We have to do this by grass roots movement. If we are going to take this country back and make it work for the people. We got to build this one from the bottom up. And here's the thing. Here's why I'm so joyous at this moment. We have an opportunity in 2020 that's not like an opportunity we have seen in a long, long time. Donald Trump has taken a corrupt system and made it so much more corrupt. That millions of people are now off the sideline. Millions of people are saying I'm in the fight and the door has opened a crack. When the door opens a crack, put your shoulder down and run hard it and let's make (inaudible).</p><p>CUOMO: All right, let me take this crack in the door right now. Dana, you have another question?</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: OK.</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Dana.</p><p>BASH: Hi, So, big picture, the fight, the debate over who the nominee is going to be is still very much a philosophical one. Is it you or somebody like you who talks about revolutionary ideas and making sweeping change? Or somebody who says that's not realistic, we will not win because the Republicans the president will destroy us with ideas like that. Do you feel now that the debate stage was smaller, you know, we're getting closer to the actual votes. How do you think that that debate is playing out right now?</p><p>WARREN: So, I think what's unrealistic is to offer more of the same businesses as usual. And think you're going to inspire people to get out and vote.</p><p>BASH: But some people are scared. If they're not hard core Democrat. And they are thinking, I don't like Donald Trump, I might be interested in a Democrat. And what Elizabeth Warren is saying scares me. What do you say?</p><p>WARREN: I'm thinking of Democrats, independents and Republicans. Who are ready for an anticorruption bill? I'm not talking about folks in Washington. I'm talking about folks across these nation. Democrats, independents and Republicans who support a two cent wealth tax? Democrats, independents and Republicans who want to see us increase social security payment. I have got that $200 a month for everybody on social security and disability. Start with the things that we agree on. That's how we can win. We can win the Democrats. We can win the independents and we are going to scratch off a lot of the Republicans.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: How about those Democrats who don't want to give up the healthcare that they have? For a Medicare for all plan. Which would make them change. I mean, aren't they scared of that maybe what Dana's referring to.</p><p>WARREN: Look, 36 million Americans didn't have a prescription filled last year. Because they can't afford it. And a lot of those people have health insurance. But people are just getting crushed by the deductibles, by the co-pays. Fees are going up. Expenses that are not covered. So, here's my plan, as to say as president, I will do as much as I can as quickly as I can for as many people as I can. I'll tell you what, I'm going to start with -- I'm going to start by standing up to the big drug companies. I'm going to bring down the cost of Epipen and insulin. That going to (inaudible).</p><p>BORGER: What if I don't want to change my plan?</p><p>WARREN: That's where we are going to start. That's going to save people hundreds of millions of dollars across this country.</p><p>JONES: I have a question about the --</p><p>CUOMO: You changed on this though, do you acknowledge that? That you have changed the sell on your plan to meet concerns that are expressed here about price tag and about musts. I think the most recent iteration Senator was, we are going to try this if people want to try this then they can. Optionality as opposed to, yes, you have to give up your insurance. Yes, it has to be this way. Was that intentional? Or you just give in to the pushback.</p><p>WARREN: I support Medicare for all. This has been my transition plan since I first laid it out. It's to give the maximum amount of help to the maximum number of people as quickly as we can. And to do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one penny.</p><p>JONES: Hey, listen, I do think that I like that sales pitch better. So, it's under lying thing is good. It sound better when you say it now. But you keep talking about corruption, corruption, corruption. Do you think that Joe Biden now is wounded by this Burisma, the whole thing? They seem to be trying to tag Joe Biden as corrupt. Do you think that because of the fire that he's taking, that he is now incapable of leading this anticorruption effort the way you are?</p><p>[23:50:05]</p><p>WARREN: But I think that what the president has tried to do to Joe Biden is despicable. And I think most Americans agree with that.</p><p>JONES: But has it wounded him?</p><p>WARREN: I don't think so. I don't think so. I think Joe is strong on this point. But understand this, when we talk about corruption in the system, we have to talk about whether or not someone is going to be willing to stand up to the big drug companies, to stand up to big ag.</p><p>JONES: But not just willing in fact, but willing in terms of their images, in terms of the peoples' understanding. So, Joe Biden has a son that did take a job that seems kind of weird, and does that make him less -- is he now incapable of carrying the argument to the American people, I'm against corruption because of his son?</p><p>WARREN: Look, as I've said from the beginning, we're going to have to make a credible argument that we are willing to stand up to giant corporations --</p><p>JONES: Can Biden do it?</p><p>WARREN: I think that I am the best person to do this. This is why I'm running for president. And remember this, because you and I know this. We've been talking about this. This is what I talked about on the first day I ran for president.</p><p>JONES: And before that.</p><p>WARREN: And before that. I put out the biggest anticorruption plan since Watergate. Because the problem of money in Washington, sure, it's about campaign contributions, but it is also about lobbying and lawyers, and P.R. firms and bought and paid for experts and so-called think tanks that just keep pushing Congress in exactly one direction. And that is just a little something for the rich. Just a little exception for the well-to-do, just a little nibble, a few word changes for the giant banks, for big AG, for big tech.</p><p>And understand this. People talk about gridlock in Washington. There's no gridlock in Washington. Keep in mind that when they wanted to pass a tax break of a trillion and a half dollars, got it, done in no time at all. Five weeks? Six weeks? But here's the deal. They don't pass anything else. Why? Because not passing anything helps big oil. Even though we see climate change bearing down on us.</p><p>Not passing anything helps big pharma, because they just keep charging prices that are through the roof. Not passing anything helps the gun industry, because that means we're not fighting back. All of it, over and over and over is about an unwillingness to confront money and power in Washington. It's time to make this government work not for those at the top but everyone else and that's why I'm in this race.</p><p>AXELROD: Can I just ask one thing?</p><p>WARREN: Sure.</p><p>AXELROD: Just about this Biden thing, why do you think the president went to such extraordinary lengths to sully Joe Biden, the lengths that have landed him now in front of you as a juror under impeachment? Why did he feel Biden was such a threatening candidate? WARREN: You know, look, I can't get into the head of Donald Trump. That's just -- that's a really horrible place to go. I think that Donald Trump looks out for Donald Trump. And he looks out for Donald Trump's closest buddies who give him total loyalty, and he looks out for the other billionaires because he thinks they've got a whole bro thing going on. That's what Donald Trump does. And if he had to step on a cute little kitten to get something done that would help himself --</p><p>AXELROD: he obviously feared Biden as a candidate didn't he?</p><p>WARREN: He saw an opportunity and he took it.</p><p>CUOMO: Senator Warren, let me take this opportunity, I know time is short up here. Thank you for being with us. I appreciate it.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: Again, an advanced Merry Christmas to you and your family. Congratulations on the debate. And thank you for being with us tonight.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you, it's good to be.</p><p>CUOMO: Congratulation on the debate.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>CUOMO: All right. So, we've been lucky here, we've had some of the main players from the debate stage tonight. Let's talk about the implications, their answers afterwards, and what it lets us know about where these campaigns are headed. Stay with CNN.</p><p>[23:55:00]</p><p>CUOMO: All right. Thank you for following our continuing coverage of what happened out here in Los Angeles tonight, the sixth Democratic debate. It was very interesting. Seven tonight made a difference. There was a lot more exchange. It helped people to know they didn't have to fight for time the same way and points were made. Joining us now, Tom Steyer. Good to have you.</p><p>TOM STEYER, 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CUOMO: greeting advance, best for the holidays to you and the family, Merry Christmas. You made the important point of saying Christmas. I like Christmas. Very good. Very good to (inaudible) Christmas. The president thinks he brought it back, but it's always been here. It's good to hear that.</p><p>Now, we thought this was your Christmas tie but you wear it all the time. It's become a little bit of your signature. Your other signature up on the stage is, I know the economy better than these people with all due respect, so to win on the economy you can't do it from the Washington perspective. That's how Trump beat you. I'm the only one who can go toe for toe. You get eye rolls across the board from your fellow competitors from the party. Why are you right and they're wrong?</p><p>STEYER: Look, I think we know how Mr. Trump is going to run for president because he said it last week. You know, he was talking to, I think, the Israeli American conference of Americans and he said, you don't like me and I don't like you, but you're all going to vote for me because if the Democrats get in control they're going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes. That's how he's going to run for president.</p><p>So, whoever is going to be the Democratic nominee, he's going to be on stage saying that and we're going to have to be able to take him out because he's a fake. He hasn't been good for the American economy. He wasn't a successful business person. He's a fake. He's been terrible for the American people on the economy and we have to talk about what it would look like to have true prosperity for Americans, not fake prosperity.</p><p>CUOMO: All right, here's the rebound. You say fake prosperity, 55 percent of people, his highest positive rating on the economy.</p><p>STEYER: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: You ask Americans are you better off than four years ago, the numbers are high on the positive side. They see him in a way that he has a grip on his Party.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019121904CNV54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSX-69X1-DXH2-653N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump Administration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>2020 Presidential Debate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Final Debate Of 2019</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Andrew Yang</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tom Steyer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Profiles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Families</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The hires in question, data specialists Eric Mayefsky and Nina Wornhoff, were recommended to campaign manager Mike Schmuhl by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The campaign has aggressively fought back against allegations of even a whiff of impropriety, noting that Zuckerberg\u2019s emails were sent at the applicants\u2019 request, and that Buttigieg\u2019s team had received more than 7,000 job applications between Buttigieg\u2019s breakout appearance on a CNN town hall in March and his campaign\u2019s official launch the following month.</p><p>\u201cOther people we have gotten staff recommendations from: former Presidents, civil rights leaders, members of Congress, Pete\u2019s high school teacher,\u201d tweeted Lis Smith, Buttigieg\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe make staff decisions on how to build the best team in politics, which I\u2019m proud to report we have!\u201d</p><p>But as some fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls call for the government to potentially break up large tech companies, and Facebook\u2019s leadership continues to defend the company\u2019s position that politicians should be considered exempt from its rules regarding hate speech, harassment and false advertising, the relationship between Buttigieg and Silicon Valley is under renewed scrutiny.</p><p>For Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose political life has been defined by curbing corporate power, the appearance of any coziness between Zuckerberg and a political campaign\u2014particularly one that\u2019s hot on her tail in Iowa\u2014is bad enough as it is, regardless of the fact that the two staffers hired were not in political roles.</p><p>\u201cMy views on Mark Zuckerberg are pretty clear: He runs a company that has too much political power,\u201d Warren told a gaggle of reporters on Monday, when asked about the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 exchange. \u201cThey already have way too much influence in Washington and they are helping drive every conversation in a way that will protect Mark Zuckerberg and his company but that undermines our democracy. That is why I have said I think it\u2019s time to enforce the antitrust laws that are already on the books\u2014we need to break up these big tech companies.\u201d</p><p>Warren has pointed to Facebook\u2019s outsized influence and alleged disinterest in preventing the spread of fake news as evidence that the company has failed to learn the lessons of the 2016 presidential campaign, when pages dedicated to sharing fake news\u2014sometimes with the assistance or orchestration of the Russian government\u2014targeted voters in the lead-up to the election.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Mark,\u201d Warren tweeted last week, after Zuckerberg gave a defensive address at Georgetown University. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t just posting a lie on his own page for his own followers. Facebook is accepting millions of dollars from Trump to run political ads, including ones with misinformation and outright lies\u2026 Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again\u2014and profit off of it.\u201d</p><p>By one measure, at least, Buttigieg is far and away the preferred candidate of Facebook\u2019s employees. According to a review of Federal Election Commission data by The Daily Beast, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, raked in $23,095.36 in donations from Facebook employees in the first six months of 2019, a sum that includes checks written by some of the company\u2019s most senior employees. David Marcus, the former president of PayPal and current head of Facebook Messenger, donated $2,800 to Buttigieg the day before he officially launched his campaign; Naomi Gleit, senior director of the growth, engagement, and mobile team at Facebook and the company\u2019s vice president of \u201csocial good,\u201d also donated $2,800.</p><p>Other high-level donors from Facebook\u2019s upper ranks include Maz Sharafi, global head of marketing for WhatsApp ($2,000), Victoria Grand, WhatsApp\u2019s vice president of policy and communications ($2,000), and Elliot Schrage, the company\u2019s former vice president of global communications, marketing, and public policy who led its response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal ($2,000).</p><p>In comparison, the rest of the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates have raised far less money from Facebook employees over the same period\u2014although Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have both called for the government to take antitrust action to break up Facebook, have each actually received more individual donations from the company\u2019s workers. In the first six months of 2019, Sanders raised $6,084 from 88 Facebook employees, while Warren raised $9,362.80 from 65 employees, and former Vice President Joe Biden raised $1,500 from seven people.</p><p>(For the curious, President Donald Trump has raised $383.91 from 12 separate donations over the same period, all made by the same solitary Facebook employee.)</p><p>Some of that pocketbook enthusiasm is likely rooted in Buttigieg\u2019s discomfort with the idea of breaking up Facebook, which his rivals say has become too powerful and monopolistic. After Harvard acquaintance and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes published a piece in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> calling for the company to be broken up, Buttigieg told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">San Jose Mercury News</emphasis> that while Hughes \u201cmade a very convincing case\u201d that no company \u201cshould have the type of power that\u2026 these tech companies have,\u201d he would prefer implementing \u201ca spectrum\u201d of regulations over the industry.</p><p>Some preference may lie beyond policy, however. Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the field, has called for increasing the government\u2019s technological literacy, pointing to congressional hearings in 2018\u2014which featured Zuckerberg\u2014as an example of \u201cpeople in charge of regulating a very powerful force demonstrating that they had no concept of what it was they were in charge of overseeing.\u201d</p><p>Politicians, Buttigieg told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mercury News</emphasis>, \u201cneed some kind of literacy in these technologies, what they mean and more importantly what they can do, in order to regulate properly,\u201d although he added that the critique was \u201cnot necessarily an age thing.\u201d</p><p>Buttigieg\u2019s working relationship with Big Tech extends to before his run for the White House. When Zuckerberg set off on a much-hyped tour of the United States following Trump\u2019s inauguration, he joined Buttigieg in his hometown, streaming live video from the dashboard of Buttigieg\u2019s car as the pair toured the city and discussed proposals intended to lure tech startups to revitalize downtown South Bend.</p><p>\u201cLike everybody else, I\u2019ll be very interested to hear what he makes of what we\u2019ve shown him,\u201d Buttigieg said at the time.</p><p>But Buttigieg\u2019s campaign denied that his support from Facebook employees and the tech industry more broadly means he\u2019s any softer on Silicon Valley.</p><p>\u201cSince the beginning of the campaign, we\u2019ve built a top-tier operation with more than 430 staff in South Bend and around the country,\u201d said national press secretary Chris Meagher in a statement. \u201cThe staffers come from all types of backgrounds, and everyone is working hard every day to elect Pete to the White House.\u201d</p><p>Zuckerberg, meanwhile, told reporters on Monday that passing along the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u201cshouldn\u2019t be taken as an endorsement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a number of colleagues who I\u2019d worked with at Facebook or my philanthropic foundation were interested in working there, they asked me or my wife Priscilla to send over their r\u00e9sum\u00e9, so I did that,\u201d Zuckerberg said on a press call on Monday, during a conversation about election security. \u201cI think that this probably should not be misconstrued as if I\u2019m deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or anything like that.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2307544789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBB-M5R1-JBHT-D0Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They hold the Facebook subsidiary to be partially responsible for her death.</p><p>Also prominent alongside the politicians in the launch announcement were Barnado's, the NSPCC, Childnet, the Dianna Award and Internet Matters.</p><p>That representsa powerful coalition in favour of ideas such as imposing a \"duty of care\" on internet businesses, together a demand that they shield people from potentially harmful content.

The weakness of the Paris Climate Accords, and the patchy observance of themin response to something that represents aclear and present danger to the future of life on this planet tells you all you need to know.

Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform - including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for 'abortion.' The term 'abortion' was added to a 'blacklist' file for 'controversial YouTube queries,' which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg. </p><p>The existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source. In the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source. 'We have tons of white- and blacklists that humans manually curate,' said the employee. 'Hopefully this isn't surprising or particularly controversial.' Others were more concerned about the presence of the blacklist. According to the source, the software engineer who started the discussion called the manipulation of search results related to abortion a 'smoking gun.' The software engineer noted that the change had occurred following aninquiry from a left-wingSlatejournalist[3]about the prominence of pro-life videos on YouTube, and that pro-life videos were replaced with pro-abortion videos in the top ten results for the search terms following Google's manual intervention. 'TheSlatewriter said she had complained last Friday and then saw different search results before YouTube responded to her on Monday,' wrote the employee. 'And lo and behold, the [changelog] was submitted on Friday, December 14 at 3:17 PM.' The manually downranked items included several videos from Dr. Antony Levatino, a former abortion doctor who is now a pro-life activist. Another video in the top ten featured a woman's personal story of being pressured to have an abortion, while another featured pro-life conservative Ben Shapiro. TheSlatejournalist who complained to Googlereported[4] that these videos previously featured in the top ten, describing them in her story as 'dangerous misinformation.' Since theSlatejournalist's inquiry andGoogle's subsequent intervention, the top search resultsnow[5]feature pro-abortion content from left-wing sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, andLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.In herreport[6], theSlatejournalist acknowledged that the search results changed shortly after she contacted Google. The manual adjustment of search results by a Google-owned platform contradicts a keyclaim[7]made under oath by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in his congressional testimony earlier this month: that his company does not 'manually intervene on any search result.' A Google employee in the discussion thread drew attention to Pichai's claim, noting that it 'seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.' One of the posts in the discussion also noted that the blacklist had previously been edited to include the search term 'Maxine Waters' after a single Google employee complained the top YouTube search result for Maxine Waters was 'very low quality.' Google's alleged intervention on behalf of a Democratic congresswoman would be further evidence of the tech giant using its resources to prop up the left. Breitbart News previously reported on leaked emails revealing the company targeted pro-Democrat demographics in its get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016. According to the source, a software engineer in the thread also noted that 'a bunch of terms related to the abortion referendum in Ireland' had been added to the blacklist - another change with potentially dramatic consequences on the national policies of a western democracy. youtube_controversial_query_blacklist At least one post in the discussion thread revealed the existence of a file called 'youtube_controversial_query_blacklist,' which contains a list of YouTube search terms that Google manually curates. In addition to the terms 'abortion,' 'abortions,' 'Maxine Waters,' and search terms related to the Irish abortion referendum, a Google software engineer noted that the blacklist includes search terms related to terrorist attacks. (the posts specifically mentions that the 'Strasbourg terrorist attack' as being on the list). 'If you look at the other entries recently added to theyoutube_controversial_query_blacklist(e.g., entries related to the Strasbourg terrorist attack), the addition of abortion seemsout-of-place,' wrote the software engineer, according to the source. After learning of the existence of the blacklist, Breitbart News obtained a partial screenshot of the full blacklist file from a source within Google. It reveals that the blacklist includes search terms related to both mass shootings and the progressive anti-second amendment activist David Hogg. This suggests Google has followed the lead of Democrat politicians, who haverepeatedly pushed tech companies[8]to censor content related to the Parkland school shooting and the Parkland anti-gun activists. It's part of a popular new line of thought in the political-media establishment,which views the public as too stupid to question conspiracy theories for themselves[9]. Here is the partial blacklist leaked to Breitbart:2117 plane crash Russian 2118 plane crash 2119 an-148 2120 florida shooting conspiracy 2121 florida shooting crisis actors 2122 florida conspiracy 2123 florida false flag shooting 2124 florida false flag 2125 fake florida school shooting 2126 david hogg hoax 2127 david hogg fake 2128 david hogg crisis actor 2129 david hogg forgets lines 2130 david hogg forgets his lines 2131 david hogg cant remember his lines 2132 david hogg actor 2133 david hogg cant remember 2134 david hogg conspiracy 2135 david hogg exposed 2136 david hogg lines 2137 david hogg rehearsing 2120 florida shooting conspiracyThe full internal filepath of the blacklist, according to another source, is: //depot/google3/googledata/superroot/youtube/youtube_controversial_query_blacklist Contradictions Responding to a request for comment, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company wants to promote 'authoritative' sources in its search results, but maintained that YouTube is a 'platform for free speech' that 'allow[s]' both pro-life and pro-abortion content. YouTube's full comment:YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow ourCommunity Guidelines[10], which prohibit things like inciting violence and pornography. We apply these policies impartially and we allow both pro-life and pro-choice opinions. Over the last year we've described how we are working tobetter surface news sources[11]across our site for news-related searches and topical information. We've improved our search and discovery algorithms, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more authoritative sources where they can fact check information for themselves.In the case of the 'abortion' search results, YouTube's intervention to insert 'authoritative' content resulted in the downranking of pro-life videos and the elevation of pro-abortion ones. A Google spokesperson took a tougher line than its YouTube subsidiary, stating that 'Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.' However, in the leaked discussion thread, a member of Google's 'trust ...fety' team, Daniel Aaronson, admitted that the company maintains 'huge teams' that work to adjust search results for subjects that are 'prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content' - all subjective terms that are frequently used to suppress right-leaning sources. He also admitted that the interventions weren't confined to YouTube - they included search results delivered via Google Assistant, Google Home, and in rare cases Google 's organic search results. In the thread, Aaronson attempted to explain how search blacklisting worked. He claimed that highly specific searches would generate non-blacklisted results, even controversial ones. But the inclusion of highly specific terms in the YouTube blacklist, like 'David Hogg cant remember his lines' - the name of an actual viral video - seems to contradict this. Aaronson's full post is copied below:I work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are 'Proactive' and 'Reactive':Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain ofReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E,g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy These Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public[12] Manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of 'suicide', that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying 'hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users'. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search isextremelyhigh. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for 'Jews run the banks' - I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant 'Why do Jews run the banks' we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions - these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list - image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our 'Pepsi formula'. Best, DanielThe fact that Google manually curates politically contentious search results fits in with a wider pattern of political activity on the part of the tech giant. In 2018, Breitbart News exclusively published a leaked video from the company that showedsenior management in dismay at Trump's election victory[13], and pledging to use the company's power to make his populist movement a'hiccup' in history[14]. Breitbart also leaked'The Good Censor,'[15]an internal research document from Google that admits the tech giant is engaged in the censorship of its own products, partly in response to political events. Another leak revealed that employees within the company, including Google's current director of Trust and Safety,tried to kick Breitbart News off Google's market-dominating online ad platforms[16]. Yet another showed Google engaged intargeted turnout operations[17]aimed to boost voter participation in pro-Democrat demographics in 'key states' ahead of the 2016 election. The effort was dubbed a 'silent donation' by a top Google employee. Evidence for Google's partisan activities is now overwhelming.President Trump has previously warned Google[18], as well as other Silicon Valley giants, not to engage in censorship or partisan activities. Google continues to defy him. Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.
