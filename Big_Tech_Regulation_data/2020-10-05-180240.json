Happy Easter and happy Passover from FOX News in  Washington.  </p><p> It's been a turbulent week for President Trump's foreign policy.  Russia  tested a powerful new missile and responded to the U.S. expelling 60 of  their diplomats by kicking out 60 of ours.  Kim Jong-un made a surprise  trip to China while appearing to set new conditions for talks with Mr.  Trump, and the president announced he wants to pull all American forces out  of Syria and is freezing recovery aid for that country.  </p><p> We want to discuss all this with Senator Lindsey Graham, a key member of  the Senate Armed Services Committee.  </p><p> Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY and happy Easter.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Happy Easter.   A lot to talk about.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, let's start with the situation in Russia -- the launch of a  powerful new missile, those mass expulsions.  </p><p> Here's how Russia's ambassador to the U.S. described the situation.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.:  It seems the atmosphere  in Washington is poison, is poisoned.  It's a toxic atmosphere.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  How serious is the split now between Moscow and Washington?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  I think it's pretty ironic that he used the word poison.  One of  the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the Russian intelligence  services most likely poisoned a British citizen and his daughter, a former  Russian agent in the United Kingdom.  So, this is the '80s to me all over.  </p><p> I can tell you what Ronald Reagan did.  Every time the Russians tried to  advance their military technology, we one-up to them.  Every time the  Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back.  </p><p> So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically  isolate Russia.  I would study every major recipient of Russia oil and gas  and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas  somewhere -- from a source outside of Russia.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to pick up on the president's action because while the  Trump administration has taken some actions, imposed some sanctions the  week before last, President Trump himself has been reluctant to call out  Vladimir Putin.  </p><p> In fact, here's how we talked about his call to congratulate Putin after he  won his reelection victory.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We had a very good call and I suspect that we will probably be  meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Senator, do we need a Trump-Putin summit meeting or do we need  President Trump first to take some stronger actions against Russia?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Let's go back to the Reagan playbook.  He stood up in front of the  Berlin wall and said: Tear this wall down, on the other side is an evil  empire.  He wound up meeting with Gorbachev to try to reduce the number of  nuclear weapons.  </p><p> I think the problem is that Russia is running wild.  Whatever we're doing  is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing  back against Putin directly.  So, again, economic isolation of Russia.   They're an oil and gas economy.  They couldn't survive very long without  customers.  </p><p> So, if I were President Trump, Germany and Europe, I would -- France, I  would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to  their customers for oil and gas outside of Russia.  That's what I do.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Speaking of summits, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un made a  surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet with Chinese President Xi as  Kim prepares for a summit meeting with President Trump next month.  And  according to the Chinese, Kim is now calling for phased synchronized moves  to denuclearize his country.  </p><p> Question, does that concern you that according to what the Chinese said  after the meeting between Kim and Xi, that the North Korean leader Kim now  wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Yes, it could, but let me just highlight one thing.  The reason  that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign  against North Korea launched by the Trump administration, where the world  is beginning to follow, has paid off.  They're coming to the table because  it has hurt so much.  </p><p> And the president has called out Kim Jong-un by name for being the tyrant  he is.  Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and  maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean  War, which is still going on.  But, yes, I'd be very cautious about the  terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why I like John Bolton as  national security advisor.  He's a very -- he has a very healthy  skepticism, but I do hope President Trump will meet with North Korea.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, I just want to pick up on that.  You say you want to be  careful about the terms of the meeting, if what Kim says he has in mind is  longer negotiations, concessions on both sides, it sounds kind of like the  negotiations --  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- that prior presidents have had with the North Korean regime  with Kim's father.  </p><p> Do we still want to have the summit?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  We don't want to give him nine months or year to talk and build a  missile at the same time.  So, I had dinner with Bolton a couple of nights  ago.  His big fear is that they're just buying time.  </p><p> They're about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear  weapon on top that can hit America.  He sees these negotiations as we're  (ph) buying time.  That's what they've done in the past.  </p><p> So, I'd cut them off at the pass there.  I would make sure the negotiations  were very focused and get quick action.  </p><p> Here's the goal in negotiations: to make sure that North Korea gives up  their nuclear program.  Japan and South Korea, they don't have notes,  there's no reason for North Korea to have a nuclear program.  They'll sell  anything they'll build as to their history.  And maybe get a peace treaty  with North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China, but not let  this drag on a very long time.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Meanwhile, President Trump started talking this week about  pulling all of our 2,000 troops --  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- out of Syria who are there supporting the effort against ISIS,  and we learned yesterday he has frozen $200 million in funds for recovery  efforts there. </p><p> Here is the president on Syria this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon.  Let the other people  take care of it now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Is President Trump making a mistake talking about getting out of  Syria while ISIS is still alive, obviously diminished but still in the  field, and while Iran is still pushing and some could say helping the Assad  regime won the civil war?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, Mr. President, when it comes to Russia, read the Ronald  Reagan playbook.  When it comes to Syria, do not read the Obama playbook.  </p><p> This is the Obama playbook, one foot in, one foot out.  This is a disaster  in the making.  </p><p> All of his military advisors have said, we need to leave troops in Syria to  work with the Kurds, calm down the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish  fighters who have helped, make sure that Raqqa does not fall back into the  hands of ISIL.  There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around  Syria.  We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region.  </p><p> If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war  between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving  Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran  would dominate Syria.  </p><p> It'd be the single worst decision the president could make.  I've seen this  movie before when Obama did the same thing in Iraq and quite frankly gave  Assad a pass in Syria when he had them on the ropes.  </p><p> We got ISIL on the ropes.  If you want to let them off the ropes, remove  American soldiers.  </p><p> WALLACE:  You have talked -- we also want to talk about some domestic  issues.  You have called for a second special counsel to investigate --  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Right.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- the FBI and the Justice Department and how they conducted both  the Clinton investigation and the Trump investigation.  But the inspector  general, who is independent, says he is looking into that and this week,  the Attorney General Jeff Sessions named John Huber, the U.S. attorney from  Utah, to conduct his own investigation into those matters.  </p><p> Does that move satisfy you or do you still want a second special counsel?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, some people say it's a good start, some people say it's an  insufficient process.  I don't know yet.  The jury is still out regarding  Mr. Huber, but I do know this: if you tried this when it came to the Trump  campaign, not appoint a special counsel but take some U.S. attorney outside  of Washington and let them look at the Trump-Russia connection, the left  would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel.  </p><p> My belief is that there should be a special counsel.  And here's the  question: I want a special counsel with the same determination and  resources to look at the abuses of the FISA process, was the Clinton email  investigation a sham, were there conflicts of interest in the Justice  Department.  </p><p> I want to special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the  same determination to look at those issues as is Mueller is looking at the  Trump campaign.  And I don't see that yet.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Finally, you said we had a lot to cover.  This week, the  president fired the secretary of veterans affairs and he named the White  House doctor, Admiral Ronny Jackson, to take that job, Jackson who famously  gave President Trump a clean bill of health.  </p><p> Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADMIRAL RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN:  To answer your question, he  has incredibly good genes.  It's just the way god made him.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  You call this a home run for veterans and there's no question  that Admiral Jackson is a brilliant -- well, he's a great combat surgeon.   The question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has  the experience to run an agency with 360,000 employees and an annual budget  of $186 billion.  </p><p> Why doesn't that concern you and how much trouble do you think Admiral  Jackson is going to have being confirmed?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  One, I think he'll get confirmed because he's made life-and-death  decisions on the battlefield.  He's committed medical personnel on the  battlefield.  He's been in the middle of this war.  </p><p> I was with him a week ago, I guess two weeks ago now, at an event in  Charleston and he had no idea this was coming.  I had no idea it was  coming.  But we started talking about the Veterans Administration, and he  said to me something that was very satisfying.  </p><p> Somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down.  Somebody needs  to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get  basic health care.  </p><p> I want competition for the veterans health care.  I want the V.A. to stay  in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a  facility I want the private sector to fill in that gap.</p><p> And Admiral Jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into  the V.A.  He's willing to fight the bureaucracy and I think Admiral Jackson  is a good pick because he's been on the battlefield.  He knows what the  fight is all about.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you.  Thanks for your time this holiday  weekend.  It was a busy set of questions and we got it all in.  Always good  to talk with you, sir.  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Happy Easter.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Happy Easter to you.  </p><p> Up next, the president announces he wants to pull American troops out of  Syria.  We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether he's moving too  fast.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the state of U.S.-Russian  relations now?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may  use your question on the air.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ANTONOV:  If anybody slap your check, your face, what will be reaction from  your side?  You will retaliate.  It goes without saying.  </p><p> NAUERT:  Russia should not be acting like a victim.  The only victims in  the situation are the two victims in a hospital in the U.K. right now.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and State Department  Spokeswoman Heather Nauert continuing the two countries war of words this  week.  </p><p> And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Former Republican Congressman  Jason Chaffetz, FOX News analyst Marie Harf, Catherine Lucey, who covers  the White House for \"The Associated Press\", and FOX News correspondent  Gillian Turner.  </p><p> Well, Gillian, let me start with you.  Where are we headed in relations  with the Kremlin after this week and you heard from Senator Graham, what  should President Trump do next?  </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, all right, Chris, to lay it  out right now, this investigation phase into the nerve agent attack is in  full swing.  Reporting this week is that the United States is sort of hand  in glove with the Brits on this investigation every step of the way and  some horrifying, horrifying developments coming out of that.  </p><p> Just in the last 24 hours, the Brits confirmed that they believe President  Putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself.  They believe  it's not a stand-alone event and it's part of a broader plan of a large- scale assassination plan for Russian defectors around the world.  They've  gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for  Russian defectors living inside their borders.  </p><p> It's a horrifying set of circumstances.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Why would they do that?  I mean, what's to be gained -- I mean, I  understand you don't like these people, but why is killing the person who  is living as a private citizen in Salisbury, England, worth the blowback  you get internationally?  </p><p> TURNER:  I think because according to the Putin and the KGB playbook, these  are some of the worst people on earth, people who defected from the former  Soviet Union, now from Russia are people that don't really deserve to live.   They are enemies of the state in the truest form.  And not to play pop  psychology, but I think that's what motivates this.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel.</p><p> And on this issue of relations with Russia and the mass expulsion of  diplomats, Lambert Boeman tweeted this: the only question, does this not  put to bed any and all allegations of true collusion?  They put him in  office, to Kremlin allegedly helping Mr. Trump, to expel people?  </p><p> Catherine, how do you answer Lambert and the argument that the Trump  administration is taking action, the shows he's not playing ball with  Putin?  </p><p> CATHERINE LUCEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  The actions this week the  administration took a strong stance.  These are very aggressive actions.   But there is a disconnect a little bit between the administration's actions  and the president's public rhetoric.  We haven't heard him directly  challenging Putin.  So, critics are still pointing to that as a cause for  concern.  </p><p> But in terms of collusion specifically, that's just not going to be put to  rest until this investigation concludes.  We still don't know where that's  going and the people are still waiting to see what Mueller finds.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to turn to a different subject, and that is Mr. Trump  surprise announcement this week that he is eager to pull all use U.S.  troops, about 2,000 there backing up Syrian rebels, wants to pull them out  of Syria and also that he has decided to freeze $200 million in U.S.  recovery aid for people in the country.  </p><p> Here was Mr. Trump this week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are going to be coming out of there real soon.  We're going to  get back to our country where we belong, where we want to be.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Congressman, I want to pick up on what Senator Graham said.  He  said that the president is -- if he follows through on this -- is making  exactly the same mistake that Barack Obama made in Iraq, which is to pull  U.S. forces out before the battle is won.  </p><p> Is Graham right?  </p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT):  Senator Graham is right.   Why do you telegraph in advance what you are going to do to your enemies?   And to the local people that you're working and engaging with, to signal to  them that, hey, a couple weeks from now, we may not be here?  </p><p> That's -- that's not a good message.  I do think it's right to look at the  aid portion of this and how are you going to distribute that, but I also  don't think we're that close, inches away from getting rid of the caliphate  and reclaiming all of the land.  I just don't see that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, I mean, there didn't seem be any pressure.  There was no huge  call to pull U.S. troops out.  How do you explain the president suddenly  announcing this?  He was in Ohio for an infrastructure speech, and  suddenly, he says this.  </p><p> CHAFFETZ:  There's no way that I'm going to be able to answer that in its  totality.  But, look, I think his heart is in the right place.  I do  believe you want to get in, get your job done and get our troops home, and  I think that's a good message to their military.  Go in with overwhelming  force, do what you need to do and come back home.  </p><p> But I don't think you telegraph that in advance.  And, you know, the  timeline is iffy, but I think Senator Graham is right in this case.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I mean, it's interesting because you say don't telegraph in  advance.  That was one of the major points --  </p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- that President Trump made during the campaign.  </p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I think I said that every week, I was critical of the president  -- saying, President Obama, don't do it like this.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Right, so is President Trump.  He was saying, don't -- be  unpredictable.  </p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  Don't tell people in advance what's going to happen.  </p><p> Marie, your thought about the president's apparent eagerness to get out of  Syria?  </p><p> MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  I think it would be a  huge strategic mistake and not just because of the telegraphing issue,  although I do agree with Congressman Chaffetz, who will fill that void if  the United States is not there?  Russia and Iran.  And we've already seen  Russia and Iran both move in increasingly into Syria.  They have, you know,  airbases, they have troops there, both of them do.  </p><p> If the United States pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone  else, we are handing that country over to the two countries we don't want  to have more power in the Middle East.  So, we are hearing from commanders  on the ground, we are hearing from diplomats that President Trump needs to  take a step back and stay in this for the long haul, whatever that means  whether it's months or years.  This would be a mistake and I think  Republicans like Senator Graham will keep standing up and may be pushing  the president in a different direction.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Now, I have to ask you, did you feel the same way about Barack  Obama when he pulled our troops out of Iraq in 2012?  </p><p> HARF:  Well, I think it was a completely different strategic situation at  the time.  And there are --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Why?</p><p> HARF:  The conditions on the ground quite frankly were different.  And  Barack Obama pulled troops out of Iraq on a timeline set by the Bush  administration.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Well, that's not quite true.  </p><p> HARF:  Well, it is absolutely -- they negotiated the forces agreement under  which those troops got pulled out and on that timeline.  </p><p> WALLACE:  You want to take this one on or shall I?  </p><p> HARF:  Well, wait, there's a question -- and Congressman Chaffetz brought  it up.  There's a tension between going to the American people rightly so  and saying, our men and women are not going to fight indefinitely overseas,  policing other countries' civil wars.  There is tension between that and  advocating American leadership.  The balance is not always an easy one to  find, but going to the infrastructure event in Ohio and saying, we're going  to get out of Syria really soon sends a bad signal to the commanders and to  our enemies.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I'm going to make an audible here.  We could relitigate that, and  the fact is that although there was a status of forces agreement, there's  always the presumption that U.S. and Iraq were going to negotiate for  troops to stay --  </p><p> HARF:  Maybe (ph).</p><p> WALLACE:  -- and that President Obama didn't push very hard.  </p><p> I want to move on to North Korea because there was an interesting --  Catherine, after Kim surprised us with the Chinese, the Chinese said that  Kim is now saying --  we're not talking about a quick dismantlement like  Libya did, like Gadhafi did to get rid of all of our nukes.  We want phase,  synchronized talks, concessions by both sides, longer negotiations.  </p><p> What's the reaction in the White House to that?  </p><p> LUCEY:  You know, I think we're still waiting to hear how the president  processes this.  We haven't heard from him in the last day or two.  But he  said earlier this week that he was still looking forward to talks.  I mean,  he talked about -- he made references to this in Ohio this week.  </p><p> So, we haven't heard an indication that he's not going to do this.  And  some of this I think is a part of sort of -- there's some public posturing  that's going to keep going on I think up until this meeting potentially  happens.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Does that concern you when you hear him talk?  Because it sounds  a bit like what the North Koreans have done in the past.  Well, we'll give  you this, you give us that, we will play along for a while and then we'll  go back on our word.  </p><p> CHAFFETZ:  This is all moving in the right direction.  I think this is one  of the strongest points for President Trump and what he's done.  He's put  the pressure on both economically and militarily.  It's pushing in the  right direction.  </p><p> You see that China is obviously going to play a key, key role in ultimately  what happens there and us with the Japanese and the South Koreans have got  to hold the line.  And I do think it's important that the president meets  with the leader of North Korea.  I think that will be productive.  </p><p> I don't think you should let off the gas at all.  And certainly, the  appointment of John Bolton is not going to send any signals that we're  going to be softer.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Quick final thought, Gillian?  </p><p> TURNER:  I think the president changed tack this week.  He shifted to what  I would call a maximum pressure campaign against South Korea, which was  really interesting, and threatening to tie a bilateral trade deal with them  to the denuclearization issue.  He's now saying to South Korea or demanding  that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for  this negotiation with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p> And that was remarkable because I think it shows - - it shows up how little  leverage we actually have against this crazy, despotic, rogue regime, North  Korea.  The president is sort of triangulating, as much as I hate that  word, looking at the levers and saying, well, I'm not really going to get  what I want from this, so I might as well push this lever and see what I  can extract from South Korea.  </p><p> WALLACE:  And since they're meeting first, the South Koreans and North  Koreans at the end of this month, he's saying, before we sign this trade  deal which you guys want, let's see how much you push the North Koreans and  we certainly don't want you breaking away from us.  </p><p> TURNER:  Yes, you said it better than I did.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> WALLACE:  Well -- all right.  Thank you, panel.  You'll get more time in  the next panel for buttering me up.  </p><p> We're going to take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.</p><p> When we come back, the decision to include a question on citizenship in the  2020 census raises an uproar.  We'll talk with two California officials  about that and the escalating battle over its status as a sanctuary state.   All of that, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  Coming up, the Commerce Department adds a citizenship question to  the 2020 census and some states are fighting back.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Adding a question on  citizen strip threatens to derail the integrity of the entire process.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  We'll ask two California officials what it means for their state,  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE:  A look around the world as Christians celebrate Easter.  </p><p> The Trump administration announced this week the 2020 census will ask  respondents whether they are U.S. citizens for the first time in 70 years,  and that has started a fierce debate in California, which has voted to  become a sanctuary state.</p><p> Joining me now from California, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman and the  vice chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Shawn Nelson. </p><p>California's attorney general announced this week that he is suing the  federal government for deciding to add that question to the census. Here  was his reasoning. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERA: An undercount resulting  from this decision would jeopardize vital services for all Californians. It  would also jeopardize our representation in government. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, is Congressman Becerra wrong or, in fact, would you  like to see California lose some seats in Congress and some federal money  that is based on the large number of people in your state illegally? </p><p> SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: Well,  Attorney General Becerra, I just think is incorrect because the federal  government has a right to conduct the census and there's nothing that says  they can't ask any particular question. I don't want California to miss out  on anything, but I think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow  going to force people away from a censes, I -- I just don't buy it. The --  the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years  after a person answers the census. And I think his time ought to be spent  allaying the fears of people he things are going to be freaked out by  having to answer questions. </p><p> WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you, though, about the practical effect of it,  because it's kind of an open question as we looked into it. Even the  Supreme Court has not definitively ruled. </p><p> Do you think that people who are in this country illegally should be  counted when it's decided how you're going to apportion congressional seats  and how you're going to divvy up federal money? </p><p> NELSON: Well, that's a great question. I mean if -- if, in the end, we  essentially import a few million citizens of other countries to game the  system to get extra congressional seats, I suppose that presents a big  question for power in Washington, D.C. I mean we always just assumed the  count is for the citizens of a country, but California, where I've lived my  whole life, obviously has a little different issue. And that poses a big  problem. </p><p> WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, let me ask you the same question. Why should  California, or any state with a sizable number of illegal immigrants in its  population, benefit from that to get more federal money or to get more  seats in Congress? </p><p> BRAD SHERMAN (D), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: We're often shortchanged when it  comes to federal money and Congress can allocate the federal money however  it chooses. The enumeration for the census is the allocation of House seats  and seats in the Electoral College. And the Constitution is clear, you  count all persons except Indians untaxed. Those are the words of the  Constitution. </p><p> Now, if people want the change the Constitution, they -- there's a process  for doing that. But instead they seem to want to thwart the Constitution,  to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting  all immigrants, legal and illegal. And they've got a three step program for  doing that. Create massive fear, starting by calling immigrants rapists and  murders, deportations. The fear in Latino and Asian communities is  palpable. </p><p> Then you add this question, which the census itself, under the Trump  administration says will lead to an undercount. And then you add insult to  injury by saying that the reason you're doing it is to enforce the Voting  Rights Act. That it's part of the Trump program for Latino empowerment.  That's why they're doing it.</p><p> WALLACE: Let me -- let me --</p><p> SHERMAN: That's absolutely absurd. If you believe that, then --</p><p> WALLACE: Let me -- let me bring Mr. Nelson in, if I can, congressman,  because we do have limited amount of time. </p><p> This will be the first time that this question has been asked as a general  question. It's been asked, I know (ph), to a small group of people. But as  a general question in the census since 1950. </p><p> What about the argument that this is an effort by the Trump administration  to depress the count by frightening illegal immigrants? </p><p> NELSON: Listen, I think that any questionnaire has the potential to be  avoided. The point is to reach out to communities and encourage them to  participate. There's no repercussions. This information cannot be shared.  And there's no reason people shouldn't participate, unless folks go out and  scare them. And I would say that what's happening on this very show the  Congressman Sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything  that -- that I'm seeing from -- from my end of the -- of the spectrum. I  mean tell people they are protected and encourage them to participate. </p><p> My county has more poor people than most counties have people. Many of them  are immigrants. We need federal money. </p><p> WALLACE: Let me -- let me -- let -- let -- I just want to ask you,  Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson is exactly right, that the law expressly  prohibits using, sharing, any information from the census with any  government, with any court. So why should anybody be afraid? And perhaps  aren't you, by talking as you are, aren't you creating that fear? </p><p> SHERMAN: I'm certainly trying not to create any fear. But the fact is  immigrants come from countries with oppressive governments in many cases.  And to convince them that a man who stands there and says these are rapists  and murders and must be pushed out of our country should get information  about who's in your family and what their immigration status is, and that a  Congress that includes people that say they're rapists and murders isn't  going to change the statute and use that as a deportation list, to convince  someone who's lived through the terrible situations in Guatemala and  Honduras, that they should go ahead and answer the census is going to be  difficult. And to say that you're doing it to --</p><p> WALLACE: All right.</p><p> SHERMAN: Enforce the Voting Rights Act is absolutely absurd. </p><p> WALLACE: I want to switch to the other side of this because while  California is suing the federal government about including this question on  the census, the federal government is suing California about its decision  to enact laws that in effect make it a sanctuary state. And, in fact, the  Orange County Supervisors voted this week to join the federal lawsuit  against their own state of California. </p><p> Here was President Trump this week. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sanctuary cities, where they  protect criminals. They protect murderers. They protect people that you  don't want on the streets. Other places in California said, we don't want  that. First time they're speaking up. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, you were one of the Orange County Board of Supervisors  members who voted to join a federal lawsuit against her own state. Why? </p><p> NELSON: Well, it was my idea, because we are put in an untenable position  where our sheriff's deputies are precluded from talking to federal  authorities if they know the authorities want to pick someone up because  the person is here illegally, is charged with a crime, and our -- our  people can't even talk to the federal government unless there are some  exceptions that are -- that are met like they're a prior convicted felon.  But we have people getting out every day that we don't want released  without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands  on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released  into the streets. We've had 244 people as of last week released that we  could not stop and our people could not tell ICE officials that we believe  ICE would have wanted to speak with and likely wanted to do something  about. </p><p> WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, you have said that Washington is violating  the Constitution by putting this citizenship question in. But isn't  California violating the Constitution by interfering with the federal  government, which has supremacy when it comes to matters of immigration? </p><p> SHERMAN: Chris, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Until we get it,  we'll be pulling our society apart over this issue. </p><p> WALLACE: Sir, you're not answering my question. Isn't --</p><p> SHERMAN: Now, I'll get -- I'll get --</p><p> WALLACE: OK.</p><p> SHERMAN: California is absolutely within its rights. And California has  sued the Trump administration 29 times and we haven't lost once.  (INAUDIBLE) the Trump administration --</p><p> WALLACE: You're not answering my question, which is, isn't immigration -- </p><p> SHERMAN: I will. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, let's get to it, sir.</p><p> SHERMAN: Absolutely.</p><p> WALLACE: We're almost done, sir. </p><p> SHERMAN: Yes. Yes. The states and the federal government share sovereignty  in our federal system. That's why Obamacare couldn't force the states to  expand Medicaid, even though that's the federal program that even though --</p><p> WALLACE: Now, that's the question of supremacy. And, in fact, when Arizona,  went further than President Obama did, the Supreme Court said that they had  overstepped their bounds. Under the supremacy clause, the federal  government, what they say on immigration goes, and aren't you violating  that? </p><p> SHERMAN: Federal government establishes immigration policy. But whether  America -- whether California employees are going to spend California money  and resources to help enforce that policy is a California decision. We will  win that in court. And if the federal government can't compel states to  participate in Medicaid, it can't compel states to become law enforcement  authorities on immigration. </p><p> WALLACE: Of course the federal -- the Constitution didn't say anything  about Medicaid, which didn't happen until the 1960s. It says something very  specifically about immigration. </p><p> Mr. Nelson, I'm going to give you 30 seconds for a final thoughts. </p><p> NELSON: Right. </p><p> And, Chris, unfortunately, that's completely misleading. We don't want our  people doing the federal government's job, nor do they have the time to do  it. What California's law is requiring is our sheriffs not even cooperate,  which is resulting in people that have committed crimes ending up on the  streets of every county, but certainly Orange County. We got involved  because we don't think that's right. We are tired of the state trying to  use these arguments to prevent us from keeping the citizens safe.</p><p> WALLACE: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Didn't think we  were going to settle this, and we didn't. </p><p> Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson, thank you both.</p><p> NELSON: Thanks, Chris.</p><p> WALLACE: Thank you for joining us today to discuss the continuing debate  over immigration.</p><p> Up next, we'll bring back the panel to weigh in on the census asking people  if they are U.S. citizens, and President Trump's new war on Amazon. All of  that coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Every person who uses our  highways or our mass transit system, counts. Everyone who relies on our  government, federal, state and local, to be there when a natural disaster  strike, counts. </p><p> SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR., ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: They'd like  to pretend that everyone here is entitled to certain government carve outs  and benefits. And, of course, non-citizens are entitled to a lot of  benefits. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: California's attorney general and Orange County Supervisor Shawn  Nelson with sharply different views on whether the 2020 census should ask  people if they are U.S. citizens. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel. </p><p> Well, Marie, let me start with you. </p><p> Why do you think the Trump administration has decided to ask this as a  general question on the census for the first time since 1950? </p><p> MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, it's hard to know their motivation. I  know what they've said. </p><p> But for many Americans, including myself, I see this decision in the  context of the divisive rhetoric about immigration, in the context of more  hard line policies on deportation. And that's how, most importantly,  Americans and people living in the country are seeing it. </p><p> So the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country,  not just citizens, and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who  firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not  get an accurate count because people are scared of what the Trump  administration might do with that information. </p><p> WALLACE: Gillian, do you think that's true, that this is a conscious effort  to try -- to depress voter -- response by people to the census with the  expressed effort of trying to lower the amount of money that's spent on  federal benefits, a apportionment of congressional seats, particularly to  areas with large number of illegal immigrants, which tend to be Democratic? </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is certainly the  political argument to be made about this issue. But there is, in fact, in  addition to this, a much larger context at stake that gets a little bit  more to the fundamentals of American democracy and how our representatives  in Congress and elsewhere represent us, meaning the question -- and this is  something the Supreme Court took up as recently as 2016, should  congressional representative represent numbers -- equal numbers of voters  in different districts, or should they represent equal number of people? In  that -- the case was called -- I wrote it down so I'd remember, Evenwel  versus Abbott. In that instance, they decided that folks who are not  citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy  decisions as people who are American citizens. That was that decision.</p><p> WALLACE: Yes. Now that, apparently -- and -- and -- and I'm just learning  about that this morning. Apparently that was a decision that was more to  the states and local -- localities than it was to Congress. </p><p> So the question as to whether congressional seats should be apportioned  according to people or citizens, I have to say, I was shocked to learn that  it might be people and not citizens. </p><p> TURNER: Well, I was -- I -- the same, considering that, you know, American  members of Congress are supposed to represent the American electorate, not  just any -- everybody who I thought, you know, common parlance, what we're  taught in school, seems that there's a fair argument to be made for they  should also be representing the interests of non-citizens. That's a bigger  question.</p><p> (CROSS TALK) </p><p> WALLACE: Let's bring it to one member of Congress that's sitting at this  table. </p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): That's ridiculous to think  that we weren't going to have people that aren't Americans, that they are  going to influence the vote so that California gets more? </p><p> WALLACE: But are -- you're aware that's how it's worked up until now  because there's been no citizen question? </p><p> CHAFFETZ: I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just saying, as a fundamental principle, I  -- I think that's wrong. </p><p> Now, the census is going to count everybody. We're having our national  debate about DACA, about immigration reform. Shouldn't we know how many  people are here illegally? Of course we're going to count everybody, but we  ought to know. </p><p> By the way, the biggest problem that's moving forward with the census isn't  this question. And it will be on there. There's no way for the Democrats to  get it off. Their way -- the biggest problem with the census is that  they're going to try to do this over the Internet and through electronic  machines. What -- what could possibly go wrong, Chris? </p><p> WALLACE: Catherine, what -- the debate inside the White House about this?  And -- and, you know, it just seemed to come out of nowhere with Secretary  of Commerce Ross announcing it this week. Had there been a lot of  discussion about adding this question? </p><p> CATHERINE LUCEY, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I know that Secretary Ross pointed to  concerns about, appropriately, dealing with the Voting Rights Act. So  that's kind of the -- the argument that's being made from the  administration as to why this is important. </p><p> But I think also we know that all these legal challenges are already  happening. A number of states are going to challenge this. And it's not  clear how quickly this will be resolved. I mean so some people are saying  that it's possible that this question may not end up on the census if it --  if it gets tied up for so long in the courts. So we'll have to see how it  plays out. </p><p> WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump has been on a tear this week about  Amazon. And here is one of his tweets, to give you a sense of what he's  been talking about. </p><p> They, Amazon, pay little or no taxes to state and local governments, use  our postal system as their delivery boy, causing tremendous loss to the  U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business. </p><p> Congressman Chaffetz, as the former chair of the House Oversight Committee,  you've dealt with some of these issues. Is President Trump right or wrong?</p><p> CHAFFETZ: You know, I've been fond of the president and his policies, but  he is fundamentally wrong on this issue. And I actually think he knows he's  wrong on this issue. </p><p> The problems at the post office are rooted in the decline in first-class  mail, their pension issues and how they account for -- for their medical  costs. The fact that they have more customers in Amazon is a blessing and  it is a good thing to the postal service. </p><p> If you look at UPS, FedEx, Amazon, they all use the postal service and you  need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to -- to the  post office. So it is a good thing. </p><p> I know that they -- there is a personal conflict between the president and  Mr. Bezos, and that's rooted in his acquisition of \"The Washington Post.\"  But you need more customers at the post office, not less. </p><p> WALLACE: And what about this question of taxes? Because I know it was true  in the past that a lot of the big box brick and mortar retailers were upset  that sales over the Internet, they didn't collect sales tax. But, in fact,  Amazon has, I think is collecting sales tax in 45 states. </p><p> CHAFFETZ: It's all rooted in, do you or do you not have physical presence  in these states. But quite contrary to what the president has said, Amazon  has been helping to lead the charge because it's in their best economic  future to have sales tax collected in these states. The Remote Transaction  Parody Act, which I helped sponsor, has broad bipartisan support in both --  both bodies, in the House and the Senate, and that says that the states  would get to make this determination. </p><p> So Amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes, more than they've paid before,  and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of  decisions. A very conservative viewpoint. </p><p> WALLACE: Catherine, why is the president so focused on Amazon right now?  And is it just tweets, or is there talk in the White House of really taking  action to move against Amazon? </p><p> LUCEY: Well, the White House said this week there were no specific policies  on the table at this time. So you're with the obvious caveats that the  president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone. As of right now,  they don't appear to be signaling anything. But he does, as the congressman  said, this is something that's rooted both for him I think in sort of  policy and politics, but also personal. And he does find the fact that Jeff  Bezos, Amazon's founder, owns \"The Post\" deeply frustrating. Now, \"The  Post\" has been very clear. Bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions.  But the president does seem to lash out particularly if he's frustrated by  news coverage. </p><p> WALLACE: Marie, let me ask you, because this is part of a bigger story,  which is that there is a backlash against big tech. And we see it  particularly with FaceBook and the role that they played with the -- with  the Russian ads, the -- the role that they played with Cambridge Analytica  and turning over information. </p><p> What -- what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting, not  tech as an industry, but targeting Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and specifically  talking about Bezos using \"The Washington Post\" to lobby for his interests  here in D.C.? </p><p> HARF: Well, Catherine's right, this is personal for the president. And we  see him use his Twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he  has, whether it's with \"The Washington Post,\" and Jeff Bezos. This is sort  of his inner monologue coming -- made -- being made public, right?</p><p> But I think that he hasn't -- or his administration, even more importantly,  hasn't really looked at these bigger issues of tech. There actually could  be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how --  should and how -- should we and how should we regulate FaceBook, Twitter,  Amazon, Google, all of these different platforms. There's a huge  conversation we're having in our country about tech right now and the  president's playing out some personal -- personal game on Twitter, which is  frustrating to a lot of people. </p><p> WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left, Gillian. </p><p> And -- and while there is certainly some -- seems to be something between  President Trump and Jeff Bezos, there is also a policy question here, which  is that the success of these Internet companies does hurt the big box  retailers in the street. </p><p> TURNER: Yes. That's -- yes. And that's, I think to the president, this is  about the U.S. government, the postal service versus Amazon. And he's  weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal  service. </p><p> But to the tech sector and to the rest of America, this is about the future  of brick-and-mortar and retail and what happens if a player like Amazon is  forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like  to see -- to see happen? You can't put the cat back in the box and you  can't -- you can't move America away from the future of -- of online  retail. </p><p> WALLACE: All right, we'll discuss more of this, I'm sure. </p><p> Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p> Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the birth of two baby bald  eagles attracted international attention for one of D.C.'s hidden gems. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Pope Francis celebrating Easter mass this morning at the Vatican. </p><p> It's one of Washington's hidden treasures just two miles from the U.S.  Capitol Building. But as we showed you in 2016, thanks to some stars, it  has captured the world's attention. Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. RICHARD OLSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ARBORETUM: I think people are  fascinated by this because this is -- this is real, live action nature  right in front of their eyes. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen is talking about the birth of two baby  bald eaglets, events that attracted 22 million hits on Eagle Cam. </p><p> Olsen is director of the National Arboretum in Washington. And he took us  to watch the nest from a distance where the eagle family was still living. </p><p> OLSEN: What you're seeing moving is actually the mom or the dad, Mr.  President or First Lady. </p><p> WALLACE: The interest in the baby eaglets has brought more attention to the  rest of the arboretum, a huge collection of plants, trees and shrubs in the  heart of the city. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): So is this a garden or a 400-acre laboratory? </p><p> OLSEN: It's both. It's not mutually exclusive. Science occurs here every  day. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): For example, these beautiful azaleas that used to  grow only in the south, until scientists at the arboretum developed hybrids  that can thrive farther north. </p><p> OLSEN: We behave as a bumblebee and move pollen from the male to the  female, evaluate the seedlings to find the best one that combines the  traits we're looking for. </p><p> WALLACE: There's a collection of 650,000 dried fresh plants to keep a  permanent record. </p><p> OLSEN: If there's any confusion as to what scientifically a rosemary is, we  can go back to the original specimens and say, this is how the plant was  described. </p><p> WALLACE: And there's a museum of bonsai. Miniature trees Japan gave to this  country in 1976 to mark our bicentennial, including this peace tree that's  had quite a life since 1625. </p><p> OLSEN: This tree did in fact survive Hiroshima. So just a mile or more away  from the epicenter. And this tree survived the blast. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): So history, 400 years and one nuclear blast. </p><p> OLSEN: Yes, it's pretty amazing to think about. </p><p> This is my office and I obviously get to get out when I want. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen grew up loving the outdoors. </p><p> OLSEN: I was always seemed to be the kid that was out helping the parents  in the tomato garden, vegetable garden. I remember planting rhubarb in  Wisconsin and planting red tipped petunias in North Carolina. </p><p> WALLACE: There was a time when he considered a different line of work. </p><p> OLSEN: I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to be an analyst in -- for the  CIA. I read too many spy books and movies. </p><p> WALLACE: But by the end of college, he traded spy craft for seeds and he's  never looked back. </p><p> OLSEN: Our mission at the arboretum is to enhance the American landscapes.  When you walk into work and you see these trees and you think, my job is to  get people to love trees as much as I love trees, that's a -- that's pretty  noble. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: And more good news at the arboretum this week. Two new bald eagle  eggs were spotted in the nest. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a Happy Easter and Passover and a great week,  and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Happy Easter and happy Passover from FOX News in Washington.</p><p>It's been a turbulent week for President Trump's foreign policy. Russia tested a powerful new missile and responded to the U.S. expelling 60 of their diplomats by kicking out 60 of ours. Kim Jong-un made a surprise trip to China while appearing to set new conditions for talks with Mr. Trump, and the president announced he wants to pull all American forces out of Syria and is freezing recovery aid for that country.</p><p>We want to discuss all this with Senator Lindsey Graham, a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY and happy Easter.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Happy Easter. A lot to talk about.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's start with the situation in Russia -- the launch of a powerful new missile, those mass expulsions.</p><p>Here's how Russia's ambassador to the U.S. described the situation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: It seems the atmosphere in Washington is poison, is poisoned. It's a toxic atmosphere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: How serious is the split now between Moscow and Washington?</p><p>GRAHAM: I think it's pretty ironic that he used the word poison. One of the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the Russian intelligence services most likely poisoned a British citizen and his daughter, a former Russian agent in the United Kingdom. So, this is the `80s to me all over.</p><p>I can tell you what Ronald Reagan did. Every time the Russians tried to advance their military technology, we one-up to them. Every time the Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back.</p><p>So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically isolate Russia. I would study every major recipient of Russia oil and gas and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas somewhere -- from a source outside of Russia.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to pick up on the president's action because while the Trump administration has taken some actions, imposed some sanctions the week before last, President Trump himself has been reluctant to call out Vladimir Putin.</p><p>In fact, here's how we talked about his call to congratulate Putin after he won his reelection victory. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We had a very good call and I suspect that we will probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Senator, do we need a Trump-Putin summit meeting or do we need President Trump first to take some stronger actions against Russia?</p><p>GRAHAM: Let's go back to the Reagan playbook. He stood up in front of the Berlin wall and said: Tear this wall down, on the other side is an evil empire. He wound up meeting with Gorbachev to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons.</p><p>I think the problem is that Russia is running wild. Whatever we're doing is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing back against Putin directly. So, again, economic isolation of Russia. They're an oil and gas economy. They couldn't survive very long without customers.</p><p>So, if I were President Trump, Germany and Europe, I would -- France, I would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to their customers for oil and gas outside of Russia. That's what I do.</p><p>WALLACE: Speaking of summits, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un made a surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet with Chinese President Xi as Kim prepares for a summit meeting with President Trump next month. And according to the Chinese, Kim is now calling for phased synchronized moves to denuclearize his country.</p><p>Question, does that concern you that according to what the Chinese said after the meeting between Kim and Xi, that the North Korean leader Kim now wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations?</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes, it could, but let me just highlight one thing. The reason that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign against North Korea launched by the Trump administration, where the world is beginning to follow, has paid off. They're coming to the table because it has hurt so much.</p><p>And the president has called out Kim Jong-un by name for being the tyrant he is. Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean War, which is still going on. But, yes, I'd be very cautious about the terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why I like John Bolton as national security advisor. He's a very -- he has a very healthy skepticism, but I do hope President Trump will meet with North Korea.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I just want to pick up on that. You say you want to be careful about the terms of the meeting, if what Kim says he has in mind is longer negotiations, concessions on both sides, it sounds kind of like the negotiations --</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- that prior presidents have had with the North Korean regime with Kim's father.</p><p>Do we still want to have the summit?</p><p>GRAHAM: We don't want to give him nine months or year to talk and build a missile at the same time. So, I had dinner with Bolton a couple of nights ago. His big fear is that they're just buying time.</p><p>They're about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear weapon on top that can hit America. He sees these negotiations as we're (ph) buying time. That's what they've done in the past.</p><p>So, I'd cut them off at the pass there. I would make sure the negotiations were very focused and get quick action.</p><p>Here's the goal in negotiations: to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear program. Japan and South Korea, they don't have notes, there's no reason for North Korea to have a nuclear program. They'll sell anything they'll build as to their history. And maybe get a peace treaty with North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China, but not let this drag on a very long time.</p><p>WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump started talking this week about pulling all of our 2,000 troops --</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- out of Syria who are there supporting the effort against ISIS, and we learned yesterday he has frozen $200 million in funds for recovery efforts there.</p><p>Here is the president on Syria this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon. Let the other people take care of it now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Is President Trump making a mistake talking about getting out of Syria while ISIS is still alive, obviously diminished but still in the field, and while Iran is still pushing and some could say helping the Assad regime won the civil war?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, Mr. President, when it comes to Russia, read the Ronald Reagan playbook. When it comes to Syria, do not read the Obama playbook.</p><p>This is the Obama playbook, one foot in, one foot out. This is a disaster in the making.</p><p>All of his military advisors have said, we need to leave troops in Syria to work with the Kurds, calm down the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish fighters who have helped, make sure that Raqqa does not fall back into the hands of ISIL. There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around Syria. We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region.</p><p>If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran would dominate Syria.</p><p>It'd be the single worst decision the president could make. I've seen this movie before when Obama did the same thing in Iraq and quite frankly gave Assad a pass in Syria when he had them on the ropes.</p><p>We got ISIL on the ropes. If you want to let them off the ropes, remove American soldiers.</p><p>WALLACE: You have talked -- we also want to talk about some domestic issues. You have called for a second special counsel to investigate --</p><p>GRAHAM: Right.</p><p>WALLACE: -- the FBI and the Justice Department and how they conducted both the Clinton investigation and the Trump investigation. But the inspector general, who is independent, says he is looking into that and this week, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions named John Huber, the U.S. attorney from Utah, to conduct his own investigation into those matters.</p><p>Does that move satisfy you or do you still want a second special counsel?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, some people say it's a good start, some people say it's an insufficient process. I don't know yet. The jury is still out regarding Mr. Huber, but I do know this: if you tried this when it came to the Trump campaign, not appoint a special counsel but take some U.S. attorney outside of Washington and let them look at the Trump-Russia connection, the left would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel.</p><p>My belief is that there should be a special counsel. And here's the question: I want a special counsel with the same determination and resources to look at the abuses of the FISA process, was the Clinton email investigation a sham, were there conflicts of interest in the Justice Department.</p><p>I want to special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the same determination to look at those issues as is Mueller is looking at the Trump campaign. And I don't see that yet.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, you said we had a lot to cover. This week, the president fired the secretary of veterans affairs and he named the White House doctor, Admiral Ronny Jackson, to take that job, Jackson who famously gave President Trump a clean bill of health.</p><p>Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADMIRAL RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN: To answer your question, he has incredibly good genes. It's just the way god made him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: You call this a home run for veterans and there's no question that Admiral Jackson is a brilliant -- well, he's a great combat surgeon. The question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has the experience to run an agency with 360,000 employees and an annual budget of $186 billion.</p><p>Why doesn't that concern you and how much trouble do you think Admiral Jackson is going to have being confirmed?</p><p>GRAHAM: One, I think he'll get confirmed because he's made life-and-death decisions on the battlefield. He's committed medical personnel on the battlefield. He's been in the middle of this war.</p><p>I was with him a week ago, I guess two weeks ago now, at an event in Charleston and he had no idea this was coming. I had no idea it was coming. But we started talking about the Veterans Administration, and he said to me something that was very satisfying.</p><p>Somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down. Somebody needs to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get basic health care.</p><p>I want competition for the veterans health care. I want the V.A. to stay in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a facility I want the private sector to fill in that gap.</p><p>And Admiral Jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into the V.A. He's willing to fight the bureaucracy and I think Admiral Jackson is a good pick because he's been on the battlefield. He knows what the fight is all about.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Graham, thank you. Thanks for your time this holiday weekend. It was a busy set of questions and we got it all in. Always good to talk with you, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Happy Easter.</p><p>WALLACE: Happy Easter to you.</p><p>Up next, the president announces he wants to pull American troops out of Syria. We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether he's moving too fast.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the state of U.S.-Russian relations now? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTONOV: If anybody slap your check, your face, what will be reaction from your side? You will retaliate. It goes without saying.</p><p>NAUERT: Russia should not be acting like a victim. The only victims in the situation are the two victims in a hospital in the U.K. right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert continuing the two countries war of words this week.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, FOX News analyst Marie Harf, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for \"The Associated Press\", and FOX News correspondent Gillian Turner.</p><p>Well, Gillian, let me start with you. Where are we headed in relations with the Kremlin after this week and you heard from Senator Graham, what should President Trump do next?</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, all right, Chris, to lay it out right now, this investigation phase into the nerve agent attack is in full swing. Reporting this week is that the United States is sort of hand in glove with the Brits on this investigation every step of the way and some horrifying, horrifying developments coming out of that.</p><p>Just in the last 24 hours, the Brits confirmed that they believe President Putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself. They believe it's not a stand-alone event and it's part of a broader plan of a large- scale assassination plan for Russian defectors around the world. They've gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for Russian defectors living inside their borders.</p><p>It's a horrifying set of circumstances.</p><p>WALLACE: Why would they do that? I mean, what's to be gained -- I mean, I understand you don't like these people, but why is killing the person who is living as a private citizen in Salisbury, England, worth the blowback you get internationally?</p><p>TURNER: I think because according to the Putin and the KGB playbook, these are some of the worst people on earth, people who defected from the former Soviet Union, now from Russia are people that don't really deserve to live. They are enemies of the state in the truest form. And not to play pop psychology, but I think that's what motivates this.</p><p>WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel.</p><p>And on this issue of relations with Russia and the mass expulsion of diplomats, Lambert Boeman tweeted this: the only question, does this not put to bed any and all allegations of true collusion? They put him in office, to Kremlin allegedly helping Mr. Trump, to expel people?</p><p>Catherine, how do you answer Lambert and the argument that the Trump administration is taking action, the shows he's not playing ball with Putin?</p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS: The actions this week the administration took a strong stance. These are very aggressive actions. But there is a disconnect a little bit between the administration's actions and the president's public rhetoric. We haven't heard him directly challenging Putin. So, critics are still pointing to that as a cause for concern.</p><p>But in terms of collusion specifically, that's just not going to be put to rest until this investigation concludes. We still don't know where that's going and the people are still waiting to see what Mueller finds.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to turn to a different subject, and that is Mr. Trump surprise announcement this week that he is eager to pull all use U.S. troops, about 2,000 there backing up Syrian rebels, wants to pull them out of Syria and also that he has decided to freeze $200 million in U.S. recovery aid for people in the country.</p><p>Here was Mr. Trump this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are going to be coming out of there real soon. We're going to get back to our country where we belong, where we want to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman, I want to pick up on what Senator Graham said. He said that the president is -- if he follows through on this -- is making exactly the same mistake that Barack Obama made in Iraq, which is to pull U.S. forces out before the battle is won.</p><p>Is Graham right?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): Senator Graham is right. Why do you telegraph in advance what you are going to do to your enemies? And to the local people that you're working and engaging with, to signal to them that, hey, a couple weeks from now, we may not be here?</p><p>That's -- that's not a good message. I do think it's right to look at the aid portion of this and how are you going to distribute that, but I also don't think we're that close, inches away from getting rid of the caliphate and reclaiming all of the land. I just don't see that.</p><p>WALLACE: So, I mean, there didn't seem be any pressure. There was no huge call to pull U.S. troops out. How do you explain the president suddenly announcing this? He was in Ohio for an infrastructure speech, and suddenly, he says this.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: There's no way that I'm going to be able to answer that in its totality. But, look, I think his heart is in the right place. I do believe you want to get in, get your job done and get our troops home, and I think that's a good message to their military. Go in with overwhelming force, do what you need to do and come back home.</p><p>But I don't think you telegraph that in advance. And, you know, the timeline is iffy, but I think Senator Graham is right in this case.</p><p>WALLACE: I mean, it's interesting because you say don't telegraph in advance. That was one of the major points --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- that President Trump made during the campaign.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I think I said that every week, I was critical of the president -- saying, President Obama, don't do it like this.</p><p>WALLACE: Right, so is President Trump. He was saying, don't -- be unpredictable.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: Don't tell people in advance what's going to happen.</p><p>Marie, your thought about the president's apparent eagerness to get out of Syria?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: I think it would be a huge strategic mistake and not just because of the telegraphing issue, although I do agree with Congressman Chaffetz, who will fill that void if the United States is not there? Russia and Iran. And we've already seen Russia and Iran both move in increasingly into Syria. They have, you know, airbases, they have troops there, both of them do.</p><p>If the United States pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone else, we are handing that country over to the two countries we don't want to have more power in the Middle East. So, we are hearing from commanders on the ground, we are hearing from diplomats that President Trump needs to take a step back and stay in this for the long haul, whatever that means whether it's months or years. This would be a mistake and I think Republicans like Senator Graham will keep standing up and may be pushing the president in a different direction.</p><p>WALLACE: Now, I have to ask you, did you feel the same way about Barack Obama when he pulled our troops out of Iraq in 2012?</p><p>HARF: Well, I think it was a completely different strategic situation at the time. And there are --</p><p>WALLACE: Why?</p><p>HARF: The conditions on the ground quite frankly were different. And Barack Obama pulled troops out of Iraq on a timeline set by the Bush administration.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's not quite true.</p><p>HARF: Well, it is absolutely -- they negotiated the forces agreement under which those troops got pulled out and on that timeline.</p><p>WALLACE: You want to take this one on or shall I?</p><p>HARF: Well, wait, there's a question -- and Congressman Chaffetz brought it up. There's a tension between going to the American people rightly so and saying, our men and women are not going to fight indefinitely overseas, policing other countries' civil wars. There is tension between that and advocating American leadership. The balance is not always an easy one to find, but going to the infrastructure event in Ohio and saying, we're going to get out of Syria really soon sends a bad signal to the commanders and to our enemies.</p><p>WALLACE: I'm going to make an audible here. We could relitigate that, and the fact is that although there was a status of forces agreement, there's always the presumption that U.S. and Iraq were going to negotiate for troops to stay --</p><p>HARF: Maybe (ph).</p><p>WALLACE: -- and that President Obama didn't push very hard.</p><p>I want to move on to North Korea because there was an interesting -- Catherine, after Kim surprised us with the Chinese, the Chinese said that Kim is now saying -- we're not talking about a quick dismantlement like Libya did, like Gadhafi did to get rid of all of our nukes. We want phase, synchronized talks, concessions by both sides, longer negotiations.</p><p>What's the reaction in the White House to that?</p><p>LUCEY: You know, I think we're still waiting to hear how the president processes this. We haven't heard from him in the last day or two. But he said earlier this week that he was still looking forward to talks. I mean, he talked about -- he made references to this in Ohio this week.</p><p>So, we haven't heard an indication that he's not going to do this. And some of this I think is a part of sort of -- there's some public posturing that's going to keep going on I think up until this meeting potentially happens.</p><p>WALLACE: Does that concern you when you hear him talk? Because it sounds a bit like what the North Koreans have done in the past. Well, we'll give you this, you give us that, we will play along for a while and then we'll go back on our word.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: This is all moving in the right direction. I think this is one of the strongest points for President Trump and what he's done. He's put the pressure on both economically and militarily. It's pushing in the right direction.</p><p>You see that China is obviously going to play a key, key role in ultimately what happens there and us with the Japanese and the South Koreans have got to hold the line. And I do think it's important that the president meets with the leader of North Korea. I think that will be productive.</p><p>I don't think you should let off the gas at all. And certainly, the appointment of John Bolton is not going to send any signals that we're going to be softer.</p><p>WALLACE: Quick final thought, Gillian?</p><p>TURNER: I think the president changed tack this week. He shifted to what I would call a maximum pressure campaign against South Korea, which was really interesting, and threatening to tie a bilateral trade deal with them to the denuclearization issue. He's now saying to South Korea or demanding that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for this negotiation with Kim Jong-un.</p><p>And that was remarkable because I think it shows - - it shows up how little leverage we actually have against this crazy, despotic, rogue regime, North Korea. The president is sort of triangulating, as much as I hate that word, looking at the levers and saying, well, I'm not really going to get what I want from this, so I might as well push this lever and see what I can extract from South Korea.</p><p>WALLACE: And since they're meeting first, the South Koreans and North Koreans at the end of this month, he's saying, before we sign this trade deal which you guys want, let's see how much you push the North Koreans and we certainly don't want you breaking away from us.</p><p>TURNER: Yes, you said it better than I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE: Well -- all right. Thank you, panel. You'll get more time in the next panel for buttering me up.</p><p>We're going to take a break here. We'll see you a little later.</p><p>When we come back, the decision to include a question on citizenship in the 2020 census raises an uproar. We'll talk with two California officials about that and the escalating battle over its status as a sanctuary state. All of that, next.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, the Commerce Department adds a citizenship question to the 2020 census and some states are fighting back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Adding a question on citizen strip threatens to derail the integrity of the entire process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll ask two California officials what it means for their state, next.</p><p>WALLACE: A look around the world as Christians celebrate Easter.</p><p>The Trump administration announced this week the 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are U.S. citizens for the first time in 70 years, and that has started a fierce debate in California, which has voted to become a sanctuary state.</p><p>Joining me now from California, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman and the vice chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Shawn Nelson.</p><p>California's attorney general announced this week that he is suing the federal government for deciding to add that question to the census. Here was his reasoning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERA: An undercount resulting from this decision would jeopardize vital services for all Californians. It would also jeopardize our representation in government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, is Congressman Becerra wrong or, in fact, would you like to see California lose some seats in Congress and some federal money that is based on the large number of people in your state illegally?</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: Well, Attorney General Becerra, I just think is incorrect because the federal government has a right to conduct the census and there's nothing that says they can't ask any particular question. I don't want California to miss out on anything, but I think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow going to force people away from a censes, I -- I just don't buy it. The -- the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years after a person answers the census. And I think his time ought to be spent allaying the fears of people he things are going to be freaked out by having to answer questions.</p><p>WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you, though, about the practical effect of it, because it's kind of an open question as we looked into it. Even the Supreme Court has not definitively ruled.</p><p>Do you think that people who are in this country illegally should be counted when it's decided how you're going to apportion congressional seats and how you're going to divvy up federal money?</p><p>NELSON: Well, that's a great question. I mean if -- if, in the end, we essentially import a few million citizens of other countries to game the system to get extra congressional seats, I suppose that presents a big question for power in Washington, D.C. I mean we always just assumed the count is for the citizens of a country, but California, where I've lived my whole life, obviously has a little different issue. And that poses a big problem.</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, let me ask you the same question. Why should California, or any state with a sizable number of illegal immigrants in its population, benefit from that to get more federal money or to get more seats in Congress?</p><p>BRAD SHERMAN (D), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: We're often shortchanged when it comes to federal money and Congress can allocate the federal money however it chooses. The enumeration for the census is the allocation of House seats and seats in the Electoral College. And the Constitution is clear, you count all persons except Indians untaxed. Those are the words of the Constitution.</p><p>Now, if people want the change the Constitution, they -- there's a process for doing that. But instead they seem to want to thwart the Constitution, to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting all immigrants, legal and illegal. And they've got a three step program for doing that. Create massive fear, starting by calling immigrants rapists and murders, deportations. The fear in Latino and Asian communities is palpable.</p><p>Then you add this question, which the census itself, under the Trump administration says will lead to an undercount. And then you add insult to injury by saying that the reason you're doing it is to enforce the Voting Rights Act. That it's part of the Trump program for Latino empowerment. That's why they're doing it.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me --</p><p>SHERMAN: That's absolutely absurd. If you believe that, then --</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me bring Mr. Nelson in, if I can, congressman, because we do have limited amount of time.</p><p>This will be the first time that this question has been asked as a general question. It's been asked, I know (ph), to a small group of people. But as a general question in the census since 1950.</p><p>What about the argument that this is an effort by the Trump administration to depress the count by frightening illegal immigrants?</p><p>NELSON: Listen, I think that any questionnaire has the potential to be avoided. The point is to reach out to communities and encourage them to participate. There's no repercussions. This information cannot be shared. And there's no reason people shouldn't participate, unless folks go out and scare them. And I would say that what's happening on this very show the Congressman Sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything that -- that I'm seeing from -- from my end of the -- of the spectrum. I mean tell people they are protected and encourage them to participate.</p><p>My county has more poor people than most counties have people. Many of them are immigrants. We need federal money.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me -- let -- let -- I just want to ask you, Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson is exactly right, that the law expressly prohibits using, sharing, any information from the census with any government, with any court. So why should anybody be afraid? And perhaps aren't you, by talking as you are, aren't you creating that fear?</p><p>SHERMAN: I'm certainly trying not to create any fear. But the fact is immigrants come from countries with oppressive governments in many cases. And to convince them that a man who stands there and says these are rapists and murders and must be pushed out of our country should get information about who's in your family and what their immigration status is, and that a Congress that includes people that say they're rapists and murders isn't going to change the statute and use that as a deportation list, to convince someone who's lived through the terrible situations in Guatemala and Honduras, that they should go ahead and answer the census is going to be difficult. And to say that you're doing it to --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>SHERMAN: Enforce the Voting Rights Act is absolutely absurd.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to switch to the other side of this because while California is suing the federal government about including this question on the census, the federal government is suing California about its decision to enact laws that in effect make it a sanctuary state. And, in fact, the Orange County Supervisors voted this week to join the federal lawsuit against their own state of California.</p><p>Here was President Trump this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sanctuary cities, where they protect criminals. They protect murderers. They protect people that you don't want on the streets. Other places in California said, we don't want that. First time they're speaking up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, you were one of the Orange County Board of Supervisors members who voted to join a federal lawsuit against her own state. Why?</p><p>NELSON: Well, it was my idea, because we are put in an untenable position where our sheriff's deputies are precluded from talking to federal authorities if they know the authorities want to pick someone up because the person is here illegally, is charged with a crime, and our -- our people can't even talk to the federal government unless there are some exceptions that are -- that are met like they're a prior convicted felon. But we have people getting out every day that we don't want released without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released into the streets. We've had 244 people as of last week released that we could not stop and our people could not tell ICE officials that we believe ICE would have wanted to speak with and likely wanted to do something about.</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, you have said that Washington is violating the Constitution by putting this citizenship question in. But isn't California violating the Constitution by interfering with the federal government, which has supremacy when it comes to matters of immigration?</p><p>SHERMAN: Chris, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Until we get it, we'll be pulling our society apart over this issue.</p><p>WALLACE: Sir, you're not answering my question. Isn't --</p><p>SHERMAN: Now, I'll get -- I'll get --</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>SHERMAN: California is absolutely within its rights. And California has sued the Trump administration 29 times and we haven't lost once. (INAUDIBLE) the Trump administration --</p><p>WALLACE: You're not answering my question, which is, isn't immigration --</p><p>SHERMAN: I will.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's get to it, sir.</p><p>SHERMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE: We're almost done, sir.</p><p>SHERMAN: Yes. Yes. The states and the federal government share sovereignty in our federal system. That's why Obamacare couldn't force the states to expand Medicaid, even though that's the federal program that even though --</p><p>WALLACE: Now, that's the question of supremacy. And, in fact, when Arizona, went further than President Obama did, the Supreme Court said that they had overstepped their bounds. Under the supremacy clause, the federal government, what they say on immigration goes, and aren't you violating that?</p><p>SHERMAN: Federal government establishes immigration policy. But whether America -- whether California employees are going to spend California money and resources to help enforce that policy is a California decision. We will win that in court. And if the federal government can't compel states to participate in Medicaid, it can't compel states to become law enforcement authorities on immigration.</p><p>WALLACE: Of course the federal -- the Constitution didn't say anything about Medicaid, which didn't happen until the 1960s. It says something very specifically about immigration.</p><p>Mr. Nelson, I'm going to give you 30 seconds for a final thoughts.</p><p>NELSON: Right.</p><p>And, Chris, unfortunately, that's completely misleading. We don't want our people doing the federal government's job, nor do they have the time to do it. What California's law is requiring is our sheriffs not even cooperate, which is resulting in people that have committed crimes ending up on the streets of every county, but certainly Orange County. We got involved because we don't think that's right. We are tired of the state trying to use these arguments to prevent us from keeping the citizens safe.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Didn't think we were going to settle this, and we didn't.</p><p>Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson, thank you both.</p><p>NELSON: Thanks, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you for joining us today to discuss the continuing debate over immigration.</p><p>Up next, we'll bring back the panel to weigh in on the census asking people if they are U.S. citizens, and President Trump's new war on Amazon. All of that coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Every person who uses our highways or our mass transit system, counts. Everyone who relies on our government, federal, state and local, to be there when a natural disaster strike, counts.</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR., ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: They'd like to pretend that everyone here is entitled to certain government carve outs and benefits. And, of course, non-citizens are entitled to a lot of benefits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: California's attorney general and Orange County Supervisor Shawn Nelson with sharply different views on whether the 2020 census should ask people if they are U.S. citizens.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Marie, let me start with you.</p><p>Why do you think the Trump administration has decided to ask this as a general question on the census for the first time since 1950?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, it's hard to know their motivation. I know what they've said.</p><p>But for many Americans, including myself, I see this decision in the context of the divisive rhetoric about immigration, in the context of more hard line policies on deportation. And that's how, most importantly, Americans and people living in the country are seeing it.</p><p>So the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country, not just citizens, and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not get an accurate count because people are scared of what the Trump administration might do with that information.</p><p>WALLACE: Gillian, do you think that's true, that this is a conscious effort to try -- to depress voter -- response by people to the census with the expressed effort of trying to lower the amount of money that's spent on federal benefits, a apportionment of congressional seats, particularly to areas with large number of illegal immigrants, which tend to be Democratic?</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is certainly the political argument to be made about this issue. But there is, in fact, in addition to this, a much larger context at stake that gets a little bit more to the fundamentals of American democracy and how our representatives in Congress and elsewhere represent us, meaning the question -- and this is something the Supreme Court took up as recently as 2016, should congressional representative represent numbers -- equal numbers of voters in different districts, or should they represent equal number of people? In that -- the case was called -- I wrote it down so I'd remember, Evenwel versus Abbott. In that instance, they decided that folks who are not citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy decisions as people who are American citizens. That was that decision.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes. Now that, apparently -- and -- and -- and I'm just learning about that this morning. Apparently that was a decision that was more to the states and local -- localities than it was to Congress.</p><p>So the question as to whether congressional seats should be apportioned according to people or citizens, I have to say, I was shocked to learn that it might be people and not citizens.</p><p>TURNER: Well, I was -- I -- the same, considering that, you know, American members of Congress are supposed to represent the American electorate, not just any -- everybody who I thought, you know, common parlance, what we're taught in school, seems that there's a fair argument to be made for they should also be representing the interests of non-citizens. That's a bigger question.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Let's bring it to one member of Congress that's sitting at this table.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): That's ridiculous to think that we weren't going to have people that aren't Americans, that they are going to influence the vote so that California gets more?</p><p>WALLACE: But are -- you're aware that's how it's worked up until now because there's been no citizen question?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just saying, as a fundamental principle, I -- I think that's wrong.</p><p>Now, the census is going to count everybody. We're having our national debate about DACA, about immigration reform. Shouldn't we know how many people are here illegally? Of course we're going to count everybody, but we ought to know.</p><p>By the way, the biggest problem that's moving forward with the census isn't this question. And it will be on there. There's no way for the Democrats to get it off. Their way -- the biggest problem with the census is that they're going to try to do this over the Internet and through electronic machines. What -- what could possibly go wrong, Chris?</p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, what -- the debate inside the White House about this? And -- and, you know, it just seemed to come out of nowhere with Secretary of Commerce Ross announcing it this week. Had there been a lot of discussion about adding this question?</p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I know that Secretary Ross pointed to concerns about, appropriately, dealing with the Voting Rights Act. So that's kind of the -- the argument that's being made from the administration as to why this is important.</p><p>But I think also we know that all these legal challenges are already happening. A number of states are going to challenge this. And it's not clear how quickly this will be resolved. I mean so some people are saying that it's possible that this question may not end up on the census if it -- if it gets tied up for so long in the courts. So we'll have to see how it plays out.</p><p>WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump has been on a tear this week about Amazon. And here is one of his tweets, to give you a sense of what he's been talking about.</p><p>They, Amazon, pay little or no taxes to state and local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy, causing tremendous loss to the U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business.</p><p>Congressman Chaffetz, as the former chair of the House Oversight Committee, you've dealt with some of these issues. Is President Trump right or wrong?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know, I've been fond of the president and his policies, but he is fundamentally wrong on this issue. And I actually think he knows he's wrong on this issue.</p><p>The problems at the post office are rooted in the decline in first-class mail, their pension issues and how they account for -- for their medical costs. The fact that they have more customers in Amazon is a blessing and it is a good thing to the postal service.</p><p>If you look at UPS, FedEx, Amazon, they all use the postal service and you need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to -- to the post office. So it is a good thing.</p><p>I know that they -- there is a personal conflict between the president and Mr. Bezos, and that's rooted in his acquisition of \"The Washington Post.\" But you need more customers at the post office, not less.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about this question of taxes? Because I know it was true in the past that a lot of the big box brick and mortar retailers were upset that sales over the Internet, they didn't collect sales tax. But, in fact, Amazon has, I think is collecting sales tax in 45 states.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's all rooted in, do you or do you not have physical presence in these states. But quite contrary to what the president has said, Amazon has been helping to lead the charge because it's in their best economic future to have sales tax collected in these states. The Remote Transaction Parody Act, which I helped sponsor, has broad bipartisan support in both -- both bodies, in the House and the Senate, and that says that the states would get to make this determination.</p><p>So Amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes, more than they've paid before, and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of decisions. A very conservative viewpoint.</p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, why is the president so focused on Amazon right now? And is it just tweets, or is there talk in the White House of really taking action to move against Amazon?</p><p>LUCEY: Well, the White House said this week there were no specific policies on the table at this time. So you're with the obvious caveats that the president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone. As of right now, they don't appear to be signaling anything. But he does, as the congressman said, this is something that's rooted both for him I think in sort of policy and politics, but also personal. And he does find the fact that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, owns \"The Post\" deeply frustrating. Now, \"The Post\" has been very clear. Bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions. But the president does seem to lash out particularly if he's frustrated by news coverage.</p><p>WALLACE: Marie, let me ask you, because this is part of a bigger story, which is that there is a backlash against big tech. And we see it particularly with FaceBook and the role that they played with the -- with the Russian ads, the -- the role that they played with Cambridge Analytica and turning over information.</p><p>What -- what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting, not tech as an industry, but targeting Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and specifically talking about Bezos using \"The Washington Post\" to lobby for his interests here in D.C.?</p><p>HARF: Well, Catherine's right, this is personal for the president. And we see him use his Twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he has, whether it's with \"The Washington Post,\" and Jeff Bezos. This is sort of his inner monologue coming -- made -- being made public, right?</p><p>But I think that he hasn't -- or his administration, even more importantly, hasn't really looked at these bigger issues of tech. There actually could be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how -- should and how -- should we and how should we regulate FaceBook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, all of these different platforms. There's a huge conversation we're having in our country about tech right now and the president's playing out some personal -- personal game on Twitter, which is frustrating to a lot of people.</p><p>WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left, Gillian.</p><p>And -- and while there is certainly some -- seems to be something between President Trump and Jeff Bezos, there is also a policy question here, which is that the success of these Internet companies does hurt the big box retailers in the street.</p><p>TURNER: Yes. That's -- yes. And that's, I think to the president, this is about the U.S. government, the postal service versus Amazon. And he's weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal service.</p><p>But to the tech sector and to the rest of America, this is about the future of brick-and-mortar and retail and what happens if a player like Amazon is forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like to see -- to see happen? You can't put the cat back in the box and you can't -- you can't move America away from the future of -- of online retail.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we'll discuss more of this, I'm sure.</p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the birth of two baby bald eagles attracted international attention for one of D.C.'s hidden gems.</p><p>WALLACE: Pope Francis celebrating Easter mass this morning at the Vatican.</p><p>It's one of Washington's hidden treasures just two miles from the U.S. Capitol Building. But as we showed you in 2016, thanks to some stars, it has captured the world's attention. Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. RICHARD OLSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ARBORETUM: I think people are fascinated by this because this is -- this is real, live action nature right in front of their eyes.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen is talking about the birth of two baby bald eaglets, events that attracted 22 million hits on Eagle Cam.</p><p>Olsen is director of the National Arboretum in Washington. And he took us to watch the nest from a distance where the eagle family was still living.</p><p>OLSEN: What you're seeing moving is actually the mom or the dad, Mr. President or First Lady.</p><p>WALLACE: The interest in the baby eaglets has brought more attention to the rest of the arboretum, a huge collection of plants, trees and shrubs in the heart of the city.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So is this a garden or a 400-acre laboratory?</p><p>OLSEN: It's both. It's not mutually exclusive. Science occurs here every day.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): For example, these beautiful azaleas that used to grow only in the south, until scientists at the arboretum developed hybrids that can thrive farther north.</p><p>OLSEN: We behave as a bumblebee and move pollen from the male to the female, evaluate the seedlings to find the best one that combines the traits we're looking for.</p><p>WALLACE: There's a collection of 650,000 dried fresh plants to keep a permanent record.</p><p>OLSEN: If there's any confusion as to what scientifically a rosemary is, we can go back to the original specimens and say, this is how the plant was described.</p><p>WALLACE: And there's a museum of bonsai. Miniature trees Japan gave to this country in 1976 to mark our bicentennial, including this peace tree that's had quite a life since 1625.</p><p>OLSEN: This tree did in fact survive Hiroshima. So just a mile or more away from the epicenter. And this tree survived the blast.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So history, 400 years and one nuclear blast.</p><p>OLSEN: Yes, it's pretty amazing to think about.</p><p>This is my office and I obviously get to get out when I want.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen grew up loving the outdoors.</p><p>OLSEN: I was always seemed to be the kid that was out helping the parents in the tomato garden, vegetable garden. I remember planting rhubarb in Wisconsin and planting red tipped petunias in North Carolina.</p><p>WALLACE: There was a time when he considered a different line of work.</p><p>OLSEN: I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to be an analyst in -- for the CIA. I read too many spy books and movies.</p><p>WALLACE: But by the end of college, he traded spy craft for seeds and he's never looked back.</p><p>OLSEN: Our mission at the arboretum is to enhance the American landscapes. When you walk into work and you see these trees and you think, my job is to get people to love trees as much as I love trees, that's a -- that's pretty noble.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And more good news at the arboretum this week. Two new bald eagle eggs were spotted in the nest.</p><p>And that's it for today. Have a Happy Easter and Passover and a great week, and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018040101cb250</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0V-BF91-DXH2-63PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 1, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Orange County</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Arboretum</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Richard Olsen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Animals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Foreign Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kim Jong-un</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Happy Easter and happy Passover from FOX News in Washington.</p><p>It's been a turbulent week for President Trump's foreign policy. Russia tested a powerful new missile and responded to the U.S. expelling 60 of their diplomats by kicking out 60 of ours. Kim Jong-un made a surprise trip to China while appearing to set new conditions for talks with Mr. Trump, and the president announced he wants to pull all American forces out of Syria and is freezing recovery aid for that country.</p><p>We want to discuss all this with Senator Lindsey Graham, a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY and happy Easter.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Happy Easter. A lot to talk about.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's start with the situation in Russia -- the launch of a powerful new missile, those mass expulsions.</p><p>Here's how Russia's ambassador to the U.S. described the situation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: It seems the atmosphere in Washington is poison, is poisoned. It's a toxic atmosphere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: How serious is the split now between Moscow and Washington?</p><p>GRAHAM: I think it's pretty ironic that he used the word poison. One of the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the Russian intelligence services most likely poisoned a British citizen and his daughter, a former Russian agent in the United Kingdom. So, this is the `80s to me all over.</p><p>I can tell you what Ronald Reagan did. Every time the Russians tried to advance their military technology, we one-up to them. Every time the Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back.</p><p>So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically isolate Russia. I would study every major recipient of Russia oil and gas and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas somewhere -- from a source outside of Russia.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to pick up on the president's action because while the Trump administration has taken some actions, imposed some sanctions the week before last, President Trump himself has been reluctant to call out Vladimir Putin.</p><p>In fact, here's how we talked about his call to congratulate Putin after he won his reelection victory. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We had a very good call and I suspect that we will probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Senator, do we need a Trump-Putin summit meeting or do we need President Trump first to take some stronger actions against Russia?</p><p>GRAHAM: Let's go back to the Reagan playbook. He stood up in front of the Berlin wall and said: Tear this wall down, on the other side is an evil empire. He wound up meeting with Gorbachev to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons.</p><p>I think the problem is that Russia is running wild. Whatever we're doing is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing back against Putin directly. So, again, economic isolation of Russia. They're an oil and gas economy. They couldn't survive very long without customers.</p><p>So, if I were President Trump, Germany and Europe, I would -- France, I would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to their customers for oil and gas outside of Russia. That's what I do.</p><p>WALLACE: Speaking of summits, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un made a surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet with Chinese President Xi as Kim prepares for a summit meeting with President Trump next month. And according to the Chinese, Kim is now calling for phased synchronized moves to denuclearize his country.</p><p>Question, does that concern you that according to what the Chinese said after the meeting between Kim and Xi, that the North Korean leader Kim now wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations?</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes, it could, but let me just highlight one thing. The reason that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign against North Korea launched by the Trump administration, where the world is beginning to follow, has paid off. They're coming to the table because it has hurt so much.</p><p>And the president has called out Kim Jong-un by name for being the tyrant he is. Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean War, which is still going on. But, yes, I'd be very cautious about the terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why I like John Bolton as national security advisor. He's a very -- he has a very healthy skepticism, but I do hope President Trump will meet with North Korea.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, I just want to pick up on that. You say you want to be careful about the terms of the meeting, if what Kim says he has in mind is longer negotiations, concessions on both sides, it sounds kind of like the negotiations --</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- that prior presidents have had with the North Korean regime with Kim's father.</p><p>Do we still want to have the summit?</p><p>GRAHAM: We don't want to give him nine months or year to talk and build a missile at the same time. So, I had dinner with Bolton a couple of nights ago. His big fear is that they're just buying time.</p><p>They're about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear weapon on top that can hit America. He sees these negotiations as we're (ph) buying time. That's what they've done in the past.</p><p>So, I'd cut them off at the pass there. I would make sure the negotiations were very focused and get quick action.</p><p>Here's the goal in negotiations: to make sure that North Korea gives up their nuclear program. Japan and South Korea, they don't have notes, there's no reason for North Korea to have a nuclear program. They'll sell anything they'll build as to their history. And maybe get a peace treaty with North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China, but not let this drag on a very long time.</p><p>WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump started talking this week about pulling all of our 2,000 troops --</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- out of Syria who are there supporting the effort against ISIS, and we learned yesterday he has frozen $200 million in funds for recovery efforts there.</p><p>Here is the president on Syria this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon. Let the other people take care of it now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Is President Trump making a mistake talking about getting out of Syria while ISIS is still alive, obviously diminished but still in the field, and while Iran is still pushing and some could say helping the Assad regime won the civil war?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, Mr. President, when it comes to Russia, read the Ronald Reagan playbook. When it comes to Syria, do not read the Obama playbook.</p><p>This is the Obama playbook, one foot in, one foot out. This is a disaster in the making.</p><p>All of his military advisors have said, we need to leave troops in Syria to work with the Kurds, calm down the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish fighters who have helped, make sure that Raqqa does not fall back into the hands of ISIL. There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around Syria. We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region.</p><p>If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran would dominate Syria.</p><p>It'd be the single worst decision the president could make. I've seen this movie before when Obama did the same thing in Iraq and quite frankly gave Assad a pass in Syria when he had them on the ropes.</p><p>We got ISIL on the ropes. If you want to let them off the ropes, remove American soldiers.</p><p>WALLACE: You have talked -- we also want to talk about some domestic issues. You have called for a second special counsel to investigate --</p><p>GRAHAM: Right.</p><p>WALLACE: -- the FBI and the Justice Department and how they conducted both the Clinton investigation and the Trump investigation. But the inspector general, who is independent, says he is looking into that and this week, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions named John Huber, the U.S. attorney from Utah, to conduct his own investigation into those matters.</p><p>Does that move satisfy you or do you still want a second special counsel?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, some people say it's a good start, some people say it's an insufficient process. I don't know yet. The jury is still out regarding Mr. Huber, but I do know this: if you tried this when it came to the Trump campaign, not appoint a special counsel but take some U.S. attorney outside of Washington and let them look at the Trump-Russia connection, the left would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel.</p><p>My belief is that there should be a special counsel. And here's the question: I want a special counsel with the same determination and resources to look at the abuses of the FISA process, was the Clinton email investigation a sham, were there conflicts of interest in the Justice Department.</p><p>I want to special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the same determination to look at those issues as is Mueller is looking at the Trump campaign. And I don't see that yet.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, you said we had a lot to cover. This week, the president fired the secretary of veterans affairs and he named the White House doctor, Admiral Ronny Jackson, to take that job, Jackson who famously gave President Trump a clean bill of health.</p><p>Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADMIRAL RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN: To answer your question, he has incredibly good genes. It's just the way god made him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: You call this a home run for veterans and there's no question that Admiral Jackson is a brilliant -- well, he's a great combat surgeon. The question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has the experience to run an agency with 360,000 employees and an annual budget of $186 billion.</p><p>Why doesn't that concern you and how much trouble do you think Admiral Jackson is going to have being confirmed?</p><p>GRAHAM: One, I think he'll get confirmed because he's made life-and-death decisions on the battlefield. He's committed medical personnel on the battlefield. He's been in the middle of this war.</p><p>I was with him a week ago, I guess two weeks ago now, at an event in Charleston and he had no idea this was coming. I had no idea it was coming. But we started talking about the Veterans Administration, and he said to me something that was very satisfying.</p><p>Somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down. Somebody needs to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get basic health care.</p><p>I want competition for the veterans health care. I want the V.A. to stay in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a facility I want the private sector to fill in that gap.</p><p>And Admiral Jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into the V.A. He's willing to fight the bureaucracy and I think Admiral Jackson is a good pick because he's been on the battlefield. He knows what the fight is all about.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Graham, thank you. Thanks for your time this holiday weekend. It was a busy set of questions and we got it all in. Always good to talk with you, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Happy Easter.</p><p>WALLACE: Happy Easter to you.</p><p>Up next, the president announces he wants to pull American troops out of Syria. We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether he's moving too fast.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the state of U.S.-Russian relations now? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTONOV: If anybody slap your check, your face, what will be reaction from your side? You will retaliate. It goes without saying.</p><p>NAUERT: Russia should not be acting like a victim. The only victims in the situation are the two victims in a hospital in the U.K. right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert continuing the two countries war of words this week.</p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, FOX News analyst Marie Harf, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for \"The Associated Press\", and FOX News correspondent Gillian Turner.</p><p>Well, Gillian, let me start with you. Where are we headed in relations with the Kremlin after this week and you heard from Senator Graham, what should President Trump do next?</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, all right, Chris, to lay it out right now, this investigation phase into the nerve agent attack is in full swing. Reporting this week is that the United States is sort of hand in glove with the Brits on this investigation every step of the way and some horrifying, horrifying developments coming out of that.</p><p>Just in the last 24 hours, the Brits confirmed that they believe President Putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself. They believe it's not a stand-alone event and it's part of a broader plan of a large- scale assassination plan for Russian defectors around the world. They've gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for Russian defectors living inside their borders.</p><p>It's a horrifying set of circumstances.</p><p>WALLACE: Why would they do that? I mean, what's to be gained -- I mean, I understand you don't like these people, but why is killing the person who is living as a private citizen in Salisbury, England, worth the blowback you get internationally?</p><p>TURNER: I think because according to the Putin and the KGB playbook, these are some of the worst people on earth, people who defected from the former Soviet Union, now from Russia are people that don't really deserve to live. They are enemies of the state in the truest form. And not to play pop psychology, but I think that's what motivates this.</p><p>WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel.</p><p>And on this issue of relations with Russia and the mass expulsion of diplomats, Lambert Boeman tweeted this: the only question, does this not put to bed any and all allegations of true collusion? They put him in office, to Kremlin allegedly helping Mr. Trump, to expel people?</p><p>Catherine, how do you answer Lambert and the argument that the Trump administration is taking action, the shows he's not playing ball with Putin?</p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS: The actions this week the administration took a strong stance. These are very aggressive actions. But there is a disconnect a little bit between the administration's actions and the president's public rhetoric. We haven't heard him directly challenging Putin. So, critics are still pointing to that as a cause for concern.</p><p>But in terms of collusion specifically, that's just not going to be put to rest until this investigation concludes. We still don't know where that's going and the people are still waiting to see what Mueller finds.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to turn to a different subject, and that is Mr. Trump surprise announcement this week that he is eager to pull all use U.S. troops, about 2,000 there backing up Syrian rebels, wants to pull them out of Syria and also that he has decided to freeze $200 million in U.S. recovery aid for people in the country.</p><p>Here was Mr. Trump this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are going to be coming out of there real soon. We're going to get back to our country where we belong, where we want to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman, I want to pick up on what Senator Graham said. He said that the president is -- if he follows through on this -- is making exactly the same mistake that Barack Obama made in Iraq, which is to pull U.S. forces out before the battle is won.</p><p>Is Graham right?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): Senator Graham is right. Why do you telegraph in advance what you are going to do to your enemies? And to the local people that you're working and engaging with, to signal to them that, hey, a couple weeks from now, we may not be here?</p><p>That's -- that's not a good message. I do think it's right to look at the aid portion of this and how are you going to distribute that, but I also don't think we're that close, inches away from getting rid of the caliphate and reclaiming all of the land. I just don't see that.</p><p>WALLACE: So, I mean, there didn't seem be any pressure. There was no huge call to pull U.S. troops out. How do you explain the president suddenly announcing this? He was in Ohio for an infrastructure speech, and suddenly, he says this.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: There's no way that I'm going to be able to answer that in its totality. But, look, I think his heart is in the right place. I do believe you want to get in, get your job done and get our troops home, and I think that's a good message to their military. Go in with overwhelming force, do what you need to do and come back home.</p><p>But I don't think you telegraph that in advance. And, you know, the timeline is iffy, but I think Senator Graham is right in this case.</p><p>WALLACE: I mean, it's interesting because you say don't telegraph in advance. That was one of the major points --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- that President Trump made during the campaign.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I think I said that every week, I was critical of the president -- saying, President Obama, don't do it like this.</p><p>WALLACE: Right, so is President Trump. He was saying, don't -- be unpredictable.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: Don't tell people in advance what's going to happen.</p><p>Marie, your thought about the president's apparent eagerness to get out of Syria?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: I think it would be a huge strategic mistake and not just because of the telegraphing issue, although I do agree with Congressman Chaffetz, who will fill that void if the United States is not there? Russia and Iran. And we've already seen Russia and Iran both move in increasingly into Syria. They have, you know, airbases, they have troops there, both of them do.</p><p>If the United States pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone else, we are handing that country over to the two countries we don't want to have more power in the Middle East. So, we are hearing from commanders on the ground, we are hearing from diplomats that President Trump needs to take a step back and stay in this for the long haul, whatever that means whether it's months or years. This would be a mistake and I think Republicans like Senator Graham will keep standing up and may be pushing the president in a different direction.</p><p>WALLACE: Now, I have to ask you, did you feel the same way about Barack Obama when he pulled our troops out of Iraq in 2012?</p><p>HARF: Well, I think it was a completely different strategic situation at the time. And there are --</p><p>WALLACE: Why?</p><p>HARF: The conditions on the ground quite frankly were different. And Barack Obama pulled troops out of Iraq on a timeline set by the Bush administration.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's not quite true.</p><p>HARF: Well, it is absolutely -- they negotiated the forces agreement under which those troops got pulled out and on that timeline.</p><p>WALLACE: You want to take this one on or shall I?</p><p>HARF: Well, wait, there's a question -- and Congressman Chaffetz brought it up. There's a tension between going to the American people rightly so and saying, our men and women are not going to fight indefinitely overseas, policing other countries' civil wars. There is tension between that and advocating American leadership. The balance is not always an easy one to find, but going to the infrastructure event in Ohio and saying, we're going to get out of Syria really soon sends a bad signal to the commanders and to our enemies.</p><p>WALLACE: I'm going to make an audible here. We could relitigate that, and the fact is that although there was a status of forces agreement, there's always the presumption that U.S. and Iraq were going to negotiate for troops to stay --</p><p>HARF: Maybe (ph).</p><p>WALLACE: -- and that President Obama didn't push very hard.</p><p>I want to move on to North Korea because there was an interesting -- Catherine, after Kim surprised us with the Chinese, the Chinese said that Kim is now saying -- we're not talking about a quick dismantlement like Libya did, like Gadhafi did to get rid of all of our nukes. We want phase, synchronized talks, concessions by both sides, longer negotiations.</p><p>What's the reaction in the White House to that?</p><p>LUCEY: You know, I think we're still waiting to hear how the president processes this. We haven't heard from him in the last day or two. But he said earlier this week that he was still looking forward to talks. I mean, he talked about -- he made references to this in Ohio this week.</p><p>So, we haven't heard an indication that he's not going to do this. And some of this I think is a part of sort of -- there's some public posturing that's going to keep going on I think up until this meeting potentially happens.</p><p>WALLACE: Does that concern you when you hear him talk? Because it sounds a bit like what the North Koreans have done in the past. Well, we'll give you this, you give us that, we will play along for a while and then we'll go back on our word.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: This is all moving in the right direction. I think this is one of the strongest points for President Trump and what he's done. He's put the pressure on both economically and militarily. It's pushing in the right direction.</p><p>You see that China is obviously going to play a key, key role in ultimately what happens there and us with the Japanese and the South Koreans have got to hold the line. And I do think it's important that the president meets with the leader of North Korea. I think that will be productive.</p><p>I don't think you should let off the gas at all. And certainly, the appointment of John Bolton is not going to send any signals that we're going to be softer.</p><p>WALLACE: Quick final thought, Gillian?</p><p>TURNER: I think the president changed tack this week. He shifted to what I would call a maximum pressure campaign against South Korea, which was really interesting, and threatening to tie a bilateral trade deal with them to the denuclearization issue. He's now saying to South Korea or demanding that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for this negotiation with Kim Jong-un.</p><p>And that was remarkable because I think it shows - - it shows up how little leverage we actually have against this crazy, despotic, rogue regime, North Korea. The president is sort of triangulating, as much as I hate that word, looking at the levers and saying, well, I'm not really going to get what I want from this, so I might as well push this lever and see what I can extract from South Korea.</p><p>WALLACE: And since they're meeting first, the South Koreans and North Koreans at the end of this month, he's saying, before we sign this trade deal which you guys want, let's see how much you push the North Koreans and we certainly don't want you breaking away from us.</p><p>TURNER: Yes, you said it better than I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE: Well -- all right. Thank you, panel. You'll get more time in the next panel for buttering me up.</p><p>We're going to take a break here. We'll see you a little later.</p><p>When we come back, the decision to include a question on citizenship in the 2020 census raises an uproar. We'll talk with two California officials about that and the escalating battle over its status as a sanctuary state. All of that, next.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, the Commerce Department adds a citizenship question to the 2020 census and some states are fighting back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Adding a question on citizen strip threatens to derail the integrity of the entire process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll ask two California officials what it means for their state, next.</p><p>WALLACE: A look around the world as Christians celebrate Easter.</p><p>The Trump administration announced this week the 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are U.S. citizens for the first time in 70 years, and that has started a fierce debate in California, which has voted to become a sanctuary state.</p><p>Joining me now from California, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman and the vice chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Shawn Nelson.</p><p>California's attorney general announced this week that he is suing the federal government for deciding to add that question to the census. Here was his reasoning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERA: An undercount resulting from this decision would jeopardize vital services for all Californians. It would also jeopardize our representation in government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, is Congressman Becerra wrong or, in fact, would you like to see California lose some seats in Congress and some federal money that is based on the large number of people in your state illegally?</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: Well, Attorney General Becerra, I just think is incorrect because the federal government has a right to conduct the census and there's nothing that says they can't ask any particular question. I don't want California to miss out on anything, but I think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow going to force people away from a censes, I -- I just don't buy it. The -- the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years after a person answers the census. And I think his time ought to be spent allaying the fears of people he things are going to be freaked out by having to answer questions.</p><p>WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you, though, about the practical effect of it, because it's kind of an open question as we looked into it. Even the Supreme Court has not definitively ruled.</p><p>Do you think that people who are in this country illegally should be counted when it's decided how you're going to apportion congressional seats and how you're going to divvy up federal money?</p><p>NELSON: Well, that's a great question. I mean if -- if, in the end, we essentially import a few million citizens of other countries to game the system to get extra congressional seats, I suppose that presents a big question for power in Washington, D.C. I mean we always just assumed the count is for the citizens of a country, but California, where I've lived my whole life, obviously has a little different issue. And that poses a big problem.</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, let me ask you the same question. Why should California, or any state with a sizable number of illegal immigrants in its population, benefit from that to get more federal money or to get more seats in Congress?</p><p>BRAD SHERMAN (D), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: We're often shortchanged when it comes to federal money and Congress can allocate the federal money however it chooses. The enumeration for the census is the allocation of House seats and seats in the Electoral College. And the Constitution is clear, you count all persons except Indians untaxed. Those are the words of the Constitution.</p><p>Now, if people want the change the Constitution, they -- there's a process for doing that. But instead they seem to want to thwart the Constitution, to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting all immigrants, legal and illegal. And they've got a three step program for doing that. Create massive fear, starting by calling immigrants rapists and murders, deportations. The fear in Latino and Asian communities is palpable.</p><p>Then you add this question, which the census itself, under the Trump administration says will lead to an undercount. And then you add insult to injury by saying that the reason you're doing it is to enforce the Voting Rights Act. That it's part of the Trump program for Latino empowerment. That's why they're doing it.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me --</p><p>SHERMAN: That's absolutely absurd. If you believe that, then --</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me bring Mr. Nelson in, if I can, congressman, because we do have limited amount of time.</p><p>This will be the first time that this question has been asked as a general question. It's been asked, I know (ph), to a small group of people. But as a general question in the census since 1950.</p><p>What about the argument that this is an effort by the Trump administration to depress the count by frightening illegal immigrants?</p><p>NELSON: Listen, I think that any questionnaire has the potential to be avoided. The point is to reach out to communities and encourage them to participate. There's no repercussions. This information cannot be shared. And there's no reason people shouldn't participate, unless folks go out and scare them. And I would say that what's happening on this very show the Congressman Sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything that -- that I'm seeing from -- from my end of the -- of the spectrum. I mean tell people they are protected and encourage them to participate.</p><p>My county has more poor people than most counties have people. Many of them are immigrants. We need federal money.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me -- let -- let -- I just want to ask you, Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson is exactly right, that the law expressly prohibits using, sharing, any information from the census with any government, with any court. So why should anybody be afraid? And perhaps aren't you, by talking as you are, aren't you creating that fear?</p><p>SHERMAN: I'm certainly trying not to create any fear. But the fact is immigrants come from countries with oppressive governments in many cases. And to convince them that a man who stands there and says these are rapists and murders and must be pushed out of our country should get information about who's in your family and what their immigration status is, and that a Congress that includes people that say they're rapists and murders isn't going to change the statute and use that as a deportation list, to convince someone who's lived through the terrible situations in Guatemala and Honduras, that they should go ahead and answer the census is going to be difficult. And to say that you're doing it to --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>SHERMAN: Enforce the Voting Rights Act is absolutely absurd.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to switch to the other side of this because while California is suing the federal government about including this question on the census, the federal government is suing California about its decision to enact laws that in effect make it a sanctuary state. And, in fact, the Orange County Supervisors voted this week to join the federal lawsuit against their own state of California.</p><p>Here was President Trump this week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sanctuary cities, where they protect criminals. They protect murderers. They protect people that you don't want on the streets. Other places in California said, we don't want that. First time they're speaking up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, you were one of the Orange County Board of Supervisors members who voted to join a federal lawsuit against her own state. Why?</p><p>NELSON: Well, it was my idea, because we are put in an untenable position where our sheriff's deputies are precluded from talking to federal authorities if they know the authorities want to pick someone up because the person is here illegally, is charged with a crime, and our -- our people can't even talk to the federal government unless there are some exceptions that are -- that are met like they're a prior convicted felon. But we have people getting out every day that we don't want released without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released into the streets. We've had 244 people as of last week released that we could not stop and our people could not tell ICE officials that we believe ICE would have wanted to speak with and likely wanted to do something about.</p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, you have said that Washington is violating the Constitution by putting this citizenship question in. But isn't California violating the Constitution by interfering with the federal government, which has supremacy when it comes to matters of immigration?</p><p>SHERMAN: Chris, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Until we get it, we'll be pulling our society apart over this issue.</p><p>WALLACE: Sir, you're not answering my question. Isn't --</p><p>SHERMAN: Now, I'll get -- I'll get --</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>SHERMAN: California is absolutely within its rights. And California has sued the Trump administration 29 times and we haven't lost once. (INAUDIBLE) the Trump administration --</p><p>WALLACE: You're not answering my question, which is, isn't immigration --</p><p>SHERMAN: I will.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's get to it, sir.</p><p>SHERMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE: We're almost done, sir.</p><p>SHERMAN: Yes. Yes. The states and the federal government share sovereignty in our federal system. That's why Obamacare couldn't force the states to expand Medicaid, even though that's the federal program that even though --</p><p>WALLACE: Now, that's the question of supremacy. And, in fact, when Arizona, went further than President Obama did, the Supreme Court said that they had overstepped their bounds. Under the supremacy clause, the federal government, what they say on immigration goes, and aren't you violating that?</p><p>SHERMAN: Federal government establishes immigration policy. But whether America -- whether California employees are going to spend California money and resources to help enforce that policy is a California decision. We will win that in court. And if the federal government can't compel states to participate in Medicaid, it can't compel states to become law enforcement authorities on immigration.</p><p>WALLACE: Of course the federal -- the Constitution didn't say anything about Medicaid, which didn't happen until the 1960s. It says something very specifically about immigration.</p><p>Mr. Nelson, I'm going to give you 30 seconds for a final thoughts.</p><p>NELSON: Right.</p><p>And, Chris, unfortunately, that's completely misleading. We don't want our people doing the federal government's job, nor do they have the time to do it. What California's law is requiring is our sheriffs not even cooperate, which is resulting in people that have committed crimes ending up on the streets of every county, but certainly Orange County. We got involved because we don't think that's right. We are tired of the state trying to use these arguments to prevent us from keeping the citizens safe.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Didn't think we were going to settle this, and we didn't.</p><p>Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson, thank you both.</p><p>NELSON: Thanks, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you for joining us today to discuss the continuing debate over immigration.</p><p>Up next, we'll bring back the panel to weigh in on the census asking people if they are U.S. citizens, and President Trump's new war on Amazon. All of that coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Every person who uses our highways or our mass transit system, counts. Everyone who relies on our government, federal, state and local, to be there when a natural disaster strike, counts.</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR., ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: They'd like to pretend that everyone here is entitled to certain government carve outs and benefits. And, of course, non-citizens are entitled to a lot of benefits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: California's attorney general and Orange County Supervisor Shawn Nelson with sharply different views on whether the 2020 census should ask people if they are U.S. citizens.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Marie, let me start with you.</p><p>Why do you think the Trump administration has decided to ask this as a general question on the census for the first time since 1950?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, it's hard to know their motivation. I know what they've said.</p><p>But for many Americans, including myself, I see this decision in the context of the divisive rhetoric about immigration, in the context of more hard line policies on deportation. And that's how, most importantly, Americans and people living in the country are seeing it.</p><p>So the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country, not just citizens, and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not get an accurate count because people are scared of what the Trump administration might do with that information.</p><p>WALLACE: Gillian, do you think that's true, that this is a conscious effort to try -- to depress voter -- response by people to the census with the expressed effort of trying to lower the amount of money that's spent on federal benefits, a apportionment of congressional seats, particularly to areas with large number of illegal immigrants, which tend to be Democratic?</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is certainly the political argument to be made about this issue. But there is, in fact, in addition to this, a much larger context at stake that gets a little bit more to the fundamentals of American democracy and how our representatives in Congress and elsewhere represent us, meaning the question -- and this is something the Supreme Court took up as recently as 2016, should congressional representative represent numbers -- equal numbers of voters in different districts, or should they represent equal number of people? In that -- the case was called -- I wrote it down so I'd remember, Evenwel versus Abbott. In that instance, they decided that folks who are not citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy decisions as people who are American citizens. That was that decision.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes. Now that, apparently -- and -- and -- and I'm just learning about that this morning. Apparently that was a decision that was more to the states and local -- localities than it was to Congress.</p><p>So the question as to whether congressional seats should be apportioned according to people or citizens, I have to say, I was shocked to learn that it might be people and not citizens.</p><p>TURNER: Well, I was -- I -- the same, considering that, you know, American members of Congress are supposed to represent the American electorate, not just any -- everybody who I thought, you know, common parlance, what we're taught in school, seems that there's a fair argument to be made for they should also be representing the interests of non-citizens. That's a bigger question.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>WALLACE: Let's bring it to one member of Congress that's sitting at this table.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): That's ridiculous to think that we weren't going to have people that aren't Americans, that they are going to influence the vote so that California gets more?</p><p>WALLACE: But are -- you're aware that's how it's worked up until now because there's been no citizen question?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just saying, as a fundamental principle, I -- I think that's wrong.</p><p>Now, the census is going to count everybody. We're having our national debate about DACA, about immigration reform. Shouldn't we know how many people are here illegally? Of course we're going to count everybody, but we ought to know.</p><p>By the way, the biggest problem that's moving forward with the census isn't this question. And it will be on there. There's no way for the Democrats to get it off. Their way -- the biggest problem with the census is that they're going to try to do this over the Internet and through electronic machines. What -- what could possibly go wrong, Chris?</p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, what -- the debate inside the White House about this? And -- and, you know, it just seemed to come out of nowhere with Secretary of Commerce Ross announcing it this week. Had there been a lot of discussion about adding this question?</p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I know that Secretary Ross pointed to concerns about, appropriately, dealing with the Voting Rights Act. So that's kind of the -- the argument that's being made from the administration as to why this is important.</p><p>But I think also we know that all these legal challenges are already happening. A number of states are going to challenge this. And it's not clear how quickly this will be resolved. I mean so some people are saying that it's possible that this question may not end up on the census if it -- if it gets tied up for so long in the courts. So we'll have to see how it plays out.</p><p>WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump has been on a tear this week about Amazon. And here is one of his tweets, to give you a sense of what he's been talking about.</p><p>They, Amazon, pay little or no taxes to state and local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy, causing tremendous loss to the U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business.</p><p>Congressman Chaffetz, as the former chair of the House Oversight Committee, you've dealt with some of these issues. Is President Trump right or wrong?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know, I've been fond of the president and his policies, but he is fundamentally wrong on this issue. And I actually think he knows he's wrong on this issue.</p><p>The problems at the post office are rooted in the decline in first-class mail, their pension issues and how they account for -- for their medical costs. The fact that they have more customers in Amazon is a blessing and it is a good thing to the postal service.</p><p>If you look at UPS, FedEx, Amazon, they all use the postal service and you need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to -- to the post office. So it is a good thing.</p><p>I know that they -- there is a personal conflict between the president and Mr. Bezos, and that's rooted in his acquisition of \"The Washington Post.\" But you need more customers at the post office, not less.</p><p>WALLACE: And what about this question of taxes? Because I know it was true in the past that a lot of the big box brick and mortar retailers were upset that sales over the Internet, they didn't collect sales tax. But, in fact, Amazon has, I think is collecting sales tax in 45 states.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's all rooted in, do you or do you not have physical presence in these states. But quite contrary to what the president has said, Amazon has been helping to lead the charge because it's in their best economic future to have sales tax collected in these states. The Remote Transaction Parody Act, which I helped sponsor, has broad bipartisan support in both -- both bodies, in the House and the Senate, and that says that the states would get to make this determination.</p><p>So Amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes, more than they've paid before, and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of decisions. A very conservative viewpoint.</p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, why is the president so focused on Amazon right now? And is it just tweets, or is there talk in the White House of really taking action to move against Amazon?</p><p>LUCEY: Well, the White House said this week there were no specific policies on the table at this time. So you're with the obvious caveats that the president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone. As of right now, they don't appear to be signaling anything. But he does, as the congressman said, this is something that's rooted both for him I think in sort of policy and politics, but also personal. And he does find the fact that Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, owns \"The Post\" deeply frustrating. Now, \"The Post\" has been very clear. Bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions. But the president does seem to lash out particularly if he's frustrated by news coverage.</p><p>WALLACE: Marie, let me ask you, because this is part of a bigger story, which is that there is a backlash against big tech. And we see it particularly with FaceBook and the role that they played with the -- with the Russian ads, the -- the role that they played with Cambridge Analytica and turning over information.</p><p>What -- what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting, not tech as an industry, but targeting Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and specifically talking about Bezos using \"The Washington Post\" to lobby for his interests here in D.C.?</p><p>HARF: Well, Catherine's right, this is personal for the president. And we see him use his Twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he has, whether it's with \"The Washington Post,\" and Jeff Bezos. This is sort of his inner monologue coming -- made -- being made public, right?</p><p>But I think that he hasn't -- or his administration, even more importantly, hasn't really looked at these bigger issues of tech. There actually could be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how -- should and how -- should we and how should we regulate FaceBook, Twitter, Amazon, Google, all of these different platforms. There's a huge conversation we're having in our country about tech right now and the president's playing out some personal -- personal game on Twitter, which is frustrating to a lot of people.</p><p>WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left, Gillian.</p><p>And -- and while there is certainly some -- seems to be something between President Trump and Jeff Bezos, there is also a policy question here, which is that the success of these Internet companies does hurt the big box retailers in the street.</p><p>TURNER: Yes. That's -- yes. And that's, I think to the president, this is about the U.S. government, the postal service versus Amazon. And he's weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal service.</p><p>But to the tech sector and to the rest of America, this is about the future of brick-and-mortar and retail and what happens if a player like Amazon is forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like to see -- to see happen? You can't put the cat back in the box and you can't -- you can't move America away from the future of -- of online retail.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we'll discuss more of this, I'm sure.</p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the birth of two baby bald eagles attracted international attention for one of D.C.'s hidden gems.</p><p>WALLACE: Pope Francis celebrating Easter mass this morning at the Vatican.</p><p>It's one of Washington's hidden treasures just two miles from the U.S. Capitol Building. But as we showed you in 2016, thanks to some stars, it has captured the world's attention. Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. RICHARD OLSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ARBORETUM: I think people are fascinated by this because this is -- this is real, live action nature right in front of their eyes.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen is talking about the birth of two baby bald eaglets, events that attracted 22 million hits on Eagle Cam.</p><p>Olsen is director of the National Arboretum in Washington. And he took us to watch the nest from a distance where the eagle family was still living.</p><p>OLSEN: What you're seeing moving is actually the mom or the dad, Mr. President or First Lady.</p><p>WALLACE: The interest in the baby eaglets has brought more attention to the rest of the arboretum, a huge collection of plants, trees and shrubs in the heart of the city.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So is this a garden or a 400-acre laboratory?</p><p>OLSEN: It's both. It's not mutually exclusive. Science occurs here every day.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): For example, these beautiful azaleas that used to grow only in the south, until scientists at the arboretum developed hybrids that can thrive farther north.</p><p>OLSEN: We behave as a bumblebee and move pollen from the male to the female, evaluate the seedlings to find the best one that combines the traits we're looking for.</p><p>WALLACE: There's a collection of 650,000 dried fresh plants to keep a permanent record.</p><p>OLSEN: If there's any confusion as to what scientifically a rosemary is, we can go back to the original specimens and say, this is how the plant was described.</p><p>WALLACE: And there's a museum of bonsai. Miniature trees Japan gave to this country in 1976 to mark our bicentennial, including this peace tree that's had quite a life since 1625.</p><p>OLSEN: This tree did in fact survive Hiroshima. So just a mile or more away from the epicenter. And this tree survived the blast.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So history, 400 years and one nuclear blast.</p><p>OLSEN: Yes, it's pretty amazing to think about.</p><p>This is my office and I obviously get to get out when I want.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen grew up loving the outdoors.</p><p>OLSEN: I was always seemed to be the kid that was out helping the parents in the tomato garden, vegetable garden. I remember planting rhubarb in Wisconsin and planting red tipped petunias in North Carolina.</p><p>WALLACE: There was a time when he considered a different line of work.</p><p>OLSEN: I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to be an analyst in -- for the CIA. I read too many spy books and movies.</p><p>WALLACE: But by the end of college, he traded spy craft for seeds and he's never looked back.</p><p>OLSEN: Our mission at the arboretum is to enhance the American landscapes. When you walk into work and you see these trees and you think, my job is to get people to love trees as much as I love trees, that's a -- that's pretty noble.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And more good news at the arboretum this week. Two new bald eagle eggs were spotted in the nest.</p><p>And that's it for today. Have a Happy Easter and Passover and a great week, and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018040101cb250</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0V-BF91-DXH2-63PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 1, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lawsuits</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Orange County</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Arboretum</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Richard Olsen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Animals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Foreign Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kim Jong-un</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Happy Easter and happy Passover from FOX News in  Washington.  </p><p>It's been a turbulent week for President Trump's foreign policy.  Russia  tested a powerful new missile and responded to the U.S. expelling 60 of  their diplomats by kicking out 60 of ours.  Kim Jong-un made a surprise  trip to China while appearing to set new conditions for talks with Mr.  Trump, and the president announced he wants to pull all American forces out  of Syria and is freezing recovery aid for that country.  </p><p>We want to discuss all this with Senator Lindsey Graham, a key member of  the Senate Armed Services Committee.  </p><p>Senator, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY and happy Easter.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Happy Easter.   A lot to talk about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, let's start with the situation in Russia -- the launch of a  powerful new missile, those mass expulsions.  </p><p>Here's how Russia's ambassador to the U.S. described the situation.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.:  It seems the atmosphere  in Washington is poison, is poisoned.  It's a toxic atmosphere.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  How serious is the split now between Moscow and Washington?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think it's pretty ironic that he used the word poison.  One of  the reasons we are expelling diplomats is because the Russian intelligence  services most likely poisoned a British citizen and his daughter, a former  Russian agent in the United Kingdom.  So, this is the '80s to me all over.  </p><p>I can tell you what Ronald Reagan did.  Every time the Russians tried to  advance their military technology, we one-up to them.  Every time the  Russians started running wild throughout the world, Reagan pushed back.  </p><p>So, if I were Trump, I'd look at the Reagan playbook and economically  isolate Russia.  I would study every major recipient of Russia oil and gas  and see if we could find ways to supply those countries with oil and gas  somewhere -- from a source outside of Russia.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to pick up on the president's action because while the  Trump administration has taken some actions, imposed some sanctions the  week before last, President Trump himself has been reluctant to call out  Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>In fact, here's how we talked about his call to congratulate Putin after he  won his reelection victory.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We had a very good call and I suspect that we will probably be  meeting in the not-too-distant future to discuss the arms race.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Senator, do we need a Trump-Putin summit meeting or do we need  President Trump first to take some stronger actions against Russia?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Let's go back to the Reagan playbook.  He stood up in front of the  Berlin wall and said: Tear this wall down, on the other side is an evil  empire.  He wound up meeting with Gorbachev to try to reduce the number of  nuclear weapons.  </p><p>I think the problem is that Russia is running wild.  Whatever we're doing  is not working and the president for some reason has a hard time pushing  back against Putin directly.  So, again, economic isolation of Russia.   They're an oil and gas economy.  They couldn't survive very long without  customers.  </p><p>So, if I were President Trump, Germany and Europe, I would -- France, I  would try to cut off all of their customers and provide alternatives to  their customers for oil and gas outside of Russia.  That's what I do.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Speaking of summits, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un made a  surprise visit to Beijing this week to meet with Chinese President Xi as  Kim prepares for a summit meeting with President Trump next month.  And  according to the Chinese, Kim is now calling for phased synchronized moves  to denuclearize his country.  </p><p>Question, does that concern you that according to what the Chinese said  after the meeting between Kim and Xi, that the North Korean leader Kim now  wants concessions from both sides and longer negotiations?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes, it could, but let me just highlight one thing.  The reason  that North Korea is at the table is that this maximum pressure campaign  against North Korea launched by the Trump administration, where the world  is beginning to follow, has paid off.  They're coming to the table because  it has hurt so much.  </p><p>And the president has called out Kim Jong-un by name for being the tyrant  he is.  Now, we've got an opportunity, historic in nature, to sit down and  maybe not only get him to give up his nuclear weapons but to end the Korean  War, which is still going on.  But, yes, I'd be very cautious about the  terms and conditions of this meeting and this is why I like John Bolton as  national security advisor.  He's a very -- he has a very healthy  skepticism, but I do hope President Trump will meet with North Korea.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, I just want to pick up on that.  You say you want to be  careful about the terms of the meeting, if what Kim says he has in mind is  longer negotiations, concessions on both sides, it sounds kind of like the  negotiations --  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- that prior presidents have had with the North Korean regime  with Kim's father.  </p><p>Do we still want to have the summit?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  We don't want to give him nine months or year to talk and build a  missile at the same time.  So, I had dinner with Bolton a couple of nights  ago.  His big fear is that they're just buying time.  </p><p>They're about nine months to a year away of having a missile with a nuclear  weapon on top that can hit America.  He sees these negotiations as we're  (ph) buying time.  That's what they've done in the past.  </p><p>So, I'd cut them off at the pass there.  I would make sure the negotiations  were very focused and get quick action.  </p><p>Here's the goal in negotiations: to make sure that North Korea gives up  their nuclear program.  Japan and South Korea, they don't have notes,  there's no reason for North Korea to have a nuclear program.  They'll sell  anything they'll build as to their history.  And maybe get a peace treaty  with North Korea, South Korea, the United States and China, but not let  this drag on a very long time.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Meanwhile, President Trump started talking this week about  pulling all of our 2,000 troops --  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- out of Syria who are there supporting the effort against ISIS,  and we learned yesterday he has frozen $200 million in funds for recovery  efforts there. </p><p>Here is the president on Syria this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We'll be coming out of Syria like very soon.  Let the other people  take care of it now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Is President Trump making a mistake talking about getting out of  Syria while ISIS is still alive, obviously diminished but still in the  field, and while Iran is still pushing and some could say helping the Assad  regime won the civil war?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, Mr. President, when it comes to Russia, read the Ronald  Reagan playbook.  When it comes to Syria, do not read the Obama playbook.  </p><p>This is the Obama playbook, one foot in, one foot out.  This is a disaster  in the making.  </p><p>All of his military advisors have said, we need to leave troops in Syria to  work with the Kurds, calm down the conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish  fighters who have helped, make sure that Raqqa does not fall back into the  hands of ISIL.  There are over 3,000 ISIS fighters still roaming around  Syria.  We've got troops there to protect us and to protect the region.  </p><p>If we withdrew our troops anytime soon, ISIS would come back, the war  between Turkey and the Kurds would get out of hand, and you'd be giving  Damascus to the Iranians without an American presence, and Russia and Iran  would dominate Syria.  </p><p>It'd be the single worst decision the president could make.  I've seen this  movie before when Obama did the same thing in Iraq and quite frankly gave  Assad a pass in Syria when he had them on the ropes.  </p><p>We got ISIL on the ropes.  If you want to let them off the ropes, remove  American soldiers.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You have talked -- we also want to talk about some domestic  issues.  You have called for a second special counsel to investigate --  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Right.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- the FBI and the Justice Department and how they conducted both  the Clinton investigation and the Trump investigation.  But the inspector  general, who is independent, says he is looking into that and this week,  the Attorney General Jeff Sessions named John Huber, the U.S. attorney from  Utah, to conduct his own investigation into those matters.  </p><p>Does that move satisfy you or do you still want a second special counsel?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, some people say it's a good start, some people say it's an  insufficient process.  I don't know yet.  The jury is still out regarding  Mr. Huber, but I do know this: if you tried this when it came to the Trump  campaign, not appoint a special counsel but take some U.S. attorney outside  of Washington and let them look at the Trump-Russia connection, the left  would have went crazy saying this deserves a special counsel.  </p><p>My belief is that there should be a special counsel.  And here's the  question: I want a special counsel with the same determination and  resources to look at the abuses of the FISA process, was the Clinton email  investigation a sham, were there conflicts of interest in the Justice  Department.  </p><p>I want to special counsel to be appointed with the same resources and the  same determination to look at those issues as is Mueller is looking at the  Trump campaign.  And I don't see that yet.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Finally, you said we had a lot to cover.  This week, the  president fired the secretary of veterans affairs and he named the White  House doctor, Admiral Ronny Jackson, to take that job, Jackson who famously  gave President Trump a clean bill of health.  </p><p>Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADMIRAL RONNY JACKSON, WHITE HOUSE PHYSICIAN:  To answer your question, he  has incredibly good genes.  It's just the way god made him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  You call this a home run for veterans and there's no question  that Admiral Jackson is a brilliant -- well, he's a great combat surgeon.   The question that everybody is raising is whether or not he is equipped has  the experience to run an agency with 360,000 employees and an annual budget  of $186 billion.  </p><p>Why doesn't that concern you and how much trouble do you think Admiral  Jackson is going to have being confirmed?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  One, I think he'll get confirmed because he's made life-and-death  decisions on the battlefield.  He's committed medical personnel on the  battlefield.  He's been in the middle of this war.  </p><p>I was with him a week ago, I guess two weeks ago now, at an event in  Charleston and he had no idea this was coming.  I had no idea it was  coming.  But we started talking about the Veterans Administration, and he  said to me something that was very satisfying.  </p><p>Somebody needs to take that place and turn it upside down.  Somebody needs  to make sure that no veteran has to wait too long or drive too far to get  basic health care.  </p><p>I want competition for the veterans health care.  I want the V.A. to stay  in existence but if a veteran waits too long or lives too far away from a  facility I want the private sector to fill in that gap.</p><p>And Admiral Jackson has that same mentality and he need somebody to go into  the V.A.  He's willing to fight the bureaucracy and I think Admiral Jackson  is a good pick because he's been on the battlefield.  He knows what the  fight is all about.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you.  Thanks for your time this holiday  weekend.  It was a busy set of questions and we got it all in.  Always good  to talk with you, sir.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Happy Easter.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Happy Easter to you.  </p><p>Up next, the president announces he wants to pull American troops out of  Syria.  We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether he's moving too  fast.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the state of U.S.-Russian  relations now?  Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may  use your question on the air.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTONOV:  If anybody slap your check, your face, what will be reaction from  your side?  You will retaliate.  It goes without saying.  </p><p>NAUERT:  Russia should not be acting like a victim.  The only victims in  the situation are the two victims in a hospital in the U.K. right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov and State Department  Spokeswoman Heather Nauert continuing the two countries war of words this  week.  </p><p>And it's time now for our Sunday group.  Former Republican Congressman  Jason Chaffetz, FOX News analyst Marie Harf, Catherine Lucey, who covers  the White House for \"The Associated Press\", and FOX News correspondent  Gillian Turner.  </p><p>Well, Gillian, let me start with you.  Where are we headed in relations  with the Kremlin after this week and you heard from Senator Graham, what  should President Trump do next?  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, all right, Chris, to lay it  out right now, this investigation phase into the nerve agent attack is in  full swing.  Reporting this week is that the United States is sort of hand  in glove with the Brits on this investigation every step of the way and  some horrifying, horrifying developments coming out of that.  </p><p>Just in the last 24 hours, the Brits confirmed that they believe President  Putin at some point directly authorized this attack himself.  They believe  it's not a stand-alone event and it's part of a broader plan of a large- scale assassination plan for Russian defectors around the world.  They've  gone so far as to warn partner nations they should amp up security for  Russian defectors living inside their borders.  </p><p>It's a horrifying set of circumstances.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Why would they do that?  I mean, what's to be gained -- I mean, I  understand you don't like these people, but why is killing the person who  is living as a private citizen in Salisbury, England, worth the blowback  you get internationally?  </p><p>TURNER:  I think because according to the Putin and the KGB playbook, these  are some of the worst people on earth, people who defected from the former  Soviet Union, now from Russia are people that don't really deserve to live.   They are enemies of the state in the truest form.  And not to play pop  psychology, but I think that's what motivates this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel.</p><p>And on this issue of relations with Russia and the mass expulsion of  diplomats, Lambert Boeman tweeted this: the only question, does this not  put to bed any and all allegations of true collusion?  They put him in  office, to Kremlin allegedly helping Mr. Trump, to expel people?  </p><p>Catherine, how do you answer Lambert and the argument that the Trump  administration is taking action, the shows he's not playing ball with  Putin?  </p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  The actions this week the  administration took a strong stance.  These are very aggressive actions.   But there is a disconnect a little bit between the administration's actions  and the president's public rhetoric.  We haven't heard him directly  challenging Putin.  So, critics are still pointing to that as a cause for  concern.  </p><p>But in terms of collusion specifically, that's just not going to be put to  rest until this investigation concludes.  We still don't know where that's  going and the people are still waiting to see what Mueller finds.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to a different subject, and that is Mr. Trump  surprise announcement this week that he is eager to pull all use U.S.  troops, about 2,000 there backing up Syrian rebels, wants to pull them out  of Syria and also that he has decided to freeze $200 million in U.S.  recovery aid for people in the country.  </p><p>Here was Mr. Trump this week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are going to be coming out of there real soon.  We're going to  get back to our country where we belong, where we want to be.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Congressman, I want to pick up on what Senator Graham said.  He  said that the president is -- if he follows through on this -- is making  exactly the same mistake that Barack Obama made in Iraq, which is to pull  U.S. forces out before the battle is won.  </p><p>Is Graham right?  </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT):  Senator Graham is right.   Why do you telegraph in advance what you are going to do to your enemies?   And to the local people that you're working and engaging with, to signal to  them that, hey, a couple weeks from now, we may not be here?  </p><p>That's -- that's not a good message.  I do think it's right to look at the  aid portion of this and how are you going to distribute that, but I also  don't think we're that close, inches away from getting rid of the caliphate  and reclaiming all of the land.  I just don't see that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, I mean, there didn't seem be any pressure.  There was no huge  call to pull U.S. troops out.  How do you explain the president suddenly  announcing this?  He was in Ohio for an infrastructure speech, and  suddenly, he says this.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  There's no way that I'm going to be able to answer that in its  totality.  But, look, I think his heart is in the right place.  I do  believe you want to get in, get your job done and get our troops home, and  I think that's a good message to their military.  Go in with overwhelming  force, do what you need to do and come back home.  </p><p>But I don't think you telegraph that in advance.  And, you know, the  timeline is iffy, but I think Senator Graham is right in this case.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I mean, it's interesting because you say don't telegraph in  advance.  That was one of the major points --  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- that President Trump made during the campaign.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I think I said that every week, I was critical of the president  -- saying, President Obama, don't do it like this.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Right, so is President Trump.  He was saying, don't -- be  unpredictable.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  Don't tell people in advance what's going to happen.  </p><p>Marie, your thought about the president's apparent eagerness to get out of  Syria?  </p><p>MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  I think it would be a  huge strategic mistake and not just because of the telegraphing issue,  although I do agree with Congressman Chaffetz, who will fill that void if  the United States is not there?  Russia and Iran.  And we've already seen  Russia and Iran both move in increasingly into Syria.  They have, you know,  airbases, they have troops there, both of them do.  </p><p>If the United States pulled back and leaves the reconstruction to someone  else, we are handing that country over to the two countries we don't want  to have more power in the Middle East.  So, we are hearing from commanders  on the ground, we are hearing from diplomats that President Trump needs to  take a step back and stay in this for the long haul, whatever that means  whether it's months or years.  This would be a mistake and I think  Republicans like Senator Graham will keep standing up and may be pushing  the president in a different direction.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Now, I have to ask you, did you feel the same way about Barack  Obama when he pulled our troops out of Iraq in 2012?  </p><p>HARF:  Well, I think it was a completely different strategic situation at  the time.  And there are --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Why?</p><p>HARF:  The conditions on the ground quite frankly were different.  And  Barack Obama pulled troops out of Iraq on a timeline set by the Bush  administration.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Well, that's not quite true.  </p><p>HARF:  Well, it is absolutely -- they negotiated the forces agreement under  which those troops got pulled out and on that timeline.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You want to take this one on or shall I?  </p><p>HARF:  Well, wait, there's a question -- and Congressman Chaffetz brought  it up.  There's a tension between going to the American people rightly so  and saying, our men and women are not going to fight indefinitely overseas,  policing other countries' civil wars.  There is tension between that and  advocating American leadership.  The balance is not always an easy one to  find, but going to the infrastructure event in Ohio and saying, we're going  to get out of Syria really soon sends a bad signal to the commanders and to  our enemies.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I'm going to make an audible here.  We could relitigate that, and  the fact is that although there was a status of forces agreement, there's  always the presumption that U.S. and Iraq were going to negotiate for  troops to stay --  </p><p>HARF:  Maybe (ph).</p><p>WALLACE:  -- and that President Obama didn't push very hard.  </p><p>I want to move on to North Korea because there was an interesting --  Catherine, after Kim surprised us with the Chinese, the Chinese said that  Kim is now saying --  we're not talking about a quick dismantlement like  Libya did, like Gadhafi did to get rid of all of our nukes.  We want phase,  synchronized talks, concessions by both sides, longer negotiations.  </p><p>What's the reaction in the White House to that?  </p><p>LUCEY:  You know, I think we're still waiting to hear how the president  processes this.  We haven't heard from him in the last day or two.  But he  said earlier this week that he was still looking forward to talks.  I mean,  he talked about -- he made references to this in Ohio this week.  </p><p>So, we haven't heard an indication that he's not going to do this.  And  some of this I think is a part of sort of -- there's some public posturing  that's going to keep going on I think up until this meeting potentially  happens.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Does that concern you when you hear him talk?  Because it sounds  a bit like what the North Koreans have done in the past.  Well, we'll give  you this, you give us that, we will play along for a while and then we'll  go back on our word.  </p><p>CHAFFETZ:  This is all moving in the right direction.  I think this is one  of the strongest points for President Trump and what he's done.  He's put  the pressure on both economically and militarily.  It's pushing in the  right direction.  </p><p>You see that China is obviously going to play a key, key role in ultimately  what happens there and us with the Japanese and the South Koreans have got  to hold the line.  And I do think it's important that the president meets  with the leader of North Korea.  I think that will be productive.  </p><p>I don't think you should let off the gas at all.  And certainly, the  appointment of John Bolton is not going to send any signals that we're  going to be softer.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Quick final thought, Gillian?  </p><p>TURNER:  I think the president changed tack this week.  He shifted to what  I would call a maximum pressure campaign against South Korea, which was  really interesting, and threatening to tie a bilateral trade deal with them  to the denuclearization issue.  He's now saying to South Korea or demanding  that they deliver some results before he even sits down at the table for  this negotiation with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>And that was remarkable because I think it shows - - it shows up how little  leverage we actually have against this crazy, despotic, rogue regime, North  Korea.  The president is sort of triangulating, as much as I hate that  word, looking at the levers and saying, well, I'm not really going to get  what I want from this, so I might as well push this lever and see what I  can extract from South Korea.  </p><p>WALLACE:  And since they're meeting first, the South Koreans and North  Koreans at the end of this month, he's saying, before we sign this trade  deal which you guys want, let's see how much you push the North Koreans and  we certainly don't want you breaking away from us.  </p><p>TURNER:  Yes, you said it better than I did.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALLACE:  Well -- all right.  Thank you, panel.  You'll get more time in  the next panel for buttering me up.  </p><p>We're going to take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.</p><p>When we come back, the decision to include a question on citizenship in the  2020 census raises an uproar.  We'll talk with two California officials  about that and the escalating battle over its status as a sanctuary state.   All of that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  Coming up, the Commerce Department adds a citizenship question to  the 2020 census and some states are fighting back.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Adding a question on  citizen strip threatens to derail the integrity of the entire process.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  We'll ask two California officials what it means for their state,  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE:  A look around the world as Christians celebrate Easter.  </p><p>The Trump administration announced this week the 2020 census will ask  respondents whether they are U.S. citizens for the first time in 70 years,  and that has started a fierce debate in California, which has voted to  become a sanctuary state.</p><p>Joining me now from California, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman and the  vice chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Shawn Nelson. </p><p>California's attorney general announced this week that he is suing the  federal government for deciding to add that question to the census. Here  was his reasoning. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERA: An undercount resulting  from this decision would jeopardize vital services for all Californians. It  would also jeopardize our representation in government. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, is Congressman Becerra wrong or, in fact, would you  like to see California lose some seats in Congress and some federal money  that is based on the large number of people in your state illegally? </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: Well,  Attorney General Becerra, I just think is incorrect because the federal  government has a right to conduct the census and there's nothing that says  they can't ask any particular question. I don't want California to miss out  on anything, but I think that hysteria than answering questions is somehow  going to force people away from a censes, I -- I just don't buy it. The --  the government is precluded from sharing that information for 72 years  after a person answers the census. And I think his time ought to be spent  allaying the fears of people he things are going to be freaked out by  having to answer questions. </p><p>WALLACE: Let -- let me ask you, though, about the practical effect of it,  because it's kind of an open question as we looked into it. Even the  Supreme Court has not definitively ruled. </p><p>Do you think that people who are in this country illegally should be  counted when it's decided how you're going to apportion congressional seats  and how you're going to divvy up federal money? </p><p>NELSON: Well, that's a great question. I mean if -- if, in the end, we  essentially import a few million citizens of other countries to game the  system to get extra congressional seats, I suppose that presents a big  question for power in Washington, D.C. I mean we always just assumed the  count is for the citizens of a country, but California, where I've lived my  whole life, obviously has a little different issue. And that poses a big  problem. </p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, let me ask you the same question. Why should  California, or any state with a sizable number of illegal immigrants in its  population, benefit from that to get more federal money or to get more  seats in Congress? </p><p>BRAD SHERMAN (D), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN: We're often shortchanged when it  comes to federal money and Congress can allocate the federal money however  it chooses. The enumeration for the census is the allocation of House seats  and seats in the Electoral College. And the Constitution is clear, you  count all persons except Indians untaxed. Those are the words of the  Constitution. </p><p>Now, if people want the change the Constitution, they -- there's a process  for doing that. But instead they seem to want to thwart the Constitution,  to achieve their results without an amendment by deliberately undercounting  all immigrants, legal and illegal. And they've got a three step program for  doing that. Create massive fear, starting by calling immigrants rapists and  murders, deportations. The fear in Latino and Asian communities is  palpable. </p><p>Then you add this question, which the census itself, under the Trump  administration says will lead to an undercount. And then you add insult to  injury by saying that the reason you're doing it is to enforce the Voting  Rights Act. That it's part of the Trump program for Latino empowerment.  That's why they're doing it.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me --</p><p>SHERMAN: That's absolutely absurd. If you believe that, then --</p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me bring Mr. Nelson in, if I can, congressman,  because we do have limited amount of time. </p><p>This will be the first time that this question has been asked as a general  question. It's been asked, I know (ph), to a small group of people. But as  a general question in the census since 1950. </p><p>What about the argument that this is an effort by the Trump administration  to depress the count by frightening illegal immigrants? </p><p>NELSON: Listen, I think that any questionnaire has the potential to be  avoided. The point is to reach out to communities and encourage them to  participate. There's no repercussions. This information cannot be shared.  And there's no reason people shouldn't participate, unless folks go out and  scare them. And I would say that what's happening on this very show the  Congressman Sherman might have more to do with scaring them than anything  that -- that I'm seeing from -- from my end of the -- of the spectrum. I  mean tell people they are protected and encourage them to participate. </p><p>My county has more poor people than most counties have people. Many of them  are immigrants. We need federal money. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me -- let me -- let -- let -- I just want to ask you,  Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson is exactly right, that the law expressly  prohibits using, sharing, any information from the census with any  government, with any court. So why should anybody be afraid? And perhaps  aren't you, by talking as you are, aren't you creating that fear? </p><p>SHERMAN: I'm certainly trying not to create any fear. But the fact is  immigrants come from countries with oppressive governments in many cases.  And to convince them that a man who stands there and says these are rapists  and murders and must be pushed out of our country should get information  about who's in your family and what their immigration status is, and that a  Congress that includes people that say they're rapists and murders isn't  going to change the statute and use that as a deportation list, to convince  someone who's lived through the terrible situations in Guatemala and  Honduras, that they should go ahead and answer the census is going to be  difficult. And to say that you're doing it to --</p><p>WALLACE: All right.</p><p>SHERMAN: Enforce the Voting Rights Act is absolutely absurd. </p><p>WALLACE: I want to switch to the other side of this because while  California is suing the federal government about including this question on  the census, the federal government is suing California about its decision  to enact laws that in effect make it a sanctuary state. And, in fact, the  Orange County Supervisors voted this week to join the federal lawsuit  against their own state of California. </p><p>Here was President Trump this week. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sanctuary cities, where they  protect criminals. They protect murderers. They protect people that you  don't want on the streets. Other places in California said, we don't want  that. First time they're speaking up. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Nelson, you were one of the Orange County Board of Supervisors  members who voted to join a federal lawsuit against her own state. Why? </p><p>NELSON: Well, it was my idea, because we are put in an untenable position  where our sheriff's deputies are precluded from talking to federal  authorities if they know the authorities want to pick someone up because  the person is here illegally, is charged with a crime, and our -- our  people can't even talk to the federal government unless there are some  exceptions that are -- that are met like they're a prior convicted felon.  But we have people getting out every day that we don't want released  without the federal government at least having an opportunity to put hands  on and make their own decision whether these people ought to be released  into the streets. We've had 244 people as of last week released that we  could not stop and our people could not tell ICE officials that we believe  ICE would have wanted to speak with and likely wanted to do something  about. </p><p>WALLACE: Congressman Sherman, you have said that Washington is violating  the Constitution by putting this citizenship question in. But isn't  California violating the Constitution by interfering with the federal  government, which has supremacy when it comes to matters of immigration? </p><p>SHERMAN: Chris, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Until we get it,  we'll be pulling our society apart over this issue. </p><p>WALLACE: Sir, you're not answering my question. Isn't --</p><p>SHERMAN: Now, I'll get -- I'll get --</p><p>WALLACE: OK.</p><p>SHERMAN: California is absolutely within its rights. And California has  sued the Trump administration 29 times and we haven't lost once.  (INAUDIBLE) the Trump administration --</p><p>WALLACE: You're not answering my question, which is, isn't immigration -- </p><p>SHERMAN: I will. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, let's get to it, sir.</p><p>SHERMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>WALLACE: We're almost done, sir. </p><p>SHERMAN: Yes. Yes. The states and the federal government share sovereignty  in our federal system. That's why Obamacare couldn't force the states to  expand Medicaid, even though that's the federal program that even though --</p><p>WALLACE: Now, that's the question of supremacy. And, in fact, when Arizona,  went further than President Obama did, the Supreme Court said that they had  overstepped their bounds. Under the supremacy clause, the federal  government, what they say on immigration goes, and aren't you violating  that? </p><p>SHERMAN: Federal government establishes immigration policy. But whether  America -- whether California employees are going to spend California money  and resources to help enforce that policy is a California decision. We will  win that in court. And if the federal government can't compel states to  participate in Medicaid, it can't compel states to become law enforcement  authorities on immigration. </p><p>WALLACE: Of course the federal -- the Constitution didn't say anything  about Medicaid, which didn't happen until the 1960s. It says something very  specifically about immigration. </p><p>Mr. Nelson, I'm going to give you 30 seconds for a final thoughts. </p><p>NELSON: Right. </p><p>And, Chris, unfortunately, that's completely misleading. We don't want our  people doing the federal government's job, nor do they have the time to do  it. What California's law is requiring is our sheriffs not even cooperate,  which is resulting in people that have committed crimes ending up on the  streets of every county, but certainly Orange County. We got involved  because we don't think that's right. We are tired of the state trying to  use these arguments to prevent us from keeping the citizens safe.</p><p>WALLACE: All right, we're going to have to leave it there. Didn't think we  were going to settle this, and we didn't. </p><p>Congressman Sherman, Mr. Nelson, thank you both.</p><p>NELSON: Thanks, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Thank you for joining us today to discuss the continuing debate  over immigration.</p><p>Up next, we'll bring back the panel to weigh in on the census asking people  if they are U.S. citizens, and President Trump's new war on Amazon. All of  that coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Every person who uses our  highways or our mass transit system, counts. Everyone who relies on our  government, federal, state and local, to be there when a natural disaster  strike, counts. </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIR., ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: They'd like  to pretend that everyone here is entitled to certain government carve outs  and benefits. And, of course, non-citizens are entitled to a lot of  benefits. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: California's attorney general and Orange County Supervisor Shawn  Nelson with sharply different views on whether the 2020 census should ask  people if they are U.S. citizens. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel. </p><p>Well, Marie, let me start with you. </p><p>Why do you think the Trump administration has decided to ask this as a  general question on the census for the first time since 1950? </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, it's hard to know their motivation. I  know what they've said. </p><p>But for many Americans, including myself, I see this decision in the  context of the divisive rhetoric about immigration, in the context of more  hard line policies on deportation. And that's how, most importantly,  Americans and people living in the country are seeing it. </p><p>So the point of the census is to take account of everyone in the country,  not just citizens, and there are many people on both sides of the aisle who  firmly believe that this question will depress turnout and that we will not  get an accurate count because people are scared of what the Trump  administration might do with that information. </p><p>WALLACE: Gillian, do you think that's true, that this is a conscious effort  to try -- to depress voter -- response by people to the census with the  expressed effort of trying to lower the amount of money that's spent on  federal benefits, a apportionment of congressional seats, particularly to  areas with large number of illegal immigrants, which tend to be Democratic? </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is certainly the  political argument to be made about this issue. But there is, in fact, in  addition to this, a much larger context at stake that gets a little bit  more to the fundamentals of American democracy and how our representatives  in Congress and elsewhere represent us, meaning the question -- and this is  something the Supreme Court took up as recently as 2016, should  congressional representative represent numbers -- equal numbers of voters  in different districts, or should they represent equal number of people? In  that -- the case was called -- I wrote it down so I'd remember, Evenwel  versus Abbott. In that instance, they decided that folks who are not  citizens have as much equity and should have as much say in these policy  decisions as people who are American citizens. That was that decision.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes. Now that, apparently -- and -- and -- and I'm just learning  about that this morning. Apparently that was a decision that was more to  the states and local -- localities than it was to Congress. </p><p>So the question as to whether congressional seats should be apportioned  according to people or citizens, I have to say, I was shocked to learn that  it might be people and not citizens. </p><p>TURNER: Well, I was -- I -- the same, considering that, you know, American  members of Congress are supposed to represent the American electorate, not  just any -- everybody who I thought, you know, common parlance, what we're  taught in school, seems that there's a fair argument to be made for they  should also be representing the interests of non-citizens. That's a bigger  question.</p><p>(CROSS TALK) </p><p>WALLACE: Let's bring it to one member of Congress that's sitting at this  table. </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT): That's ridiculous to think  that we weren't going to have people that aren't Americans, that they are  going to influence the vote so that California gets more? </p><p>WALLACE: But are -- you're aware that's how it's worked up until now  because there's been no citizen question? </p><p>CHAFFETZ: I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just saying, as a fundamental principle, I  -- I think that's wrong. </p><p>Now, the census is going to count everybody. We're having our national  debate about DACA, about immigration reform. Shouldn't we know how many  people are here illegally? Of course we're going to count everybody, but we  ought to know. </p><p>By the way, the biggest problem that's moving forward with the census isn't  this question. And it will be on there. There's no way for the Democrats to  get it off. Their way -- the biggest problem with the census is that  they're going to try to do this over the Internet and through electronic  machines. What -- what could possibly go wrong, Chris? </p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, what -- the debate inside the White House about this?  And -- and, you know, it just seemed to come out of nowhere with Secretary  of Commerce Ross announcing it this week. Had there been a lot of  discussion about adding this question? </p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I know that Secretary Ross pointed to  concerns about, appropriately, dealing with the Voting Rights Act. So  that's kind of the -- the argument that's being made from the  administration as to why this is important. </p><p>But I think also we know that all these legal challenges are already  happening. A number of states are going to challenge this. And it's not  clear how quickly this will be resolved. I mean so some people are saying  that it's possible that this question may not end up on the census if it --  if it gets tied up for so long in the courts. So we'll have to see how it  plays out. </p><p>WALLACE: Meanwhile, President Trump has been on a tear this week about  Amazon. And here is one of his tweets, to give you a sense of what he's  been talking about. </p><p>They, Amazon, pay little or no taxes to state and local governments, use  our postal system as their delivery boy, causing tremendous loss to the  U.S., and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business. </p><p>Congressman Chaffetz, as the former chair of the House Oversight Committee,  you've dealt with some of these issues. Is President Trump right or wrong?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know, I've been fond of the president and his policies, but  he is fundamentally wrong on this issue. And I actually think he knows he's  wrong on this issue. </p><p>The problems at the post office are rooted in the decline in first-class  mail, their pension issues and how they account for -- for their medical  costs. The fact that they have more customers in Amazon is a blessing and  it is a good thing to the postal service. </p><p>If you look at UPS, FedEx, Amazon, they all use the postal service and you  need them to actually boost up the numbers that are coming in to -- to the  post office. So it is a good thing. </p><p>I know that they -- there is a personal conflict between the president and  Mr. Bezos, and that's rooted in his acquisition of \"The Washington Post.\"  But you need more customers at the post office, not less. </p><p>WALLACE: And what about this question of taxes? Because I know it was true  in the past that a lot of the big box brick and mortar retailers were upset  that sales over the Internet, they didn't collect sales tax. But, in fact,  Amazon has, I think is collecting sales tax in 45 states. </p><p>CHAFFETZ: It's all rooted in, do you or do you not have physical presence  in these states. But quite contrary to what the president has said, Amazon  has been helping to lead the charge because it's in their best economic  future to have sales tax collected in these states. The Remote Transaction  Parody Act, which I helped sponsor, has broad bipartisan support in both --  both bodies, in the House and the Senate, and that says that the states  would get to make this determination. </p><p>So Amazon is paying quite a bit of taxes, more than they've paid before,  and they want each of the states to be able to make these types of  decisions. A very conservative viewpoint. </p><p>WALLACE: Catherine, why is the president so focused on Amazon right now?  And is it just tweets, or is there talk in the White House of really taking  action to move against Amazon? </p><p>LUCEY: Well, the White House said this week there were no specific policies  on the table at this time. So you're with the obvious caveats that the  president sometimes makes policy without telling anyone. As of right now,  they don't appear to be signaling anything. But he does, as the congressman  said, this is something that's rooted both for him I think in sort of  policy and politics, but also personal. And he does find the fact that Jeff  Bezos, Amazon's founder, owns \"The Post\" deeply frustrating. Now, \"The  Post\" has been very clear. Bezos is not involved in journalistic decisions.  But the president does seem to lash out particularly if he's frustrated by  news coverage. </p><p>WALLACE: Marie, let me ask you, because this is part of a bigger story,  which is that there is a backlash against big tech. And we see it  particularly with FaceBook and the role that they played with the -- with  the Russian ads, the -- the role that they played with Cambridge Analytica  and turning over information. </p><p>What -- what are your thoughts about why the president is targeting, not  tech as an industry, but targeting Amazon and Jeff Bezos, and specifically  talking about Bezos using \"The Washington Post\" to lobby for his interests  here in D.C.? </p><p>HARF: Well, Catherine's right, this is personal for the president. And we  see him use his Twitter feed to sort of hash out personal issues that he  has, whether it's with \"The Washington Post,\" and Jeff Bezos. This is sort  of his inner monologue coming -- made -- being made public, right?</p><p>But I think that he hasn't -- or his administration, even more importantly,  hasn't really looked at these bigger issues of tech. There actually could  be some good work if they stepped back from the personal and said how --  should and how -- should we and how should we regulate FaceBook, Twitter,  Amazon, Google, all of these different platforms. There's a huge  conversation we're having in our country about tech right now and the  president's playing out some personal -- personal game on Twitter, which is  frustrating to a lot of people. </p><p>WALLACE: I've got less than a minute left, Gillian. </p><p>And -- and while there is certainly some -- seems to be something between  President Trump and Jeff Bezos, there is also a policy question here, which  is that the success of these Internet companies does hurt the big box  retailers in the street. </p><p>TURNER: Yes. That's -- yes. And that's, I think to the president, this is  about the U.S. government, the postal service versus Amazon. And he's  weighing in and putting his finger on the scale in favor of the postal  service. </p><p>But to the tech sector and to the rest of America, this is about the future  of brick-and-mortar and retail and what happens if a player like Amazon is  forced to bear out some of the consequences that the president would like  to see -- to see happen? You can't put the cat back in the box and you  can't -- you can't move America away from the future of -- of online  retail. </p><p>WALLACE: All right, we'll discuss more of this, I'm sure. </p><p>Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week.\" How the birth of two baby bald  eagles attracted international attention for one of D.C.'s hidden gems. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Pope Francis celebrating Easter mass this morning at the Vatican. </p><p>It's one of Washington's hidden treasures just two miles from the U.S.  Capitol Building. But as we showed you in 2016, thanks to some stars, it  has captured the world's attention. Here's our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. RICHARD OLSEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ARBORETUM: I think people are  fascinated by this because this is -- this is real, live action nature  right in front of their eyes. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen is talking about the birth of two baby  bald eaglets, events that attracted 22 million hits on Eagle Cam. </p><p>Olsen is director of the National Arboretum in Washington. And he took us  to watch the nest from a distance where the eagle family was still living. </p><p>OLSEN: What you're seeing moving is actually the mom or the dad, Mr.  President or First Lady. </p><p>WALLACE: The interest in the baby eaglets has brought more attention to the  rest of the arboretum, a huge collection of plants, trees and shrubs in the  heart of the city. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So is this a garden or a 400-acre laboratory? </p><p>OLSEN: It's both. It's not mutually exclusive. Science occurs here every  day. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): For example, these beautiful azaleas that used to  grow only in the south, until scientists at the arboretum developed hybrids  that can thrive farther north. </p><p>OLSEN: We behave as a bumblebee and move pollen from the male to the  female, evaluate the seedlings to find the best one that combines the  traits we're looking for. </p><p>WALLACE: There's a collection of 650,000 dried fresh plants to keep a  permanent record. </p><p>OLSEN: If there's any confusion as to what scientifically a rosemary is, we  can go back to the original specimens and say, this is how the plant was  described. </p><p>WALLACE: And there's a museum of bonsai. Miniature trees Japan gave to this  country in 1976 to mark our bicentennial, including this peace tree that's  had quite a life since 1625. </p><p>OLSEN: This tree did in fact survive Hiroshima. So just a mile or more away  from the epicenter. And this tree survived the blast. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): So history, 400 years and one nuclear blast. </p><p>OLSEN: Yes, it's pretty amazing to think about. </p><p>This is my office and I obviously get to get out when I want. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Richard Olsen grew up loving the outdoors. </p><p>OLSEN: I was always seemed to be the kid that was out helping the parents  in the tomato garden, vegetable garden. I remember planting rhubarb in  Wisconsin and planting red tipped petunias in North Carolina. </p><p>WALLACE: There was a time when he considered a different line of work. </p><p>OLSEN: I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to be an analyst in -- for the  CIA. I read too many spy books and movies. </p><p>WALLACE: But by the end of college, he traded spy craft for seeds and he's  never looked back. </p><p>OLSEN: Our mission at the arboretum is to enhance the American landscapes.  When you walk into work and you see these trees and you think, my job is to  get people to love trees as much as I love trees, that's a -- that's pretty  noble. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And more good news at the arboretum this week. Two new bald eagle  eggs were spotted in the nest. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a Happy Easter and Passover and a great week,  and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It`s MEET THE PRESS.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, this is MEET THE PRESS WITH CHUCK TODD.</p><p>TODD: Good Sunday morning.</p><p>Right now, President Trump has an opportunity for one of those leadership moments on the issue of guns. But once again, he seems distracted by the Russia investigation. Apparently rattled by the release of a Democratic memo challenging Republican allegations of misconduct in the FBI`s Russia probe, Mr. Trump sent out five tweets yesterday and felt the need to call into Fox News late last night to insist once again that there was no collusion, once again, that he did nothing wrong, and to once again, blame the election interference on President Obama.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Because everybody`s looking, there is no collusion. No phone calls, I had no phone calls, no meetings, no nothing. There is no collusion.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Phone calls, by the way, is a new denial for the president, as far as the specifics are concerned. The president may have reason to be rattled. In the last ten days, the Mueller probe has intensified with more indictments and more guilty pleas, plural.</p><p>But the national conversation right now is on guns and the NRA is the one in the hot seat, with more than a dozen companies cutting ties this weekend with the gun lobby.</p><p>The NRA has lashed out at the boycott, calling it a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.</p><p>Still, you have a president with an A-plus rating from the NRA who says he`s open to new gun restrictions, including one that the NRA opposes.</p><p>And you have a Republican governor with an A-plus rating from the NRA defying the gun lobby and going further on gun control than Republicans went after Sandy Hook.</p><p>There are few things more polarizing in this country than the gun debate. And both parties must now decide what, if anything, their bases can support or stomach.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: They want to do things that you wouldn`t even believe, including taking your Second Amendment rights away.</p><p>TODD: President Trump caught between a growing movement of grieving parents and students --</p><p>SAMUEL ZEIF, DOUGLAS STONEMAN STUDENT: How have we not stopped this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook?</p><p>TODD: -- and its conservative base.</p><p>TRUMP: The NRA, they`re friends of mine, they backed us all. They`re great people.</p><p>TODD: This week, Mr. Trump appeared open to modest gun reforms, including a bill that would reward states that improve reporting to the FBI`s background check system, a ban on bump stocks, though that would likely be challenged in court, and raising the minimum age to buy an AR-15.</p><p>TRUMP: We`re going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18.</p><p>TODD: The NRA opposes that change. But faced with protests and boycotts - -</p><p>STUDENT PROTESTORS: Hey, hey, NRA, you can`t beat the PTA (ph)!</p><p>TODD: -- several Republican lawmakers, including Florida`s governor, are bucking the gun lobby.</p><p>SCOTT: We will require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older.</p><p>TODD: But just like on immigration, where a long White House listening session produced little action, the devil is in the details. And Mr. Trump has so far refused to talk legislative specifics. Instead, pivoting the debate to arming teachers.</p><p>TRUMP: The teacher would`ve shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.</p><p>TODD: And that`s not the only talking point Mr. Trump has borrowed from the NRA.</p><p>WAYNE LAPIERRE, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: We must immediately harden our schools.</p><p>TRUMP: And I want to harden the school too. Harden. Into a hardened, hardened, hardened, a hardened school.</p><p>TODD: According to a Pew poll last year, twice as many gun owners said they had contacted a public official on the issue of guns than non-gun owners. But there are signals Republicans in suburban districts may sense a change in the political climate. A Florida congressman, whose district Mr. Trump won by nine points, came out in favor of an assault weapons ban on Friday.</p><p>REP. BRIAN MAST (R), FLORIDA: I spent my life trying to defend this country and I can`t stand to see the weapon that I carried, in order to -- in defense of this country, used to kill -- used to kill kids.</p><p>TODD: Still, most red state and rural Democrats are wary of the gun issue, worrying it will energize the Republican base. Five senators who caucus with the Democrats voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013. And they`re on the ballot this year. And Democrat Conor Lamb, running in the Pennsylvania special election, where voters go to the polls in just over two weeks, made it clear he does not want to run on gun control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So the majority of Americans who tell Pew and other pollsters that they`re in favor of banning assault weapons, you do not support that?</p><p>CONOR LAMB (D-PA), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: I do not support that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Joining me now is Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. He was the Republican leader of the last bipartisan effort in Congress in an attempt to reform gun laws. That, of course, didn`t pass.</p><p>Senator Toomey, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, sir.</p><p>SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Good morning, Chuck. Thanks for having me.</p><p>TODD: Let me start with your bill and what we know about the shooter down in south Florida. There was a lot of information the school system had. There was a lot of information that were called into authorities about the mental stability or instability of this young man.</p><p>TOOMEY: Right.</p><p>TODD: But there`s no part of the law that would have mandated that information make it into the background check system. How would your bill deal with that?</p><p>TOOMEY: It wouldn`t. You know, the fact is the bill that Joe Manchin and I introduced and that we still support, Chuck, it`s not going to solve all the problems and we never suggest that it would.</p><p>And one of the challenges that we face is what to do about someone who is clearly mentally deranged, but they haven`t acted out yet in a way that allows you to adjudicate them as dangerously mentally ill or they haven`t committed a crime. Clearly, in this case, there were all kinds of warning signs that were advertised, right? That were communicated.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>TOOMEY: And nothing was done. That`s a problem.</p><p>I think there`s an important discussion to be had about a temporary restraining order on somebody who`s evidencing some serious dangerous behavior. There would have to be due process --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>TOOMEY: -- so that that couldn`t be used as a weapon against someone inappropriately.</p><p>But, look, our legislation I think would be very constructive. I still support it. But I`m not going to suggest it would solve all problems.</p><p>TODD: No I understand that. I guess the question then is, should school information be temporarily put in the system. So for instance, he was expelled. Does the fact that he was expelled -- do you put that in the system say for a five-year period, so that, you know, he could be caught in the system, an extra -- maybe an extra interview by the FBI? Or an extra interview by authorities if he attempts to purchase a weapon?</p><p>TOOMEY: Yes, I`m not sure that expulsion from school is sufficient. I imagine there could be all kinds of -- cheating on a test, for instance --</p><p>TODD: Sure.</p><p>TOOMEY: -- you know, I don`t know what kind of circumstances might cause an expulsion. That really doesn`t suggest that this is a dangerous person who shouldn`t have Second Amendment rights. So I`m not sure that`s the right criteria.</p><p>But look, we have a lot of gun sales in America today, for which there is no background check whatsoever. And this is one of the things that Senator Manchin and I are trying to address. Let`s at least require a background check for all commercial sales. That`s what our legislation attempts to do by requiring background checks at sales at gun shows, or over the Internet.</p><p>We`d also our legislation would encourage states to provide the information to the background check system so that the information would be there. And we also create a commission to study this kind of, these massacres, this mass violence. I think it`s overdue, and I still hope we can succeed with another run at it. TODD: Senator, John Cornyn, the Republican -- the number two Republican in the Senate, he has a Fix NICS bill.</p><p>TOOMEY: Right.</p><p>TODD: He says basically, hinting that whether it`s your measure or even another that the president wants to put out there, raising the age on getting assault weapons to 21. That it doesn`t have the votes in the Senate. Is he right? Does your bill not have the 60 votes?</p><p>TOOMEY: We don`t know the answer to that, Chuck. I`ve spent a lot of hours on the phone and communicating in other ways with my colleagues this week. I do think there are some members who were not supportive in the past who are reconsidering. I haven`t got anyone who said, yes, sign me up, Pat.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>TOOMEY: But there are definitely members who are reconsidering. The president`s expression of support for strengthening our background check system is very constructive. The president can play a huge and in fact probably decisive role in this.</p><p>So, I intend to give this another shot.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this. On the idea of raising the age on assault weapons from 18 to 21, are you personally supportive of that?</p><p>TOOMEY: I`m very skeptical about that, because the vast majority of 18, 19, 20, 21-year olds are law-abiding citizens who aren`t a threat to anyone. So I`m skeptical about that. I`m willing to hear the other side on this, but I`m skeptical.</p><p>TODD: Go -- what about the AR-15 specifically? I mean, is there an argument to be made that something that powerful, you know, you could make an exception for some hunting rifles, but that one, that powerful.</p><p>TOOMEY: Here`s the problem, Chuck. There`s a lot of hunting rifles that are as powerful as an AR-15. The difference between the AR-15 and an awful lot of commonly sold rifles is just cosmetic. You know, it`s got a grip under the barrel and it`s painted black. That is -- that doesn`t change its lethality.</p><p>TODD: I want to ask you about the failures of law enforcement down in South Florida. The failures, whether it`s the FBI, the Broward County sheriff`s office, does that in your mind reinforce the notion that the background check system needs to be fixed? We need another fail-safe because you can`t always count on law enforcement to be there, or does that reinforce this notion that more people need to be armed?</p><p>TOOMEY: These are not mutually exclusive, Chuck. I think this is a case where an armed guard appears to have really, really failed to do his job, as best as we know so far. I think we need an investigation on that. But certainly, I don`t think that would be the typical response of an armed guard, and it certainly is not the typical response of law enforcement and trained first responders we have all over the country.</p><p>So, I think having properly trained capable people in vulnerable settings will enhance security, but I still believe that we absolutely should tighten up our background check system. So I think both are, you know, sensible steps.</p><p>TODD: You`re opened to arm -- having some teachers be armed?</p><p>TOOMEY: Under some circumstances. I`d leave it to the individual school districts and the states. I will tell you, in Pennsylvania, there are school districts where there are a number of teachers who are extensively trained there. They`re ex-military. They would be comfortable and they would be -- it would be suitable. I certainly wouldn`t impose it on a school that didn`t wish to do that.</p><p>TODD: I want to get you to respond to something that the NRA`s Wayne LaPierre said in a speech over the weekend. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAPIERRE: The elites don`t care not one whit about America`s school system. This growing socialist state dreams of manipulating school children to squeeze and squeeze information about their parents. And I sense your anxiety. And you should be anxious. And you should be frightened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: You think the NRA has been playing a constructive role this week?</p><p>TOOMEY: This is the first I`ve heard, and I don`t know what else Wayne LaPierre said, so that strikes me as a little bit conspiratorial in its tone, but again, I don`t have it in the full context.</p><p>TODD: But I guess overall, I mean, there has been this -- a boycott that has gotten traction. And, you know, the NRA seems to be more defiant than wanting to talk about the fact that, hey, a lot of people want to have a different conversation on guns.</p><p>TOOMEY: Look, I mean I disagree with the NRA on this position. The NRA once held the position that I hold, which is that background checks at gun sales and any kind of commercial sale are appropriate. The NRA changed its position on that. I disagree with them.</p><p>I think it`d be terrific if the NRA would come back to where it once was. And that would be very constructive.</p><p>TODD: Finally, have you been guaranteed that your bill is going to get a vote?</p><p>TOOMEY: No. You know, I`ll be speaking with Senator McConnell about that this week. You know, time on the Senate schedule is precious, especially with our Democratic colleagues chewing so much of it up over non- controversial nominees, but if we`ve got 60 votes, then I think that would be a very compelling argument to have a vote, and I think I think we would.</p><p>TODD: All right. Senator Pat Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views. Much appreciated.</p><p>TOOMEY: Thanks, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: Well, not every Republican is on board, even with some limited gun reform proposals that the president says he`ll support. After Mr. Trump proposed raising the minimum age to purchase the AR-15, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie didn`t take long to tweet back at the president.</p><p>Quote: Why should a 20-year-old single mom be denied the right to defend herself and her kids? We should lower the age to buy a handgun to 18 instead of raising the age to buy an AR-15. Sad. In all caps there, a little tweak at the president`s use of that word.</p><p>Well, Republican Congressman Massie joins me now.</p><p>Congressman, welcome to MEET THE PRESS, sir.</p><p>REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R), KENTUCKY: Thanks for having me on to talk about some serious solutions to these problems.</p><p>TODD: Well, let me ask you this. What is -- you heard Senator Toomey, he wants to expand the background check system for all gun purchases. What`s wrong with that?</p><p>MASSIE: Listen, my heart is breaking for the families in Florida. I have kids that go to public school. We had a school shooting here in Kentucky, and I`m a legislator who`s in a position to do something. But if I came home after proposing some of these things that are so unserious and disingenuous that some of my colleagues are proposing as solutions to these school shootings, I couldn`t face my wife or my children.</p><p>Now this -- but, I`ve not been in that situation of a school shooting. So, this week, I talked to two survivors of Columbine. And one of them, Evan Todd, related to me his story of being in the library when the two shooters came in. He was the first one shot. He hid under a desk. They found him, and he pleaded for his life. Then, he escaped from the library, ran outside and there were two police behind a shed who had taken up a position. They weren`t going in.</p><p>Now, he tells me that he forgives the adults that day. The legislators, the administrators and the police because they couldn`t foresee what was going to happen at Columbine. But he said it`s -- you know, it`s a shame here we are 20 years later, it`s still happening.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>MASSIE: And people are rolling out these same old solutions that will do nothing. And he supports my bill which is called the Safe Students Act, which will repeal the federal Gun Free School Zone Act.</p><p>TODD: All right. But what`s wrong with having multiple fail-safes? That`s the part of this where I think that people get frustrated on this debate. You have people that say, we don`t want to infringe upon anybody`s Second Amendment rights. But what`s wrong with an expanded background check? What`s wrong with maybe more cops at high schools?</p><p>MASSIE: Well, you know, I wish that background checks stopped criminals or stopped school shootings, but they don`t. They failed in Texas with the church shooting. They failed at Columbine. Look, the two students there - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Doesn`t, well, wait a minute there. Doesn`t that mean the background check system is flawed? Isn`t that the issue here? That we`re not putting --</p><p>MASSIE: It`s absolutely --</p><p>TODD: Well, then why don`t -- because we don`t put any of the information in it. We`re not putting enough information in it.</p><p>MASSIE: Well, you`re trying to put -- you`re trying to put lipstick on a pig. You`re trying to put lipstick on a pig.</p><p>Look, you could put all the information you want in it, but the shooter in Connecticut who stole his mother`s firearms and shot her before he committed the crime wouldn`t -- isn`t going to be stopped by a background check. Neither were the two perpetrators in Columbine who got other people to buy the guns for them. One of them -- one of the straw purchasers went to prison for that, because talk about the handgun, you know, 21 age. The guy that went to prison, he was 22. And he sold a handgun to one of the perpetrators who was 17.</p><p>Look, people, criminals are going to get a hold of guns. We`ve got -- what we`ve got to look at is what`s the solution. The solution, frankly, you know, you could put more guards at schools if you have one guard. It`s probably a waste of money because you`re just endangering that guard unless you have two guards. And anybody that`s in security profession knows that.</p><p>But what you need are some of the teachers who are armed. Ninety-eight percent of mass public shootings happen in a gun-free zone. And we`ve labeled all of our schools as gun-free zones.</p><p>We need to take those labels off, and put our kids in that 2 percent category of being safe, you know, instead of being in that 98 percent vulnerable category.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this. A majority of the country disagrees with you, right? You have -- we have 60 -- some 65 percent in a recent poll. And it`s been across the board, doesn`t matter which poll, that in general, the public would like stricter regulation of gun sales, in some form or another.</p><p>You`re proposing weaker. I understand that. You`re from a rural state. And so, let me ask you this though. Shouldn`t that matter--</p><p>MASSIE: Well, you`re in a bubble. You`re in a bubble there.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this though -- 65 percent of the country disagrees with you. Do you have a, do you have an obligation to legislate on behalf of them at all?</p><p>MASSIE: You`re in a bubble. If you take out New York and California, 8 percent of Americans have concealed carry permits. And the people watching this show right now, there are a lot of them getting ready for church in Middle America, putting their guns on, millions of them. They`re going to be carrying guns to church, and to family dinner after that, and they`re going to be safe.</p><p>And so, you know all these things, these hypotheticals that come out of the bubble in D.C. or New York City or California, what if this happens, what if that happens? We don`t have to ask what if this happens. People are carrying every day.</p><p>TODD: I guess I go back to is what are you -- what are you so opposed to expanding the background check system? Why do you make this argument that says, well, if you just pass more gun laws, it won`t matter, criminals get it, then why do we pass any laws? Like, why do we pass laws on drugs, why do we pass laws on murder?</p><p>MASSIE: Well, we should pass my law to repeal the Gun-Free School Zone Act. I call it the Safe Students Act.</p><p>But, look, those are -- those are false senses of security. Like Evan Todd from Columbine, he`s disgusted at these proposals because they wouldn`t do anything. And in 10 years, we`re still going to have school shootings, unless you propose real legislation, like President Trump has proposed, that would allow teachers to be armed.</p><p>TODD: But you`re in favor of that, but you`re opposed to raising the AR-15 to 21?</p><p>MASSIE: Oh, well that`s ridiculous here. Think about this. You had a ban on assault rifles in 1999 when Columbine happened. The assault weapons ban lasted, the so-called ban, lasted from -- the so-called assault weapons ban, lasted from `94 to 2004. Columbine fell right in the middle of that. The assault weapons ban would do nothing to stop school shootings.</p><p>TODD: Wow.</p><p>MASSIE: Eighty-four percent of mass public shootings involve a firearm other than an assault rifle, so-called assault rifle.</p><p>TODD: I understand that. But going back, you just think a background -- do you think our background check --</p><p>MASSIE: Yes.</p><p>TODD: -- why do we bother with it at all?</p><p>MASSIE: Well, you know what, it`s flawed. Three million people, law- abiding citizens were denied a purchase since this has been put in place. But only about one in a thousand are prosecuted for trying to, quote, buy a gun illegally.</p><p>The reality is, most of those 3 million, 99.9 percent of them are actually law-abiding citizens who were denied a purchase because the background check system is flawed. It doesn`t have the right information in there. It`s got false information.</p><p>And it disproportionately is biased against minorities. If you can get the information from the ATF, you would find that out.</p><p>TODD: Well, we have no gun research in this country at all because Congress in many ways has prevented that from happening.</p><p>Congressman Massie --</p><p>MASSIE: Well, I`ve got an inquiry into the ATF to get that data.</p><p>TODD: All right. Congressman Massie, I`m going to leave it there. Sir, thanks for coming on and sharing your views. Much appreciated.</p><p>MASSIE: Thank you, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: When we come back, much more on the corporate backlash facing the NRA and what folks at one of the nation`s largest gatherings of conservatives told us about the president`s gun reform proposals. And later, why is the president so defensive about the Democrats` new memo on the Russia probe?</p><p>TODD: Welcome back, panel is here.</p><p>Former White House press secretary and NBC News political analyst, Josh Earnest, Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute, Helene Cooper, Pentagon correspondent for \"The New York Times\", and David Brody, host of \"Faith Nation\" on the Christian Broadcasting Network, co-author of his new book, \"The Faith of Donald J. Trump: A Spiritual Biography.\"</p><p>All right, before I turn the gun debate over to you, I want you to take a look at what we heard from some attendees at the CPAC Conference, influential, you know, conservative meeting here this week in the D.C. area.</p><p>Here`s how they reacted to some of the gun reforms the president is proposing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don`t believe schools should have a policy of arming teachers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some teachers who would be willing to be armed is a reasonable request.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don`t think anyone goes through to buy a gun and needs it right then and there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think strengthening the background checks is a good idea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe that 18 should be the legal age.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I agree in raising the age because I don`t think, you know, my son when he was 18, I would never give him an AR-15.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Again, I want to reiterate, that was CPAC conference attendees.</p><p>David, the NRA, they`re getting hammered here on this boycott. And it`s been effective I think because they`ve not shown a lot of empathy in the last 10 days. And then perhaps even CPAC attendees have noticed.</p><p>DAVID BRODY, HOST, CBN`S \"FAITH NATION\": No. The NRA has been tone deaf. And they`re going off of talking points that have been out there for a while. And they`ve got to figure out a way to update those.</p><p>And now, you have a president, for the first time a Republican president, who comes along as basically a Trump-publican, if you will. I mean, he`s not a Republican, he`s not a Democrat, he`s somewhere in the middle, or who knows what he is, depending on what happens.</p><p>TODD: Depends on who`s in the office, I think.</p><p>BRODY: Well, and I`ll just say this, but when it comes to guns, clearly, he can lead here. It`s an important moment for him. And I think there is a deal to be done.</p><p>TODD: There could be. But, you know, why am I a little skeptical?</p><p>HELENE COOPER, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Because we`ve covered this forever. I think you and I remember talking to you right after Sandy Hook and you laughed at me because I was like, this is it. They`re killing kindergarteners. Surely, we`re going to do something about it.</p><p>And I remember you telling me, you were like, no, this is not, you know, nothing`s going to happen.</p><p>I never feel like I`m less of an American than when I listen to the gun control debate. Because what seems so obvious and what seems so rational and yet you just had a conversation between these two Republican guests who you had on there, talking about nipping at the edges, and it`s all this stuff that we all know at the end of the day is probably not going to do that much to change anything. But it`s still, if you can`t even get that tiny -- this tiny, tiny, tiny stuff, you know, how are we actually going to get anything real?</p><p>TODD: Josh, you were there during Sandy Hook.</p><p>JOSH EARNEST, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Right.</p><p>TODD: And you saw the fight from Manchin-Toomey. I`ve always thought part of the reason why Manchin-Toomey failed was it didn`t feel like a direct response to Sandy Hook. This time, we see how the background check system, if it had worked better, might have worked.</p><p>EARNEST: Right. And certainly, some of the -- the age limit being raised would also address the situation directly.</p><p>I did think it was notable, and you mentioned this in the open, that Governor Scott was in a situation where he is actually taking a position that is contrary to the NRA. It`s imagine -- it`s easy to imagine sitting around this table saying, Governor Scott`s never going to take any action on this, you know why? Because he`s running for the United States Senate.</p><p>In fact, we`re in a situation now where he is taking action on this --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>EARNEST: -- because he is running for the United States Senate.</p><p>So, I`m not suggesting, Chuck, that I`m particularly optimistic that this Congress is going to get something done, but we are starting to see the politics on this shift in a way that leaves me more optimistic about the future.</p><p>TODD: Danny, that`s what I think, if nothing legislatively changes this time, but the debate has shifted. The ground`s shifted a little bit.</p><p>DANIELLE PLETKA, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: I don`t think there`s any question the debate has shifted. The problem really is that we focus a lot on the NRA, which is I think out of touch, sort of, you know, old-school, old talking points from the 1980s. But the reality is that the members of Congress, whether it`s a Democrat-dominated Congress or a Republican- dominated Congress, are not taking these votes. We`ve got to ask ourselves why that is.</p><p>TODD: They don`t want to take the votes, do they?</p><p>PLETKA: But when they do, the reality is that these laws stay in place. So the problem is that we sit here, you know, we West Coast/East Coast elites talk about this. And I think we`re, you know, we`re probably in sync. We agree with Governor Scott, we agree something needs to be done. The problem is, there are a lot of actual Americans who live in places that don`t agree.</p><p>TODD: Josh, do you think Democrats want an incremental? You know, it`s interesting, base Democrats, will they accept incremental progress or will they kill it?</p><p>EARNEST: Well, look, you know, this is one of the interesting things about this debate is that the vast majority of the problem exists on the Republican side. But there are problems on the Democratic side, too. Republicans, many critics of President Obama have pointed out that Democrats were in charge of the United States Congress for the first two years of his presidency, and they didn`t take any of these votes.</p><p>And there`s a reason for that. Because it wouldn`t have passed, had they taken these votes, right?</p><p>But the other reason is that we --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Harry Reid didn`t want you to have that vote.</p><p>EARNEST: That`s right.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>EARNEST: Now, we were focused on preventing a second Great Depression, passing healthcare reform. So, it`s not as if we were focused on the wrong things, but the political dynamics here do portray that Democrats in some cases are not in the right place. The question I think does -- the question is, what impact does that mean? What does it mean for Democrats? What should we do when we confront a candidate like Conor Lamb?</p><p>TODD: Right. I mean, look, I mean, Conor Lamb`s in Western Pennsylvania saying one thing, and here`s Pat Toomey the senator going, whoa, you know, let`s do something.</p><p>BRODY: But the issue here I think is that we`ve reached a tipping point. And you know, in society, we reach tipping points. In a marriage, you reach a tipping point. Enough of the lying, the cheat, whatever it is.</p><p>In the debate on guns, I think we`ve reached the tipping point here. Why? Yes, another shooting. At some point, just by osmosis, it just happens. It just happens. You see the poll results.</p><p>But then beyond that, I think eventually what you`re going to have to see here is like what is going to happen going forward here? Because I believe that at some point, Republicans are going to have to figure this out. They have a president, though, that can lead here.</p><p>TODD: It`s like why not try?</p><p>COOPER: We have a data point that`s coming out on March 24 with this. You know, people are already talking about this national march on Washington. I`m very curious to see if we are going to see thousands upon thousands of people coming up -- but we`re talking about it, too. When we`re talking about a tipping point, at some point, you have to ask whether the voices of these kids, these kids who are going to the capitol, who are going -- standing before congress, who are standing before the White House who...</p><p>TODD: Look, we have a change. Brian Mast, a Republican member of congress, not far from where the shooting took place, he came out for the assault weapons ban.</p><p>PLETKA: But shockingly enough, in Washington, it is reasonable to ask one question. The march is great. I agree with you, I think we have reached a tipping point. We all agree about these issues, is this going to solve this problem? That`s -- we have a debate about what we can all do politically to make the kids go away and to make the lobbyists go away. But what is going to solve this problem? And the answer is nobody wants to talk about that because it`s unpalatable in the United States.</p><p>BRODY: Well, it`s also cultural. And just for a quick, mental health, I think, is going to be where this debate is going to go.</p><p>TODD: There`s no doubt, but you can`t do one without the other. I think we all know that.</p><p>COOPER: That`s where we get back to the whole nibbling around the edges thing again. It`s -- yeah...</p><p>EARNEST: President Obama wrote an op-ed in January of 2016 basically suggesting that Democrats, if they care about this issue, need to be single issue voters in the same way that NRA supporters are. And I think that really is going to the question in this Connor Lamb race, right. Are we willing to give up a golden opportunity to enhance our chances in the midterm elections by voting against somebody who says they support assault weapons ban. That`s a question that Pennsylvania voters are going to have ask themselves.</p><p>TODD: We will leave that there. Interesting way to leave the panel.</p><p>When we come back, we`re going to hear from a Democrat who is trying to crack down on how the fake news issue spreads online and ramp up congress`s role in policing social media. It`s Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. She`s next.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. This weekend we got to see House Democrat`s response to Republican charges of misconduct in the FBI`s Russian investigation. The Democrat`s newly declassified document defends the FBI`s surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and rebuts Republican`s highly publicized memo alleging partisan bias at the Justice Department.</p><p>Now part of the reason that initial memo was so hyped, Kremlin-linked bots seeking to discredit the Russia investigation, the automated accounts designed to amplify political One reason why it was so hyped was Russian- linked bots. It was meant to amplify political divisions, sprang into action on social media, calling for that memo`s release. And of course they`ve also gotten involved in this gun debate as well, whether trying to create fake news or amplify fake news.</p><p>Joining me now is Democrat Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She`s interested in a bipartisan bill aimed at trying to police social media, at least on the advertising frong.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, welcome back to Meet the Press.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D) MINNESOTA: Thanks. It`s great to be on, Chuck.</p><p>All right, let me start with this larger issue here of policing social media. I know your bill, and it`s an attempt to make digital ads part of the campaign finance laws that we have here, that they be regulated just the same. But can your -- would your bill been able to regulate YouTube and keeping them from spreading this idea that one of the students was an actor, for instance, when it came to the gun activism?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: There`s several fronts that we should operating on here, Chuck. I mean, first of all, the thought of these innocent kids, they get no NRA money. They`re just out there telling the truth about what happened, leading to what I hope is going to be a seminal moment in our country, where we finally get congress to act on some sensible gun legislation. They`re out there doing that. And at the same time, you have websites linked to Russia that are immediately within hours putting out fake things through bots, saying these kids are paid actors, things that are totally false.</p><p>OK, one, come on, administration, put those sanctions in place. They went through 98-2 against Russia for this very reason that they were messing around in our American elections. Secondly, on the bot front, separate from my legislation, these are the most sophisticated companies in America. They have brilliant people working there. I believe that they`ve got to put more resources -- maybe it means they make less profits off of ads and other things, but they have got to put the resources into Facebook and Twitter to stop these bots from dominating the accounts. There are literally tens of millions of these accounts out there right now on people`s pages.</p><p>And the third things is...</p><p>TODD: How do you incentivize -- oh, go ahead. Finish your third point, sorry.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: No, no. It`s just how do you incentivize it? Public pressure. Congress holding hearings. Pushing them and pushing them. People realizing that these are fake people, which I`m sure...</p><p>TODD: Should they be fined? You know, in a super fund disaster, should Facebook and Twitter face fines if they fail to purge itself of bots, for instance, after the government finds out?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I think that would be a great idea, but then you need a congress to act. And there are too many people that are afraid of doing something about this, because we know these sites are popular. Everyone loves putting recipes, cat videos, it`s a great thing. But at the same time, there`s an ugly side of this, and someone once said that there systems were set up without alarms, without locks, and big surprise, bad guys are coming in and manipulating people, and that is what`s happening and worse, literally committing crimes when they tell people they can text in and vote.</p><p>And the last thing we know is that Russian rubles were spent on ads, coming out of this latest indictment that the Russians spent a lot of money on paid ads. That`s much simpler to regulate, Chuck. You know why? TV, your station right now, has rules in place, so does radio and print. Do the same thing. They have got to have disclaimers on issue ads and on candidate ads, and they have to disclose them so the press and the other candidates can look at these ads and figure out where they are coming from, what they mean.</p><p>TODD: I want to move, specifically to the gun issue, because you represent a diverse state when it comes to the gun issue, both with some rural areas. I think of the Iron Range. And I can only imagine their mindset when it comes to some of these gun laws, versus those in Minneapolis. It`s going to be a different story.</p><p>As a leader in the Democratic Party, how do you strike this balance. You know, we were just talking about it in the panel before. How do you strike this balance where, some of your colleagues, like right next door, Heidi Heitkamp is never going to be able to vote for an assault weapons ban. But there is some base Democrats who think that`s an outrageous decision. What do you say to the base?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I was up on Iron Range two days ago. And I was actually quite surprised when your host there and your guests talk about tipping points, that`s where we are. I had a number of proud gun owners, we have a hunting culture here, and I always look at every bill that comes before us, and I think would this have hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand? And what these hunters were telling me the last few days, is that they are ready to do some background checks. They asked me why the bump stock bill hadn`t passed.</p><p>They understand, as law abiding gun owners, that we need to make changes.</p><p>And I think these students are going to lead the way. And we`re going to finally see some action. And when I had those Sandy Hook parents in my office and they told their stories, and you think about the courage they had to come forward on the simple background check bill, and then congress didn`t have the courage to pass it, I don`t think you`re going to see that happen again. I want to see Senator Toomey`s bill come up for a vote. I`d like to see an assault weapon ban come up for a vote, and I would also like to see the work we need to do on domestic violence.</p><p>TODD: You`re on Judiciary committee. There`s been a lot of law enforcement errors that have been discovered in the shooting itself, particularly whether it`s the FBI. What kind of concerns do you have about the FBI`s misses here. And what do you attribute it to?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would like to get all the details on this, because I think someone clearly made a major, tragic mistake in not reporting that to the Miami field office. And the FBI director has specifically come out and said it was a major mistake.</p><p>In addition to that, you have an armed sheriff`s deputy outside of the school, didn`t go in, has now left that department.</p><p>But you literally had 23 reports about this particular killer to law enforcement over the years. So they clearly had -- it`s not just FBI, it`s also what was going on on the local level.</p><p>TODD: Well, do you attribute anything -- has the FBI got -- the FBI has taken a lot of heat lately on a lot of ways. Is this well deserved?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It sounds like this was something that has to have a major change in terms of how they do their operations, if something was reported to a call center and then didn`t go to the field office to be checked out, that`s a mistake. But again, 23 reports to local law enforcement as well. So they have some issues here, but that doesn`t take away from the fact that if you want to stop these mass shootings like we have seen in other countries, whether they are in a church, whether they are in a concert venue, an outdoor concert venue in Las Vegas, you`ve got to start admitting, as so many gun owners in my state are starting to do, that we can to some changes without hurting hunting and includes background checks, assault weapons bans and some of things we`re talking about.</p><p>TODD: Senator Klobuchar, I have to leave it there. I appreciate it. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views. Always good to talk with you.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Go Olympics. We`re proud of our Minnesota Olympics, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: Quite a bit. We need Minnesota to do well.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: ...Curley team.</p><p>TODD: There you go.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: They have done very well. Thank you.</p><p>TODD: When we come back, it`s not just foreign adversaries using social media to sew division, how the big tech companies are causing some big problems.</p><p>But, first, we`re remembering the man considered by many to be America`s pastor. The Reverend Billy Graham died this week at the age of 99. He was a counselor and unofficial spiritual adviser to a dozen presidents, every one of them -- Truman to Obama -- prayed with Reverend Graham. Graham will become the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Capitol rotunda this week. His mission took him all over the world, including to Meet the Press four times.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILLY GRAHAM, PASTOR: We have the message, but how to communicate it to the masses? And we have used television and radio and the press in every way we possibly can to communicate the fact that Christ can transform human life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Data Download time. We talk a lot about the forces that divide us in American politics increasingly. Those forces are getting a big assist from the big four tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These companies dictate how we get online, how we find information and how we shop and how we find information and how we share it with our communities. And they`re bigger and worth more than ever.</p><p>A recent piece in Esquire magazine caught my eye. Check out these numbers, they`re astounding, in terms of sheer market value, Amazon is now worth more than the 15 most well known retail companies combined. Look at that list of companies, folks, from Walmart to Nordstroms and everyone in between.</p><p>To match the combined value of Google and Facebook, you could take the value of the world`s top five advertising firms, add the five major media companies and the five major communications companies, and that still doesn`t equal those firm`s total value. We`re talking Comcast, Disney, all of us. It`s all that surprising they`re worth a lot in dollars, but it`s the influence they have over our day to day lives that`s more mind-boggaling. Two-thirds of U.S. adults have Facebook accounts, almost half of whom get their news there.</p><p>And of the top five apps used most across the globe, Facebook makes and its other platforms make up four out of the five.</p><p>So, what you say, right? These companies are curating what you see, what you buy and what you read based on what you believe. And blue America, your Facebook newsfeed is dominated by liberal voices -- the Daily Show, Bernie Sanders, Media Matters, and the ACLU. In Red America, your feed shows the opposite: Breitbart News, the Conservative Post, Rush Limbaugh, and the anti-abortion rights Life News.com. In the end, creating completely different cultural bubbles for Americans to live, work, and vote in. That`s what we`ve created here. Which is why the big four are finally attracting the attention, and the ire, of lawmakers on the left and right.</p><p>When we come back, Endgame, more twists and turns in the special counsel`s investigation. And it`s clearly getting a lot closer to the White House.</p><p>TODD: Back now with Endgame. And if you`re struggling to keep up with all the charges, indictments and plea deals coming out of the special counsel`s office, you`re not alone. In the nine months since Robert Mueller was appointed to oversee the investigation, he`s issued more than 100 criminal charges against three companies and 19 individuals, including a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin, who by the way, had owned -- also appears orchestrated an attack on U.S. troops in Syria using a private mercenary force, oh by the way.</p><p>Helene, we also had the Democratic -- I know.</p><p>COOPER: I love that you actually managed to do that connection and get that in there.</p><p>TODD: It`s a stunning reminder of what Russia`s doing to the United States.</p><p>But let me start with the larger picture here. The president last night, the Democratic memo comes out, and he takes to Twitter and then takes a phoner with Judge Jeanine, Mueller`s indictments are coming and Mueller`s indictments are coming. The president is acting in an interesting way.</p><p>COOPER: But he`s acting in a very consistent way, which is always despite -- no matter what comes out of Mueller`s office about what -- you know, just about the scope and the depth of this Russia -- of what Russia tried to do, President Trump`s reaction is again, and again and again me, me, me, me, no collusion, look no collusion. It`s not about whether, you know, Russia completely subverted the American democratic process or about all of the other things that they have done. In fact, including the Syria -- having Russian mercenaries attacking American troops and American-backed troops in Syria, you`re not hearing the administration say anything at all about that, what you`re hearing -- what you`re hearing President Trump say, no, so far no phone calls, no collusion.</p><p>TODD: Danny, I mean, that`s the thing, some of his actions when it comes to Russia and Putin, including not calling out the fact that Russians attacked American troops. Hard stop. Russians attacked American troops, he hasn`t said a word.</p><p>PLEKTA: Inexplicable. Look, the problem for the president of the United States is the one that we identify every single time, Donald Trump is about Donald Trump, and not only that, but I think he takes it further. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So if people are saying bad things about them and trying to tie them back to me, I am not going to say anything. It is -- it is inexplicable.</p><p>The -- one of the main reasons we talk about the Mueller investigation and Donald Trump is because Donald Trump keeps tying them together. Mueller has not tied the president and collusion and his campaign to Russia, what he has done has not even touched that for the most part.</p><p>TODD: Not yet. We don`t know.</p><p>PLETKA: But Donald Trump keeps saying, it`s not me. Don`t look at me.</p><p>TODD: But it`s a me thinks you doth protest too much.</p><p>BRODY: But that was the reason, in essence, for the special counsel investigation.</p><p>Look, the report from the heartland is these words, and maybe they`re not the most intellectual words, but blah, blah, blah. I mean, really, this is what folks in the heartland. They`re thinking about the gun debate. You know, they`re thinking about tax cuts. They`re just not -- look...</p><p>TODD: What does that matter right now? Does that matter to the investigation?</p><p>BRODY: Well, no, my point simply is how it`s playing politically. And I`m just telling you that when you hear bank fraud and Ukraine and Paul Manafort and you put all up those statistics, I`m telling you how it plays in Peoria, they`re just saying forget about it. I mean, to the point where this is why Trump goes and talks about no collusion because look at those statistics you put, where is any of this? And that`s what he`s saying. I mean, who knws, maybe they want to see if he`s got Russian dressing on his salad tonight. I don`t know. But they`re trying to figure this out somehow. And they`re not doing it so far.</p><p>TODD: Huh. What is your take on he Mueller probe?</p><p>EARNEST: The challenge that president Trump faces is he is not someone who is not good at playing the long game. He is constantly figuring out how tactically I can get myself through the news cycle and that`s why he called Judge Janine Pirro on the same day that the Democratic memo was released.</p><p>But this is the -- where the sort of the thinking of that breaks down. Yes, it is taking a while for Mueller to conduct his investigation. At some point, though, he will have something to reveal. And that will be the question. And that will be -- I think that`s the more interesting question, the political resonance of the ongoing investigation, I think to your point is accurate. I don`t think there`s a lot on. But once it concludes, once Mueller shows the goods, then how do the politics shift on this.</p><p>And I think that there will be -- once there is some substance for us to consider, I think that there will be some political consequences to consider as well.</p><p>TODD: Well, and it just goes back to the lack of action. That`s what you don`t understand. You had internet company, we know what Mueller has found out is enough to punish Russia, at this point. We know enough to punish them and we haven`t.</p><p>COOPER: Absolutely, and no we haven`t. We haven`t even instigated -- we haven`t even put into -- the White House hasn`t put in place the sanctions that congress has already voted in against...</p><p>PLETKA: Hang on just one second -- I`m sorry -- you know, I wrote a lot of sanctions legislation. I have to say about this administration, president, weird, Russia, except. But the notion that this administration has not moved on the legislation passed by congress on Russia is just simply false.</p><p>TODD: No, they`ve moved. It was the speed with which they...</p><p>PLETKA: No, again, I have looked at Iran sanctions. I`ve looked at missile sanctions, nuclear sanctions, I have never seen an administration move so fast as they did. This oligarchs list, other lists that they have put together, in fact they have. This is a process. And I don`t want to defend the Trump administration where they don`t deserve it, but in this case they`ve done a lot.</p><p>EARNEST: One of the things I think is interesting about this discussion about sanctions is that so much of the criticism that the Obama administration got in dealing with Russia, whether that was countering them on Crimea, countering their interference in Ukraine, or even countering their interference in the elections was that, well, the Obama administration is not doing anything tough, they`re just putting in place sanctions.</p><p>The truth is what we know now is that the Russians have spent a lot of time and energy working with the Trump administration to try to get those sanctions rolled back. So, here in the United States they may not be a big deal, but Russia obviously thinks those sanctions are big.</p><p>TODD: All right, I`m going to pause to end the conversation, you guys can keep yelling at each other if you want.</p><p>But before we go, a big shoutout, collective shoutout, both to the U.S. women`s hockey team and the U.S. men`s curling team, on their gold medal, one a first ever. So, take that, Sweden.</p><p>That`s all for today. We`ll be back next week. Because, if it`s Sunday it`s Meet the Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBCNEW-2018022501cb504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBCNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRD-1361-JB20-G0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157446</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018  ASC Services II Media, LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Broadcasting Co.

They`re leading an effort right now to target companies like Google and others who practice political censorship that usually goes after conservative thinking and views, not so much liberal thinking and views.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator Tom Cotton is working on a big crackdown. He joins us right now, the Arkansas senator with us right now.</p><p>Senator, good to have you.</p><p>SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: What are we looking at doing here? What do you want to see done?</p><p>COTTON: Well, Neil, too often, big tech companies, especially social media companies, engage in unfair and biased moderation of comments or posts. Sometimes, they delete them. Sometimes, they lock down accounts entirely.</p><p>I revealed this week on the FOX News Web site my own story of that kind of censorship. Just a little over a couple weeks ago, Twitter contacted me about posts I made about the writing and the looting and the way to respond to them and said...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>COTTON: ... these were in violation of our policies, and you have 30 minutes to delete them. They gave us shifting explanations.</p><p>Sometimes, they were conflicting explanations. We called their bluff. We sent them my arguments for why those posts should remain up. We didn`t hear back from them for almost two hours. And they said, you can keep your account.</p><p>Now, I`m a United States senator. I have other ways to make my voice heard on the Senate floor, for instance. But just imagine all the conservatives out there on social media or who run conservative Web sites who are at the whims of big tech.</p><p>You saw that this week, when NBC News and Google almost deplatformed The Federalist, a popular conservative news site, for the comments, not articles posted on The Federalist, but for the comments.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>COTTON: So, what we propose to do, Senators Hawley, Rubio, Braun and I, is to limit the immunity that these social media companies have from legal liability if they`re engaged in that kind of censorship, that kind of curation of content.</p><p>They can either be neutral platforms, where everyone can speak, or they can be regulated platforms, and have to face the consequences for those actions. But they can`t be both.</p><p>CAVUTO: Or you can have no fact-checkers, no one policing, and like the Wild West, right? I mean, there is a separate concern.</p><p>I think Facebook is trying to walk this line: We don`t believe in fact- checkers. It can come back to bite us if we fact-check the president or if you fact-check a prominent liberal.</p><p>So, what do you think of that? Is that the solution? Because what`s at stake, as you know, Senator, is a very successful, thriving technology industry. And these behemoths, say what you will of them, make Americans a lot of money. Obviously, they make a lot of money, and they are the standard for the world.</p><p>What do you do? How do you balance that?</p><p>COTTON: Well, Neil, at a minimum, these companies need to provide more transparency and consistency.</p><p>Again, take my example from a couple of weeks ago. We got an ultimatum that gave us less than 30 minutes to either censor my own posts or to allow Twitter to permanently lock down my account. They wouldn`t put anything in writing. They very carefully avoided putting anything in writing.</p><p>And when we pointed out some of the policy inconsistencies that they cited to us, then they just came up with new explanations. And, again, if they will do that to a sitting United States senator, what will they do to a regular Web site or to conservative citizens who just want to make their voices heard?</p><p>That`s why, at a minimum, they need to be more transparent and consistent. And if they`re not going to offer that kind of transparency and consistency, if they are going to engage in carefully moderating the content they provide, and censoring opinions that they don`t like, even when those opinions garner majority support repeatedly at the polls or in surveys, then they ought not to enjoy the extraordinary immunity from liability that the laws have given them.</p><p>CAVUTO: If I can switch gears a little here, because you`re right, there`s a back-and-forth here. A lot of liberals have typically gone after these guys who have gotten too big for their britches, so there`s an effort to rein them in that way, the same abroad, Senator.</p><p>But I did want to get your quick thoughts on this Bolton book that is out on the president, more or less saying that he got a little too cozy with China and, through Xi Jinping, was even trying to all but plead that the Chinese buy agricultural goods, that it would help him out in the 2020 election.</p><p>A, do you believe that? And, B, if he did something like that, Bolton seemed to be intimating that`s an impeachable offense. What do you think?</p><p>COTTON: Well, so, first, Neil, let me say, I haven`t read the book. I have seen some of the media excerpts on it. But, no, I thought many of the claims to be simply implausible.</p><p>Let`s take one about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Bolton claims that Mike Pompeo passed him a note during a summit with President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and that that handwritten note by Secretary Pompeo insulted the president.</p><p>I find that to be completely implausible, based on my personal relationship and years of history with Mike Pompeo. If it is the case, then Mr. Bolton could presumably produce that note in Mike Pompeo`s handwriting, since he is, as everyone knows, a very careful and methodical notetaker and collector of information.</p><p>And I think that one episode reflects on many of the claims. To cite the one you gave, I`m sure that President Trump repeatedly, in his conversations with Xi Jinping, emphasized that America`s farmers have not been getting a fair shake from the Chinese Communist Party for years, and that, in fact, that was one of the main objectives of the president in trying to get better trade terms with China, is to get their markets opened up to our farmers.</p><p>That`s a completely appropriate posture for the president to take.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see.</p><p>The passing note thing, you`re not buying. I think, at one of the summit events, they were sitting next to each other, Bolton and Pompeo, but it -- you don`t think that any nasty notes were exchanged. We will see, like you said.</p><p>Senator, Senator Cotton, very good having you, my friend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020061802cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-RHH1-JB20-G48B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>INTERVIEW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tonight, the truth behind fake news, the founder of Wikipedia tells me how he's fighting back against this epidemic and a Pulitzer Prize winning author on how she became a target of Russian trolls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary North Koreans, we find out what they really think about the regime of Kim Jong Un.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Good Evening everyone and welcome to the program. I'm Christane Amanpour in London. Fake news took on a whole new meaning and momentum this year, from President Trump's mouth to the ears of dictators around the world. To Russia's disinformation campaign during American and European election cycles.</p><p>Even the pope is calling it a very serious sin. So how do we fight back? How do we stand up for the truth? Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales is hoping to do that with his new venture, Wikitribune. The collaboration between professional journalists and community volunteers who collectively fact check and produce accurate news.</p><p>The Pulitzer Prize winning author and historian, Anne Applebaum also joins me. She was a victim of a Russian smear campaign herself, we had a conversation about all of this. Jimmy Wales, Anne Applebaum, welcome but let me just ask you first about fake news.</p><p>The term has been around forever, apparently, according to Merriam-Webster, since the 1890s. But there's no doubt that Donald Trumps is responsible of making it a huge part of everyday conversation. Anne Applebaum, author, historian and journalist there in Poland.</p><p>Let's not forget Poland was within the Soviet sphere, one of the countries that fought back early against Soviet domination. But fake news is a phenomenon that came from over there, right?</p><p>ANNE APPLEBAUM, HISTORIAN: Well certainly, the Soviet systems ruled by used of what we used to call propaganda and we've now decided to call fake news, and these were whole systems of spreading a false version of reality design deliberately to manipulate people and to be used for political goals.</p><p>We saw over the last several years the Russians become very sophisticated in the way that they use fake websites combined with social media, combined with official media to creat false stories. And we've also seen some domestic political organizations in western countries adopt many of the same tactics.</p><p>The difficulty with what Trump has done is that Trump ran a campaign that used many elements of the kind that Russian propagandists have used in their campaigns in systems of fake websites, conspiracy theories, leaked material that's been spun into hundreds of different kinds of stories. I mean, these are tactics that have been used in Poland and in Ukraine, elsewhere in this part of the world.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you yourself were a victim of it.</p><p>APPLEBAUM: I was once a victim of - not alone. I was the subject of a whole series of fake stories that were then spun into other kind of stories and repeated all around the web. Actually one of the reasons I know about this is you get interest in these things when you follow them.</p><p>But these tactics, although they started out being very much Russian tactics, the Russians began to play with them several years ago. It's now much wider than that, lots of people now understand how to create what are so called inorganic social media campaigns.</p><p>How to create fake stories, how to move then form one part of the internet to the next so that people don't even know where they originally came from and I think we'll be seeing more of that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You, as founder of Wikipedia have sort of like almost a crowd sourcing kind of -</p><p>JIMMY WALES, CO-FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA: Yes -</p><p>AMANPOUR: Encyclopedia and now Wikitribune. What are you trying to do with that? How is that designed to attack fake news?</p><p>WALES: Well one of the things that we've seen in the world of Wikipedia is that, the Wikipedia community has been very robust in now falling for fake news. As a community, they're very obsessive about trying to get it right. The classic Wikipedia debate is not about politics, it's about is this a good source or not and so when they see these true fake news sites, they're not easily duped by them, and so that has been a bit of a resistant mechanism.</p><p>The idea, really, is to say look, let's try to bring in a community, a strong, healthy community and professional journalists to work together side by side to try to fact check stories, try to do new things in journalism.</p><p>It's really a pilot project on experiment, having a lot of fun, trying to figure out what it is we can do to help fund the more and better journalism because one of the biggest things is the business models of journalism have been under extreme pressure.</p><p>AMANPOUR: For the last many years start ups in the Silicon Valley big tech (Yong Hudi)'s you know have been sort of the messiahs and now this year the worm is turning against them. Where is the responsibility of the CEOs and the people who run these sites which have so clearly have played into the distortion of fact and truth?</p><p>WALES: Well, I think we have to be very careful here because on the one hand yes if falsehoods are being spread and they have an ability to do something about it then naturally we think they probably should. On the other hand we can imagine a slightly different set of historical circumstances where an announcement by Facebook that they're going to start shaping our view of the world by Facebook deciding what's true and false, that sounds very alarming and not really something we want.</p><p>We want them to preserve their status as a platform. I don't want Facebook deciding what I'm allowed to share. At the same time if I'm about to share something that's fake they should maybe warn me and say hey you don't want to look like an idiot in front of your friends.</p><p>And I think they're going to need to because I do think that consumers are concerned about it. When you look at the trust levels that people have, I just saw some results from Edelman's Trust Barometer survey where there's a hugely declining trust in news that I get from my friends.</p><p>I think people are saying maybe my friends are not as smart as I thought they were. Maybe I shouldn't trust that and I think for places like Facebook, they need to think about that.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And where do you stand on that, the responsibility of these tech giants who have literally taken over the world, often for good, but as we've seen over the last for very bad. Can they be regulated, should they be regulated? Does politics have a role to play in that or do they have to sort it out with the consumers playing their role as well.</p><p>ANNE APPLEBAUM, WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST: I mean ideally what I'd like to see is the tech companies working together with governments and together with consumers to find solutions to these problems. I mean it actually - I think they're going to be multiple solutions.</p><p>One of them might involve building communities of trust like the like as Jimmy Wales is doing. Others might be finding ways to help newspapers reach people who live in (alegated) eco chambers and don't have access to good news. So, there may be multiple solutions. I do think it's pretty inevitable now and this is beginning to happen in a lot of European countries, but at the very least tech companies are going to be subject to local laws.</p><p>I mean so for example, Germany has very strict hate speech laws of a kind that we actually in Anglo Saxon countries probably wouldn't want to have. But the Germans have them that's their law, that's up to them to decide. And they've now made Facebook subject to that law.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So we're talking about laws and trying to figure out how to better regulate this. Does anything sort of jump out at you?</p><p>WALES: Well, as Anne was saying one of the things that we should expect to see, particularly across Europe is more enforcement of local laws on the internet, but I want to raise a little bit of a cautionary note about that. Wikipedia is currently banned in Egypt for example and for reasons that would not suit our sort of ideas of freedom of expression, freedom of speech.</p><p>And they are demanding that we follow local law, but that's something that's really not compatible with human rights and so we won't. And so, there is this difficult thing around the tempting notion that internet companies should just follow local law because sometimes the local law isn't the answer.</p><p>AMANPOUR: The term fake news, when the President of the United States used it to smear us, the traditional media. What does that do? What kind of boomerang effect does that have on any number of governments where the Democratic or Authoritarian around the world?</p><p>APPLEBAUM: Well, that's now a really interesting story because the fact that the President of the United States now seems to seek deliberately to undermine mainstream media and normal reporting as oppose to these fake websites. It means that other dictators and other non dictators and other leaders around the world have begun to do exactly the same.</p><p>And so when the Burmese government has information that it doesn't like about - that it's reading about its torment of the Rajinga people and ethic cleansing. It simply denounces the reports of that and says fake news. We've now seen that happen in multiple countries actually.</p><p>The dictators and those who would manipulate the news and those who would like to be authoritarian and those who would like to undermine reporting now simply copy President Trump. I mean, I think they underestimate the degree to which the American President is a role model for other leaders.</p><p>People are watching what he's doing they're listen to what he's saying. And when he seeks on a daily basis to undermine real reporting and real journalism then they say well if he does it then we can too.</p><p>AMANPOUR: If you had a perfect solution what would Ricky Tribune's contribution to that be?</p><p>WALES: Well, one of the things was really (intrigued) by me, there's a group online called The Donald on Readit and it's all Donald Trump fans. And, they live in a bubble, I have to say. But, one of them was complaining (to) CNN and so on and they said, I just wish there were a Wikipedia of news.</p><p>And, what they meant by that was, they don't know who to trust anymore. They don't know what's going on. They want have somebody help them sift through and not feel like it's not coming from the left or coming from the right, just giving us facts.</p><p>Now this came from quite an odd place online but I think it's a (sentiment) feel. There is a demand to say, no, if you can just sit back and reflect a minute. Let's think this through, show me where the arguments on all sides, it's really old fashioned in a way but I think there is a demand for it.</p><p>And, you know, Wikipedia is incredibly popular so that approach of trying to be fair and trying to be neutral, still has huge appeal.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And, and what are we meant to think when even Facebook is saying, whether it's the company, itself, saying the way that Facebook is consumed by some people may not be actually good for their health? We read articles about smart phones high jacking people's brains. I mean literally talking about rewiring brains. Changing the social compact, changing the social dynamic, which obviously has political implications, as well as also, (develop) to other social culturing implications. How do you see that playing out?</p><p>APPLEBAUM: Well, I think that Facebook has been a little late in understanding this. And actually, one of the reasons why it is, at least, expressing the company's is expressing some concerns is that the employees inside the building are now expressing concerns. I'm not sure that other kind of pressure would have made any difference. I mean, I do think, I know that there will be efforts over the next year or two, look at ways in which (Agernisms) can begin to deliver people more balance views.</p><p>They are going to look at ways, in which, you know, is there some of kind of technical rigid you can create so that for example, when you, when you click on a page of news that has a, you know, that comes from a strange source for example, could some kind of, you know, warning pop up? Lots of people is going to be playing with that.</p><p>But, I think that Jimmy Wales is onto something when he notes that. The real problem is that the, you know, people want to have sources that they trust. They want to have information that they trust. And, finding ways to brought, you know, to both deliver news that is trustworthy and that has some kind of, some kind of basis in reality is going to be the, you know, is going to be the real goal over the next few years.</p><p>I mean, I think there is going to be multiple answers. I mean, maybe Wikitribune is one answer. It may be that mainstream newspapers find different ways to deliver news, different ways to write news in ways people find more trustworthy. I do think there is going to be a multiple instead of solutions and waiting for sort of one kind of regulation to fix the problem or one technical widget to, you know, to attach to your computer that will fix the problem is wrong.</p><p>I mean, among other things that is the definition of what we mean by evidence based. What we mean by fact based also difference between people in this clearly (gray) (zone).</p><p>AMANPOUR: What do you see in the next twelve months (being) out in this field?</p><p>WALES: Well, in the next twelve months, I expect that we will see the major tech giants make some real strives for in dealing with the true (statement) problem which is effectively just spam. Websites were set up two days ago with outrageous headlines with no concern for the truth. And, that's fine but we shouldn't assume that the problem is fixed.</p><p>Donald Trump, being a part of the problem, will still call mainstream media fake news but also will low quality outlets out there, who are pushing bias agendas and so on. So, even though the problem may fade away a little bit because people will get tired of it and we'll solve the real fake news problem, it is something that it is (ware) for the long haul.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And just, you are sitting in Poland there. It was one of the first to try to, you know, democratize that Soviet block. What is happening in Poland with the media and the crack down there right now?</p><p>APPLEBAUM: So, right now, we have in Poland, a democratic elected government, which is seeking to restrain the media. And which actually, does use Trump as a kind of an example and they do look up to his way of treating mainstream media. There has been a takeover of state media, which is no longer neutral but is very (pro-willing) party. Almost, kind of parity and there has been quite a lot pressure on independent media, all in very subtle ways, attempts to, for example, restrict advertising and threaten companies that want to advertise independent newspapers. And, there has also recently been a (find) on the most important independent television station for showing opposition demonstrations on T.V.</p><p>You know, when the Berlin fell, one of our ideas was, of course, there will be free media all over the East, all over the former Communist world because they'll simply copy our model and have multiple kinds of newspapers and so on. I think the one thing that we didn't count on was the idea that the business model of the mainstream media, would collapse so quickly, so relevantly quickly.</p><p>And while it's in some rich countries, you know, in the United States, in Britain, in Germany, it's still possible for private media to survive as a business in a lot of smaller countries. And Poland is one of them but also Slovakia, even even even even other counties in western Europe.</p><p>It's become more and more difficult for independent media organizations to survive and remain independent. Many of them get bought out by Oligarchs(ph) or by people close to the government in a deliberate attempt to undermine them. And that's, you know, that that may be an unavoidable problem but it's one of the other issues which we're going to need to find solutions to in the next few years.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And this final word, extraordinary that were talking about this, the truth here being at risk of getting lost in the weeds while at the same time some great journalism coming out of main stream media in the last year.</p><p>WALES: Yes, fantastic. I mean what disturbs me and bothers me in the back of my mind is knowing that some of the great newspapers of the world are doing amazing journalism but are having a harder and harder time in the long span, surviving actually making a business case out of funding that kind of journalism. And I think that's something that I'm really happy to see that New York Times subscriptions are way up and people are starting to realize that actually journalism's worth supporting.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Jimmy Wales, Ann Applebaum, thank you so much for having this discussion with me.</p><p>WALES: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And just as social media plays a role in fake news, the US now says Facebook accounts played a role in helping North Korea link cyber attacks. Pyongyang's provocations are well known, but what is life like for ordinary North Koreans? The most we usually see is goose stepping soldiers in perfect formation and massive missile parades.</p><p>But my next guest has tried to reveal a more honest and complex view of North Koreans. It comes at a critical time, of course, as the US National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster says in an interview, that the United States is committed to a resolution of the crisis with North Korea but wouldn't commit that would be necessarily a peaceful resolution. Now Barbara Demick spent years covering the Koreans and she has written Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea. And she joins me now from New York. Barbara, welcome to the program.</p><p>BARBARA DEMICK, AUTHOR: Thanks so much. Thanks so much, nice to be here.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes, you've been working for the Los Angeles Times as a reporter all over that region. And you've written this book, as I say. You know, what is the thing that surprised you the most when you talk to the ordinary people you tracked down over a period of time?</p><p>DEMICK: You know, this this is always sort of a cliche but North Koreans are, when you talk to them, they're kind of like us. They care about their kids, their homes, what they're going to eat. They're not such monsters so, you know, I rather like North Koreans and I really came to enjoy their company when I, when I interviewed them.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But what do you think, when you say they're like us, I'm sure they are, every every human has pretty much the same instincts by in large. But do they know what's going on around the world? What is their view of their own regime, like the regime; do they blame the US for all the bad things that are happening to them?</p><p>DEMICK: Well, certainly the regime would like them to blame the US. The, you know, all of the North Korean propaganda is that the US is to blame for the shortage of electricity, the lack of food, it's all because they're in a state of war.</p><p>And they use this war to, you know, keep the people in line. But increasingly, North Koreans, you know, listen to smuggled radios, they have USBs memory sticks with Hollywood movies and South Korean soap operas. So it's really hard to keep a country in the dark in that way. So they're not as ignorant as they once were.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And, you know, I was stuck by the fact that you actually didn't stick to Pyongyang at all. You didn't take the city that most foreigners go to, you went to a whole different city to talk to North Koreans there. Which city was it? Why did you choose that location?</p><p>DEMICK: The city is called, Chongin, and actually very few foreigners, including myself, have been there. I traveled around parts of North Korea, but not this city. But what I did was, I decided to interview defectors from one particular place and it happened to be Chongin because it was a city not on that Chinese border.</p><p>But there were a lot of defectors who came from Chongin and they they tended to be smart people, a little bit savior than ordinary North Koreans. And there were lots of them. And I felt like by interviewing people from one city, I could sort of fact check myself. You know, you never quite trust what defectors are (staying) but if you have dozens of people from one city saying yes I saw dying children by the railroad tracks in the 1990's you know it's true. So that was the technique. And Pyongyang is this model city, it is a Potemkin village, it's all the winners of North Korea's society so this was a much more ordinary place.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you say winners, everybody is led to believe that in a real communist state like North Korea that everybody's equal but they're not, right?</p><p>DEMICK: No and less so than in many communist places there are very strictly ranked by their loyalty to the regime, it's a whole system called Songbun and you're like the core class, you're a wavering class, you're a hostile class and there's not a number, but your ranking based on loyalty follows you and it determines what kind of job you can get, what kind of apartment you can get so yes it is a very class-based society.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to just go back to what you said about food and people being able to feed their families et cetera. Obviously the worst time for North Korea was during the famine in the 1990's for a variety of reasons; the Soviet Union in a collapse; there was mismanagement and all the aid that they got sort of suddenly dried up. But I was stunned to read about some of the interviews, I (don't know) families who literally decided who was going to go without in order to save other members of the family. Walk us through what it was like at that time.</p><p>DEMICK: I think it's horrific and it's as you said, Korean families are very close and older people would basically starve to death so that the younger ones could survive. Everybody, everybody I met from North Korea even the ones who didn't particularly suffer had somebody they loved who they watched die of -- in the famine; if not directly of starvation, of some disease caused by malnutrition. Just everybody had a terrible story, waking up in the morning to see that your baby sleeping in the bed next to you was dead. It was -- I was always in tears listening to these people. And they would always start out modestly saying oh nothing terrible happened to me but it did to all of them.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you also recount how some people are actually savvy, very savvy as you say, but they were able to distinguish between who was really responsible for their misfortune; they laid it at the feet of their leadership at least some of them right?</p><p>DEMICK: I think with time people have gotten much smarter, especially since the famine of the 1990's and I remember hearing this from one coal miner, not an educated man, and he said to me we're not stupid, we know our own leadership is to blame for our problems but we're also not so stupid that we need to talk about it. I know what I think I know, what my neighbor thinks, he doesn't need to tell me and I think there is some recognition. Now interestingly people tended to blame Kim Jong-il because -- the late leader because he was presiding at the time of the worst famine, things have gotten slightly better under Kim Jong-un.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I was going to say that. We hear definitely that the economy miraculously has actually got a bit better; they've got a little bit of private enterprise and it's not as dire. So I was wondering what you thought about the sanctions and whether, certainly the West says they're not looking for regime change, but I'm sure they'd like to think that they can force a collapse of some sort or a surrender of some sort when it comes to their nuclear weapons. What did you find about that?</p><p>DEMICK: Well it's interesting, North Korea, people don't really understand, North Korea thrives on being anti-American it's their raison d etre, it's -- anti-Americanism is the force that gives them meaning. And in a way President Trump is playing into their own hands with this sort of rhetoric about North Korea; they can say see, see, see what the -- how the Americans are insulting our leadership and so I think that right now the North Korea leader probably has pretty good support inside North Korea. I haven't been there for a while, but I think all of this is really boosting Kim Jong-un's image, I think Donald Trump has done him a favor.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What is extraordinary - I mean that is an extraordinary thing that your saying right now, but also you being obviously a lot in South Korea and I think to say that you know an anti-North Korean protest drawls very few people, but it's not the same when their protesting the United States. And that's in an allied nation.</p><p>DEMICK: That's right. I - you know of all the places I've worked I've felt I think actually the most anti-Americanism in Sol(ph). I mean Korea analysts hate when I say this and I was there at a particular time. But there's a lot of hostility to the U S and there's a lot of feeling that the U S was responsible for dividing the Korean peninsula.</p><p>And that these tensions right now are a result of fears in North Korea that the U S is going to attack them.

Enjoy:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>Mad Hedge Fund Trader began his career in finance by moving to Japan and working at Dai Nana Securities as a research analyst in 1974. In 1976 he was named the Tokyo correspondent for The Economist magazine and the Financial Times, which then shared an office. He traveled the world interviewing famous people, such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. In 1982, he was named the US editor of Euromoney magazine, and in 1983 he built a new division in international equities for Morgan Stanley. (NYSE:MS)  After moving to London in 1985, Mad Hedge supervised sales and trading in Japanese equity derivatives. In 1989, he became a director of the Swiss Bank Corp, responsible for Japanese equity derivatives. A year later, he set up an international hedge fund which he sold in 1999.</p><p><br/><br/>I havent even covered all of Mad Hedges adventures, such as his latent movie star career (as an extra in the 1979 epic war film, Apocalypse Now), and who knows what else. But now, missing the adrenaline-surging excitement of active trading, Mad Hedge has returned to the hedge fund business, set up an educational website, and is busy keeping up with the demands of newsletter writing.. So lets begin our interview with Mad Hedge by exploring his current thoughts on the markets.<br/><br/>Interview<br/><br/>Ilene: Hi Mad Hedge. Youve had a fascinating career having little to do with your major in biochemistry. A brief review of your newsletter shows that your recommendations early in 2009 have appreciated by an average of around 400%. Youve been writing your daily market thoughts and investment strategies at your website - <url normalizedValue=\"http://links.newstex.com/link?p=103438&amp;c=39&amp;s=MFLY-5186-38676682&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.madhedgefundtrader.com%2F\">www.madhedgefundtrader.com</url> - which its terrific, by the way. What are your goals with this site?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: This whole thing started out as a letter to investors in my hedge fund, to tell them my thinking behind my positions. Then I thought, why not post this on the web and see what happens? Six months later it is now going out to 50,000 readers a day, mostly to portfolio managers, financial advisors, and traders. The growth has been explosive.<br/><br/>Ilene: Who are your readers? <br/><br/>I seemed to have stumbled on a market that I describe as \u0153semi-professionals. If you are a big hedge fund, with a staff of 600 and a huge in-house research department, Im not going to tell you anything you dont already know. But there appear to be a few million people out there who trade their own accounts, or invest their own IRAs. They have never worked on Wall Street, but have taught themselves a lot about markets and investing. My letter gives them the 30,000 foot view on global stock, bond, currency, commodity, and real estate markets which they cant find at their online broker. About half of them are from abroad. When I get up in the morning now, there are five e-mails waiting for me from China and India asking what to do about natural gas. I also try to make the letter funny and entertaining. Not all financial publications have to be dreary reading. Its not always about the next stock to buy.<br/><br/>Ilene: In a recent letter you wrote that one of your favorite ETFs is the Proshares Ultra Short Treasury Trust (TBT). Why is that?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: TBT is a 200% leveraged bet that long Treasury bonds will go down. While the Fed keeps short rates low, it doesnt directly control long rates. As the supply of government bonds increases exponentially, their eventual collapse is inevitable. All Ponzi schemes must come to an end, and the US government is no exception. We currently have the greatest liquidity driven market of all time, and the ten year is eking out a mere 3.30% yield, pricing in near zero inflationary expectations. The average yield on this paper for the last ten years is 6.20%. If the yield goes back to 5%, that will take the TBT from $45 to $70. The TBT could perform even better if Treasuries lose their triple \u0153A rating, which I think is a real possibility.<br/><br/>Historically, bonds are not a good buy in a low interest rate, deflationary environment. If long rates move from 3% back to the 12% we saw in the early eighties, bond holders will get slaughtered, and the TBT could exceed $200. Even if inflation stays low, the sheer weight of supply and credit concerns will crater government bond prices.<br/><br/>Ilene: Whats the worst case scenario for the bond market?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Debt service is currently 11% of the budget. If interest rates rise sharply, that could double to 22%. Then you get a downward spiral like you saw in Latin America in the eighties, when higher debt service creates more borrowing, and more borrowing creates a higher debt service, until the whole thing blows up. At some point China, Japan, the Middle Eastern countries may stop buying our debt. There are only so many \u0153greater fools out there.<br/><br/>The only way out of this is for the economy to return to a long term 3%-4% growth rate. Thats obviously what Obama is hoping for with his programs. Hes taking big risks, but he doesnt have much choice. He really did inherit a bad hand. If he did nothing, wed be in a depression by now, with 25% unemployment. He understands what hes doing and understands the risks. He has great economic advisors.<br/><br/>Obama couldnt have allowed the banking system to collapse. We need banks as the economys lynchpin. A year ago we could have lost the entire financial system over a weekend. Ships were being turned around at sea and going back home because their letters of credit were failing. The freeze up in credit could have gone on for years.<br/><br/>The stock market is up 50% since Obama took office, so it likes the uneasy stability that we have now. Credit markets have recovered tremendously, and IPOs are coming to the market again. Junk bond funds are up, confidence is returning. Theres greater willingness to lend, though only at high interest rates. But its a big improvement over last year.<br/><br/>Ilene: What do you expect for mortgage rates in the next few months? Years?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: You shouldnt touch real estate, as I think it will be dead money for another decade. Rent, dont buy. If you have to buy, then get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage now at 5%, because rates are going up a lot in the future. When I bought my first home in New York in the early eighties, I got nailed with a 17% interest rate on my mortgage. We may revisit those levels.<br/><br/>Houses will continue to move lower, maybe another 10% or so. We have another wave of foreclosures hitting the system soon, triggered by the option arm readjustments. I see support for prices when the cost of owning and the cost of renting are more in line. Home ownership may have to become cheaper than renting, because of perceived risk to the principle, for the real estate market sell-off to finish. However, expecting houses to drop a lot from here is like shorting Citibank at $3. Weve basically had the big move already. Due to poor demographic factors, the demand for houses is going to take a long time to come back. While 80 million baby boomers are trying to sell their houses to 65 million gen Xers, dont expect a recovery in prices, especially when the gen Xers are still living in your basement.<br/><br/>Ilene: You mentioned you missed the rally in financials, but still have concerns about the financial sector. <br/><br/>Mad Hedge: With financials, I knew they would rebound, but didnt imagine the extensive move weve seen. It was the greatest dead cat bounce and short covering rally of all time. But the financial sector will have troubles for years. If I had to buy U.S. stocks, Id buy big tech stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) , (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO), because for the most part they have tons of cash and little debt. Tech stocks didnt have the problems that were plaguing the other sectors. For example, they have no troubled assets, and no regulatory clamp down on their business. The credit crisis didnt affect them directly because they finance their operations through cash flow and tend not to borrow. Of course, theyre hurt indirectly when the customers have credit problems.<br/><br/>Credit markets are now seeing a huge differentiation in terms. Lenders are much more discriminating about who they lend to. American consumers are very constrained, but foreign consumers are not as constrained. They are not returning to frugality as we are because they didnt share our excesses in the first place. You dont see many black Cadillac Escalades with chrome wheels in China. If I had to buy stocks, I would buy equity in foreign companies where the growth will be in the coming years. In March, you could have bought anything and had a great trade, as the rising tide lifted all boats. But stocks in emerging markets outperformed US stocks by over a two to one margin.<br/><br/>Ilene: Would you be buying stocks now?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: No, I sold most of my positions in June. The risk was low in March, but not so low in June, and its even greater now. The PE multiple on the S&amp;P 500 has just jumped from 10 to 20 in six months. Historically, a 20 multiple is a terrible time to enter the market. Markets are discounting a \u0153V-shaped recovery, which we are not going to get. I think well get more of a \u0153square root shaped recovery, a \u0153V followed by sideways to a gradually upward sloping grind. Weve already had the \u0153V. Markets are overpriced. I dont see how we can have huge economic growth with capital-constrained banks, catatonic consumers, and commercial real estate troubles up the wazoo. One of the only positives is the weak dollar, which makes everything we sell to the rest of the world cheaper. This is good for our multi-national companies, good for our exporters. So far, the dollar is on a grinding, controlled move down, which is good. But if the dollars fall accelerates, it would not be good. A real dollar panic would lead to the widespread dumping of dollar assets, and commodity prices would explode. Then well get to $2,000 for gold and $40 for silver very quickly.<br/><br/>Ilene: You spent several years wildcatting for natural gas in Texas and Colorado, which has given you a unique insight into the energy space. What are your current thoughts on natural gas and oil?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Stay away from natural gas. The volatility will kill you. If you are a masochist, then buy it only when its cheap, on big dips, in the $3/MBTU range. In the last three years, thanks to the new \u0153fracting technology used in oil shales, we have discovered a 100 year supply of natural gas sitting under the US, and the producers have not been able to cut back fast enough. So now we have a supply glut, and we are almost out of storage. This is what took us down from $13 to $2.40 in 18 months. The lack of hurricanes has not helped demand either. Producers have been cutting back like crazy, trying to balance supply and demand, with a breakeven point of $2. They need a cold winter to help bring things back into balance. If the industry gets organized, then gas can become the 20 year bridge we need, until energy alternatives (OOTC:EGAL)  kick in. That makes me a big supporter of the \u0153Pickens Plan.<br/><br/>Oil is much more interesting. It overshot to downside in January to $32. Crude is now at $70 climbing out of the recession. Imagine how high it will get when all economies are functioning again. The financial crisis hurt the ability of big oil companies to get financing for large development projects in oil. These projects can take five to ten years to bring online. That means we will get higher oil prices sooner. We may get a pull back to the $50s, but the $30s would be a stretch. The $32 low was an artificial one caused by a complete absence of liquidity in all markets. I dont think well see those lows again.<br/><br/>Ilene: Where do you see the price of oil going in the distant future?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I think it may dip into the 50s, then up, perhaps skyrocketing to $300 before dropping back down to $3 after alternatives take over and demand vanishes. But thats at best 20 years out. If we can wean ourselves off oil in 20 years, it would be a huge accomplishment.<br/><br/>Ilene: I noticed you speak a little about politics in your essays; do you have a leaning one way or another?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Im politically neutral. Im getting bashed by the right these days because Ive said that the Republicans have no ability to affect the legislative process now. But we need to adjust our portfolios to reflect the current political realities. No matter how much you love Obama, you cant dispute the fact that the massive issuance of government bonds he is proposing is terrible for the bond market and the dollar, but great for precious metals and commodities. Obama won by a big margin, so the Democrats will be around for a while. Of course, if my \u0153square root scenario doesnt pan out, and we get a serious \u0153W recession instead, all bets are off. People will only give him the benefit of the doubt for so long.<br/><br/>Ilene: Where do you think the stock markets going to go over the next few years?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I think theres a 1 in 3 chance for new lows. Thats the \u0153W scenario. But with Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Washington Mutual (OOTC:WAMUQ)  gone, we have run out of companies that can suddenly go under and trigger a new financial crisis. The big survivors are partially government owned, and of course zero interest rates help a lot. More banks are going under, but they will be smaller, regional banks with excessive exposure to commercial real estate.<br/><br/>Ilene: How does this affect your actions in the markets?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: The best and least risky trades were in the early part of the year. Now, theres a lot more risk in all markets. Im neutral right now. If stocks dropped from here, I might be a buyer, but only in energy, commodities, and technology, and of course in emerging markets like Brazil, India, China, Korea, and Vietnam. Gold, silver and commodities have all had huge runs. My inner wimp has me in cash, waiting for better opportunities. I havent been playing the short side, because its a nightmare trying to short a liquidity driven market with interest rates at zero. There is no return on low risk investments now. Capital always moves to risky assets when interest rates are zero. Just look at Japan in the 1980s. There PE multiples soared from 10 to 100 purely driven by liquidity. For the last three years of that run the fundamental analysts were left twisting slowly in the wind. Artificially low interest rates boost asset prices to artificially high prices. It always ends in tears, but can play out for a while. You want to have an asymmetric risk reward metric in your favor, as we did in March of this year. Now, we dont have that.<br/><br/>The next downward move in the markets will more likely be due to disappointing economic data, earning misses, etc., not due to a total collapse of the system. We may sell off, but I dont think it will be to new lows. Its hard to see new lows with interest rates at zero. Instead, I see the \u0153square root recovery scenario mentioned earlier. The market may start drifting lower as people start seeing this possibility. That might set up a trading range for the S&amp;P 500 which could last for years, something like 800-1,200. During the nineties, Japan peaked at \u00a539,000, then traded in a \u00a520,000-\u00a525,000 range for five years, before the final collapse to \u00a57,000. Thats one scenario for the US.<br/><br/>Ilene: Youve had an amazing career. Let me ask you about some of the people youve interviewed. What was Ronald Reagan like?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Although I never agreed with him politically, you couldnt help but like the guy. He always had a joke ready. He was a lot smarter than he let on.<br/><br/>Ilene: And Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of Britain?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: Her nickname as \u0153The Iron Lady was well deserved. She could stare holes right through you. She treated journalists like a disapproving school teacher, which of course, she was.<br/><br/>Ilene: How about the terrorist leader, Yassir Arafat, of the PLO?<br/><br/>Mad Hedge: His body guards almost shot me when I reached to turn over a cassette in my tape recorder. I always thought he was a terrible leader. That is why the Palestinians never got anywhere, and why the Israelis left him alone.<br/><br/>Ilene: Meeting Chinas Deng Xiaoping must have been amazing. <br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I am 64 and he was only 49, so of course there were plenty of opportunities for humor. I could never envision this guy going on the Long March. He had a tremendous wit. Someone asked him why China kept its borders closed, and wasnt this an imposition on human rights. He said if he opened the borders, the surrounding countries would get flooded with people. He asked \u0153How many Chinese do you want? 20 million? 30 million? I also met Zhou Enlai during the Cultural Revolution. He was a brilliant man, the last man on a bell shaped curve of 500 million.<br/><br/>Ilene: I read somewhere that you interviewed four US Secretaries of the Treasury. <br/><br/>Yes, Miller Reagan, Schultz, and Brady. And I visited the French chateau of a fifth, C. Douglas Dillon. I keep a collection of dollar bills they signed.<br/><br/>My goal in life was always to get in the way of history, and let it run me over. Its been an amazing life. I wouldnt trade it for anything. <br/><br/>Ilene: What about Apocalypse Now? <br/><br/>Mad Hedge: I happened to be in town to interview Ferdinand Marcos, the president of the Philippines. If you look hard, Im in the USO scene. Most of the other \u0153GIs in that scene were European and Australian hippies rounded up from the Youth Hostels of Manila by Francis Ford Coppolas agents. Good luck, though. I was a lot younger and thinner then.<br/><br/>Ilene: Thanks a lot. Its been great talking to you.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The above was an interview with the Mad Hedge Fund Trader, courtesy of Ilene with       \u00a0    <url

Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, April 29th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're coming to you live from California this morning at the Milken Institute Conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trade is in focus today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My exclusive interview coming up with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: We made a lot of progress. We couldn't be more pleased with USMCA. We hope to see the Speaker bring that to the floor so we can get it passed.</p><p>You know we signed an agreement with South Korea. We're having conversations with Europe about trade issues. We're having conversations with China. And yes, we are having conversations with Japan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: New information on Japan coming up. More on trade, the GDP, the recent attacks on capitalism -- all right here with the Treasury Secretary.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle at the border continues. My exclusive interview with President Trump coming up about the growing crisis that I witnessed firsthand this weekend at the border between the U.S. and Mexico in El Paso, Texas. The President says that people are illegally pouring in partly because the U.S. economy is so good. They are looking for opportunity.</p><p>There is trouble for Boeing to report. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting this morning that the aircraft maker did not advise airlines or the FAA that it shut the warning system off on the 737 Max. What it could mean as the shareholder meeting kicks off today at Boeing.</p><p>We are also watching earnings. This is probably the biggest week so far for the first quarter reporting. Big tech companies are reporting this week, including Google parent company, Alphabet. That's today. Tomorrow it's all about Apple. We've got a preview. And then we've got the big jobs report at the end of the week.</p><p>But look at that week -- not only earnings, we've got the Federal Reserve meeting. We'll get the FOMC decision on Wednesday and, of course, trade talks as Mnuchin heads to Beijing. Full analysis on what is one of the most important weeks this week for investors</p><p>Ahead of it all, investors are looking at a market that is trading down fractionally. The Dow Industrials right now down 19 points, S&amp;P futures down 2 and the Nasdaq futures lower by 6.</p><p>Last week the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs after the GDP came in better than expected. The economic growth clocking in at 3.2 percent for the first quarter. It was much better than most expectations. That's why you had a rally in the Dow of 81 points at the close on Friday, 27 points higher on the Nasdaq.</p><p>This morning in Europe, the indices are lower. FT 100 is down 9 points, the CAC 40 in Paris is lower by 15. And the Dax in Germany down by 35 points -- one quarter of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, there's a holiday in Japan. That market is closed. But as you can see, the best performer was Korea, up 1.75 percent.</p><p>Well, the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks are on. The Nikkei average closed for Japan's Golden Week Holiday as you can see with the holiday there.</p><p>Joining me to break it all down, coming up: Fox Business Network's Lauren Simonetti is in New York this morning. PWC partner Mitch Roschelle also in New York and the Milken Institute Asia Fellow, Curtis Chin. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>CURTIS CHIN, ASIA FELLOW, MILKEN INSTITUTE: Good to see you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We really have to get your insights on all of the above.</p><p>Busy week this week. So we've got a lot to talk about. We are on it.</p><p>Our top story however, my exclusive sit-down with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. We talked about a wide range of topics including trade negotiations across the globe and now fears of a potential recession have certainly moved off of the front page. Policy moves at the Federal Reserve though still a focus.</p><p>We began with President Trump's economic policies and the growth that they've spurred.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great first quarter, 3.2 percent growth. To what do you attribute such vibrancy?</p><p>MNUCHIN: It was very impressive. And it's a result of the President's economic program. So this was tax cuts, tax reform, regulatory relief, and trade deals.</p><p>And, you know, not only was it a great number, but the first quarter is normally 1 percent lower than usual. And the government shutdown probably cost 30 basis points. This is really like a 4.5 percent unadjusted quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was incredible. So how do you keep this going? How much of a runway do all of those policies have in terms of providing a boost in the future.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well Maria -- as you know, last year there were a lot of people who said we would never get to 3 percent. We did. Then there were people who said the economy was going to slow down.</p><p>I think the President's economic program will continue to show strength throughout this year. And the U.S. is really the bright spot of the world. We really see -- we see Europe's falling. We see China is falling. We still see tremendous amounts of money coming into the U.S. economy and I think it looks very clear for the next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about Europe's slowdown? Because a lot of people feel like that has to hit the U.S. at some point. How significant is that slowdown in Europe?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, there's no question that the slowdown in Europe and China has already had some impact. But it just goes to show you how strong the U.S. economy is doing.</p><p>So again, I think we would be even stronger if it weren't for that. But I expect that's a modest impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think the corporate sector is really showing the strength more so than the consumer? Is the consumer shaky? How would you characterize each sector? Consumer versus corporate.</p><p>MNUCHIN: I think as you look at each quarter, we've seen a little bit of a variation. But I think as you look it over the time period, we've seen both the consumer as well as the business sector perform extremely well. We continue to see a lot of investments in the U.S. We see more jobs. We see the participation rate going up. We see wages increasing. So this is really an across-the-board expansion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wages are increasing. Better than 3 percent year over year. And yet the Fed can't even get the inflation that it's targeting of 2 percent. What's your take on inflation right now?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria -- that's good news for the U.S. economy to have this environment where we have low inflation and good growth. That's really the perfect condition we want to continue the expansion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that why LARRY KUDLOW is asking for a cut in interest rates by 50 basis points? I mean if things are going so well, why is Kudlow asking for the fed to lower rates?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Maria -- you know in my position as secretary of the Treasury, I have to respect the fed independence. I'm not going to comment on interest rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how about commenting on Kudlow?</p><p>MNUCHIN: I'm not going to comment on Kudlow commenting on interest rates either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>Well, the Federal Reserve is obviously right now saying it's out of the way, it's not going to be doing anything. But at some point with all of this strength in the economy, you would expect rates are going to go up and yet they're going down.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria -- if you look at, you know, at the end of last year, the market expected rates to go up another 100 basis points. The markets now adjusted those expectations.</p><p>Matter of fact, at certain points there's been expectations in the market of a rate cut. I think the Fed has said they're going to be data dependent. We'll see how the data comes in and how they react.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So did it matter that we saw that inversion, the 2-year versus the 10-year yield? Usually an inversion like that indicates a recession is at hand.</p><p>MNUCHIN: No, I said at the time I wasn't concerned about the inverted yield curve and I continue not to be -- have concerns about any of that.</p><p>I think first of all, the yield curve just reflects markets. Sometimes markets are efficient and sometimes markets aren't efficient. But I don't think that was ever predicting a recession. I think it was just predicting what people expected future interest rates to be.</p><p>But, you know, there's a lot of talk about recession at the end of last year. There's no talk about recession now with people seeing these numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, these numbers certainly indicate a much different story. You're leaving for China tomorrow. I want to ask you about China. What would be the most ideal situation in this next round of talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria -- I think the good news is we've made a lot of progress. I think we've been talking about this for two years, starting with President Trump and President Xi at Mar-A-Lago talking about a desire to have a rebalanced trading relationship. And that's something President Xi agreed to.</p><p>Over the last four months, Ambassador Lighthizer and a large inter-agency team has done an extraordinary job great job. I think we've made more progress than ever before. This is a real agreement. If we get to a completed agreement it will have real enforcement provisions.</p><p>There's still some important issues. So we still have more work to do. I think we spent a lot of time, we expect to have the meetings this week. The vice premier will come back with his team the following week. I think there's a strong desire from both sides to see if we can wrap this up or move on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wrap this up by when?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, I think kind of we hope within the next two rounds of -- in China and in D.C. -- to be at the point where we can either recommend to the President we have a deal or make a recommendation that we don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's most important to you? Is it most important that China opens up its markets to American companies? Is it more important that they not steal IP, forced transfer of technology? Or that they buy more stuff from the United States or that they stop espionage?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well Maria -- I think the most important issue is that we have a rebalanced economic relationship. The U.S. has been completely open to them for investment and for goods. We want to have a reciprocal trading relationship.</p><p>And if we can do that, that's a tremendous opportunity for U.S. workers, for U.S. companies to sell into a large, growing China middle class. So if we can get this right, this will completely rebalance the economic relationship and be a great opportunity for the U.S. economy.</p><p>And there's seven different chapters. So it's not one or two issues. We have talked about forced technology transfer, intellectual property, those are very important issues. But agriculture is very important to the President, making sure that farmers are treated fairly. Financial services, currency enforcement, there are major provisions in this agreement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they going to stop stealing IP from America?</p><p>MNUCHIN: We would absolutely expect them to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So have you gotten the enforcement mechanism done? Is that agreed upon?</p><p>MNUCHIN: The enforcement mechanism is close to done. So I would say that's one of the areas we've made a lot of progress. It needs a little bit of fine-tuning. But I would say, we have a fundamental understanding in that area.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What can you say about China's economy and its impact on the U.S.?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, there's no question that China is slowing. But again, I think that an opening of their economy and these reforms is a very important thing for their own growth and is not only good for the U.S., but will be good for them from a domestic standpoint as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is the President willing to remove all tariffs?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Again, I'm not going to comment on the specifics of our negotiations and what the President may or may not be willing to do at a specific time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the espionage issue -- Secretary? Because there was a story in the \"Journal\" just the other day that basically says China is growing increasingly aggressive in spying on the United States and the \"Journal\" says \"It has become Washington's single most important counter espionage priority. Is this part of the talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Maria -- I sit on the National Security Council, so I have access to information I can't talk about. But I would just say those issues are separate from the trade and economic issues so those are not part of the discussions we're having over the next two weeks. But there are discussions going on between us and the Chinese government on many important issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well look, Huawei has been a big issue. The President has not been shy about telling us that if the Europeans, if Africa is using Huawei Telecom, then the U.S. will not share as much information with them. So clearly there has been he's espionage and trade secrets stolen.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, the President is absolutely determined to make sure that our communication system is secure, and whether that's China or anyone else, you know, the President is going to make sure we build out the most advanced communication infrastructure in a very secure way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about Japan. The President was with Japanese Prime Minister Abe last week. Is he willing to consider putting tariffs on autos coming out of Japan?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria -- as you know, the President has us focused on trade issues across the board. So we made a lot of progress. We couldn't be more pleased with USMCA. We hope to see the Speaker bring that to the floor so we can get that passed.</p><p>You know, we signed an agreement with South Korea. We're having conversations with Europe about trade issues. We're having conversations with China and yes, we are having conversations with Japan.</p><p>So I met with the deputy prime minister on Thursday. We had a good discussion on trade and economic issues. Ambassador Lighthizer has a team that's leading these discussions and we want to make sure that our farmers are being treated fairly and that their markets are open for our agriculture and other issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the President was very clear, he doesn't want those tariffs or levies on U.S. agriculture and if they are remaining there, he would consider putting tariffs on autos coming out of Japan, right?</p><p>MNUCHIN: I think the President's going to look at all his options. But he fundamentally wants to make sure we have balanced and reciprocal trading relationships. So as you know, we have a deficit with Japan as we do in other areas. And the President is just looking for fair and reciprocal access.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So once China is completed, should we expect the President next attacks the Europeans in terms of a trade relationship and Japan? You said you're working on it right now.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Ambassador Lighthizer and his team, we have a big interagency team working on all these issues. And the President has us working on all of these simultaneously.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible that you're working on all of these things together. You're in the middle of working on a deal with Japan and Europe as well as you also do China.</p><p>MNUCHIN: That's true. The economic team meets with the President weekly to update him on the trade issues. He's briefed on all these issues. He gives us input and direction. And as you know, the President is determined to make sure we have fair and balanced trade and wants to see that across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The only thing is that even people who agree with all of your policies -- and it's hard not to agree. You've obviously moved the needle on economic growth. But the one thing that people say could actually change the momentum, reverse the vibrancy, are issues around trade. Do you worry that all of this conversation about the potential for tariffs on Japan, potential for increased tariffs on Europe in the face of China and all the other issues, is that going to slow down economic growth, reverse this?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well Maria -- as you know, for a long time many of these countries didn't want to have conversations about changing the trade relationship because as the President said, we were the piggy bank and the deals were fair -- not fair to us, they were advantageous to them.</p><p>So the President is determined -- and tariffs have been a big part of getting people to the negotiating table. But the President's objective is to make sure we have fair and balanced trade.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: More of that exclusive interview coming up. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Earnings season is shifting into high gear this week -- huge week.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I'm glad you said it like that -- Maria, huge. It is huge. We are waiting results from five Dow components this week -- Apple, Merck, Pfizer, McDonald's. And then Dow also going to post all of their results all this week. And we're going to hear from nearly one-third of S&amp;P 500 companies, including Google's parent Alphabet, we've got General Electric and General Motors.</p><p>Now, Alphabet's results are going to be out after the bell today -- the parent of Google. That's going to be interesting. And then there's more, key economic news coming out this week. You've got the Case-Shiller Home Prices report that's out tomorrow. The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates, that's Wednesday with a press conference and the April jobs report which you'll be covering of course, will be on Friday. Get ready.</p><p>Ok. Now, let's talk about Boeing. They're bracing for a pretty stormy annual meeting today. The company's CEO is facing shareholders for the first time since two deadly crashes of the 737 max Jet. Now Boeing reportedly did not tell airlines it had deactivated a safety feature that warns the pilots about faulty sensors until after the Lion Air crash in October. Then they started to share the information.</p><p>That safety feature was used on earlier models of the popular plane, so some of the manuals the airlines were using were actually wrong. Boeing also apparently failed to notify the FAA about the change.</p><p>Big day for Boeing today. The stock down about half a percent in the premarket.</p><p>Staying with airlines. United Airlines reportedly covering built-in cameras on certain seatback in-flight entertainment screens. A United spokesperson telling BuzzFeed the cameras that were on some premium seats were never activated. The company has no plans to use them. The decision coming after passengers began to notice the built-in cameras and they raised privacy concerns to United as well as notifying Singapore Airlines about those cameras.</p><p>Finally there is this. Massachusetts' last coal-fired power plant is now rubble.</p><p>There it went. The plant had burned coal since 1963. It closed in 2017. They new owners of the property plan to replace it with a facility that supports, Maria -- offshore wind farms. So, you know, things are changing. There you go. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: wow. Yes. That is amazing. What a picture. And that is really a sign of the times.</p><p>Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>Backlash from William Barr. The attorney general threatening not to testify this upcoming week before House and Senate Committees. This week is planned that he will testify but now there's some pushback.</p><p>Then the battle at the border. I spoke exclusively with the President on immigration -- next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump defending himself against allegations of obstruction of justice from Judge Andrew Napolitano. The judge questioning the President's action before and after the Mueller report release.</p><p>The President wrote in a pair of tweets over the weekend about Judge Napolitano, saying this, \"Thank you to brilliant and highly-respected attorney Alan Dershowitz for destroying the very dumb legal argument of Judge Andrew Napolitano. Ever since Andrew came to my office to ask that I appoint him to the U.S. Supreme Court and I said no, he has been very hostile. Also asked for a pardon for his friend, a good pal of low ratings Shepard Smith.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano to respond to all of this. Judge -- good to see you this morning.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>If this is the way you treat your friends, how do you treat your enemies? Oh boy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What happened? Did you ask him to put you on Supreme Court?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you ask him to pardon a friend?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He and I spoke for about three hours in two 90-minute meetings. This is when he was the President-elect, about the type of person that should replace Justice Scalia. And in the process of my describing that person and the person I was describing was then Judge Neil Gorsuch, he looked to me and said sounds like you're describing yourself. I said no, no, I'm not describing myself. I'm describing Neil Gorsuch because you have this list of people from which you want to choose and Judge Gorsuch is the person that I think most of your advisers are going to point to.</p><p>This is early on in the process. He said all right, give me a spiel as to why I should put you on. Now who would turn that down I gave him the spiel, so-to-speak. And somebody else in the room said, you know, that's pretty interesting. The judge is a little long in the tooth to which the President said \"blank you\" to the person who said the judge is long in the tooth. I'm four years older than the judge and I'm about to become president.</p><p>It was that kind of conversation. So I thought the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you don't expect the President -- you don't expect the President to reveal it all. But that seems like that's what he was doing, even with the pardon situations as well.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. You know, the pardon that he and I discussed is of a mutual friend of his and mine and he asked me to tell me what the person was convicted of and if I thought that the conviction was just. I described what the person was convicted of. I described that it was just. The President used a very strong term to condemn the conviction. And he said you know this person as well as I do. Call this person up and tell this person he's going to be on the list of pardons that I will seriously consider. That was the extent of that conversation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Look, I thought the President's comments were brilliant. He wanted to divert attention from what Mueller had said about him and what I had commented about Mueller to his relationship with me. His relationship with me is not the story. He and I have been friends for 30 years and probably will be for the next 30 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let me ask about the Mueller story because Attorney General William Barr seems to be threatening that he's going to skip this hearing on the Justice Department's handling of the Russia investigation if lawmakers go through with a plan to let staff lawyers question him. Democrats are threatening a subpoena if Barr does not appear.</p><p>But you know, he's going willingly. He doesn't have to go and now they're saying that they're not even going to be there. They're going to have staff question him. What do you think?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I think they would be there. But it would be kind of demeaning to have staff questioning the attorney general.</p><p>So there's two arguments here. One is, this is the Congress' hearing and he can't tell them how to run it. The other is it's highly unusual and even improper to have persons other than elected public officials interrogating the attorney general.</p><p>Prediction? They'll work something out. The interest in this testimony is so great, they will find a way to make it happen and we'll be watching on Thursday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right -- Judge. Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge Andrew Napolitano. Great to see you sir. Appreciate that.</p><p>Quick break and then the border crisis. More on my visit to the southern border in El Paso, Texas yesterday. I got an up close look at how agents are working to secure the border. I spoke exclusively with President Trump during the day. His take -- coming up.</p><p>Then there's this, Mark Zuckerberg's newest invention made for his wife. We'll take a look.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Los Angeles at the Milken Institute Global Conference .</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are covering the battle at the border, part two of my exclusive interview coming up with President Trump about the growing crisis that I had a chance to witness firsthand yesterday at the border in El Paso. The president also spoke about the potential upcoming testimony of Attorney General William Barr and the pending USMCA deal. We begin with the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via telephone): Now what's happening though is the economy is so good, you know, it's probably the best economy. You report it's one of the best economies that we've ever had. Would you say that's right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely. That 3.2 percent number obviously showed strength in the consumer as well as strength in the corporate sector because CapEx was so strong. But Beto O'Rourke, the strongest town where I am right now Mr. President helped El Paso.</p><p>TRUMP: Right. And because of that -- but Maria, because of that people see that, they're very smart. And it's the cartels, the coyotes, you wouldn't believe these people, they're tough and they're vicious, and they're smart, and they're street smart and cunning and they know the system better than the people that wrote it. They know the system a hell of a lot better than the people in Congress that wrote it. The people in Congress have no clue.</p><p>And you know, look, we have some great Republicans that are dying to get this done. They'll do anything to get it done. It's so simple. I mean, we change four or five rules and we have to change the asylum rules.</p><p>You know, the people come up asylum -- these rough gang members come up and they stand there like little innocent lambs next to a lawyer that they have who they pick up. I don't know, I guess these lawyers get paid by the -- by the dozen. And they stand there and they read a statement that the lawyer hands them. This is great danger, I am afraid for my life, I am afraid for my country and being in my country and they say oh, that's wonderful.</p><p>Then you look at the guy and you wouldn't want to fight him. OK, this guy is not afraid of anything. And you see pictures of him coming up that he's carrying a flag from Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. Yes, we run into a lot of people --</p><p>TRUMP: You know, it's crazy. So you see them waving the flag proudly and then they say they're afraid to be in their country. It's just a con game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, let me tell you Mr. President, I know you have to run, but you know, all of the 2020 contenders who want to run against you in 2020, you haven't heard a peep out of them about this. Beto O'Rourke is from El Paso. I don't know what he's done about this problem. And then of course, you've got Bernie and now you've got Joe Biden. They're not characterizing this as a crisis, sir.</p><p>TRUMP: So Beto O'Rourke wants to take down the walls. That means he's finished. I mean, he was finished two weeks ago when he started saying certain very stupid things. Beto O'Rourke has been exposed. I think Biden has been exposed. I don't know what the hell happened to Biden. I never saw that before. I don't know. It just doesn't look like the same Biden. I said is that really Joe Biden? He doesn't look the same to me. I've known him for a long time. I've seen him for a long time. I said what happened to him. So he's been exposed because he's very weak, he doesn't want to talk about this. No, but they don't want to talk about this.</p><p>I don't -- I don't get what their plan is. Do they they want to let people in that shouldn't be here? Because we have people that are trying to get in that shouldn't be here. Think of the word apprehend. The border security is apprehending 100,000 people a month. Do you know how many people that is? It's incredible, the job they do.</p><p>The problem is with the laws, we should be able to take them right out. We can't. We have to bring them into a court. Who ever heard of that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know, yes.</p><p>TRUMP: We're the only country in the world, not that I know of that has a court system and it's a -- it's a mobile court system. I mean, it is on the border and with all of these cases, 900,000 cases, you'd need to do 900 -- you'd need 100,000 lawyers. I mean, it's the craziest thing you've ever seen. So, we are doing a job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is and the border patrol --</p><p>TRUMP: What we're really focused on is the bad ones. We won't let the bad ones in under any circumstances. We're keeping track of everybody. So when the laws change, we can move them back out and bring them back to their countries. So we have a very good system of keeping track. When the law is change.</p><p>Because right now, we move them out, the border patrol people would get arrested. I don't know where these people come from, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, I know you have to go.</p><p>TRUMP: But I'll tell you, it wasn't my neighborhood. These have no common sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Final question Mr. President.</p><p>TRUMP: Unless -- honestly, unless they hate the country. The only thing I can say is, they hate our country. That's how stupid these laws are. There's only a person that hates our country could have approve this stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God. And the whole -- the whole world loves it. They're trying to get in, in record numbers. Mr. President, before you go, real quick, William Barr testifying next week --</p><p>TRUMP: You know, people see this and they say hey, maybe -- they start learning and then they get -- you know, they get educated very quickly and you know who educates them? The cartels. And then the cartels say we want $5,000 and we'll bring you up and then the women are getting raped on the trip.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>TRUMP: The trip is brutal. The trip through Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's very dangerous.</p><p>TRUMP: And they should do much better by the way, in stopping the people. They're not doing anything, they're doing very little for us. They should do much more. They've done more for us under me than they ever have before. But they should do much more.</p><p>They took 15,000 people out recently. But that's nothing compared to the number of people that walk. And I said, I'm going to close the border if you don't start shaping up. But Mexico is doing a terrible job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you can't close the border though right before USMCA gets ratified though, right? I mean, you're waiting on its ratification of USMCA.</p><p>TRUMP: I'll do anything I have to, because this to me is more important than USMCA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, I know you have to run. Real quick, William Barr testifies next week. What's the most important question you think he should be asked, if he - if he shows up for the testimony next week, this upcoming week?</p><p>TRUMP: I think the most important question for our great new attorney general -- he's done a great job in a short period of time. I think it's just to -- how did this start, how could a thing like this happen to our country. It was a big con job. How could -- you know, top people at the FBI be so corrupt and be so rotten and why did everybody let it start?</p><p>Now, It was very interesting. I watched different people this week and everybody wants to know not about -- you know, where it came from, how did this start? Why did we come up with Bruce Ohr?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, what was the predicate?</p><p>TRUMP: Why did we come up with a Comey who was corrupt? Why did McCabe and all of these people exist? I mean, McCabe whose wife got $700,000 from Hillary Clinton's PAC and she's under investigation by the -- by the FBI. No wonder she -- now wonder they let her go for so many -- so many violations. So many crimes committed. Hard to believe, actually. I mean, it's shocking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's all -- it's all quite extraordinary. It's all quite extraordinary.</p><p>TRUMP: And this was really a coup attempt, it didn't worked, we caught them. But now, everybody wants people to go out and find out what the hell happened, where did all of this corruption start, when you have Strzok and Page?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, certainly our viewers want to know.</p><p>TRUMP: The lovers we call them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, our viewers want to know that.</p><p>TRUMP: Say we wanted insurance policy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, thank you so much.</p><p>TRUMP: -- just in case Hillary Clinton loses, we want an insurance policy, well, we can get Trump out. Well, it didn't work so well. But I'll tell you what, it really hurt our country and it hurts our country and this is cleaning out the deep state. This is really cleaning the swamp and we've gotten rid of 22 people at the very top. These people are corrupt.</p><p>And then you look at a guy like Brennan with his big mouth and you look at Clapper who is a dummy and yet he was in Intelligence. He's a dumb guy. They lied and they lied to Congress. Clapper lied so badly it's incredible, to Congress. And then they get paid by CNN.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and we have that resume.</p><p>TRUMP: Fake news CNN, they go and they make more money than they've ever seen before, although they probably may possibly they made a lot more than that. We just don't know about it. I mean, something had to go on, but it's a disgrace.</p><p>Everyone wants to know, Maria, and you might be number one on the list, I watch your show, you're incredible. You may be number one on the list.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>TRUMP: Everybody wants to know how did it start, why did it start, what about the dossier?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we want to know.</p><p>TRUMP: How much did Hillary Clinton pay for the dossier? You know she paid for it. And the DNC paid for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it was a million dollars.</p><p>TRUMP: This guy Steele is a total fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it was a million dollars.</p><p>TRUMP: So, you know, everybody wants to know about it. And that's really -- hopefully they'll being going there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, thank you so much for calling in this morning, I so appreciate it. I know you have a busy day. Thank you, sir.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much, Maria.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up right here next up, booming real estate, how Marriott is now gearing up to become the first major hotel chain to create a home rental platform, they're going right after Airbnb.</p><p>And then Mark Zuckerberg's new invention, the Facebook head creates a device to help his wife get a better night sleep. We're taking a look at that. We all need it. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're watching earnings this morning, also want to point out that J.P. Morgan is upgrading the banks this morning. We'll check the bank stocks coming up.</p><p>Then there's this, a major recall affecting rocking baby sleepers, Cheryl Casone with those details in headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria. Kids II is recalling nearly 700,000 rocking sleepers after five infants died over the past seven years. The affected products have been sold since 2012 at Wal-Mart, Target and other stores. The Consumer Products Safety Commission says anyone who has the Kids II sleeper should stop using it. The recall comes two weeks after Fisher Price recalled about five million of its sleepers after more than 30 deaths over a decade.</p><p>All right, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg showing off an invention that he made to help his wife sleep. It's a glowing device called the sleep box. It emits a faint light between 06:00 a.m. and 07:00 a.m., so Mrs. Zuckerberg knows the couples, two toddlers, two daughters are about to wake up without having to check her phone. Zuckerberg says if anybody wants to develop his invention further, go for it.</p><p>All right, if you like your cup of Joe with a kick, Skyy Vodka is introducing a Cold Brew Coffee flavored vodka, it's made with real coffee beans. But it's still 70 proof, folks. A liter will set you back $17.00 bottles are only available for a limited time.</p><p>And finally, I'm going to go from vodka to slime. Nickelodeon turning its signature green goo into something sweet. Wal-Mart is exclusively carrying Nickelodeon Slime Ice Cream, Maria. It's available in other vanilla ice cream cups roll with green frosting or orange, lemon lime frozen bars. I'll work on getting some for us on set.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good. Well, we'll have to -- we'll have to see that one. When I'm back in New York, I've got to see those slime -- those slime bars. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We want to talk China and trade with Canada and Mexico. There is some question this morning, an article in the Journal, about the pushback the Democrats are giving the president on his USMCA and of course Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary is on his way to China this morning to begin another round of trade talks.</p><p>Curtis Chin is with us this morning from the Milken Institute. Tell us about the China Silk Road strategy and where China is going with this. How the U.S. gets impacted?</p><p>CHIN: Sure. Terrifically, there's so much happening this week. But one thing that happened this weekend was China's second One Belt One Road or new Silk Road initiative. It's only their plan really to help with infrastructure investments throughout the region, very positive. But maybe the negative rr they're really trying to lock in perhaps unfair relationships with trading partners from Europe to Africa, to Asia. Recreating that old Silk Road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The president's not going to allow that. He's going to keep pushing back on China to get a deal. Do you expect a deal will in fact address some of the more important issues like the I.P. theft, like the transfer of technology?</p><p>CHIN: That's a separate issue than the One Belt One Road conference. We're very clear -- you know, we're all hopeful for a trade deal. but I think as what happened -- as what happened between the U.S. and North Korea so far, if it's a bad deal, America will walk away.</p><p>You know, the U.S. Economy, amazing, what, 3.2 percent. The U.S. is really -- economy is firing on all cylinders. And that works to Secretary Mnuchin's advantage as they try and rebalance this relationship with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a really good point. Yes, the leverage is when you've got a strong economy.</p><p>Mitch Roschelle, Lauren Simonetti in New York this morning. This article in the Journal about USMCA, we've been saying this for upwards of a year that the Democrats are pushing back on this but this would be a huge blow to markets, Lauren, if in fact the USMCA is not ratified.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I know and Democrats want labor laws changed in Mexico, particularly, in order for them to ratify this. But in the same Wall Street Journal over the weekend, Chuck Grassley wrote an op-ed. And he said essentially, look, if you want this deal to go through, you've got to take the tariffs off because the tariffs are a tax. I'm a farmer, my family's a farmer, my constituents are farmers and it hurts us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's absolutely right. Mitch, your reaction to that, he wants those steel and aluminum tariffs removed from Mexico and Canada.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: You know, I think sort of bridging this stories together, the thing that's interesting is as Secretary Mnuchin goes to China is the Chinese could look at what's going on with USMCA and saying wow, we're negotiating in good faith but if the Congress is going to be obstreperous and not want to play ball here, why should we bother right now? So, I wonder if they're very focused on our legislative process and going to say they've got an election coming up, they've got unfriendly Congress, maybe they don't want to be in a hurry to make a deal. So I don't know if that's part of the calculus on their part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point. Yes, I don't think they're missing a lot, that's for sure.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back, the booming real estate market, Marriott is now gearing up to become the first major hotel chain to create a home rental platform. They're going targeting right to Airbnb. My next guest will be speak here at Milken later today about just that. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Real estate in focus, industry leaders set to speak here at the Milken Conference later today, weighing in on the global economy, the impact on the retail, commercial and industrial real estate industries, this as Marriott International is looking to get into the home rental business, setting up direct competition with Airbnb.</p><p>Joining me right now is Cain International CEO, Jonathan Goldstein. Jonathan, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JONATHAN GOLDSTEIN, CEO, CAIN INTERNATIONAL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, I guess some of these traditional hotel companies have seen the success that Airbnb has and they're saying I want a piece of that market share.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Well, I think that's right. I think over the years the hotel companies have moved very much into asset light models and now they're looking for all alternative ways they can generate revenue. And what you're seeing around the world is you're seeing the modern traveler is looking for modern ways to solve their solutions and provide ways in which they can enjoy themselves in overseas cities. I think that's a global phenomenon. I think it's going to continue growing. We're seeing it in London, we're seeing it in New York, we're seeing it in Miami. So I think we're seeing growth across the sector in all areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How would Marriott do it? I mean, you know, Marriott has hotels. Would they acquire homes and then rent them out? Do you know what the strategy is?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: I would think -- I would think they would go into the world of getting people to sign up on their website and therefore creating the income by creating an income stream rather than the assets. They've stayed -- they've stayed away from the asset heavy model for some -- for some years now. And I doubt they're going back there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, this market is booming right now, isn't it?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: It is -- it is. And I think -- we have a service department offering in eastern to the north London delivering hundred units this week. We have an opportunity at Mayfair, we have opportunities in Miami. We're seeing opportunities across the space, where alternative uses for property to meet the needs of the consumer in the 21st century. We've got a co- working space for women opening in more else place, in L.A. And of course on this site here we own -- you know, (INAUDIBLE) Beverly Hilton South where we are fortunate to be this morning where we've got a million square feet we're developing for downtown Beverly Hills.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Jonathan, we know that the global economy is slowing. Europe is lucky to generate one percent growth this year. China has come off of the highs of the year. How is that impacting real estate right now? Are you expecting this market to slow down?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: No, I think the world is seeing a slowdown. I think it's very important as well that people recalibrate their expectations for returns. We live in a very low interest rate environment, we've enjoyed that for over 10 years now.</p><p>So I think what was a 20 percent return, people now have to understand and expect that that's in the low teens. People have to understand their construction, they have to understand their offering. But most importantly, they have to understand the needs of the modern consumer. If they understand what people want, then they have an opportunity of meeting their needs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point.</p><p>Let me switch gears, ask you about the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union, being in London you have British and global real estate getting an impact there as well. Do you expect the U.K. to leave the E.U. number one, and number two, how will this impact real estate?</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: My children will tell you, I've got every political prediction wrong in the last three years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, no, OK.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: I'm not going to say it today and make a prediction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not good.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: What I will tell you is that the short-term uncertainty in Britain is chaotic. It's a farce to upper cool class there have been unable to find the solution to move forward from the vote in 2016. And I don't really see in the short-term an opportunity for that happening unless in the most extreme and unlikely situation that a conservative party led by Theresa May finds a resolution with the most left-leaning labor party in a generation.</p><p>So, I think that we've got a situation of chaos and farce. But I think we need to distinguish between the short-term and the long-term. In the long- term, you can bet on London, you can bet on the United Kingdom, we'll be OK. Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Jonathan, it's great to have you. Thank you so much.</p><p>GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jonathan Goldstein joining us there.</p><p>Quick break and then more of my exclusive sit-down interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. That's next. We're talking USMCA, next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019042902cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0N-VY71-DXH2-616X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp; SPACE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp; ENGINE PARTS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC3761 GUIDED MISSILES &amp; SPACE VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>BOE (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>BA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>President.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  Yikes, the Dow, the lawyer, and, oh, yes, the trade  war.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FOX on top of more than just stocks going down.  And, boy, oh, boy, did  they ever go down.  The Dow careening more than 723 points on a trifecta of  troubles that all came together today.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up, the president's lead attorney out, John Dowd quitting, the same  John Dowd who was strongly advising that the president not sit down with  Bob Mueller.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second up, tariffs.  Try more than $50 billion worth of them going down,  China the target.  And let's just say today China not happy.  </p><p>And third up, a $1.3 trillion spending plan that passes in the House, but  is anyone's guess in the Senate.  If it fails, guess what?  The government  shut down, which, as I said, all combined have sent stocks down.  Every  single Dow component in the red today.  The Dow surrendering more than 722  points for the day, down about 3 percent, the Nasdaq almost 2.5 percent,  the S&amp;P 500 2.5 percent.</p><p>More on what produced those numbers.  </p><p>First to the White House on how they're responding to them.  </p><p>That's where you will find our John Roberts -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, clearly,  Neil, as the Dow has continued to go down since the president made his  announcement that he sending his U.S. trade representative, Robert  Lighthizer, to the drawing board to come up with some tariffs against China  and then further to that take some measures to restrict investment by China  in U.S. technological companies, they have watched the Dow tick down and  tick down.  </p><p>And now we're back -- we're down over 700 points.  And the president, of  course, all through the campaign and the first part of his presidency was  touting at how the Dow was at record numbers.  Now it looks like it's on a  little bit of shaky ground.  </p><p>But let's not also forget that when the president was doing the run-up to  tariffs on steel and aluminum, the Dow was all over the place and it  managed to recover quite well.  So the president and the White House  clearly hoping that this is only a temporary setback as well and that when  they see the effect of the tariffs might be, if and when tariffs are  actually imposed, the Dow may decide that it's not as flipped out as it  appears to be today.  </p><p>Let's not forget that the tariffs on steel and aluminum have not been  imposed yet.  Now to a couple of the other things.  A $1.3 trillion budget  clearly is something that the stock market doesn't like, because that means  that the deficit will be even bigger than it was, adding to the debt.  </p><p>And that's always a drag on the stock markets as well.  And then there's  the report that came out this morning about the president's lead outside  attorney, John Dowd, is leaving the legal team.  One of the reasons for  that is that it appears as though there was a conflict between members of  the outside and the inside legal team, each other and with the president,  over what the future strategy should be.  </p><p>The president appeared to be not listening to the advice of John Dowd, who  was urging cooperation with Mueller, but at the same time suggesting that  the president shouldn't sit down for an interview with Mueller, or if he  did, that the parameters of that be very narrow.</p><p>We saw Joe diGenova, the famous former U.S. attorney for the District of  Columbia and a man that believes that there was a conspiracy at the top of  the FBI to frame President Trump for a false crime, being named to the  legal team.  They also reached out to Ted Olson, John Flood, a number of  other people they're also reaching out to try to try to bolster that team.</p><p>So, just seemed that John Dowd wasn't fitting in with the team as it was  organizing to go forward in what they believe will be a crucial aspect of  the Mueller investigation.  </p><p>But the president when asked this afternoon in the Diplomatic Room after  announcing the trade action on China, saying that he would like to sit down  for an interview with Mueller.  Another indication that that may be not in  not-too-distant future -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Buddy, thank you very, very much, John Roberts.</p><p>All right, before I go to my guests here, I do want to show you happened at  the corner of Wall and Broad and a sell-off that picked up steam.  Again,  as I said, all Dow 30 components were down and appreciably so.  This is now  putting the Dow into correction territory yet again.  </p><p>And we had some technology stocks that were falling off beyond that.   Boeing, for example, was one of the worst performers in the Dow, falling  better than 5 percent.  Remember, a lot of people seem to think that Boeing  more to that point is going to be a target of the Chinese as a sort of a  tit for tat on all of the beefed-up tariffs that the administration is  looking to slap on the Chinese.  That's the next stage of this.  </p><p>We're also looking at that $1.3 trillion spending measure which worried  Wall Street even though it passed the House because it's just chockful of  all these goodies and the spending that seems to know no bounds.  </p><p>We're going to be going to Peter Doocy on Capitol Hill with that and a read  on that, but first of John Layfield on the market responding to all these  developments, sort of lick a trifecta of trying news, huh?</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It is.</p><p>We knew this day of reckoning was coming, that the easy money was going to  end, that rates were going to start going up.  But I think what has  exacerbated it obviously was inflation worries that are coming up, but more  importantly the tariffs and the retaliatory trade that could come from  these tariffs.</p><p>Add to that what's going on with the big tech companies and the regulatory  framework that's most likely coming.  I think you have this big storm that  we have had it today.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means chief, John,, has  talked about the fact that trade tariffs -- and the president might be  right to be chagrined about this.  He doesn't like the way some of these  countries play ball, but that a trade war could wipe out all the benefits  of the tax cuts.</p><p>Is that among some of the factors hitting stocks?</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I don't think there's any doubt about.</p><p>It's hard to put tariffs on China because they have a global supply chain.   Not everything is made in China.  We learned that in 2009 with President  Obama when we put the tire tariff on.  It didn't work.  All we did is get  tires from different places.  It didn't work.  we didn't have any more  production necessarily in the United States coming from that.</p><p>But, however, China can put tariffs on us directly.  They can put it on our  farm products.  They can put it on our technology.  That's much easier to  do.  A retaliatory measure from China hurts us more than it hurts them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we're seeing a the bottom of the screen, for those  looking at home here, a correction is when you're 10 percent from your  highs.  A bear market starts at 20 percent from those highs.  </p><p>But one of the catalysts besides trade that might be influencing this is  this touch and go thing with a spending measure to keep the government  lights on for another six months or at least through the next fiscal year,  at least through the end of this one.</p><p>And that's where we will find our Peter Doocy sort of dealing with this.</p><p>It's a $1.3 trillion measure, right, Peter?  And it passes the House, but  iffy in the Senate?  What's the latest?</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The latest right now, Neil, is that  there are big question marks not -- about certain senators who may not want  a vote to proceed before the government shutdown deadline.</p><p>And, in fact, we came over here to Senator Rand Paul's office.  We were  talking to some staff.  We understand that he is in here right now trying  to read this 2,232-page bill, but right now he's only on page 140.</p><p>There's no updated guidance right now as to whether or not he is going to  object to a vote that would let them pass this omnibus budget and avoid a  government shutdown or he's going to try to block it.  But he's not the  only Republican senator who has problems with this.</p><p>Senator Bob Corker, Republican retiring from Tennessee, was on the Senate  floor a little while ago.  He said that this bill is one of the most  grotesque pieces of legislation that he has ever seen.</p><p>And a big problem that these fiscally conservative Republican senators have  is just that you spend a lot of new money and you don't make any new  meaningful cuts elsewhere -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, the question, Peter, is what happens if the Senate can't get  its act together on this?  Time is a ticking, right?  I mean, by 12:01  Saturday morning, bright and early, they don't have something together, the  pumpkins explodes, right?</p><p>DOOCY:  Right.</p><p>And then in the first three months of the midterm election year, you would  have your third government shutdown.  And that would come as a surprise to  a lot of people on Capitol Hill, because even though the House Freedom  Caucus, the conservative lawmakers over there, have been urging President  Trump not to sign this measure, Republican leadership put enough stuff into  this omnibus that they were able to get more than a hundred Democrats on  board over there.</p><p>There's a lot of Democratic support in the Senate.  In fact, Chuck Schumer  had a press conference a little while ago where he said that they were  happy with the deal that they got, which is not something that you hear  from Republicans, except those who were very pleased with all the new  Pentagon spending.  </p><p>But if there is a shutdown, then you're just going to hear a lot more talk  about dysfunction, about waiting until the last minute, but also about why  Republicans, who were elected to come to Congress to rein in spending,  haven't been doing that -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Guys, thank you all very, very much -- Peter Doocy.</p><p>White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short with us right now.</p><p>Marc, a confluence of weird events here, but the worry seems to be that  there could be some hell to pay with this stuff.  I know you don't obsess  over the markets to the degree maybe your boss did when they were going and  running up, but are you worried? </p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  Well, Neil, I  think, putting it in perspective, the markets were a little over 18000 on  Election Day 2016.  So, we have had about a 30 percent increase in the  markets.  </p><p>You have unemployment at a 17-year low.  You have the Fed announcing just  yesterday, when they raised rates, expectations of continued reduced  unemployment and actually boosting their GDP forecast.  </p><p>So the fundamentals of our economy remain strong.  The president's policies  on regulations and taxes continue to boost our economy.  And now what the  president is looking to do is to try to protect American workers and  American companies whose intellectual property has been stolen by the  Chinese.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You had said and the president had echoed that you weren't fans  necessarily of this $1.3 trillion spending plan, but it allows you to move  forward.  You get what you want on the military and some of these other  priorities.  Some of the Democrats get what they want.  And it should pass.  </p><p>What if it doesn't?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, Neil, we fully expect the bill to pass.  As far as to when I  think is a guess, for tonight, tomorrow night.  </p><p>But the reality is that Congress has provided us with six continuing  resolutions since the fiscal year ended on September 30.  What that means  is that rather than actually doing their job and passing appropriations  bill, we're stuck with legislation that General Mattis tells us puts them  at a great handicap, because they're basically repairing old, worn-out  equipment, as opposed to purchasing new equipment they need to continue to  fight the war on terror.</p><p>So, from an administration perspective, you're right.  There's a lot things  in the bill we like.  We like that is the first, the most significant pay  increase for our men and women in uniform in 10 years.  It's the biggest  build-up in military resources since World War II that can help make sure  that America safe.</p><p>It does provide a lot of the border security measures.  It does provide  legislation that we were asking for as far as protecting our schools and  making them safer.</p><p>But the price tag is something that, if we had sufficient Republican votes,  of course we wouldn't want as much non-defense spending is in this bill.   But, ultimately, we have to make a decision as administrations, do you shut  down the government, have another continuing resolution, or actually  provide our troops the resources they need to make sure America is safe?</p><p>CAVUTO:  This tariff thing, any response from the Chinese yet?  They have  promised that they're going to do something.  They vowed all necessary  measures.  They deny that they force companies to hand over technology,  some of the things that the president outlined.</p><p>But they are almost assuredly going to target U.S. companies or even  industries or even the agriculture community, that they could go after our  farmers.  Are you worried that this gets out of control?</p><p>SHORT:  Well, Neil, I don't think any of us wants a trade war.  And we  certainly want to protect the farmers in America.  And I know that China  looks at that and knows how much of the agricultural products they import.</p><p>But at the same time, for decades, we have had administrations talk about  the intellectual theft.  It's nothing that is just an accusation. It's  something that's been documented and proven, when basically they force  American companies to partner with them.  They steal the intellectual  property.  And they will go set up competing companies inside China that's  owned by a communist government.</p><p>So the practices have been grossly unfair.  This administration's trying to  do something to make sure that American intellectual property is protected.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  Let's talk about where this goes, because many on Wall Street have  were rattled by that.  </p><p>They have memories that trade wars have started and they sort of can't  stop.  They just grow and grow.  You're clearly not worried about that.  </p><p>But I'm wondering what kind of advice the president is getting from foreign  leaders, other countries who all say, almost to a country, that be careful  what you start here, Mr. President, German finance minister, a number of  others?</p><p>Do you fear that it's going to get in the way of some of the other deals  you hope to make with some of these same foreign players, the Chinese  included, on other big items?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, my role, obviously, is working more with Capitol Hill.</p><p>And I can tell you there's a lot more bipartisan support for these actions  on China.  I think members in Congress have been anxious to see this for  quite some time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't know.  I don't know, Marc.</p><p>Kevin Brady., the House Ways and Means chief, does worry about this wiping  out the benefit of those tax cuts that you guys worked very hard to get.   Are you worried?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, actually, in some of our meetings here in the White House,  Kevin Brady has reiterated his support for going after China and believing  that they are stealing our intellectual property.</p><p>So as we focus on the 301 measure, I think there actually is broad  bipartisan support for it.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, so, ultimately now with the markets -- and you're quite  right to say, I mean, the trend has definitely over the course of the this  president's tenure in the White House been very, very productive.  </p><p>But, you know, like you say, people look for a correction, they look for a  reason to move back.  And there's this fear that all of a sudden spending  is out of control again, and we're looking at likely a trillion-dollar  deficit now, and that the timing couldn't be worse for the midterm  elections and all of that.  What do you say to that?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, again, I think it's a one-day reaction in the markets.</p><p>I would look at the long term trend.  I would certainly expect as we  continue to roll back the regulatory front, we continue to make sure that  this administration is working with business across America, including in  this case trying to protect their intellectual property, I think the  markets will respond affirmatively.</p><p>And as I said, just yesterday, you saw testimony from the new Fed chairman  saying that the unemployment rate is actually expected to continue to drop  and growth now at high -- elevating their forecast as to how high we're  going to go.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  And the irony of that is that good news was greeted as a concern,  because the better things look, the more likely he will keep raising  interest rates more than was originally thought to be the case.   </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, I think that we have had such historically low interest rates  that, in many cases, the growth that we saw during the Obama years, when  for eight years GDP only grew at 1.8 percent, in many cases, that was  artificially low by a Fed keeping interest rates so low.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right about that.</p><p>SHORT:  The reality is that -- the reality is, yes, Neil, you're right,  there is -- as you grow, that -- that higher interest rates could begin to  slow that growth.  That is certainly a concern.</p><p>But we have had so historically low, artificially low rates, that actually  you're seeing a response to growth.  And in some cases, you're seeing a  response to wage inflation, which is something Americans have been dying  for, for many years.</p><p>So a lot of this is actually, as you say, a reaction to very positive news.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  This might not be your area exactly, Marc, but if you will indulge  me.  </p><p>John Dowd stepping down as the president's lead attorney, did he quit or  was he pushed?  </p><p>SHORT:  You know, Neil, I apologize, but that's just not an area that I'm  working in, and I'm not familiar with the inside conversations on that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Were you surprised?  </p><p>SHORT:  Neil, I don't know what extent there is surprise.  </p><p>I think, that as we have expressed many times, there's a growing  frustration of the length and duration of the special counsel investigation  into collusion with Russia, when there's been no evidence of whatsoever of  collusion with Russia.  </p><p>And I think that taxpayers have spent millions and millions of dollars on  this so far.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right.  There's a great deal of attention to this entire  case and where this whole case will go.</p><p>And the president now has mentioned Bob Mueller's name when he talks about  this.  A lot of Republicans are saying, go slow there, be careful about  that there.  </p><p>Was there concern building among some of the people you talk to, because  you work legislatively with the other side of Capitol Hill, that the  president is going too far?  </p><p>SHORT:  No, I don't think so, Neil.  </p><p>I think that the administration has had many conversations with members on  the Hill on this topic.  And I think that, typically, what we're hearing is  an affirmation from many Republicans that there's no been evidence in their  investigations of collusion with Russia.  And I think that there's, I  think, a growing frustration in the American people that this continues to  drag on.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You have been very patient.</p><p>SHORT:  Yes, sure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I want to get sort of a big picture view of the White House of  what comes next.  </p><p>In order to look at these tariffs that have been slapped on the Chinese,  and no response as of yet, let's assume they make a decision over the  weekend to target either an industry or Boeing, for example, Boeing plane  orders.  </p><p>Is there a plan for a follow-up response to that response?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, Neil, I'm not going to put out a hypothetical response as to  how the administration will respond.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Feel free.   Feel free.  Go ahead. </p><p>SHORT:  No, no, no, no, no.  </p><p>No, but, again, I think I come back to making the case that this  administration is going to continue to make sure that the American worker  is protected.  And that was a priority the president laid out in the  campaign.  This is something he talked about for quite some time.  </p><p>It actually, I think, as I said, has bipartisan support.  And I don't think  there should be surprise over it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, now, very quickly back to this measure, this $1.3  trillion spending measure.  </p><p>SHORT:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It's your hunch that this is ultimately passed and we avoid a  government shutdown?  </p><p>SHORT:  Yes, it is, Neil.  </p><p>I think that, again, the process in Washington has been broken for quite  some time.  They have not completed a normal appropriations process in 22  years.</p><p>For your viewers, we submit a budget in February that Congress is supposed  to complete by September 30.  We're now in mid to late March without having  that process completed, which is why you have these large omnibus bills.</p><p>I can't sit here and tell you and your viewers that we love everything in  the bill.  It's the nature of a compromise.  But we think that we got many  of our priorities funded, particularly funding our military and making sure  that we're getting resources to begin the down payment in building the wall  the president's promised.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, you're the legislative affairs director.  </p><p>I'm sure you're aware of the Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of  Republicans, not a fan of this latest spending plan, saying that it's not  consistent with what we told the American people.  We have let them down.   You have heard variations of that argument from some of their members.  </p><p>How do you keep them happy?  And are you worried that right now they're  not?  </p><p>SHORT:  Well, the Freedom Caucus has been some of our greatest partners in  our legislative accomplishments to date.  </p><p>They partnered with us on the tax relief legislation.  They have partnered  with us significantly in rolling back the regulatory burden that the Obama  administration had on this economy.  So, we maintain, I believe, very  strong relationships with the Freedom Caucus.  </p><p>I understand their perspective.  Again, from a White House perspective,  what we say back to Congress is, put your own house in order and put the  process in place that you can get us appropriations bills on time.  </p><p>Otherwise, we won't have to deal with a large omnibus.  But in light of  Congress not doing its job, we have -- we're put in a position of, do you  want another shutdown, or are we going to give Secretary Mattis the  resources he needs to make sure America is safe, make sure that DHS has the  resources it needs to begin protecting our border?</p><p>It has a 10 percent increase in funding for ICE, about a 12 overall  increase in DHS funding.  And it also provides some of the priorities the  president said after the tragedies with the school shootings and providing  for the Stop School Violence Act, as well as opioid dollars we have asked  for, as well as beginning a down payment on the infrastructure plan.  </p><p>So there's a lot of things in this bill that we had asked for and we're  pretty excited about.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Marc Short, thank you very much for taking the time.  </p><p>Marc is the White House legislative affairs director.  We threw a lot at  him in this interview.</p><p>Thank you, Marc, again.  </p><p>All right, for those of you just tuning in, and you want to know what the  heck happened today, this was it.  And this shows the bumpy ride we had  through the course of the day.  This is, of course, the time we got  indicated that the probe, the Russian probe is going to have a top lawyer  at the White House out.  </p><p>Then you had the tariff news, and you had the spending news, a measure that  did pass, which world be greeted favorably normally, but the fact that it  will be dicey in the Senate or the fact that it's just going to add to our  debt, which is already substantial, combined as a sort of 1-2-3 hit for the  markets here, and something that picked up steam by day's end.  </p><p>And Marc is quite right to point out that, even with today's hit, we're  only in correction territory now, in other words, back 10 percent from our  highs.  The Nasdaq actually is not in correction territory, even though the  Nasdaq 100, some of those hot, fast stocks like Facebook and others that  have problems of their own, that's down 5.6 percent from its highs here.</p><p>But a lot of this had to do with the simple fact of an excuse to sell or  reason to sell or impetus to sell or Washington out of control, whatever  you want to say.  Facebook, again, its own little separate soap opera that  we are going to get into it.</p><p>But I will tell you this.  A lot of money was going into bonds.  A lot of  money was going into something called the 10-year note.  And a lot of  people use that.  And this can sound kind of gobbledygook boring, but a 10- year note fell seven basis points today.  </p><p>That's a sign that money was going into bonds today, a relative safe haven,  because they're backed by Uncle Sam.  And that drove the yield down a  little bit to 2.83 from 2.90 percent.  </p><p>Now, you say, Neil, why do you mention that?  Because money was trying to  find a home.  At least a lot of stock traders will tell you a temporary  home, because they want them back in the stock market.  </p><p>So, as crazy as this incredible day was, it's worth pointing out that the  markets are up still appreciably.  The only question is, let's just see  what the Senate does with that spending plan.  Let's just see what the  Chinese do with that tariff plan.  And let's just see what other lawyers  are moving around on Pennsylvania Avenue.  </p><p>That, my friends, is the making of a Washington drama.  It was playing out  in real time.  </p><p>More after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Mr. President, would you still like to testify to special  counsel Robert Mueller, sir?  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUESTION:  You would?</p><p>TRUMP:  I would like to.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  It makes it easier if someone is walking by that you can see  letters of what they're saying.</p><p>But that was the president saying that he would be open to talking about  Bob Mueller, of course, doing this Russian investigation.</p><p>Now, keep in mind John Dowd, the president's top attorney, stepping down  lot today. He was among those -- actually the only one, as far as I know,  urging the president not to sit down with Bob Mueller.  Others within the  White House, the legal team, both from the White House and the president's  himself, have been trying to come up with a way, a middle ground, either  written questions of responses, targeted area that will talk about.</p><p>Our own Judge Andrew Napolitano says, that would be a very big mistake,  that it sets the stage for something that the president will not like.</p><p>Attorney Lisa Giovinazzo says she agrees with that, that a sit-down there,  whatever your views of the subject, for the president at least, could be a  problem.</p><p>Why is that, Lisa?</p><p>LISA GIOVINAZZO, ATTORNEY:  Look, no defense attorney want their clients to  sit down in here an Q&amp;A with authorities.</p><p>Immediately, you're at the risk of perjury.  Miranda rights, right,  anything that you can say can and will be used against you, this all  ensues.</p><p>And there's no reason for him to do it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, is the fear that he says something that goes beyond what he  intended to or that he would veers into an area that he had no idea would  be discussed?</p><p>If his lawyers are presently looking at a structured area where he could or  would either via written responses or others talk about stuff, just as long  as he's aware of the stuff they're going to talk about.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO:  Well, I mean, the written responses, right, they would go  along the lines of interrogatories.  That's kind of the first step.</p><p>And they're always profitable, because you can look at them.  The lawyers  can help him draft the proper responses.  They're very focused, whereas you  put anybody in a room, especially President Trump, and every word now will  be taken literally.  And that could be a very dangerous scenario.</p><p>We also have a president and an investigation that has a pretty wide net.   If you remember back in the Clinton days, he did sit down with the  prosecutors.</p><p>CAVUTO:  He did.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO:  And it didn't work out very well for him, but it was also a  very focused investigation.  This not so much.</p><p>There a lot of different areas that the president could delve into.  Now,  the one positive, he would be able to have counsel in the room.</p><p>In the event that he doesn't have a sit-down, there is always the risk that  they could choose to subpoena him.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where you think this is going, Lisa? </p><p>GIOVINAZZO:  The fact that he recently fired Dowd, the fact that he goes  through a lot of lawyers at the time, I don't think that he is all that  concerned with the criminal nature of this investigation.</p><p>I think it's much more political.  I think that it's gotten a lot of legs  because it keeps coming up with a lot of changes, a lot of legalese we're  hearing about.</p><p>But in the nature of this case, it's a long way out.  Even if they were to  subpoena him, that could be months in a court system.  They have never  subpoenaed a sitting president and actually enforced it against him</p><p>I mean, they're -- the scales of justice, they work, but they turn very  slowly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they're maddening for the president.  </p><p>I can understand that.  I mean, obviously, this investigation seems to have  gone afield from what it was originally.  Now they're looking at business  transactions that date to the Trump organization and years before even he  was running for president, if we're to believe these reports.</p><p>So, it wouldn't be the first investigation that has gone from its original  intent.  I'm thinking of Whitewater with Ken Starr.  That was about land  deals and the like. And it ended up with an intern in a blue dress.</p><p>So, where is this going?</p><p>GIOVINAZZO:  Well, I think you hit the nail on the head.</p><p>I think it's going into deeper and deeper areas of the president's personal  business, because they're not getting what they want to come up with an  indictment, to find criminal charges on the surface, which is why this  whole -- this whole issue about Q&amp;A with the president is coming up.</p><p>They don't seem to have enough to move forward.  And that's why you're  hearing from other people in the party.  You're hearing from his lawyers to  say, you know, move with it or drop the investigation.</p><p>And, honestly, he does have a right to that. People have a right to a  speedy trial.  Now, bear in mind, it's just an investigation.  Nobody --  nobody is pointing a finger at the president.  So he's kind of stuck in  this gray area that it could really drag out for a very long time.</p><p>And I think that all of us would agree that we're starting to see a lot of  political movement in this investigation, and the fact that it doesn't seem  to ever come to an end.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, just accelerates, like a soap opera as well.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Lisa, thank you very, very much.  Good seeing you.  </p><p>GIOVINAZZO:  You too, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the read from one of the most powerful Republicans in  the United States Senate, John Thune, on what's going on here and what is  going on with that spending measure.</p><p>Remember, it has to get passed in the Senate and have to do so in a little  bit more than, what, 30 hours or so, or we're looking at a government  shutdown.  Are we?  John Thune after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, a big hit in the Dow today.</p><p>In case you're counting, all 30 Dow stocks are down, and all 11 sectors of  the S&amp;P 500, they were down as well.  Try 1,000 points on the Dow just this  week.  We have another day to go.</p><p>After this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we just want to pass along some news regarding the  Trump administration approving $1 billion worth of arms sold to the Saudi  Arabians.  </p><p>Remember, the crown prince is visiting this country for the next couple of  weeks.  He had stopped by at the White House to visit the president just a  couple of days ago.  That order will include more than 6,500 missiles.  </p><p>He expressed concern -- that is, the crown prince, as well as the president  -- about Iran and that nuclear agreement that seems to be fraying and  falling apart.</p><p>We should let you know right now that the Saudis have made clear that if  the Iranians get their hands on a nuclear weapon, he wants to go nuclear  himself.</p><p>The read on all of this and all the other news happening today from South  Dakota Republicans Senator, prominent top Republican, John Thune.  </p><p>Senator, good to have you.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  Nice to be with you.  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What do you make?  I mean, this is still early.</p><p>One billion, I guess for the Saudis and us, is chump change these days, but  it's a pretty big missile deal.  And we seem to be very tight with both the  Saudis, helping them, and them helping us.  What do you make of this  arrangement?  </p><p>THUNE:  Well, I think they have been an ally for a long time on a lot  levels.</p><p>And, obviously, right now, they help check in that region of the world the  influence of Iran.  And I think it's important for us to continue to  maintain that relationship and to work together with them as partners to  try and bring stability to that region of the world.</p><p>They are leading the force against -- in Yemen.  They're helping the  government there against the Houthis, which are backed by the Iranians.   And so there are lots of ways in which our countries are able to cooperate.   And I think we continue -- need to continue that if we're going to keep  some sort of a stability in that region, which is so important to the  stability of the entire world.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know of the markets, as you're aware, Senator.  Of course,  you're not as much as a nerd as me and live and die by this stuff, so  touche to you.</p><p>But there's a fear expressed by some traders of all political persuasions  that what goes but is coming down.  It's coming down again.  Washington  spending is out of control.  You guys can't seem to agree on this.  Maybe  you do the measure on the spending plan to avoid a government shutdown, but  that the debt is building, a lot of excesses are building, and there's a  world of hurt coming, including now a potential trade war with the Chinese.  </p><p>Are you concerned?  </p><p>THUNE:  I am.</p><p>I think there are a lot of things that we need to be concerned about.  We  have got to get spending under control.  We have got to deal with this debt  and this deficit, which, of course, I think means we have got to reform our  budget process.</p><p>But we have to play the long game.  The market has its day-to-day ups and  downs and gyrations, but I think as long as we focus on policies that are  creating conditions that are favorable to economic growth, and we're seeing  that -- you saw the unemployment rate is now down to its lowest level in 17  years.</p><p>The number of people reentering the labor force in the month of February  was at the highest in 38 years, over 800,000 people coming back in.  Wages  are up.  And we're starting to see good growth in the economy.</p><p>And a lot of that, Neil, is because of policies that this president, this  Congress have put in place, tax reform, regulatory reform, certainty when  it comes to the legal process through the appointment of good judges to the  courts.</p><p>Those are all things that I think are shaping the economy right now in a  way that provides hope and optimism for the future, which is why consumer  confidence is up.</p><p>That said, we have to -- we have got to get fiscal discipline back in place  here in Washington.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it's nowhere near -- it's nowhere near in place, right?</p><p>The House Freedom Caucus, they just threw up their arms and said, oh, no  one seems to care about it.  Republicans run the show.  They have the  House, the Senate, the White House, and yet this debt is growing faster  than me circling a Ponderosa buffet.  </p><p>No?</p><p>THUNE:  Well, it's two things.</p><p>We have got to reform entitlement programs, which the Democrats have had no  appetite for.  We tried to do that with the Obamacare replace and repeal  last summer.  We put in place for the first time real entitlement reforms  in the Medicaid program.</p><p>Obviously, that failed by a vote.  We need more Republicans, more  conservatives in Congress to get the entitlement programs reined in.   That's the spending side.</p><p>But on the other side, as I mentioned earlier, you got to have growth in  the economy.  And that's why these policies that are pro-growth and pro- jobs are really important.  And so it's a -- it's a combination of both.</p><p>It's fiscal restraint, but it's also pro-growth policies.  And I think we  can get this back on the right track.  But it does start fundamentally, in  my view, with reforming our budget process.  And that's something that I  and many others around here have been advocating for a long time.</p><p>And I hope that, again, another omnibus spending bill like this will renew  the emphasis on serious, meaningful budget reform here in Washington.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  Are you worried about a trade war?</p><p>THUNE:  Well, I am worried about what I see happening out there.  I do  think that that could undermine a lot of the good things that we're seeing  in the economy.</p><p>And the market obviously is reacting to it.  But I think, again, we want to  make sure that when we -- these trade policies -- and I understand the  president's desire to clamp down on China and to deal with them in a way  that helps them understand that we are serious and that they're going to  have to get serious when it comes to stealing our intellectual property,  but that we do that in a way that doesn't create disruption in the market.</p><p>And, obviously, we're worried about retaliatory actions taken particularly  directed at agriculture that could be very detrimental and harmful to the  middle of the country, but to the whole country.</p><p>And so this is one of those things, they need to proceed slowly with care,  very targeted, very selective in how they go about this.  I think these  indiscriminate, wide tariff policies could be incredibly harmful if they  lead to an escalation of a trade war.</p><p>That's not going to be good for the economy in the long term.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  You think the president made a mistake?</p><p>THUNE:  I disagree with him on this issue.</p><p>I know he feels passionately about it.  I have heard him speak about it.  I  do think that he wants to see reciprocal trade.  We agree with that.  But,  again, I think how you go about that, the policies you implement, who you  direct those at, thinking about the consequences and the unintended  consequences and how those retaliatory actions might occur, what they might  hit, being prepared for that is going to be really important.</p><p>And so I hope, as they move forward, they do it in a very thoughtful way,  and in a way that would limit the ancillary, harmful and adverse impacts  that could occur to the economy.</p><p>I appreciate the fact they have scaled back some of these actions already.   But I guess I would encourage them not to get us in the middle of a trade  war.  I don't think that is in anybody's best interests.  And I think it  could undo a lot of the good progress that we have seen in terms of  economic growth as a result, in many respects, because of the president's  policies and working with the Congress.   </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Senator John Thune, very good having you.  Thank you.  </p><p>THUNE:  Thanks, Neil.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>And speaking of the Senate, that measure, that budget measures could come  up tonight, could come up tomorrow.  But it's got to get done before 12:01  a.m. on Saturday, or we do have another shutdown.</p><p>We shall see.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, you're familiar with what's going on at Facebook right  now, and how that stock has just been getting pummeled over the last few  days over the release of information that showed 50 million folks had their  data compromised.</p><p>Well, the stock has swooned, lost about $40 billion in market value, about  $8 billion of that, well, for Mark Zuckerberg.  That is how much poorer he  is this week, $8 billion poorer.  A rounding error on his worth, but I  thought I would pass that along.</p><p>All right, first, it was Los Alamitos, remember that, proposing to opt out  of California's new sanctuary law.  Now many other government officials  there, elsewhere saying, you know what?  We want a sanctuary from this  sanctuary thing, because it's killing us.</p><p>Orange County Supervisor Michael Steel, who proposed just last night to  take on the issue at her next meeting.</p><p>Michelle Steel.</p><p>I apologize, Michelle.</p><p>CAVUTO:  What kind of reaction are you getting?</p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  I got a lot of support, because  people are sending me a lot of e-mails.  And they strongly support, because  they know that California law, that Senate Bill 54 is illegal.</p><p>So I get a lot of support and a lot of phone calls.  And I really  appreciate that.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Your argument is what, that this hurts you.  Explain why you're  doing this.  </p><p>STEEL:  Well, the government's first duty, I believe that that is protect  its citizens.</p><p>And it's like, when you release all these illegal aliens, especially  criminals, we are talking about -- we are not talking about law-abiding  illegal aliens -- we are talking about criminals on the streets -- it's  very dangerous.</p><p>And public safety is very, very important in Orange County. And it's going  to hurt.  And it's going to hurt our residents in Orange County, and not  just Orange County, but for California.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think California is hurting itself, hurting its reputation  by doing this, the mayor of Oakland, the governor who support these type of  measures?</p><p>STEEL:  Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>Mayor of Oakland tells everybody that this is racist.  That has nothing to  do with it.  We don't want any criminals walking on the street.  </p><p>You cannot really put it some different way, but we just want to stop these  criminals walking on our streets.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You always get that rap, right?  I mean, and I have talked to  others who are trying to do the same thing as you are, Michelle.</p><p>And the first thing they have to deal with is, oh, you're racist, or you're  against poor people trying to do the right thing in the United States.  And  they morph into saying you're against immigration, of course, when you're  against illegal immigration.  </p><p>But you know the drill.  Have you gotten any of that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>STEEL:  I know the drill.  And I know the process.  I'm a first-generation  immigrant.  </p><p>And Orange County is number third, the largest county in the state.  And we  have a lot of large immigrant communities in our county.  So we totally  understand.  </p><p>And we are supporting that what we are doing, because left-wing California  state legislators, and they're the ones created this chaos.  And we have to  stop that.  So what we are doing is, Jeff Sessions sued California.  </p><p>And I don't want this going to be inside of the court forever.  And we want  to expedite the ruling against this bad law.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Now, it should be stressed that you're in a  conservative community.  Most of the communities in California seem to be  slightly to the left of you.  </p><p>So, it's not really going to change the policy in the state, or do you  suspect it might?  </p><p>STEEL:  No, I want all the 58 counties in California joined us.  </p><p>And there's a couple of cities already joined us.  And Newport Beach, city  of Newport Beach, you heard, and Buena Park is, and then Aliso Viejo in  Orange County, they all start this.  </p><p>So, all these cities and counties joining us opt out against this bad law,  then I think it's going to happen.  It's not just like all the leftists and  the other counties, but they all want to be in the safe environment.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Michelle Steel, thank you very much for taking the  time, Orange County, California, supervisor.  </p><p>And, again, she's an example of some in the state there saying, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, we need a sanctuary from the sanctuary thing.  It's fascinating  and it's building.  </p><p>We do want to alert you as well.  We told you about these roughly $55  billion to $66 billion worth of trade tariffs that administration slapped  on the Chinese.  Well, they are responding, as we thought they would, that  China is strongly disappointed and firmly opposes the president's move,  strongly disappointed that he's doing this, that plans for Chinese imports  are a bad idea.  </p><p>Going on to say, he doesn't want a trade war with the United States, but  will not recoil from one.  This is again coming from the Chinese Embassy in  Washington.  China would fight to the end with all necessary measures in a  trade war initiated by the U.S.</p><p>Now, again, the prevailing wisdom is that they go for something that will  hit back at the president, some of these agricultural targets that might  hurt the presidents in states that he won and hurt Republicans in states  that they have generally done well in the last election in the midterm.</p><p>There's no way of quantifying that.  There is also a suspicion that Boeing  might be a target.  It was among the worst performers in the Dow 30 today,  on the belief that the Chinese might say, we're not going to order planes  from you.  We will go to Airbus.</p><p>There's no way of knowing, but that the Chinese have responded, as we  thought they would, and that they're saying they're not guilty of any of  this and that China doesn't, doesn't do any of the horrible things they  have been accused of doing from this administration.</p><p>By the way, this administration is not the first one to say that the  Chinese cheat.  It's the first administration to act on it.</p><p>We will have more after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Remember that guy?  Well, he's live right now.  You're looking  live at Steve Bannon.  </p><p>He's speaking at The Financial Times conference going in New York City.   The man accused of a whole lot of leaks has been out of the White House,  but those leaks keeps coming.</p><p>So the White House wants to start trying to get handle on this.  How does  this keep happening?  Steve is gone, but they're still happening.</p><p>What the heck is going on?</p><p>Let's ask former Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush Brad  Blakeman.</p><p>They do have a problem here.  Marco Rubio articulated it very well, Brad,  to say, look, if you don't want to be in the administration, you don't like  the president, or you don't like just being there, get the hell out.  But  it still happens.</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER:  Well, what is going on is, we  have people within the White House that are trying to deep-six the  president on his policies.</p><p>If they don't like it, what do they do?  They leak it and try and either  sink the policy or adversely affect it.  But there's a way to stop it,  Neil.  </p><p>And it's pretty simple.  Every bit of paper the president gets, there is a  flow chain, a check-off of who has this information.  I think the president  needs to get serious.  Get the FBI in.  Do interviews, polygraphs if  necessary, and find out who these people are, and deal with them harshly,  because it will send a tremendous message throughout the White House that  leaking is inappropriate.</p><p>Get fired.  Get prosecuted, if necessary.  That's the way to get a handle  on leaking.</p><p>CAVUTO:  These are relatively small and apparently increasingly smaller  groups of people.  So at least you could remember, I was at a meeting with  six other people.  I know I wasn't the guy doing the leaking, so maybe the  other five did.</p><p>It's like a bad version of the game \"Clue.\"  But, I mean, what do you do?   I mean, how do you get a handle on it?  Because this is not the  administration that has had this sort of problem, but it seems to me here  to be out of control.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  But you have to make examples of people.</p><p>And, sometimes, administrations don't want to know who the leaker is,  because they're afraid of who it might be.  Now you need to send a message,  not only to the White House, but to the bureaucracies, that leaking is not  going to be tolerated.</p><p>And, again, whether it's a telephone call, there's a checklist of people  who are on that call it, you do check the box.  Is it this person?  Is it  that person?  Is it this person?</p><p>The other problem, Neil, is, I may be privy to information, and then I give  it to somebody else within the administration, who then leaks it.  But then  you have a paper trail, you have a telephone trail.  This is something that  can be done forensically.  And the FBI does this all the time.  It probably  should be done now,.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The one thing is really weird about it is that -- and this dates  back to remember when the president just got in office and a call that he  had, it was a nasty exchange with the Australian prime minister?  And  suddenly -- very few people were aware of that, maybe, say, people at the  State Department.  Maybe it was someone at the State Department.</p><p>And it was all over, their argument, that they said it.</p><p>And back to Marco Rubio's point.  If for some reason this is all about  embarrassing the president or you don't like the president, then stop  working for the president.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  There's no doubt about it.</p><p>But it may not be people directly in the White House.  It could be somebody  in the bureaucracy who is not necessarily politically appointed by the  president, a career person.  And you can find out that as well.</p><p>But no leaking should be tolerated, whether it's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, see, what you said there is interesting, because someone then  would be tapping the president, tapping the president's phone.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Well, not really.</p><p>You would be surprised, Neil, on, let's say, a call with Putin.  Typically,  there's probably about 10 people on that call.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  There are translators.  There are notetakers.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, that's true.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  But, again, you know from the call sheet who exactly is privy at  firsthand information to that call.</p><p>The FBI needs to go out and polygraph these people.  And you're going to  find the leaker pretty quick.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do they still rely on these polygraphs?  </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Absolutely.  And they're done randomly, as well as drug testing.   You don't know when it's coming.  And that's the way it should be, because  then you can't prepare for it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what I do?  I look at everybody's eyes, like -- you ever  do that?  And if they're shifting, I just say, you -- I don't know.</p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Then everybody in Washington would be locked up.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, you know, actually, it was a dumb point I just made there.   Thank you for bringing that up.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Brad, thank you very, very much, Brad Blakeman, former deputy  assistant to President George Bush -- W. Bush.  </p><p>BLAKEMAN:  Pleasure.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, in the meantime, we have got some new developments  involving some intelligence leaks and the former director of national  intelligence, James Clapper.  Remember him?  </p><p>Catherine Herridge in Washington with the latest on that.  </p><p>Hey, Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you, Neil.</p><p>Earlier today, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee posted more  extensive findings from their investigation, because now the 150-page  report goes to the intelligence community for declassification.</p><p>I have some of those findings right here.  And one in particular is  noteworthy under a section about national security leaks and the allegation  -- it says -- I'm reading from it -- the former director of national  intelligence, James Clapper, this is the person who runs the intelligence  community and is charged with protecting classified information.</p><p>Republicans found that he provided -- quote -- \"inconsistent testimony\"  about his contacts with the media, including CNN.</p><p>That's important, because, of course, now he works as an analyst for CNN.   And based on our reporting, we believe the incident at issue here is that  January 2017 Trump Tower briefing, where the incoming president was told  for the first time about this unverified dossier.</p><p>And it was the leaking of that briefing which really took the dossier story  into the mainstream, which is something that hadn't happened in the fall of  2016, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what is kind of interesting, Catherine?</p><p>If you think of Clapper and you think of Brennan, and you think of all of  these former higher-ups at all these various intelligence agencies, we now  know how they feel about the president, Brennan, over-the-top criticism of  the president.</p><p>And the president have always argued, these guys are biased against me.  It  turns out, if their sentiment is pretty consistent, he was right</p><p>So what are we to make of their prevailing view, which tends to be very  dismissive of President Trump, and whether that in one way, shape or form  at any of these intelligence agencies of which he was quite critical is  coming back to bite him?</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Well, a couple of points there.</p><p>In the past, I have tried to reach DNI Clapper for comment on other FOX  reporting, but he has declined, citing his new position with CNN.  So we  will try again, because that's the right thing.</p><p>But in the past, he's not provided comment.</p><p>The other thing I would say, that in the 15 years that I have been covering  the intelligence community here in Washington, I have never seen a period  where previous leadership has been so public and outspoken and really very  political about their views of a current administration.</p><p>So that is certainly a new and very different development, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And petty, right, very, very petty.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Well, you have to look into their eyes, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HERRIDGE:  I almost feel nervous about this segment now, what my eyes are  telling you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm watching you.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  I know.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I am watching you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Catherine, thank you very, very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is so weird, Catherine Herridge.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, if you think about it, folks, the president has been saying,  right, look, these guys have it out for me.</p><p>And, sometimes, like my dad used to say, it's a good thing to be paranoid,  because you really should be seeing who is right over your shoulder,  because there are a lot of cases again and again where they're telling  exactly how they feel about the president now, in a former -- former top  official role.</p><p>Well, what was the deal when they were those top officials at all these  various security agencies and they harbored those views?  The only  difference is, they're not in power to do that.  Of course, some of them  pop up on other news networks just to rip him a new one, but that's a whole  'nother drama.</p><p>In the meantime, there's where we stand going into tomorrow.  A lot of  concerns about how this sorts out.  Friday, anything could happen.  You  know what's going to happen in Asia and Europe.  We will see.</p><p>\"The Five\" now.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: Yikes, the Dow, the lawyer, and, oh, yes, the trade war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FOX on top of more than just stocks going down. And, boy, oh, boy, did they ever go down. The Dow careening more than 723 points on a trifecta of troubles that all came together today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up, the president's lead attorney out, John Dowd quitting, the same John Dowd who was strongly advising that the president not sit down with Bob Mueller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second up, tariffs. Try more than $50 billion worth of them going down, China the target. And let's just say today China not happy.</p><p>And third up, a $1.3 trillion spending plan that passes in the House, but is anyone's guess in the Senate. If it fails, guess what? The government shut down, which, as I said, all combined have sent stocks down. Every single Dow component in the red today. The Dow surrendering more than 722 points for the day, down about 3 percent, the Nasdaq almost 2.5 percent, the S&amp;P 500 2.5 percent.</p><p>More on what produced those numbers.</p><p>First to the White House on how they're responding to them.</p><p>That's where you will find our John Roberts -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, clearly, Neil, as the Dow has continued to go down since the president made his announcement that he sending his U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, to the drawing board to come up with some tariffs against China and then further to that take some measures to restrict investment by China in U.S. technological companies, they have watched the Dow tick down and tick down.</p><p>And now we're back -- we're down over 700 points. And the president, of course, all through the campaign and the first part of his presidency was touting at how the Dow was at record numbers. Now it looks like it's on a little bit of shaky ground.</p><p>But let's not also forget that when the president was doing the run-up to tariffs on steel and aluminum, the Dow was all over the place and it managed to recover quite well. So the president and the White House clearly hoping that this is only a temporary setback as well and that when they see the effect of the tariffs might be, if and when tariffs are actually imposed, the Dow may decide that it's not as flipped out as it appears to be today.</p><p>Let's not forget that the tariffs on steel and aluminum have not been imposed yet. Now to a couple of the other things. A $1.3 trillion budget clearly is something that the stock market doesn't like, because that means that the deficit will be even bigger than it was, adding to the debt.</p><p>And that's always a drag on the stock markets as well. And then there's the report that came out this morning about the president's lead outside attorney, John Dowd, is leaving the legal team. One of the reasons for that is that it appears as though there was a conflict between members of the outside and the inside legal team, each other and with the president, over what the future strategy should be.</p><p>The president appeared to be not listening to the advice of John Dowd, who was urging cooperation with Mueller, but at the same time suggesting that the president shouldn't sit down for an interview with Mueller, or if he did, that the parameters of that be very narrow.</p><p>We saw Joe diGenova, the famous former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a man that believes that there was a conspiracy at the top of the FBI to frame President Trump for a false crime, being named to the legal team. They also reached out to Ted Olson, John Flood, a number of other people they're also reaching out to try to try to bolster that team.</p><p>So, just seemed that John Dowd wasn't fitting in with the team as it was organizing to go forward in what they believe will be a crucial aspect of the Mueller investigation.</p><p>But the president when asked this afternoon in the Diplomatic Room after announcing the trade action on China, saying that he would like to sit down for an interview with Mueller. Another indication that that may be not in not-too-distant future -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Buddy, thank you very, very much, John Roberts.</p><p>All right, before I go to my guests here, I do want to show you happened at the corner of Wall and Broad and a sell-off that picked up steam. Again, as I said, all Dow 30 components were down and appreciably so. This is now putting the Dow into correction territory yet again.</p><p>And we had some technology stocks that were falling off beyond that. Boeing, for example, was one of the worst performers in the Dow, falling better than 5 percent. Remember, a lot of people seem to think that Boeing more to that point is going to be a target of the Chinese as a sort of a tit for tat on all of the beefed-up tariffs that the administration is looking to slap on the Chinese. That's the next stage of this.</p><p>We're also looking at that $1.3 trillion spending measure which worried Wall Street even though it passed the House because it's just chockful of all these goodies and the spending that seems to know no bounds.</p><p>We're going to be going to Peter Doocy on Capitol Hill with that and a read on that, but first of John Layfield on the market responding to all these developments, sort of lick a trifecta of trying news, huh?</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It is.</p><p>We knew this day of reckoning was coming, that the easy money was going to end, that rates were going to start going up. But I think what has exacerbated it obviously was inflation worries that are coming up, but more importantly the tariffs and the retaliatory trade that could come from these tariffs.</p><p>Add to that what's going on with the big tech companies and the regulatory framework that's most likely coming. I think you have this big storm that we have had it today.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means chief, John,, has talked about the fact that trade tariffs -- and the president might be right to be chagrined about this. He doesn't like the way some of these countries play ball, but that a trade war could wipe out all the benefits of the tax cuts.</p><p>Is that among some of the factors hitting stocks?</p><p>LAYFIELD: I don't think there's any doubt about.</p><p>It's hard to put tariffs on China because they have a global supply chain. Not everything is made in China. We learned that in 2009 with President Obama when we put the tire tariff on. It didn't work. All we did is get tires from different places. It didn't work. we didn't have any more production necessarily in the United States coming from that.</p><p>But, however, China can put tariffs on us directly. They can put it on our farm products. They can put it on our technology. That's much easier to do. A retaliatory measure from China hurts us more than it hurts them.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we're seeing a the bottom of the screen, for those looking at home here, a correction is when you're 10 percent from your highs. A bear market starts at 20 percent from those highs.</p><p>But one of the catalysts besides trade that might be influencing this is this touch and go thing with a spending measure to keep the government lights on for another six months or at least through the next fiscal year, at least through the end of this one.</p><p>And that's where we will find our Peter Doocy sort of dealing with this.</p><p>It's a $1.3 trillion measure, right, Peter? And it passes the House, but iffy in the Senate? What's the latest?</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The latest right now, Neil, is that there are big question marks not -- about certain senators who may not want a vote to proceed before the government shutdown deadline.</p><p>And, in fact, we came over here to Senator Rand Paul's office. We were talking to some staff. We understand that he is in here right now trying to read this 2,232-page bill, but right now he's only on page 140.</p><p>There's no updated guidance right now as to whether or not he is going to object to a vote that would let them pass this omnibus budget and avoid a government shutdown or he's going to try to block it. But he's not the only Republican senator who has problems with this.</p><p>Senator Bob Corker, Republican retiring from Tennessee, was on the Senate floor a little while ago. He said that this bill is one of the most grotesque pieces of legislation that he has ever seen.</p><p>And a big problem that these fiscally conservative Republican senators have is just that you spend a lot of new money and you don't make any new meaningful cuts elsewhere -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, the question, Peter, is what happens if the Senate can't get its act together on this? Time is a ticking, right? I mean, by 12:01 Saturday morning, bright and early, they don't have something together, the pumpkins explodes, right?</p><p>DOOCY: Right.</p><p>And then in the first three months of the midterm election year, you would have your third government shutdown. And that would come as a surprise to a lot of people on Capitol Hill, because even though the HouseFreedom Caucus, the conservative lawmakers over there, have been urging President Trump not to sign this measure, Republican leadership put enough stuff into this omnibus that they were able to get more than a hundred Democrats on board over there.</p><p>There's a lot of Democratic support in the Senate. In fact, Chuck Schumer had a press conference a little while ago where he said that they were happy with the deal that they got, which is not something that you hear from Republicans, except those who were very pleased with all the new Pentagon spending.</p><p>But if there is a shutdown, then you're just going to hear a lot more talk about dysfunction, about waiting until the last minute, but also about why Republicans, who were elected to come to Congress to rein in spending, haven't been doing that -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Guys, thank you all very, very much -- Peter Doocy.</p><p>White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short with us right now.</p><p>Marc, a confluence of weird events here, but the worry seems to be that there could be some hell to pay with this stuff. I know you don't obsess over the markets to the degree maybe your boss did when they were going and running up, but are you worried?</p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS: Well, Neil, I think, putting it in perspective, the markets were a little over 18000 on Election Day 2016. So, we have had about a 30 percent increase in the markets.</p><p>You have unemployment at a 17-year low. You have the Fed announcing just yesterday, when they raised rates, expectations of continued reduced unemployment and actually boosting their GDP forecast.</p><p>So the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. The president's policies on regulations and taxes continue to boost our economy. And now what the president is looking to do is to try to protect American workers and American companies whose intellectual property has been stolen by the Chinese.</p><p>CAVUTO: You had said and the president had echoed that you weren't fans necessarily of this $1.3 trillion spending plan, but it allows you to move forward. You get what you want on the military and some of these other priorities. Some of the Democrats get what they want. And it should pass.</p><p>What if it doesn't?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Neil, we fully expect the bill to pass. As far as to when I think is a guess, for tonight, tomorrow night.</p><p>But the reality is that Congress has provided us with six continuing resolutions since the fiscal year ended on September 30. What that means is that rather than actually doing their job and passing appropriations bill, we're stuck with legislation that General Mattis tells us puts them at a great handicap, because they're basically repairing old, worn-out equipment, as opposed to purchasing new equipment they need to continue to fight the war on terror.</p><p>So, from an administration perspective, you're right. There's a lot things in the bill we like. We like that is the first, the most significant pay increase for our men and women in uniform in 10 years. It's the biggest build-up in military resources since World War II that can help make sure that America safe.</p><p>It does provide a lot of the border security measures. It does provide legislation that we were asking for as far as protecting our schools and making them safer.</p><p>But the price tag is something that, if we had sufficient Republican votes, of course we wouldn't want as much non-defense spending is in this bill. But, ultimately, we have to make a decision as administrations, do you shut down the government, have another continuing resolution, or actually provide our troops the resources they need to make sure America is safe?</p><p>CAVUTO: This tariff thing, any response from the Chinese yet? They have promised that they're going to do something. They vowed all necessary measures. They deny that they force companies to hand over technology, some of the things that the president outlined.</p><p>But they are almost assuredly going to target U.S. companies or even industries or even the agriculture community, that they could go after our farmers. Are you worried that this gets out of control?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Neil, I don't think any of us wants a trade war. And we certainly want to protect the farmers in America. And I know that China looks at that and knows how much of the agricultural products they import.</p><p>But at the same time, for decades, we have had administrations talk about the intellectual theft. It's nothing that is just an accusation. It's something that's been documented and proven, when basically they force American companies to partner with them. They steal the intellectual property. And they will go set up competing companies inside China that's owned by a communist government.</p><p>So the practices have been grossly unfair. This administration's trying to do something to make sure that American intellectual property is protected.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let's talk about where this goes, because many on Wall Street have were rattled by that.</p><p>They have memories that trade wars have started and they sort of can't stop. They just grow and grow. You're clearly not worried about that.</p><p>But I'm wondering what kind of advice the president is getting from foreign leaders, other countries who all say, almost to a country, that be careful what you start here, Mr. President, German finance minister, a number of others?</p><p>Do you fear that it's going to get in the way of some of the other deals you hope to make with some of these same foreign players, the Chinese included, on other big items?</p><p>SHORT: Well, my role, obviously, is working more with Capitol Hill.</p><p>And I can tell you there's a lot more bipartisan support for these actions on China. I think members in Congress have been anxious to see this for quite some time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I don't know. I don't know, Marc.</p><p>Kevin Brady., the House Ways and Means chief, does worry about this wiping out the benefit of those tax cuts that you guys worked very hard to get. Are you worried?</p><p>SHORT: Well, actually, in some of our meetings here in the White House, Kevin Brady has reiterated his support for going after China and believing that they are stealing our intellectual property.</p><p>So as we focus on the 301 measure, I think there actually is broad bipartisan support for it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so, ultimately now with the markets -- and you're quite right to say, I mean, the trend has definitely over the course of the this president's tenure in the White House been very, very productive.</p><p>But, you know, like you say, people look for a correction, they look for a reason to move back. And there's this fear that all of a sudden spending is out of control again, and we're looking at likely a trillion-dollar deficit now, and that the timing couldn't be worse for the midterm elections and all of that. What do you say to that?</p><p>SHORT: Well, again, I think it's a one-day reaction in the markets.</p><p>I would look at the long term trend. I would certainly expect as we continue to roll back the regulatory front, we continue to make sure that this administration is working with business across America, including in this case trying to protect their intellectual property, I think the markets will respond affirmatively.</p><p>And as I said, just yesterday, you saw testimony from the new Fed chairman saying that the unemployment rate is actually expected to continue to drop and growth now at high -- elevating their forecast as to how high we're going to go.</p><p>CAVUTO: And the irony of that is that good news was greeted as a concern, because the better things look, the more likely he will keep raising interest rates more than was originally thought to be the case.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>SHORT: Well, I think that we have had such historically low interest rates that, in many cases, the growth that we saw during the Obama years, when for eight years GDP only grew at 1.8 percent, in many cases, that was artificially low by a Fed keeping interest rates so low.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right about that.</p><p>SHORT: The reality is that -- the reality is, yes, Neil, you're right, there is -- as you grow, that -- that higher interest rates could begin to slow that growth. That is certainly a concern.</p><p>But we have had so historically low, artificially low rates, that actually you're seeing a response to growth. And in some cases, you're seeing a response to wage inflation, which is something Americans have been dying for, for many years.</p><p>So a lot of this is actually, as you say, a reaction to very positive news.</p><p>CAVUTO: This might not be your area exactly, Marc, but if you will indulge me.</p><p>John Dowd stepping down as the president's lead attorney, did he quit or was he pushed?</p><p>SHORT: You know, Neil, I apologize, but that's just not an area that I'm working in, and I'm not familiar with the inside conversations on that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Were you surprised?</p><p>SHORT: Neil, I don't know what extent there is surprise.</p><p>I think, that as we have expressed many times, there's a growing frustration of the length and duration of the special counsel investigation into collusion with Russia, when there's been no evidence of whatsoever of collusion with Russia.</p><p>And I think that taxpayers have spent millions and millions of dollars on this so far.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right. There's a great deal of attention to this entire case and where this whole case will go.</p><p>And the president now has mentioned Bob Mueller's name when he talks about this. A lot of Republicans are saying, go slow there, be careful about that there.</p><p>Was there concern building among some of the people you talk to, because you work legislatively with the other side of Capitol Hill, that the president is going too far?</p><p>SHORT: No, I don't think so, Neil.</p><p>I think that the administration has had many conversations with members on the Hill on this topic. And I think that, typically, what we're hearing is an affirmation from many Republicans that there's no been evidence in their investigations of collusion with Russia. And I think that there's, I think, a growing frustration in the American people that this continues to drag on.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have been very patient.</p><p>SHORT: Yes, sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I want to get sort of a big picture view of the White House of what comes next.</p><p>In order to look at these tariffs that have been slapped on the Chinese, and no response as of yet, let's assume they make a decision over the weekend to target either an industry or Boeing, for example, Boeing plane orders.</p><p>Is there a plan for a follow-up response to that response?</p><p>SHORT: Well, Neil, I'm not going to put out a hypothetical response as to how the administration will respond.</p><p>CAVUTO: Feel free. Feel free. Go ahead.</p><p>SHORT: No, no, no, no, no.</p><p>No, but, again, I think I come back to making the case that this administration is going to continue to make sure that the American worker is protected. And that was a priority the president laid out in the campaign. This is something he talked about for quite some time.</p><p>It actually, I think, as I said, has bipartisan support. And I don't think there should be surprise over it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now, very quickly back to this measure, this $1.3 trillion spending measure.</p><p>SHORT: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's your hunch that this is ultimately passed and we avoid a government shutdown?</p><p>SHORT: Yes, it is, Neil.</p><p>I think that, again, the process in Washington has been broken for quite some time. They have not completed a normal appropriations process in 22 years.</p><p>For your viewers, we submit a budget in February that Congress is supposed to complete by September 30. We're now in mid to late March without having that process completed, which is why you have these large omnibus bills.</p><p>I can't sit here and tell you and your viewers that we love everything in the bill. It's the nature of a compromise. But we think that we got many of our priorities funded, particularly funding our military and making sure that we're getting resources to begin the down payment in building the wall the president's promised.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, you're the legislative affairs director.</p><p>I'm sure you're aware of the Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of Republicans, not a fan of this latest spending plan, saying that it's not consistent with what we told the American people. We have let them down. You have heard variations of that argument from some of their members.</p><p>How do you keep them happy? And are you worried that right now they're not?</p><p>SHORT: Well, the Freedom Caucus has been some of our greatest partners in our legislative accomplishments to date.</p><p>They partnered with us on the tax relief legislation. They have partnered with us significantly in rolling back the regulatory burden that the Obama administration had on this economy. So, we maintain, I believe, very strong relationships with the Freedom Caucus.</p><p>I understand their perspective. Again, from a White House perspective, what we say back to Congress is, put your own house in order and put the process in place that you can get us appropriations bills on time.</p><p>Otherwise, we won't have to deal with a large omnibus. But in light of Congress not doing its job, we have -- we're put in a position of, do you want another shutdown, or are we going to give Secretary Mattis the resources he needs to make sure America is safe, make sure that DHS has the resources it needs to begin protecting our border?</p><p>It has a 10 percent increase in funding for ICE, about a 12 overall increase in DHS funding. And it also provides some of the priorities the president said after the tragedies with the school shootings and providing for the Stop School Violence Act, as well as opioid dollars we have asked for, as well as beginning a down payment on the infrastructure plan.</p><p>So there's a lot of things in this bill that we had asked for and we're pretty excited about.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Marc Short, thank you very much for taking the time.</p><p>Marc is the White House legislative affairs director. We threw a lot at him in this interview.</p><p>Thank you, Marc, again.</p><p>All right, for those of you just tuning in, and you want to know what the heck happened today, this was it. And this shows the bumpy ride we had through the course of the day. This is, of course, the time we got indicated that the probe, the Russian probe is going to have a top lawyer at the White House out.</p><p>Then you had the tariff news, and you had the spending news, a measure that did pass, which world be greeted favorably normally, but the fact that it will be dicey in the Senate or the fact that it's just going to add to our debt, which is already substantial, combined as a sort of 1-2-3 hit for the markets here, and something that picked up steam by day's end.</p><p>And Marc is quite right to point out that, even with today's hit, we're only in correction territory now, in other words, back 10 percent from our highs. The Nasdaq actually is not in correction territory, even though the Nasdaq 100, some of those hot, fast stocks like Facebook and others that have problems of their own, that's down 5.6 percent from its highs here.</p><p>But a lot of this had to do with the simple fact of an excuse to sell or reason to sell or impetus to sell or Washington out of control, whatever you want to say. Facebook, again, its own little separate soap opera that we are going to get into it.</p><p>But I will tell you this. A lot of money was going into bonds. A lot of money was going into something called the 10-year note. And a lot of people use that. And this can sound kind of gobbledygook boring, but a 10- year note fell seven basis points today.</p><p>That's a sign that money was going into bonds today, a relative safe haven, because they're backed by Uncle Sam. And that drove the yield down a little bit to 2.83 from 2.90 percent.</p><p>Now, you say, Neil, why do you mention that? Because money was trying to find a home. At least a lot of stock traders will tell you a temporary home, because they want them back in the stock market.</p><p>So, as crazy as this incredible day was, it's worth pointing out that the markets are up still appreciably. The only question is, let's just see what the Senate does with that spending plan. Let's just see what the Chinese do with that tariff plan. And let's just see what other lawyers are moving around on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>That, my friends, is the making of a Washington drama. It was playing out in real time.</p><p>More after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Mr. President, would you still like to testify to special counsel Robert Mueller, sir?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: You would?</p><p>TRUMP: I would like to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: It makes it easier if someone is walking by that you can see letters of what they're saying.</p><p>But that was the president saying that he would be open to talking about Bob Mueller, of course, doing this Russian investigation.</p><p>Now, keep in mind John Dowd, the president's top attorney, stepping down lot today. He was among those -- actually the only one, as far as I know, urging the president not to sit down with Bob Mueller. Others within the White House, the legal team, both from the White House and the president's himself, have been trying to come up with a way, a middle ground, either written questions of responses, targeted area that will talk about.</p><p>Our own Judge Andrew Napolitano says, that would be a very big mistake, that it sets the stage for something that the president will not like.</p><p>Attorney Lisa Giovinazzo says she agrees with that, that a sit-down there, whatever your views of the subject, for the president at least, could be a problem.</p><p>Why is that, Lisa?</p><p>LISA GIOVINAZZO, ATTORNEY: Look, no defense attorney want their clients to sit down in here an Q&amp;A with authorities.</p><p>Immediately, you're at the risk of perjury. Miranda rights, right, anything that you can say can and will be used against you, this all ensues.</p><p>And there's no reason for him to do it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, is the fear that he says something that goes beyond what he intended to or that he would veers into an area that he had no idea would be discussed?</p><p>If his lawyers are presently looking at a structured area where he could or would either via written responses or others talk about stuff, just as long as he's aware of the stuff they're going to talk about.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO: Well, I mean, the written responses, right, they would go along the lines of interrogatories. That's kind of the first step.</p><p>And they're always profitable, because you can look at them. The lawyers can help him draft the proper responses. They're very focused, whereas you put anybody in a room, especially President Trump, and every word now will be taken literally. And that could be a very dangerous scenario.</p><p>We also have a president and an investigation that has a pretty wide net. If you remember back in the Clinton days, he did sit down with the prosecutors.</p><p>CAVUTO: He did.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO: And it didn't work out very well for him, but it was also a very focused investigation. This not so much.</p><p>There a lot of different areas that the president could delve into. Now, the one positive, he would be able to have counsel in the room.</p><p>In the event that he doesn't have a sit-down, there is always the risk that they could choose to subpoena him.</p><p>CAVUTO: Where you think this is going, Lisa?</p><p>GIOVINAZZO: The fact that he recently fired Dowd, the fact that he goes through a lot of lawyers at the time, I don't think that he is all that concerned with the criminal nature of this investigation.</p><p>I think it's much more political. I think that it's gotten a lot of legs because it keeps coming up with a lot of changes, a lot of legalese we're hearing about.</p><p>But in the nature of this case, it's a long way out. Even if they were to subpoena him, that could be months in a court system. They have never subpoenaed a sitting president and actually enforced it against him</p><p>I mean, they're -- the scales of justice, they work, but they turn very slowly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But they're maddening for the president.</p><p>I can understand that. I mean, obviously, this investigation seems to have gone afield from what it was originally. Now they're looking at business transactions that date to the Trump organization and years before even he was running for president, if we're to believe these reports.</p><p>So, it wouldn't be the first investigation that has gone from its original intent. I'm thinking of Whitewater with Ken Starr. That was about land deals and the like. And it ended up with an intern in a blue dress.</p><p>So, where is this going?</p><p>GIOVINAZZO: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head.</p><p>I think it's going into deeper and deeper areas of the president's personal business, because they're not getting what they want to come up with an indictment, to find criminal charges on the surface, which is why this whole -- this whole issue about Q&amp;A with the president is coming up.</p><p>They don't seem to have enough to move forward. And that's why you're hearing from other people in the party. You're hearing from his lawyers to say, you know, move with it or drop the investigation.</p><p>And, honestly, he does have a right to that. People have a right to a speedy trial. Now, bear in mind, it's just an investigation. Nobody -- nobody is pointing a finger at the president. So he's kind of stuck in this gray area that it could really drag out for a very long time.</p><p>And I think that all of us would agree that we're starting to see a lot of political movement in this investigation, and the fact that it doesn't seem to ever come to an end.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, just accelerates, like a soap opera as well.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Lisa, thank you very, very much. Good seeing you.</p><p>GIOVINAZZO: You too, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the read from one of the most powerful Republicans in the United States Senate, John Thune, on what's going on here and what is going on with that spending measure.</p><p>Remember, it has to get passed in the Senate and have to do so in a little bit more than, what, 30 hours or so, or we're looking at a government shutdown. Are we? John Thune after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, a big hit in the Dow today.</p><p>In case you're counting, all 30 Dow stocks are down, and all 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500, they were down as well. Try 1,000 points on the Dow just this week. We have another day to go.</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we just want to pass along some news regarding the Trump administration approving $1 billion worth of arms sold to the Saudi Arabians.</p><p>Remember, the crown prince is visiting this country for the next couple of weeks. He had stopped by at the White House to visit the president just a couple of days ago. That order will include more than 6,500 missiles.</p><p>He expressed concern -- that is, the crown prince, as well as the president -- about Iran and that nuclear agreement that seems to be fraying and falling apart.</p><p>We should let you know right now that the Saudis have made clear that if the Iranians get their hands on a nuclear weapon, he wants to go nuclear himself.</p><p>The read on all of this and all the other news happening today from South Dakota Republicans Senator, prominent top Republican, John Thune.</p><p>Senator, good to have you.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA: Nice to be with you. Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make? I mean, this is still early.</p><p>One billion, I guess for the Saudis and us, is chump change these days, but it's a pretty big missile deal. And we seem to be very tight with both the Saudis, helping them, and them helping us. What do you make of this arrangement?</p><p>THUNE: Well, I think they have been an ally for a long time on a lot levels.</p><p>And, obviously, right now, they help check in that region of the world the influence of Iran. And I think it's important for us to continue to maintain that relationship and to work together with them as partners to try and bring stability to that region of the world.</p><p>They are leading the force against -- in Yemen. They're helping the government there against the Houthis, which are backed by the Iranians. And so there are lots of ways in which our countries are able to cooperate. And I think we continue -- need to continue that if we're going to keep some sort of a stability in that region, which is so important to the stability of the entire world.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know of the markets, as you're aware, Senator. Of course, you're not as much as a nerd as me and live and die by this stuff, so touche to you.</p><p>But there's a fear expressed by some traders of all political persuasions that what goes but is coming down. It's coming down again. Washington spending is out of control. You guys can't seem to agree on this. Maybe you do the measure on the spending plan to avoid a government shutdown, but that the debt is building, a lot of excesses are building, and there's a world of hurt coming, including now a potential trade war with the Chinese.</p><p>Are you concerned?</p><p>THUNE: I am.</p><p>I think there are a lot of things that we need to be concerned about. We have got to get spending under control. We have got to deal with this debt and this deficit, which, of course, I think means we have got to reform our budget process.</p><p>But we have to play the long game. The market has its day-to-day ups and downs and gyrations, but I think as long as we focus on policies that are creating conditions that are favorable to economic growth, and we're seeing that -- you saw the unemployment rate is now down to its lowest level in 17 years.</p><p>The number of people reentering the labor force in the month of February was at the highest in 38 years, over 800,000 people coming back in. Wages are up. And we're starting to see good growth in the economy.</p><p>And a lot of that, Neil, is because of policies that this president, this Congress have put in place, tax reform, regulatory reform, certainty when it comes to the legal process through the appointment of good judges to the courts.</p><p>Those are all things that I think are shaping the economy right now in a way that provides hope and optimism for the future, which is why consumer confidence is up.</p><p>That said, we have to -- we have got to get fiscal discipline back in place here in Washington.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it's nowhere near -- it's nowhere near in place, right?</p><p>The HouseFreedom Caucus, they just threw up their arms and said, oh, no one seems to care about it. Republicans run the show. They have the House, the Senate, the White House, and yet this debt is growing faster than me circling a Ponderosa buffet.</p><p>No?</p><p>THUNE: Well, it's two things.</p><p>We have got to reform entitlement programs, which the Democrats have had no appetite for. We tried to do that with the Obamacare replace and repeal last summer. We put in place for the first time real entitlement reforms in the Medicaid program.</p><p>Obviously, that failed by a vote. We need more Republicans, more conservatives in Congress to get the entitlement programs reined in. That's the spending side.</p><p>But on the other side, as I mentioned earlier, you got to have growth in the economy. And that's why these policies that are pro-growth and pro- jobs are really important. And so it's a -- it's a combination of both.</p><p>It's fiscal restraint, but it's also pro-growth policies. And I think we can get this back on the right track. But it does start fundamentally, in my view, with reforming our budget process. And that's something that I and many others around here have been advocating for a long time.</p><p>And I hope that, again, another omnibus spending bill like this will renew the emphasis on serious, meaningful budget reform here in Washington.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you worried about a trade war?</p><p>THUNE: Well, I am worried about what I see happening out there. I do think that that could undermine a lot of the good things that we're seeing in the economy.</p><p>And the market obviously is reacting to it. But I think, again, we want to make sure that when we -- these trade policies -- and I understand the president's desire to clamp down on China and to deal with them in a way that helps them understand that we are serious and that they're going to have to get serious when it comes to stealing our intellectual property, but that we do that in a way that doesn't create disruption in the market.</p><p>And, obviously, we're worried about retaliatory actions taken particularly directed at agriculture that could be very detrimental and harmful to the middle of the country, but to the whole country.</p><p>And so this is one of those things, they need to proceed slowly with care, very targeted, very selective in how they go about this. I think these indiscriminate, wide tariff policies could be incredibly harmful if they lead to an escalation of a trade war.</p><p>That's not going to be good for the economy in the long term.</p><p>CAVUTO: You think the president made a mistake?</p><p>THUNE: I disagree with him on this issue.</p><p>I know he feels passionately about it. I have heard him speak about it. I do think that he wants to see reciprocal trade. We agree with that. But, again, I think how you go about that, the policies you implement, who you direct those at, thinking about the consequences and the unintended consequences and how those retaliatory actions might occur, what they might hit, being prepared for that is going to be really important.</p><p>And so I hope, as they move forward, they do it in a very thoughtful way, and in a way that would limit the ancillary, harmful and adverse impacts that could occur to the economy.</p><p>I appreciate the fact they have scaled back some of these actions already. But I guess I would encourage them not to get us in the middle of a trade war. I don't think that is in anybody's best interests. And I think it could undo a lot of the good progress that we have seen in terms of economic growth as a result, in many respects, because of the president's policies and working with the Congress.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Senator John Thune, very good having you. Thank you.</p><p>THUNE: Thanks, Neil. Appreciate it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>And speaking of the Senate, that measure, that budget measures could come up tonight, could come up tomorrow. But it's got to get done before 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, or we do have another shutdown.</p><p>We shall see.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you're familiar with what's going on at Facebook right now, and how that stock has just been getting pummeled over the last few days over the release of information that showed 50 million folks had their data compromised.</p><p>Well, the stock has swooned, lost about $40 billion in market value, about $8 billion of that, well, for Mark Zuckerberg. That is how much poorer he is this week, $8 billion poorer. A rounding error on his worth, but I thought I would pass that along.</p><p>All right, first, it was Los Alamitos, remember that, proposing to opt out of California's new sanctuary law. Now many other government officials there, elsewhere saying, you know what? We want a sanctuary from this sanctuary thing, because it's killing us.</p><p>Orange County Supervisor Michael Steel, who proposed just last night to take on the issue at her next meeting.</p><p>Michelle Steel.</p><p>I apologize, Michelle.</p><p>CAVUTO: What kind of reaction are you getting?</p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR: I got a lot of support, because people are sending me a lot of e-mails. And they strongly support, because they know that California law, that Senate Bill 54 is illegal.</p><p>So I get a lot of support and a lot of phone calls. And I really appreciate that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Your argument is what, that this hurts you. Explain why you're doing this.</p><p>STEEL: Well, the government's first duty, I believe that that is protect its citizens.</p><p>And it's like, when you release all these illegal aliens, especially criminals, we are talking about -- we are not talking about law-abiding illegal aliens -- we are talking about criminals on the streets -- it's very dangerous.</p><p>And public safety is very, very important in Orange County. And it's going to hurt. And it's going to hurt our residents in Orange County, and not just Orange County, but for California.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think California is hurting itself, hurting its reputation by doing this, the mayor of Oakland, the governor who support these type of measures?</p><p>STEEL: Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>Mayor of Oakland tells everybody that this is racist. That has nothing to do with it. We don't want any criminals walking on the street.</p><p>You cannot really put it some different way, but we just want to stop these criminals walking on our streets.</p><p>CAVUTO: You always get that rap, right? I mean, and I have talked to others who are trying to do the same thing as you are, Michelle.</p><p>And the first thing they have to deal with is, oh, you're racist, or you're against poor people trying to do the right thing in the United States. And they morph into saying you're against immigration, of course, when you're against illegal immigration.</p><p>But you know the drill. Have you gotten any of that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>STEEL: I know the drill. And I know the process. I'm a first-generation immigrant.</p><p>And Orange County is number third, the largest county in the state. And we have a lot of large immigrant communities in our county. So we totally understand.</p><p>And we are supporting that what we are doing, because left-wing California state legislators, and they're the ones created this chaos. And we have to stop that. So what we are doing is, Jeff Sessions sued California.</p><p>And I don't want this going to be inside of the court forever. And we want to expedite the ruling against this bad law.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Now, it should be stressed that you're in a conservative community. Most of the communities in California seem to be slightly to the left of you.</p><p>So, it's not really going to change the policy in the state, or do you suspect it might?</p><p>STEEL: No, I want all the 58 counties in California joined us.</p><p>And there's a couple of cities already joined us. And Newport Beach, city of Newport Beach, you heard, and Buena Park is, and then Aliso Viejo in Orange County, they all start this.</p><p>So, all these cities and counties joining us opt out against this bad law, then I think it's going to happen. It's not just like all the leftists and the other counties, but they all want to be in the safe environment.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Michelle Steel, thank you very much for taking the time, Orange County, California, supervisor.</p><p>And, again, she's an example of some in the state there saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we need a sanctuary from the sanctuary thing. It's fascinating and it's building.</p><p>We do want to alert you as well. We told you about these roughly $55 billion to $66 billion worth of trade tariffs that administration slapped on the Chinese. Well, they are responding, as we thought they would, that China is strongly disappointed and firmly opposes the president's move, strongly disappointed that he's doing this, that plans for Chinese imports are a bad idea.</p><p>Going on to say, he doesn't want a trade war with the United States, but will not recoil from one. This is again coming from the Chinese Embassy in Washington. China would fight to the end with all necessary measures in a trade war initiated by the U.S.</p><p>Now, again, the prevailing wisdom is that they go for something that will hit back at the president, some of these agricultural targets that might hurt the presidents in states that he won and hurt Republicans in states that they have generally done well in the last election in the midterm.</p><p>There's no way of quantifying that. There is also a suspicion that Boeing might be a target. It was among the worst performers in the Dow 30 today, on the belief that the Chinese might say, we're not going to order planes from you. We will go to Airbus.</p><p>There's no way of knowing, but that the Chinese have responded, as we thought they would, and that they're saying they're not guilty of any of this and that China doesn't, doesn't do any of the horrible things they have been accused of doing from this administration.</p><p>By the way, this administration is not the first one to say that the Chinese cheat. It's the first administration to act on it.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Remember that guy? Well, he's live right now. You're looking live at Steve Bannon.</p><p>He's speaking at The Financial Times conference going in New York City. The man accused of a whole lot of leaks has been out of the White House, but those leaks keeps coming.</p><p>So the White House wants to start trying to get handle on this. How does this keep happening? Steve is gone, but they're still happening.</p><p>What the heck is going on?</p><p>Let's ask former Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush Brad Blakeman.</p><p>They do have a problem here. Marco Rubio articulated it very well, Brad, to say, look, if you don't want to be in the administration, you don't like the president, or you don't like just being there, get the hell out. But it still happens.</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>BRAD BLAKEMAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: Well, what is going on is, we have people within the White House that are trying to deep-six the president on his policies.</p><p>If they don't like it, what do they do? They leak it and try and either sink the policy or adversely affect it. But there's a way to stop it, Neil.</p><p>And it's pretty simple. Every bit of paper the president gets, there is a flow chain, a check-off of who has this information. I think the president needs to get serious. Get the FBI in. Do interviews, polygraphs if necessary, and find out who these people are, and deal with them harshly, because it will send a tremendous message throughout the White House that leaking is inappropriate.</p><p>Get fired. Get prosecuted, if necessary. That's the way to get a handle on leaking.</p><p>CAVUTO: These are relatively small and apparently increasingly smaller groups of people. So at least you could remember, I was at a meeting with six other people. I know I wasn't the guy doing the leaking, so maybe the other five did.</p><p>It's like a bad version of the game \"Clue.\" But, I mean, what do you do? I mean, how do you get a handle on it? Because this is not the administration that has had this sort of problem, but it seems to me here to be out of control.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: But you have to make examples of people.</p><p>And, sometimes, administrations don't want to know who the leaker is, because they're afraid of who it might be. Now you need to send a message, not only to the White House, but to the bureaucracies, that leaking is not going to be tolerated.</p><p>And, again, whether it's a telephone call, there's a checklist of people who are on that call it, you do check the box. Is it this person? Is it that person? Is it this person?</p><p>The other problem, Neil, is, I may be privy to information, and then I give it to somebody else within the administration, who then leaks it. But then you have a paper trail, you have a telephone trail. This is something that can be done forensically. And the FBI does this all the time. It probably should be done now,.</p><p>CAVUTO: The one thing is really weird about it is that -- and this dates back to remember when the president just got in office and a call that he had, it was a nasty exchange with the Australian prime minister? And suddenly -- very few people were aware of that, maybe, say, people at the State Department. Maybe it was someone at the State Department.</p><p>And it was all over, their argument, that they said it.</p><p>And back to Marco Rubio's point. If for some reason this is all about embarrassing the president or you don't like the president, then stop working for the president.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: There's no doubt about it.</p><p>But it may not be people directly in the White House. It could be somebody in the bureaucracy who is not necessarily politically appointed by the president, a career person. And you can find out that as well.</p><p>But no leaking should be tolerated, whether it's...</p><p>CAVUTO: But, see, what you said there is interesting, because someone then would be tapping the president, tapping the president's phone.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Well, not really.</p><p>You would be surprised, Neil, on, let's say, a call with Putin. Typically, there's probably about 10 people on that call.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: There are translators. There are notetakers.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's true.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: But, again, you know from the call sheet who exactly is privy at firsthand information to that call.</p><p>The FBI needs to go out and polygraph these people. And you're going to find the leaker pretty quick.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do they still rely on these polygraphs?</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Absolutely. And they're done randomly, as well as drug testing. You don't know when it's coming. And that's the way it should be, because then you can't prepare for it.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know what I do? I look at everybody's eyes, like -- you ever do that? And if they're shifting, I just say, you -- I don't know.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Then everybody in Washington would be locked up.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you know, actually, it was a dumb point I just made there. Thank you for bringing that up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Brad, thank you very, very much, Brad Blakeman, former deputy assistant to President George Bush -- W. Bush.</p><p>BLAKEMAN: Pleasure.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, in the meantime, we have got some new developments involving some intelligence leaks and the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Remember him?</p><p>Catherine Herridge in Washington with the latest on that.</p><p>Hey, Catherine.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>Earlier today, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee posted more extensive findings from their investigation, because now the 150-page report goes to the intelligence community for declassification.</p><p>I have some of those findings right here. And one in particular is noteworthy under a section about national security leaks and the allegation -- it says -- I'm reading from it -- the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, this is the person who runs the intelligence community and is charged with protecting classified information.</p><p>Republicans found that he provided -- quote -- \"inconsistent testimony\" about his contacts with the media, including CNN.</p><p>That's important, because, of course, now he works as an analyst for CNN. And based on our reporting, we believe the incident at issue here is that January 2017 Trump Tower briefing, where the incoming president was told for the first time about this unverified dossier.</p><p>And it was the leaking of that briefing which really took the dossier story into the mainstream, which is something that hadn't happened in the fall of 2016, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know what is kind of interesting, Catherine?</p><p>If you think of Clapper and you think of Brennan, and you think of all of these former higher-ups at all these various intelligence agencies, we now know how they feel about the president, Brennan, over-the-top criticism of the president.</p><p>And the president have always argued, these guys are biased against me. It turns out, if their sentiment is pretty consistent, he was right</p><p>So what are we to make of their prevailing view, which tends to be very dismissive of President Trump, and whether that in one way, shape or form at any of these intelligence agencies of which he was quite critical is coming back to bite him?</p><p>HERRIDGE: Well, a couple of points there.</p><p>In the past, I have tried to reach DNI Clapper for comment on other FOX reporting, but he has declined, citing his new position with CNN. So we will try again, because that's the right thing.</p><p>But in the past, he's not provided comment.</p><p>The other thing I would say, that in the 15 years that I have been covering the intelligence community here in Washington, I have never seen a period where previous leadership has been so public and outspoken and really very political about their views of a current administration.</p><p>So that is certainly a new and very different development, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: And petty, right, very, very petty.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Well, you have to look into their eyes, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HERRIDGE: I almost feel nervous about this segment now, what my eyes are telling you.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm watching you.</p><p>HERRIDGE: I know.</p><p>CAVUTO: I am watching you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Catherine, thank you very, very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is so weird, Catherine Herridge.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But, if you think about it, folks, the president has been saying, right, look, these guys have it out for me.</p><p>And, sometimes, like my dad used to say, it's a good thing to be paranoid, because you really should be seeing who is right over your shoulder, because there are a lot of cases again and again where they're telling exactly how they feel about the president now, in a former -- former top official role.</p><p>Well, what was the deal when they were those top officials at all these various security agencies and they harbored those views? The only difference is, they're not in power to do that. Of course, some of them pop up on other news networks just to rip him a new one, but that's a whole 'nother drama.</p><p>In the meantime, there's where we stand going into tomorrow. A lot of concerns about how this sorts out. Friday, anything could happen. You know what's going to happen in Asia and Europe. We will see.</p><p>\"The Five\" now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018032203cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXV-9GX1-JB20-G0K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Marc Short</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Thune</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001673</classCode><className>TARIFFS &amp;

Justin Tallis / AFP</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Washington's campaign to dissuade nations around the world to refrain from using China's Huawei in building their fifth-generation mobile networks is stalling.</p><p>Despite the argument put forward by the US that the Chinese company could one day be a security threat (an argument the latter strongly refutes), Britain said on Tuesday it is to allow Huawei limited access to its future 5G network. On Wednesday, the EU was also expected to shy away from a ban on the Chinese company's technology. These decisions recognise the truth that if you want 5G and its super-fast internet speeds then you have little option but to turn to Huawei.</p><p>Development of new technology should not be left to either the public or private sector to decide alone</p><p>If there were a real alternative to Huawei in terms of equipment for 5G, this wouldn't be a debate.</p><p>Europe led in the 2G era, Japan led 3G and the US led 4G. Now it is China's turn.</p><p>It is worth noting ever since 2G first allowed for secure and ubiquitous voice and SMS, there has been a fair amount of hysteria around the adoption of subsequent generations of cellular technology \u2013 both positive and negative. 5G is no different, even if it is expected to provide us with a fully interconnected society.</p><p>Huawei, ahead of Cisco in the US, Europe's Nokia and Ericsson, Japan's Rakuten and South Korea's Samsung, has emerged to become the dominant force in this area of communications technology. While Huawei disputes the accusation it receives preferential treatment from the Chinese government, what cannot be disputed is that the unique environment created in China is what allowed it to become the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment.</p><p>Equally indubitable today is that the US and Europe have lost the 5G battle to China. The question now is are they also losing the wider war to lead a digital future?</p><p>According to Bloomberg, the US is the ninth most innovative country in the world. Seven years ago, it was ranked first. China is only at 15th, but is rising. More than half the top ten is made up of European nations like Germany, which is number one, and Switzerland, which is fourth. South Korea and Singapore are second and third, respectively.</p><p>The scale of an economy is not necessarily an arbiter of success in innovation, but the wider takeaway of the Huawei story is that the development of new technology should not be left to either the public or private sector to decide alone.</p><p>The market cannot be trusted to put strategic areas of development ahead of profit when necessary, and governments are rarely efficient or competitive enough to develop anything on their own.</p><p>Apple, Qualcomm, Cisco and Intel have failed to lead the worldwide push into 5G. Lucent and Motorola were unable to remain competitive over the years. This is partly because the economics of new investment didn't always make sense, especially when one is already ahead of the pack in the prevailing technology of the day. Another reason is that the government has a role to play in encouraging the adoption of the next generation of technology even if it isn't profitable yet and Washington seems to have dropped the ball on 5G. That is despite the rich tradition of public-private partnership in the innovation of new technologies in America.</p><p>Founded by Alexander Graham-Bell, the inventor of the telephone, Bell Labs \u2013 ironically enough now owned by Nokia \u2013 pioneered research into the transistor, semiconductors and microwaves in the last century. Work carried out at Bell Labs underpins much of modern computing and communications. Its efforts were indirectly funded by the government through the telephone monopoly that the lab's parent AT&amp;T enjoyed. There were also institutions across the states that were fuelled by government funding directly \u2013 one example being Stanford University, from which today's hotbed of innovation Silicon Valley has evolved.</p><p>Read More</p><p>Thanks to 5G, this is the decade we graduate from the smartphone</p><p>Apple 'to introduce 5G iPhones in 2020' but is unlikely to increase cost</p><p>Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have grown to dominate thanks to the explosion of mobile communications. Their phenomenal success today, however, may hamper breakthroughs in the future. Big companies don't behave like start-ups and often fail to innovate even when they have an advantage. That's why government regulation also has to be right. Lessons have been learned from how fractured standards for mobile telephony became in the US.</p><p>On to the next battlegrounds. For example in artificial intelligence, the US and China are ahead of Europe.</p><p>Although, China has the upper hand, first and foremost thanks to a huge population from which to take the data sets that inform AI. For much the same reason, it also has a bigger talent pool from which to hire. The US will have to be more nimble and work smarter than China in order to win. It seems Washington is making sure that the public and private sectors \u2013 linking up government, universities and companies \u2013 have every opportunity to work together as a matter of policy. For AI at least it is not being left up to the market alone to decide how technology develops in the US.</p><p>Mustafa Alrawi is an assistant editor-in-chief at The National</p><p>Updated: January 29, 2020 03:40 PM</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/84/158029996724.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/84/158029996724.jpg</url></p><p>A sign advertising 5G mobile telecommunication in a shop in London.

Tucker Carlson, up next live in D.C.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are.</p><p>Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember.</p><p>Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office.</p><p>So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR 16TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, TEXAS: Will fight when necessary against a President who's focused on building walls.</p><p>No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns.</p><p>Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem.</p><p>We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever!</p><p>Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram.</p><p>But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people.</p><p>O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls.</p><p>As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\"</p><p>Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions.</p><p>The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it.</p><p>When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat.</p><p>Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind.</p><p>Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper.</p><p>Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?</p><p>And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial.</p><p>Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country?</p><p>A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it.</p><p>Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that.</p><p>So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?</p><p>NATE LERNER, CO-FOUNDER, DRAFTBETO.ORG: Right. Right, so on the - on the surface and taken out of context, that certainly sounds bad. But what he's actually talking about is a--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, different.</p><p>LERNER: --is a very common approach to Constitutional law. Constitutional scholars for centuries have debated if the Constitution should be taken literally and at word or if it's a living breathing document that we--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LERNER: --should interpret as things change.</p><p>And guess what? Our country has changed and the world has changed quite a bit in the last 200-plus years. And what Beto was saying is that perhaps we need to re-visit parts of the Constitution as a result. That's - that's a very common discussion that--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look--</p><p>LERNER: --that scholars would have.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm open-minded. And, by the way, there are things in the Constitution, you know, I - I think we should always have conversations about everything--</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --that we disagree with. But what specifically is he talking about? I think it's also fair to ask, what principles need to be revised.</p><p>LERNER: You know, I - I'm not a spokesperson for Beto or for his campaign. But, you know, I do understand what he's saying as far as needing to re-visit parts of the Constitution. I think the Electoral College is a really good example where you are empowering some voters more so than others, and giving them more of a voice than others.</p><p>And that's - that's really unfair and not what our democracy's about. That's a very good example right there.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what - what does that mean? Look, obviously, we're for fairness. There's a lot of unfairness. I agree with that, for sure, and we should work as hard as we can to rectify it. But just give me one example of the principles that might be changed under a Beto O'Rourke presidency?</p><p>LERNER: I - I do not speak for Beto or - or for his campaign. So I can't--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --I can't do that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. That's totally fair enough. So, he was asked about the Border wall and he said, and I'm paraphrasing, but it's pretty close, \"We are killing people when we build Border walls.\" What is that - how are we - how are we killing people? How have we killed people by doing that?</p><p>LERNER: So, in the context of what he was talking about, he was making two points. One, if we - if when we militarize our border with Mexico, you're increasing the risk that people are going to get hurt or killed when they cross the border in their encounters with our - with our security forces and their side.</p><p>And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous.</p><p>And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people.</p><p>So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders. Democrats aren't for that despite what's often said here.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are.</p><p>LERNER: They're not.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but then - but hold on let's--</p><p>LERNER: They're for - they're for (ph) treating people like humans and treating--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Look, I--</p><p>LERNER: --them is the seaming (ph) way.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. So but, Mexico had over 31,000 murders last year. That's about twice the number we had in the country as a population less than half of ours. So, it's one of the most dangerous countries in the world. And so, it's fair to be concerned about that violence moving north. Any normal country--</p><p>LERNER: Well but it's also fair--</p><p>CARLSON: --would be concerned.</p><p>LERNER: --to understand that people might want to be fleeing that violence that have, you know, for their families' sake--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Because that's - that - that's true.</p><p>LERNER: --and to build up life (ph) here.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean the - the rights and the interests of Americans come first from the perspective of the U.S. government. That's why we have the government to protect--</p><p>LERNER: 100 percent, absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --our rights (ph). So, explain to me, and you can speak slowly if you want, how we are forcing people to come across our border illegally. How are we forcing people to come across? I - I don't understand that.</p><p>LERNER: We're not - we're not forcing people. It's just that we should be treating them in a humane and civil way because they are humans. And despite the way they have been described by Donald Trump and Republicans, you know, they're - they're not - they're not criminals. They're not rapists. They're not all drug dealers.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Many of them are just coming here to seek better lives.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I've - I've always--</p><p>LERNER: And we need to respect and--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, but, but I--</p><p>LERNER: --appreciate that.</p><p>CARLSON: --I totally - but I've never doubted that. And some are bad people. Most are just economic migrants who want to move to a richer country.</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: I get it. I would, as I said many times on this show, I would leave Honduras too, and I would come here illegally if I could. And I mean it. I'm not joking. So, I get it. But I'm not from Honduras. I'm from America. And I don't want people driving - driving down wages in this country.</p><p>So, don't we have a right to say, \"No, you can't come in unless we want you to come in?\"</p><p>LERNER: We absolutely have a right to - to do that. However, as Americans, we also have a duty to treat them a certain way and to respect their humanity and respect them as individuals, and not simply cast them aside.</p><p>And so, when you're - when you're looking at border security, there is a certain way that you should be treating people, and it's not forcing them to, you know, it's not - it's not putting them at a - a massive risk and potentially killing them--</p><p>CARLSON: But how are we putting--</p><p>LERNER: --instead of responding (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --wait but how - how are - if - if we erect a wall and say, you can't cross, that's the same as killing them?</p><p>LERNER: Putting up a wall does put them in greater danger because it forces them to find different points of entry. And a wall is just a massive - it's just - it's not - it doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't solve the main problem of immigration, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --longer visa, which is we--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK, so, so, so I'm--</p><p>LERNER: --people are overstaying their visas. If people can (ph) just throw a--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm glad - I'm glad you're putting that. No, no--</p><p>LERNER: --rope over a wall, there's tunnels that they can use.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's totally fair. That's - that's a talking point, but it's also real, so I'm glad you mentioned it.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And, in fact, Mr. O'Rourke was - was asked it too by Jeff Bezos' newspaper, and his quote was, \"I don't know.\" Now, how could he not know? He represents Texas. He's been asked of immigration for years, and he hasn't thought through visa overstays, which, as you point out, are a driver of our crisis. How could you not have an answer to that?</p><p>LERNER: So, again, I - I - so, again, out of context, that sounds bad. But what he said after that was that he would work with the people who it's affected by, work with policymakers, work with experts, work with people on the ground who deal with this every day to find a solution.</p><p>And actually, I think it's very refreshing that a politician was willing to say, \"I don't know,\" because if you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's sure.</p><p>LERNER: --where immigration reform has gone in the last 20 years, which is nowhere, I think a lot of politicians actually don't know. They have no idea what a solution is because we haven't found one. And so, what he's saying is we need to have a debate. We need to talk it over.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, look, I'm totally for that.</p><p>LERNER: Find a solution.</p><p>CARLSON: And I - and actually do agree with you.</p><p>LERNER: Right. So, sounds like you support him there.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I support being honest about not knowing. I just think--</p><p>LERNER: He's - he's just (ph) being honest.</p><p>CARLSON: --he should like try a little harder. But let me ask you something that I don't know the answer to and I'm not being mean. I'm being sincere.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Here you had in the last election an Irish Catholic guy with a Hispanic nickname running against an actual Hispanic guy with an Anglo name. Would that seem a little weird to you, a little audacious maybe?</p><p>LERNER: You know, Ted Cruz tried to make that point as well, and Texans got over it pretty quickly.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a real point.</p><p>LERNER: It's not - it's not a real point. It's - it's - the point is moot. You know, it's - it's something that - it's something to joke about for a minute. It was his - his nickname.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: It's his nickname growing up. It's I guess people call Ted, you know, Ted Cruz, Ted, his higher enough (ph) as well. And it's - it's not - it's not something people care about. People care about real issues.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know. Well, I asked about real issues and I ended it with, as you pointed out, joking about it for a second, which I didn't have (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Very fair.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate your coming on Nate. Thank you very much.</p><p>LERNER: Of course, anytime.</p><p>CARLSON: Well from The View to all the dumb people on television, what you're hearing this week, and it really is a talking point of the week, is that everybody who's not a Democrat is by nature a bigot. It's what they're telling you.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson responds to that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well if you've watched TV this week, you have heard this week's talking point. Republicans and the people who vote for them are bigots, every one of them. The geniuses over at The View, the daytime TV show, suggested that almost half the country's just flat-out immoral, and should be shunned on those grounds. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: But will Republicans now step up to the plate with Donald Trump because he has been using, I think, the Border wall as sort of this dog whistle for racism. The government is still shut down, and I think it's all about, \"Let's not let all these Brown people in.\"</p><p>ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: There's 42 percent of this country that support the wall. Are they all racist?</p><p>HOSTIN: That's a good question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know. That's--</p><p>HOSTIN: That - that--</p><p>HUNTSMAN: I'm - I'm asking you that. I don't - I don't think so.</p><p>HOSTIN: --that's a good question.</p><p>HUNTSMAN: I don't think so. I think there are a lot of people that believe--</p><p>HOSTIN: Is Donald - is - is-- I don't know--</p><p>HUNTSMAN: --in security.</p><p>HOSTIN: --is Donald Trump racist?</p><p>(CROWD APPLAUDING)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW: Duh.</p><p>MEGHAN MARGUERITE MCCAIN, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, AUTHOR, FORMER FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Do you think 42 percent of Americans are racist?</p><p>HOSTIN: I just said I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. It's The View. You can write it off like what do they know. But it wasn't just The View. Nicole Wallace had a real job at one point. She was White House Communications Director briefly, I think, under last Republican Administration. Here's her view.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ANCHOR, CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC AND NBC NEWS: This does not have a parallel on the Left. They're just - they're just - it - it doesn't. There isn't. There isn't a strain of racism on the Left.</p><p>I don't so - so, I think that - that this gets brushed under the rug. People sort of tolerate - it's been normalized. Like you just said, they don't have anywhere else to go, so they attach to the Republican Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. No racists on the Left, literally not one, says Nicole Wallace.</p><p>Over in ESPN, one of their hosts suggested it was racist, not surprisingly, for the President to serve the Clemson Football Team fast food at the White House. Fast food is the food of bigots. Of course.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOLLY QERIM ROSE, SPORTS ANCHOR AND MODERATOR, ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: When I saw him giving the football players, it's - it's a predominantly Black sport, and fast food, my thought went - went a very different place. Also a - a bunch of--</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, BOXING COMMENTATOR, CO-HOST OF ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: I think the - I think the President likes fast food.</p><p>ROSE: --a bunch of--</p><p>STEPHEN ANTHONY SMITH, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, SPORTS RADIO HOST, SPORTS JOURNALIST, ACTOR, ESPN FIRST TAKE COMMENTATOR: Yes.</p><p>ROSE: --Macs (ph). I mean come on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. OK. So, the consensus is the racism is on the Right. Only Conservatives can be racist. So that raises a few questions.</p><p>What exactly is racism? What does it look like? How'd if - you know if you are racist. And so, we have a handily checklist for you. Get a pen and follow along. See if you can answer these questions.</p><p>A racist - what would a racist do? A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done.</p><p>They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes.</p><p>They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right?</p><p>People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do.</p><p>Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>You know what I noticed, Professor Hanson, and maybe I'm just making this up in my head, but it seems like people have a tendency to accuse others of doing the exact thing that they are doing. Have you noticed that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I think it's really dangerous throughout history when you have a group that sets themselves up as the arbiters of morality.</p><p>We saw that with the Catholic Church and the abuse problems. We saw that in the #MeToo and the Hollywood liberals like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey.</p><p>They feel that they're not subject to the same standards they demand of others. And what's going on here is that if I think that Representative King confused Western civilization with White and - Whiteness, and they're not synonymous, especially in the global world.</p><p>Japan can be more Western than - than Russia. But the point is--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's just interesting that if you--</p><p>HANSON: --we got to find out what the rules are, Tucker because while--</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's what I mean--</p><p>HANSON: --we're condemning him, we have Hank Johnson, another Member of the Congress, who recently said, compared Jews in Israel to termites.</p><p>And then we've got the Editor Board - a person on the Editorial Board in the New York Times, Sarah Jeong, who said, literally (ph), I hate White people, and compared them to dogs urinating on hydrants. The New York Times was not upset.</p><p>Then we've got this whole trope now in - in rap music, all the major marquee rappers, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Scarface, it's just rampant anti-Semitism. And we saw LeBron James, our national icon, re-tweeting an anti-Semitic tweet and with no - of a rapper with no consequences.</p><p>So, the American people are saying to themselves, \"Wow! What are the rules?\" And when you look at Trump supporters are not just derided as stupid or ignorant. But if you'd - this new Left-wing mode is to say that they stink. We saw that with Peter Strzok.</p><p>I think Mr. Caputo from Politico said remember that they don't have any teeth. That was echoed by Rick Wilson. He call - also called them garbage people, a piece of S-H blank, an FBI agent remarked.</p><p>And so, there's this, Jim Carrey, of all, the actor, compared Trump supporters to apes that has a long - that simian synonym and metaphor has a really bad pedigree.</p><p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that anytime somebody says we're progressive, and we're enlightened, and we're not racist, that tends human nature of being what it is to give them a blank check to - to be racist, which is your point.</p><p>Remember 2008, Tucker, when Joe Biden said, do you remember that he said about Barack Obama that he was the first Black candidate who was clean, clean and was articulate. And then Harry Reid sort of echoed that and said, he didn't have a Negro dialect and he was light-skinned.</p><p>And then, Bill Clinton said, well he would have been serving his coffee. Even - even Al Sharpton tried to contextualize that because the idea, again, was these are good--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: --Progressives. They're good people. They couldn't be--</p><p>CARLSON: It's awful.</p><p>HANSON: --guilty of racism.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: That's not a window into their soul. It is with Republicans. But with Democrats and Progressives and Left is they're just inadvertent or it's allowed (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well, these are just tools they use--</p><p>HANSON: It's very dangerous to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: --to win power. And we should remember that. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: By the way, if they meant it, then the Southern Poverty Law Center wouldn't have been on a lot of this stuff. You've heard of the SPLC. It's a phony anti-hate group that exists to crush people they don't like, to tar Conservatives organizations as fellow travelers with the KKK or whatever.</p><p>Mark Krikorian is Executive Director at the Center for Immigration Studies. His group just sued the SPLC for designating them as a hate group. Finally, someone is fighting back against this. What is the basis of this lawsuit, Mark?</p><p>MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Our attorneys decided the way to go was to file a RICO lawsuit, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which is used in the criminal part by, you know, against the Mafia or whatever, by the government.</p><p>But there are civil parts where private individuals can file suit. And the basis of the claim is they are committing wire fraud, by falsely describing us as a hate group in order to do harm to my organization.</p><p>CARLSON: Has it done harm to your organization being designated (ph)?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's done some. I mean, you know, we've - we have a - a body - a reputation and a body of work that makes it hard to plausibly call us a hate group. And we've testified before Congress more than a 100 times. We've been cited in Supreme Court decision.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: We published real professors, the work of - of professors from legitimate universities. Nonetheless, it has, in fact, had an effect. One example that we mentioned in the suit, Amazon has this program where you can designate a non-profit group to get a small amount of revenue every time you buy something.</p><p>We were removed from that program. And the person who communicated that to us made the mistake of actually saying what the reason was. In print, he said, we just get our list from the SPLC.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it's just - that's what's remarkable to me. So, the SPLC is just the Praetorian Guard of the Democratic Party, obviously, fighting for the status quo, seeking to crush anyone who stands in the way of power. But they still seem to be taken seriously by media outlets, and by companies like Amazon. Why?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's good question. I'm not sure why. I mean I think there, you know, this is some - a kind of thing you see a lot in the tech industry, for instance, where they just assume that Progressive political views are just the normal political views, and anybody who doesn't hold them, somehow, is weird is, and to be shunned.</p><p>And I think that's part of what it is. You see the same thing with journalism where a lot of media simply cite the SPLC's hate group designation as just sort of a fact. You know, this person is this old. He's wearing, you know, a blue suit, and he's been designated as a, you know, hate group by the SPLC.</p><p>That's starting to change because they really have overreached, and they've gotten slapped down a couple of times. There was a Muslim reformer, a liberal Muslim--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --anti-extremist--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --they labeled him as an extremist. And he sued. They settled because they knew they were going to lose for as (ph) $3 million-plus. I don't expect them to go quite that easily in this case. But I think we have a pretty strong case.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a very strong case. And I looked at the accusations they leveled against you, because you're a guest on this show and I was interested, and they have - there's no basis for saying that about you. It was shocking. It was, I think, it's libel. But we're rooting for you, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark, thank you.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well a new report exposes Google for blacklisting certain video searches on YouTube. You can probably guess who they targeted. We've got the details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Big tech companies try to control what you see online, of course. But they also try to control what you don't see.</p><p>A new report, a shocking one, from Breitbart exposes the existence of a Google blacklist for, quote, controversial YouTube queries, questions you ask on YouTube, trying to find videos.</p><p>The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion. After receiving a complaint from a political activist posing as a reporter at Slate.com, there are a lot of those, Google intervened to bury pro-life videos on YouTube, and replace them in search with pro-abortion videos.</p><p>For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN. Well, in a statement, YouTube denied doing anything wrong and said any shifts were purely due to their algorithms which, of course, are controlled by people.</p><p>Robert Epstein has spent a lot of time looking into this question. He's a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he joins us tonight. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>You were the first person I thought of when I read this story because you have done, I think, the cutting-edge research into the effect of search - Google search, and other digital platforms on human behavior and political behavior.</p><p>So, what kind of effect could this sort of distortion have on an election?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Well, Tucker, it would have a devastating effect. And, you know, as you know, I am not a Conservative.</p><p>CARLSON: I do.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I - I - I love America. I love democracy. And I think we should all be rising above our politics here and recognize the extreme danger that we're facing when a company like Google can basically censor anything it wants to censor.</p><p>Now, this new set of leaks is extraordinary because it confirms things that I and others have been saying and writing for years. It confirms, number one that individual employees at Google have the power to manually remove material, remove content that we see. And they do so often with political ends.</p><p>And number two, this tells us that Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, committed perjury when he testified before Congress a few weeks ago, because he said quite specifically that Google never does this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean I - my frustration levels are so high, I don't want to take it out on you. But the first thought is well, why isn't he being recalled back to Congress to explain himself or face charges because you're not allowed to commit perjury.</p><p>But my question is can any of us trust that the next election won't be swayed dramatically in one direction by interference from the tech companies?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I guarantee you that this past election was affected. I'll be releasing some - some data on this, I hope, in early March that'll make the point beyond any doubt.</p><p>I also just published a piece in which I showed that just one manipulation on Google's part, on Election Day, their Go Vote reminder, that one reminder, that Go Vote reminder shifted between 800,000 and 4.6 million votes to Democratic candidates on Election Day in 2018.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why - why isn't this the hacking of our democracy? I mean how can you have a democracy under these circumstances?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, democracy is a kind of illusion at this point because we have let these companies, Google more than any other, go completely wild. There are no rules, no regulations, no laws that restrict anything they do.</p><p>And again, the more one looks at what it is they're actually doing, and these new leaks help a lot, in my opinion, the closer one looks at what they're doing, the more outraged one should become.</p><p>And I want to emphasize, we should all be outraged, not just Conservatives.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I agree. I hope that what you just said pings around the internet unimpeded and winds up in the inbox of every Member of Congress on both sides. Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My pleasure, always.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nobody covering this? It's a great question. And this question as well. Google's manipulation, the one we just told you about, why isn't that a violation of campaign finance law? The companies YouTube blacklist, for example, allegedly suppress negative videos about Maxine Waters. Why is that not an in-kind contribution to Maxine Waters?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, unlike us, is an attorney, and she joins us tonight. So, Harmeet, you just saw a guy plead to a felony because he paid off his client's girlfriend with private funds in the middle of a campaign. That was considered a campaign finance violation.</p><p>Here you have the most powerful company in the world, putting its thumb on the scale on behalf of candidates, but that's not a campaign contribution? How?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Well it is a campaign finance violation. And - and if anybody thinks that this is some sort of aberration, Google has been doing this and bragging about it internally, even in the last election.</p><p>Tucker, I think, your show has previously covered the fact that Google made what, I think, one internal person at Google, a Manager at Google called silent campaign contribution by turning out the vote and contributing turnout the vote efforts in several states that were swing states for Hillary Clinton, and specifically targeting Latino voters.</p><p>I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections.</p><p>But when a corporation does it with its corporate assets, it needs to be dis - disclosed as a campaign finance violation, declared and disclosed on the other side as a campaign finance receipt by the campaign.</p><p>Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one.</p><p>And if it isn't being disclosed as such, then that is a fraud on our democracy. And you can then imagine what they're doing vis-a-vis Donald Trump.</p><p>They're already doing it to Republicans as we - you have previously reported with regard to search engine results for Republican Women, for California Republican Party, for various other Republicans. So, I think this is, you know - you know, we all think every story is important when it comes to Google and what they do online.</p><p>But this is a particularly shocking and alarming story that we really need to see our Members of Congress, Senators and the White House wake up about this issue because otherwise we aren't going to be talking about a democracy in the next two election cycles.</p><p>We'll be talking about what it used to look like before we let Big Tech takeover and control the outcome.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't see how under these circumstances, all things being equal, Donald Trump could get re-elected. I don't. And look, I mean I think we should have a free and fair election where people's votes really matter.</p><p>But under these circumstances, we're not going to have that. I wonder why the White House wouldn't - I mean they do control the Executive Branch of government. Why they wouldn't have been awakened to that but.</p><p>DHILLON: We have seen Donald Trump actually tweet about this issue in September 2018. He tweeted about, frankly, the subject matter of today's story from Breitbart and, you know, people called him a - a conspiracy theorist that it isn't true.</p><p>And, you know, now we see the evidence that actually they are doing this manipulation, and that Sundar Pichai lied to Congress about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But - but these companies skillfully spread the money around, not just to Members of Congress, but also people working in an Administration, who are looking for their exit and thinking--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: --\"Well maybe I'll work on the other side of tech policy and make a bunch of money advising Google on how to speak Conservative--</p><p>CARLSON: Scary. Scary.</p><p>DHILLON: --to Conservatives.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: That's how it happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Vladimir Putin is a much smaller threat to the United States than Google, I would say.</p><p>DHILLON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon, thank you very much.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the country is racing at high speed toward full legalization of marijuana. Why is that exactly? And what are the effects? And what do we know about marijuana? It's uncool to ask, obviously. But being middle-aged, we're going to anyway, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Christophe Guilluy is a well-known author in France. He's written a number of books about that country's middle and working classes. He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government.</p><p>Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras.</p><p>But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar.</p><p>\"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York.</p><p>Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small-business owners outside of the big cities.</p><p>Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this.</p><p>What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else.</p><p>They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests.</p><p>Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later.</p><p>Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world.</p><p>All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too.</p><p>The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix.</p><p>The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non-urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people.</p><p>We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities.</p><p>But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people.</p><p>Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe.</p><p>The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist.</p><p>But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid.</p><p>A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order.</p><p>We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles.</p><p>Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\"</p><p>Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: DRUGGED.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well every election cycle, you probably noticed, more states legalize marijuana. It could soon be legal nationwide, likely will be. But with drug abuse of all kinds soaring and American youth falling apart, is legalization a good idea? What exactly do we know about marijuana?</p><p>David Bienenstock is the Author of How To Smoke Pot Properly and co-host of the podcast, Great Moments in Weed History. David, thank you very much for coming on. So, I guess--</p><p>DAVID BIENENSTOCK, HOW TO SMOKE POT AUTHOR, GREAT MOMENTS IN WEED HISTORY PODCAST CO-HOST: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: --the first thing I noticed, there was a really interesting piece last - this week by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker. I'm sure you read it. And it asked, and he's kind of agnostic, I think, about the question of marijuana. But he made the point that we really don't know that much about the health effects of marijuana.</p><p>Most of the claims made by its proponents are unproven. But the CDC does say that there is a relationship between marijuana use and rising schizophrenia rates and violence. So, why should we legalize something that we know causes schizophrenia?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well I mean the first thing we need to understand is cannabis is objectively safer than many substances that are legal, alcohol, tobacco--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many pharmaceutical drugs. To get to your point about the book you have--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait. I mean I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We - we - could we pause for a second? How do we know that it's safer than - than alcohol and tobacco, since I don't really think we know very much about it? I mean most drugs like we've been studying--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: OK. Well here's the-</p><p>CARLSON: --nicotine for a hundreds of years and alcohol for thousands, we don't really know that much about them. So, how do - why do we say we know that when we don't really know that?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We can compare the number of people who died from each substance every year, hundreds of thousands of people from alcohol and tobacco, and zero people from cannabis. So, you know, just as a shorthand--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Well, no that's not--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --there has never been a death--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's not actually true.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --attributed to cannabis. Absolutely, it's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? There have been many deaths attributed--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Saying something that's not true--</p><p>CARLSON: --well I'm - I'm going to. If - if it is true, as the CDC says that cannabis use looks like it causes or spurs--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose of cannabis, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: --schizophrenia - hold on, hold on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose?</p><p>CARLSON: If it causes schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: How much do you have (ph) to consume?</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. What percentage of people with schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Just answer my question.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>No, I'm saying you're looking at it wrong. If weed smoking causes schizophrenia and there's a suggestion that it does, schizophrenia kills lots of people, and so does suicide, and so does violence. And if marijuana use hikes rates of violence and it seems like there's a lot of evidence that it does, then that kills people.</p><p>So, the question is not, do they die from lung cancer. The question is do they die from suicide or violence. And those are real questions, and you don't know the answers to them. So, why are you saying it's totally safe when you - you don't know that that's true?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I - I did not say it's totally safe. That's a ridiculous--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --standard. Strenuous exercise can lead to a heart attack that's fatal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Drinking too much water can be fatal. I - I think you need to understand the difference between correlation and causation.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I do understand--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The author of the book--</p><p>CARLSON: --the difference.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --apparently, you don't.</p><p>CARLSON: No, wait, I do. And what I understand most of all is the - is the basic precept of science, which is we don't know something until we prove it. And almost nothing about marijuana--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'll tell you what I--</p><p>CARLSON: --has been proven. So, why are you acting like we know when we don't?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: This is what's proven to be harmful, Tucker.</p><p>Arresting 600,000 Americans every year for making the choice to use a substance that's objectively safer than alcohol that - and doing it in a way that targets the poor and minorities disproportionately is devastating to those communities.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're making it - but I'm not arguing but - but you're--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: It creates a police state.</p><p>CARLSON: --missing. I'm - I'm not arguing in favor of that. Well you're making a parallel argument and evading the question that I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, you don't want to arrest anybody for--</p><p>CARLSON: --that they get evading (ph) - look, I'm--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you don't want to arrest anybody for cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --always for unfair application of the law. I'm always for hassling people for things that aren't really bothering others. But that's not really the question. So, I've never been for like rousting people from their homes for smoking weed. I'm totally against that.</p><p>But that's very different from legalizing it everywhere, which increases the rate of kids smoking weed. And if it really does cause schizophrenia, I should be really afraid of that. No?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well youth use is down in the states that have legalized, first of all. And, second of all, if it's not going to be legalized - answer me this. Who's going to grow and sell this cannabis?</p><p>Where is it going to magically appear from if not through a regulated taxed industry? If my aunt in Kansas comes down with cancer, where am I going to send her to buy a safe, lab-tested, medical cannabis product to save her life in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think - I think - I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Who grows and sells the cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought it was the U.S. government grew it in Mississippi for years, as you know. I mean it's look--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not - OK, OK, look, I know, OK--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people.</p><p>CARLSON: --I get it. But it's not impossible to a man--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, who's going to--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. If there - if there are - hold on, let me finish it. If the, look, again--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --who's going to grow and sell it in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: --you're throwing another red herring into the argument and evading the question.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: That's not a red herring.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if - no, it's, look, if we use opioids legally that are prescribed by physicians, it doesn't mean the average person can buy opium.</p><p>So, you could have controlled marijuana growing for its medicinal properties, which I'm willing to believe exists. I'm just saying you're talking about legalizing it, which means many more kids will smoke it.</p><p>And if it causes schizophrenia, it should scare the hell out of us, but it doesn't seem to bother you, because, I don't know, what, you're taking money from them or something? Why doesn't that bother you?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Tucker, you know, you're the one on here repeating old lies, old distortions, debunked claims, the Author of the book that you had on last week, everything he said has been completely debunked. I don't know if you've read my article on--</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --Leafly. I assume that's why you had me on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many of the people in the studies that he cited have gone on Twitter to say, \"You grossly misrepresented our findings.\"</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well let me just ask you - look, I'm not an expert on this.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The National Academy of Medicine report the Author said you misrepresent--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm happy to--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you're not an expert. But you're supposed to do your job.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, no, I'm not - my - my job - wait hold on, wait, wait, wait a second--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: You're supposed to learn about these things. Did you read my article where I debunked all of this?</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you one - let me just end on one question. Is it - this is my real concern is schizophrenia because I think it's such a terrible disease, and we can't cure it, and a lot of people die from it. It's horrible, as you know.</p><p>Is it untrue, do you think that marijuana use looks like it could increase the rate of schizophrenia? Is that a fake statistic? It's a sincere question to you.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'd say, you know, we need to know more, and we should know more. But having you and authors come on and just--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --confuse causation and correlation--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm - I'm not confuse - I'm asking--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --does no one a good service.</p><p>CARLSON: --you a sincere question. And you don't seem to be--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I will say that. Here's my sincere answer.</p><p>CARLSON: --interested in answering it.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We've had societies where the rates of cannabis use has gone way up, and the rates of schizophrenia have not gone up at all. So, to me, that would put a lot of cold water on your idea that there is an epidemic of violence and--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I thought you were just lecturing me about causation--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --schizophrenia caused by cannabis.</p><p>CARLSON: --and correlation. But then aren't - isn't that what you're doing? OK, look, I just - look, it's an open - I - I have zero interest in banning anything. I just think that we don't know that much. I don't think you really--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well, why did you have me on if you have zero--</p><p>CARLSON: --know anything (ph) and you're pretending that you do--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --interest in debating me?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I was debating you. We're out of time. David, thank you. I appreciate your coming on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well earlier today, we told you what many are saying in Washington that fast food is racist. Maybe have a salad instead. Too bad, salads are sexist now. It's 2019. And we'll have details on that, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with, along with the Second Lady. They'll make some salads. And I said, \"You guys aren't into salads.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Or do I go out, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers?</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Big Macs?</p><p>JOAN MAUREEN WALSH, JOURNALIST, NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION, POLITICAL ANALYST AT CNN, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SALON, AUTHOR: That's appalling. It seems to me like the President will not be happy until there is not one single female Republican voter in the country. It's incredibly sexist.</p><p>We aren't all here to make salads for men. It's--</p><p>ERIN ISABELLE BURNETT, ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT ANCHOR, CNN: Yes. I mean--</p><p>WALSH: --it's disgusting.</p><p>BURNETT: How in the world do you not perceive that as sexist, to say the assumption that his wife's going to go make salads for the bunch of football players? What is she, like--</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXECUTIVE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, FORMER POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: I--</p><p>BURNETT: --the cook?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Joan Walsh, ladies and gentlemen, the single most unhappy person in the world, on CNN today, melting down because the President joked about salads. Salads are now sexist. Fast food is racist. What are you allowed to eat?</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey, a brilliant unraveller of riddles and a podcast host, joins us tonight to sort it out. Thank you for coming on.</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: Yes, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Sexist salads.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes, apparently. So, I mean she was really upset over this. The first reaction she had was not to roll her eyes but to say that this was appalling.</p><p>I mean you just have to wonder what goes on in someone like Jo's - Joan's mind. In the middle of the night, is she tossing and turning, thinking about all of the ways that she can be offended.</p><p>CARLSON: But also, why wouldn't the rest of the country take life advice from someone whose own life has clearly been a disaster and--</p><p>STUCKEY: I mean well, maybe - maybe - but maybe--</p><p>CARLSON: --who is so deeply unhappy.</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes, exactly. Maybe this is why her life is such a disaster because she is hunting for something to hurt her feelings. And she's found it. She's found it in salad.</p><p>But also, I want to say that Melania probably does make salad, so this probably had nothing to do with her sex, whatsoever. She looks like someone who makes a good salad. So, that probably was all the comment at best (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She looks like a salad eater.</p><p>STUCKEY: She does.</p><p>CARLSON: And I say that as someone who should be eating salads--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --but is not. Right, that's not a--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly. Details (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not a slur. I wonder though, in the end if the best way to get people to see your way of thinking, to bring them to your side, is to scream at them for telling jokes.</p><p>STUCKEY: Probably not. But I don't think they're interested in that, not with Conservatives, and certainly not with President Trump. They just kind of repeat this thing over and over again. It's racist, sexist, whatever it is, whatever they can find in today, the poor victim was salad.</p><p>CARLSON: How long before people say, \"You know what? I - I don't really care what you call me anymore.\"</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I think that's already happening.</p><p>CARLSON: It's already happened?</p><p>STUCKEY: Don't you think Trump has already done that? I do.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know about Trump. I've definitely reached that point and this is all fake.</p><p>STUCKEY: That's good (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Allie, it's great to see you. Welcome to Washington.</p><p>STUCKEY: It's great to see you as well. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You've improved the tenor of the city by your presence.</p><p>All right, we're out of time sadly. Tomorrow night, 8:00 P.M., we'll be back, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Needless to say, DVR it if you can figure that out. I can't, but you're probably smarter.</p><p>Good night from Washington. And tonight, with looks like about 18 seconds to go, we're going to give a delayed Christmas present to our pal, Sean Hannity--</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: I--</p><p>CARLSON: --in New York.</p><p>HANNITY: --I think you made up for all of last year, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Use the time wisely, Sean.

We're going to take a night here. Lots of emails coming in. Keep them coming. That's the story for tonight. Tucker Carlson, up next live in D.C.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are.</p><p>Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember.</p><p>Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office.</p><p>So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR 16TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, TEXAS: Will fight when necessary against a President who's focused on building walls.</p><p>No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns.</p><p>Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem.</p><p>We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever!</p><p>Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram.</p><p>But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people.</p><p>O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls.</p><p>As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\"</p><p>Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions.</p><p>The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it.</p><p>When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat.</p><p>Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind.</p><p>Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper.</p><p>Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?</p><p>And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial.</p><p>Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country?</p><p>A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it.</p><p>Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that.</p><p>So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?</p><p>NATE LERNER, CO-FOUNDER, DRAFTBETO.ORG: Right. Right, so on the - on the surface and taken out of context, that certainly sounds bad. But what he's actually talking about is a--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, different.</p><p>LERNER: --is a very common approach to Constitutional law. Constitutional scholars for centuries have debated if the Constitution should be taken literally and at word or if it's a living breathing document that we--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LERNER: --should interpret as things change.</p><p>And guess what? Our country has changed and the world has changed quite a bit in the last 200-plus years. And what Beto was saying is that perhaps we need to re-visit parts of the Constitution as a result. That's - that's a very common discussion that--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look--</p><p>LERNER: --that scholars would have.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm open-minded. And, by the way, there are things in the Constitution, you know, I - I think we should always have conversations about everything--</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --that we disagree with. But what specifically is he talking about? I think it's also fair to ask, what principles need to be revised.</p><p>LERNER: You know, I - I'm not a spokesperson for Beto or for his campaign. But, you know, I do understand what he's saying as far as needing to re-visit parts of the Constitution. I think the Electoral College is a really good example where you are empowering some voters more so than others, and giving them more of a voice than others.</p><p>And that's - that's really unfair and not what our democracy's about. That's a very good example right there.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what - what does that mean? Look, obviously, we're for fairness. There's a lot of unfairness. I agree with that, for sure, and we should work as hard as we can to rectify it. But just give me one example of the principles that might be changed under a Beto O'Rourke presidency?</p><p>LERNER: I - I do not speak for Beto or - or for his campaign. So I can't--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --I can't do that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. That's totally fair enough. So, he was asked about the Border wall and he said, and I'm paraphrasing, but it's pretty close, \"We are killing people when we build Border walls.\" What is that - how are we - how are we killing people? How have we killed people by doing that?</p><p>LERNER: So, in the context of what he was talking about, he was making two points. One, if we - if when we militarize our border with Mexico, you're increasing the risk that people are going to get hurt or killed when they cross the border in their encounters with our - with our security forces and their side.</p><p>And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous.</p><p>And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people.</p><p>So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders. Democrats aren't for that despite what's often said here.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are.</p><p>LERNER: They're not.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but then - but hold on let's--</p><p>LERNER: They're for - they're for (ph) treating people like humans and treating--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Look, I--</p><p>LERNER: --them is the seaming (ph) way.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. So but, Mexico had over 31,000 murders last year. That's about twice the number we had in the country as a population less than half of ours. So, it's one of the most dangerous countries in the world. And so, it's fair to be concerned about that violence moving north. Any normal country--</p><p>LERNER: Well but it's also fair--</p><p>CARLSON: --would be concerned.</p><p>LERNER: --to understand that people might want to be fleeing that violence that have, you know, for their families' sake--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Because that's - that - that's true.</p><p>LERNER: --and to build up life (ph) here.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean the - the rights and the interests of Americans come first from the perspective of the U.S. government. That's why we have the government to protect--</p><p>LERNER: 100 percent, absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --our rights (ph). So, explain to me, and you can speak slowly if you want, how we are forcing people to come across our border illegally. How are we forcing people to come across? I - I don't understand that.</p><p>LERNER: We're not - we're not forcing people. It's just that we should be treating them in a humane and civil way because they are humans. And despite the way they have been described by Donald Trump and Republicans, you know, they're - they're not - they're not criminals. They're not rapists. They're not all drug dealers.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Many of them are just coming here to seek better lives.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I've - I've always--</p><p>LERNER: And we need to respect and--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, but, but I--</p><p>LERNER: --appreciate that.</p><p>CARLSON: --I totally - but I've never doubted that. And some are bad people. Most are just economic migrants who want to move to a richer country.</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: I get it. I would, as I said many times on this show, I would leave Honduras too, and I would come here illegally if I could. And I mean it. I'm not joking. So, I get it. But I'm not from Honduras. I'm from America. And I don't want people driving - driving down wages in this country.</p><p>So, don't we have a right to say, \"No, you can't come in unless we want you to come in?\"</p><p>LERNER: We absolutely have a right to - to do that. However, as Americans, we also have a duty to treat them a certain way and to respect their humanity and respect them as individuals, and not simply cast them aside.</p><p>And so, when you're - when you're looking at border security, there is a certain way that you should be treating people, and it's not forcing them to, you know, it's not - it's not putting them at a - a massive risk and potentially killing them--</p><p>CARLSON: But how are we putting--</p><p>LERNER: --instead of responding (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --wait but how - how are - if - if we erect a wall and say, you can't cross, that's the same as killing them?</p><p>LERNER: Putting up a wall does put them in greater danger because it forces them to find different points of entry. And a wall is just a massive - it's just - it's not - it doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't solve the main problem of immigration, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --longer visa, which is we--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK, so, so, so I'm--</p><p>LERNER: --people are overstaying their visas. If people can (ph) just throw a--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm glad - I'm glad you're putting that. No, no--</p><p>LERNER: --rope over a wall, there's tunnels that they can use.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's totally fair. That's - that's a talking point, but it's also real, so I'm glad you mentioned it.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And, in fact, Mr. O'Rourke was - was asked it too by Jeff Bezos' newspaper, and his quote was, \"I don't know.\" Now, how could he not know? He represents Texas. He's been asked of immigration for years, and he hasn't thought through visa overstays, which, as you point out, are a driver of our crisis. How could you not have an answer to that?</p><p>LERNER: So, again, I - I - so, again, out of context, that sounds bad. But what he said after that was that he would work with the people who it's affected by, work with policymakers, work with experts, work with people on the ground who deal with this every day to find a solution.</p><p>And actually, I think it's very refreshing that a politician was willing to say, \"I don't know,\" because if you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's sure.</p><p>LERNER: --where immigration reform has gone in the last 20 years, which is nowhere, I think a lot of politicians actually don't know. They have no idea what a solution is because we haven't found one. And so, what he's saying is we need to have a debate. We need to talk it over.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, look, I'm totally for that.</p><p>LERNER: Find a solution.</p><p>CARLSON: And I - and actually do agree with you.</p><p>LERNER: Right. So, sounds like you support him there.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I support being honest about not knowing. I just think--</p><p>LERNER: He's - he's just (ph) being honest.</p><p>CARLSON: --he should like try a little harder. But let me ask you something that I don't know the answer to and I'm not being mean. I'm being sincere.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Here you had in the last election an Irish Catholic guy with a Hispanic nickname running against an actual Hispanic guy with an Anglo name. Would that seem a little weird to you, a little audacious maybe?</p><p>LERNER: You know, Ted Cruz tried to make that point as well, and Texans got over it pretty quickly.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a real point.</p><p>LERNER: It's not - it's not a real point. It's - it's - the point is moot. You know, it's - it's something that - it's something to joke about for a minute. It was his - his nickname.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: It's his nickname growing up. It's I guess people call Ted, you know, Ted Cruz, Ted, his higher enough (ph) as well. And it's - it's not - it's not something people care about. People care about real issues.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know. Well, I asked about real issues and I ended it with, as you pointed out, joking about it for a second, which I didn't have (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Very fair.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate your coming on Nate. Thank you very much.</p><p>LERNER: Of course, anytime.</p><p>CARLSON: Well from The View to all the dumb people on television, what you're hearing this week, and it really is a talking point of the week, is that everybody who's not a Democrat is by nature a bigot. It's what they're telling you.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson responds to that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well if you've watched TV this week, you have heard this week's talking point. Republicans and the people who vote for them are bigots, every one of them. The geniuses over at The View, the daytime TV show, suggested that almost half the country's just flat-out immoral, and should be shunned on those grounds. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: But will Republicans now step up to the plate with Donald Trump because he has been using, I think, the Border wall as sort of this dog whistle for racism. The government is still shut down, and I think it's all about, \"Let's not let all these Brown people in.\"</p><p>ABIGAIL HAIGHT HUNTSMAN, TELEVISION PERSONALITY, THE VIEW CO-HOST, ABC: There's 42 percent of this country that support the wall.

I don't - I don't think so.</p><p>HOSTIN: --that's a good question.</p><p>HUNTSMAN: I don't think so.

It's The View. You can write it off like what do they know. But it wasn't just The View. Nicole Wallace had a real job at one point. She was White House Communications Director briefly, I think, under last Republican Administration. Here's her view.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ANCHOR, CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC AND NBC NEWS: This does not have a parallel on the Left. They're just - they're just - it - it doesn't. There isn't. There isn't a strain of racism on the Left.</p><p>I don't so - so, I think that - that this gets brushed under the rug. People sort of tolerate - it's been normalized. Like you just said, they don't have anywhere else to go, so they attach to the Republican Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. No racists on the Left, literally not one, says Nicole Wallace.</p><p>Over in ESPN, one of their hosts suggested it was racist, not surprisingly, for the President to serve the Clemson Football Team fast food at the White House. Fast food is the food of bigots. Of course.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOLLY QERIM ROSE, SPORTS ANCHOR AND MODERATOR, ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: When I saw him giving the football players, it's - it's a predominantly Black sport, and fast food, my thought went - went a very different place. Also a - a bunch of--</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, BOXING COMMENTATOR, CO-HOST OF ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: I think the - I think the President likes fast food.</p><p>ROSE: --a bunch of--</p><p>STEPHEN ANTHONY SMITH, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, SPORTS RADIO HOST, SPORTS JOURNALIST, ACTOR, ESPN FIRST TAKE COMMENTATOR: Yes.</p><p>ROSE: --Macs (ph). I mean come on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. OK. So, the consensus is the racism is on the Right. Only Conservatives can be racist. So that raises a few questions.</p><p>What exactly is racism? What does it look like? How'd if - you know if you are racist. And so, we have a handily checklist for you. Get a pen and follow along. See if you can answer these questions.</p><p>A racist - what would a racist do? A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done.</p><p>They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes.</p><p>They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right?</p><p>People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do.</p><p>Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>You know what I noticed, Professor Hanson, and maybe I'm just making this up in my head, but it seems like people have a tendency to accuse others of doing the exact thing that they are doing. Have you noticed that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I think it's really dangerous throughout history when you have a group that sets themselves up as the arbiters of morality.</p><p>We saw that with the Catholic Church and the abuse problems. We saw that in the #MeToo and the Hollywood liberals like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey.</p><p>They feel that they're not subject to the same standards they demand of others. And what's going on here is that if I think that Representative King confused Western civilization with White and - Whiteness, and they're not synonymous, especially in the global world.</p><p>Japan can be more Western than - than Russia. But the point is--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's just interesting that if you--</p><p>HANSON: --we got to find out what the rules are, Tucker because while--</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's what I mean--</p><p>HANSON: --we're condemning him, we have Hank Johnson, another Member of the Congress, who recently said, compared Jews in Israel to termites.</p><p>And then we've got the Editor Board - a person on the Editorial Board in the New York Times, Sarah Jeong, who said, literally (ph), I hate White people, and compared them to dogs urinating on hydrants. The New York Times was not upset.</p><p>Then we've got this whole trope now in - in rap music, all the major marquee rappers, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Scarface, it's just rampant anti-Semitism. And we saw LeBron James, our national icon, re-tweeting an anti-Semitic tweet and with no - of a rapper with no consequences.</p><p>So, the American people are saying to themselves, \"Wow! What are the rules?\" And when you look at Trump supporters are not just derided as stupid or ignorant. But if you'd - this new Left-wing mode is to say that they stink. We saw that with Peter Strzok.</p><p>I think Mr. Caputo from Politico said remember that they don't have any teeth. That was echoed by Rick Wilson. He call - also called them garbage people, a piece of S-H blank, an FBI agent remarked.</p><p>And so, there's this, Jim Carrey, of all, the actor, compared Trump supporters to apes that has a long - that simian synonym and metaphor has a really bad pedigree.</p><p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that anytime somebody says we're progressive, and we're enlightened, and we're not racist, that tends human nature of being what it is to give them a blank check to - to be racist, which is your point.</p><p>Remember 2008, Tucker, when Joe Biden said, do you remember that he said about Barack Obama that he was the first Black candidate who was clean, clean and was articulate. And then Harry Reid sort of echoed that and said, he didn't have a Negro dialect and he was light-skinned.</p><p>And then, Bill Clinton said, well he would have been serving his coffee. Even - even Al Sharpton tried to contextualize that because the idea, again, was these are good--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: --Progressives. They're good people. They couldn't be--</p><p>CARLSON: It's awful.</p><p>HANSON: --guilty of racism.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: That's not a window into their soul. It is with Republicans. But with Democrats and Progressives and Left is they're just inadvertent or it's allowed (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well, these are just tools they use--</p><p>HANSON: It's very dangerous to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: --to win power. And we should remember that. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: By the way, if they meant it, then the Southern Poverty Law Center wouldn't have been on a lot of this stuff. You've heard of the SPLC. It's a phony anti-hate group that exists to crush people they don't like, to tar Conservatives organizations as fellow travelers with the KKK or whatever.</p><p>Mark Krikorian is Executive Director at the Center for Immigration Studies. His group just sued the SPLC for designating them as a hate group. Finally, someone is fighting back against this. What is the basis of this lawsuit, Mark?</p><p>MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Our attorneys decided the way to go was to file a RICO lawsuit, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which is used in the criminal part by, you know, against the Mafia or whatever, by the government.</p><p>But there are civil parts where private individuals can file suit. And the basis of the claim is they are committing wire fraud, by falsely describing us as a hate group in order to do harm to my organization.</p><p>CARLSON: Has it done harm to your organization being designated (ph)?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's done some. I mean, you know, we've - we have a - a body - a reputation and a body of work that makes it hard to plausibly call us a hate group. And we've testified before Congress more than a 100 times. We've been cited in Supreme Court decision.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: We published real professors, the work of - of professors from legitimate universities. Nonetheless, it has, in fact, had an effect. One example that we mentioned in the suit, Amazon has this program where you can designate a non-profit group to get a small amount of revenue every time you buy something.</p><p>We were removed from that program. And the person who communicated that to us made the mistake of actually saying what the reason was. In print, he said, we just get our list from the SPLC.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it's just - that's what's remarkable to me. So, the SPLC is just the Praetorian Guard of the Democratic Party, obviously, fighting for the status quo, seeking to crush anyone who stands in the way of power. But they still seem to be taken seriously by media outlets, and by companies like Amazon. Why?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's good question. I'm not sure why. I mean I think there, you know, this is some - a kind of thing you see a lot in the tech industry, for instance, where they just assume that Progressive political views are just the normal political views, and anybody who doesn't hold them, somehow, is weird is, and to be shunned.</p><p>And I think that's part of what it is. You see the same thing with journalism where a lot of media simply cite the SPLC's hate group designation as just sort of a fact. You know, this person is this old. He's wearing, you know, a blue suit, and he's been designated as a, you know, hate group by the SPLC.</p><p>That's starting to change because they really have overreached, and they've gotten slapped down a couple of times. There was a Muslim reformer, a liberal Muslim--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --anti-extremist--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --they labeled him as an extremist. And he sued. They settled because they knew they were going to lose for as (ph) $3 million-plus. I don't expect them to go quite that easily in this case. But I think we have a pretty strong case.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a very strong case. And I looked at the accusations they leveled against you, because you're a guest on this show and I was interested, and they have - there's no basis for saying that about you. It was shocking. It was, I think, it's libel. But we're rooting for you, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark, thank you.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well a new report exposes Google for blacklisting certain video searches on YouTube. You can probably guess who they targeted. We've got the details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Big tech companies try to control what you see online, of course. But they also try to control what you don't see.</p><p>A new report, a shocking one, from Breitbart exposes the existence of a Google blacklist for, quote, controversial YouTube queries, questions you ask on YouTube, trying to find videos.</p><p>The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion. After receiving a complaint from a political activist posing as a reporter at Slate.com, there are a lot of those, Google intervened to bury pro-life videos on YouTube, and replace them in search with pro-abortion videos.</p><p>For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN. Well, in a statement, YouTube denied doing anything wrong and said any shifts were purely due to their algorithms which, of course, are controlled by people.</p><p>Robert Epstein has spent a lot of time looking into this question. He's a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he joins us tonight. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>You were the first person I thought of when I read this story because you have done, I think, the cutting-edge research into the effect of search - Google search, and other digital platforms on human behavior and political behavior.</p><p>So, what kind of effect could this sort of distortion have on an election?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Well, Tucker, it would have a devastating effect. And, you know, as you know, I am not a Conservative.</p><p>CARLSON: I do.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I - I - I love America. I love democracy. And I think we should all be rising above our politics here and recognize the extreme danger that we're facing when a company like Google can basically censor anything it wants to censor.</p><p>Now, this new set of leaks is extraordinary because it confirms things that I and others have been saying and writing for years. It confirms, number one that individual employees at Google have the power to manually remove material, remove content that we see. And they do so often with political ends.</p><p>And number two, this tells us that Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, committed perjury when he testified before Congress a few weeks ago, because he said quite specifically that Google never does this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean I - my frustration levels are so high, I don't want to take it out on you. But the first thought is well, why isn't he being recalled back to Congress to explain himself or face charges because you're not allowed to commit perjury.</p><p>But my question is can any of us trust that the next election won't be swayed dramatically in one direction by interference from the tech companies?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I guarantee you that this past election was affected. I'll be releasing some - some data on this, I hope, in early March that'll make the point beyond any doubt.</p><p>I also just published a piece in which I showed that just one manipulation on Google's part, on Election Day, their Go Vote reminder, that one reminder, that Go Vote reminder shifted between 800,000 and 4.6 million votes to Democratic candidates on Election Day in 2018.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why - why isn't this the hacking of our democracy? I mean how can you have a democracy under these circumstances?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, democracy is a kind of illusion at this point because we have let these companies, Google more than any other, go completely wild. There are no rules, no regulations, no laws that restrict anything they do.</p><p>And again, the more one looks at what it is they're actually doing, and these new leaks help a lot, in my opinion, the closer one looks at what they're doing, the more outraged one should become.</p><p>And I want to emphasize, we should all be outraged, not just Conservatives.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I agree. I hope that what you just said pings around the internet unimpeded and winds up in the inbox of every Member of Congress on both sides. Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My pleasure, always.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nobody covering this? It's a great question. And this question as well. Google's manipulation, the one we just told you about, why isn't that a violation of campaign finance law? The companies YouTube blacklist, for example, allegedly suppress negative videos about Maxine Waters. Why is that not an in-kind contribution to Maxine Waters?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, unlike us, is an attorney, and she joins us tonight. So, Harmeet, you just saw a guy plead to a felony because he paid off his client's girlfriend with private funds in the middle of a campaign. That was considered a campaign finance violation.</p><p>Here you have the most powerful company in the world, putting its thumb on the scale on behalf of candidates, but that's not a campaign contribution? How?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Well it is a campaign finance violation. And - and if anybody thinks that this is some sort of aberration, Google has been doing this and bragging about it internally, even in the last election.</p><p>Tucker, I think, your show has previously covered the fact that Google made what, I think, one internal person at Google, a Manager at Google called silent campaign contribution by turning out the vote and contributing turnout the vote efforts in several states that were swing states for Hillary Clinton, and specifically targeting Latino voters.</p><p>I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections.</p><p>But when a corporation does it with its corporate assets, it needs to be dis - disclosed as a campaign finance violation, declared and disclosed on the other side as a campaign finance receipt by the campaign.</p><p>Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one.</p><p>And if it isn't being disclosed as such, then that is a fraud on our democracy. And you can then imagine what they're doing vis-a-vis Donald Trump.</p><p>They're already doing it to Republicans as we - you have previously reported with regard to search engine results for Republican Women, for California Republican Party, for various other Republicans. So, I think this is, you know - you know, we all think every story is important when it comes to Google and what they do online.</p><p>But this is a particularly shocking and alarming story that we really need to see our Members of Congress, Senators and the White House wake up about this issue because otherwise we aren't going to be talking about a democracy in the next two election cycles.</p><p>We'll be talking about what it used to look like before we let Big Tech takeover and control the outcome.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't see how under these circumstances, all things being equal, Donald Trump could get re-elected. I don't. And look, I mean I think we should have a free and fair election where people's votes really matter.</p><p>But under these circumstances, we're not going to have that. I wonder why the White House wouldn't - I mean they do control the Executive Branch of government. Why they wouldn't have been awakened to that but.</p><p>DHILLON: We have seen Donald Trump actually tweet about this issue in September 2018. He tweeted about, frankly, the subject matter of today's story from Breitbart and, you know, people called him a - a conspiracy theorist that it isn't true.</p><p>And, you know, now we see the evidence that actually they are doing this manipulation, and that Sundar Pichai lied to Congress about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But - but these companies skillfully spread the money around, not just to Members of Congress, but also people working in an Administration, who are looking for their exit and thinking--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: --\"Well maybe I'll work on the other side of tech policy and make a bunch of money advising Google on how to speak Conservative--</p><p>CARLSON: Scary. Scary.</p><p>DHILLON: --to Conservatives.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: That's how it happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Vladimir Putin is a much smaller threat to the United States than Google, I would say.</p><p>DHILLON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon, thank you very much.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the country is racing at high speed toward full legalization of marijuana. Why is that exactly? And what are the effects? And what do we know about marijuana? It's uncool to ask, obviously. But being middle-aged, we're going to anyway, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Christophe Guilluy is a well-known author in France. He's written a number of books about that country's middle and working classes. He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government.</p><p>Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras.</p><p>But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar.</p><p>\"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York.</p><p>Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small-business owners outside of the big cities.</p><p>Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this.</p><p>What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else.</p><p>They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests.</p><p>Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later.</p><p>Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world.</p><p>All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too.</p><p>The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix.</p><p>The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non-urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people.</p><p>We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities.</p><p>But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people.</p><p>Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe.</p><p>The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist.</p><p>But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid.</p><p>A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order.</p><p>We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles.</p><p>Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\"</p><p>Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: DRUGGED.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well every election cycle, you probably noticed, more states legalize marijuana. It could soon be legal nationwide, likely will be. But with drug abuse of all kinds soaring and American youth falling apart, is legalization a good idea? What exactly do we know about marijuana?</p><p>David Bienenstock is the Author of How To Smoke Pot Properly and co-host of the podcast, Great Moments in Weed History. David, thank you very much for coming on. So, I guess--</p><p>DAVID BIENENSTOCK, HOW TO SMOKE POT AUTHOR, GREAT MOMENTS IN WEED HISTORY PODCAST CO-HOST: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: --the first thing I noticed, there was a really interesting piece last - this week by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker. I'm sure you read it. And it asked, and he's kind of agnostic, I think, about the question of marijuana. But he made the point that we really don't know that much about the health effects of marijuana.</p><p>Most of the claims made by its proponents are unproven. But the CDC does say that there is a relationship between marijuana use and rising schizophrenia rates and violence. So, why should we legalize something that we know causes schizophrenia?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well I mean the first thing we need to understand is cannabis is objectively safer than many substances that are legal, alcohol, tobacco--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many pharmaceutical drugs. To get to your point about the book you have--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait. I mean I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We - we - could we pause for a second? How do we know that it's safer than - than alcohol and tobacco, since I don't really think we know very much about it? I mean most drugs like we've been studying--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: OK. Well here's the-</p><p>CARLSON: --nicotine for a hundreds of years and alcohol for thousands, we don't really know that much about them. So, how do - why do we say we know that when we don't really know that?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We can compare the number of people who died from each substance every year, hundreds of thousands of people from alcohol and tobacco, and zero people from cannabis. So, you know, just as a shorthand--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Well, no that's not--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --there has never been a death--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's not actually true.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --attributed to cannabis. Absolutely, it's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? There have been many deaths attributed--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Saying something that's not true--</p><p>CARLSON: --well I'm - I'm going to. If - if it is true, as the CDC says that cannabis use looks like it causes or spurs--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose of cannabis, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: --schizophrenia - hold on, hold on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose?</p><p>CARLSON: If it causes schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: How much do you have (ph) to consume?</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. What percentage of people with schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Just answer my question.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>No, I'm saying you're looking at it wrong. If weed smoking causes schizophrenia and there's a suggestion that it does, schizophrenia kills lots of people, and so does suicide, and so does violence. And if marijuana use hikes rates of violence and it seems like there's a lot of evidence that it does, then that kills people.</p><p>So, the question is not, do they die from lung cancer. The question is do they die from suicide or violence. And those are real questions, and you don't know the answers to them. So, why are you saying it's totally safe when you - you don't know that that's true?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I - I did not say it's totally safe. That's a ridiculous--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --standard. Strenuous exercise can lead to a heart attack that's fatal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Drinking too much water can be fatal. I - I think you need to understand the difference between correlation and causation.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I do understand--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The author of the book--</p><p>CARLSON: --the difference.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --apparently, you don't.</p><p>CARLSON: No, wait, I do. And what I understand most of all is the - is the basic precept of science, which is we don't know something until we prove it. And almost nothing about marijuana--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'll tell you what I--</p><p>CARLSON: --has been proven. So, why are you acting like we know when we don't?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: This is what's proven to be harmful, Tucker.</p><p>Arresting 600,000 Americans every year for making the choice to use a substance that's objectively safer than alcohol that - and doing it in a way that targets the poor and minorities disproportionately is devastating to those communities.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're making it - but I'm not arguing but - but you're--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: It creates a police state.</p><p>CARLSON: --missing. I'm - I'm not arguing in favor of that. Well you're making a parallel argument and evading the question that I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, you don't want to arrest anybody for--</p><p>CARLSON: --that they get evading (ph) - look, I'm--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you don't want to arrest anybody for cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --always for unfair application of the law. I'm always for hassling people for things that aren't really bothering others. But that's not really the question. So, I've never been for like rousting people from their homes for smoking weed. I'm totally against that.</p><p>But that's very different from legalizing it everywhere, which increases the rate of kids smoking weed. And if it really does cause schizophrenia, I should be really afraid of that. No?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well youth use is down in the states that have legalized, first of all. And, second of all, if it's not going to be legalized - answer me this. Who's going to grow and sell this cannabis?</p><p>Where is it going to magically appear from if not through a regulated taxed industry? If my aunt in Kansas comes down with cancer, where am I going to send her to buy a safe, lab-tested, medical cannabis product to save her life in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think - I think - I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Who grows and sells the cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought it was the U.S. government grew it in Mississippi for years, as you know. I mean it's look--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not - OK, OK, look, I know, OK--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people.</p><p>CARLSON: --I get it. But it's not impossible to a man--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, who's going to--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. If there - if there are - hold on, let me finish it. If the, look, again--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --who's going to grow and sell it in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: --you're throwing another red herring into the argument and evading the question.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: That's not a red herring.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if - no, it's, look, if we use opioids legally that are prescribed by physicians, it doesn't mean the average person can buy opium.</p><p>So, you could have controlled marijuana growing for its medicinal properties, which I'm willing to believe exists. I'm just saying you're talking about legalizing it, which means many more kids will smoke it.</p><p>And if it causes schizophrenia, it should scare the hell out of us, but it doesn't seem to bother you, because, I don't know, what, you're taking money from them or something? Why doesn't that bother you?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Tucker, you know, you're the one on here repeating old lies, old distortions, debunked claims, the Author of the book that you had on last week, everything he said has been completely debunked. I don't know if you've read my article on--</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --Leafly. I assume that's why you had me on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many of the people in the studies that he cited have gone on Twitter to say, \"You grossly misrepresented our findings.\"</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well let me just ask you - look, I'm not an expert on this.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The National Academy of Medicine report the Author said you misrepresent--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm happy to--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you're not an expert. But you're supposed to do your job.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, no, I'm not - my - my job - wait hold on, wait, wait, wait a second--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: You're supposed to learn about these things. Did you read my article where I debunked all of this?</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you one - let me just end on one question. Is it - this is my real concern is schizophrenia because I think it's such a terrible disease, and we can't cure it, and a lot of people die from it. It's horrible, as you know.</p><p>Is it untrue, do you think that marijuana use looks like it could increase the rate of schizophrenia? Is that a fake statistic? It's a sincere question to you.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'd say, you know, we need to know more, and we should know more. But having you and authors come on and just--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --confuse causation and correlation--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm - I'm not confuse - I'm asking--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --does no one a good service.</p><p>CARLSON: --you a sincere question. And you don't seem to be--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I will say that. Here's my sincere answer.</p><p>CARLSON: --interested in answering it.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We've had societies where the rates of cannabis use has gone way up, and the rates of schizophrenia have not gone up at all. So, to me, that would put a lot of cold water on your idea that there is an epidemic of violence and--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I thought you were just lecturing me about causation--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --schizophrenia caused by cannabis.</p><p>CARLSON: --and correlation. But then aren't - isn't that what you're doing? OK, look, I just - look, it's an open - I - I have zero interest in banning anything. I just think that we don't know that much. I don't think you really--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well, why did you have me on if you have zero--</p><p>CARLSON: --know anything (ph) and you're pretending that you do--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --interest in debating me?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I was debating you. We're out of time. David, thank you. I appreciate your coming on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well earlier today, we told you what many are saying in Washington that fast food is racist. Maybe have a salad instead. Too bad, salads are sexist now. It's 2019. And we'll have details on that, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with, along with the Second Lady. They'll make some salads. And I said, \"You guys aren't into salads.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Or do I go out, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers?</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Big Macs?</p><p>JOAN MAUREEN WALSH, JOURNALIST, NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION, POLITICAL ANALYST AT CNN, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SALON, AUTHOR: That's appalling. It seems to me like the President will not be happy until there is not one single female Republican voter in the country. It's incredibly sexist.</p><p>We aren't all here to make salads for men. It's--</p><p>ERIN ISABELLE BURNETT, ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT ANCHOR, CNN: Yes. I mean--</p><p>WALSH: --it's disgusting.</p><p>BURNETT: How in the world do you not perceive that as sexist, to say the assumption that his wife's going to go make salads for the bunch of football players? What is she, like--</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXECUTIVE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, FORMER POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: I--</p><p>BURNETT: --the cook?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Joan Walsh, ladies and gentlemen, the single most unhappy person in the world, on CNN today, melting down because the President joked about salads. Salads are now sexist. Fast food is racist. What are you allowed to eat?</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey, a brilliant unraveller of riddles and a podcast host, joins us tonight to sort it out. Thank you for coming on.</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: Yes, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Sexist salads.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes, apparently. So, I mean she was really upset over this. The first reaction she had was not to roll her eyes but to say that this was appalling.</p><p>I mean you just have to wonder what goes on in someone like Jo's - Joan's mind. In the middle of the night, is she tossing and turning, thinking about all of the ways that she can be offended.</p><p>CARLSON: But also, why wouldn't the rest of the country take life advice from someone whose own life has clearly been a disaster and--</p><p>STUCKEY: I mean well, maybe - maybe - but maybe--</p><p>CARLSON: --who is so deeply unhappy.</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes, exactly. Maybe this is why her life is such a disaster because she is hunting for something to hurt her feelings. And she's found it. She's found it in salad.</p><p>But also, I want to say that Melania probably does make salad, so this probably had nothing to do with her sex, whatsoever. She looks like someone who makes a good salad. So, that probably was all the comment at best (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She looks like a salad eater.</p><p>STUCKEY: She does.</p><p>CARLSON: And I say that as someone who should be eating salads--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --but is not. Right, that's not a--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly. Details (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not a slur. I wonder though, in the end if the best way to get people to see your way of thinking, to bring them to your side, is to scream at them for telling jokes.</p><p>STUCKEY: Probably not. But I don't think they're interested in that, not with Conservatives, and certainly not with President Trump. They just kind of repeat this thing over and over again. It's racist, sexist, whatever it is, whatever they can find in today, the poor victim was salad.</p><p>CARLSON: How long before people say, \"You know what? I - I don't really care what you call me anymore.\"</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I think that's already happening.</p><p>CARLSON: It's already happened?</p><p>STUCKEY: Don't you think Trump has already done that? I do.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know about Trump. I've definitely reached that point and this is all fake.</p><p>STUCKEY: That's good (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Allie, it's great to see you. Welcome to Washington.</p><p>STUCKEY: It's great to see you as well. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You've improved the tenor of the city by your presence.</p><p>All right, we're out of time sadly. Tomorrow night, 8:00 P.M., we'll be back, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Needless to say, DVR it if you can figure that out. I can't, but you're probably smarter.</p><p>Good night from Washington. And tonight, with looks like about 18 seconds to go, we're going to give a delayed Christmas present to our pal, Sean Hannity--</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: I--</p><p>CARLSON: --in New York.</p><p>HANNITY: --I think you made up for all of last year, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Use the time wisely, Sean. It's yours.</p><p>HANNITY: We're going to - we're going to give you the radio show. You can host my show one day. And it's going to be hitting the post. I'll teach - I'll - we'll tell you about it.</p><p>CARLSON: No way, I'm in (ph).</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, great show as always.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2167820050</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V73-6FN1-DY0W-42Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Tucker Carlson, up next live in D.C.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are.</p><p>Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember.</p><p>Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office.</p><p>So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR 16TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, TEXAS: Will fight when necessary against a President who's focused on building walls.</p><p>No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns.</p><p>Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem.</p><p>We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever!</p><p>Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram.</p><p>But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people.</p><p>O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls.</p><p>As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\"</p><p>Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions.</p><p>The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it.</p><p>When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat.</p><p>Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind.</p><p>Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper.</p><p>Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?</p><p>And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial.</p><p>Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country?</p><p>A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it.</p><p>Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that.</p><p>So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?</p><p>NATE LERNER, CO-FOUNDER, DRAFTBETO.ORG: Right. Right, so on the - on the surface and taken out of context, that certainly sounds bad. But what he's actually talking about is a--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, different.</p><p>LERNER: --is a very common approach to Constitutional law. Constitutional scholars for centuries have debated if the Constitution should be taken literally and at word or if it's a living breathing document that we--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LERNER: --should interpret as things change.</p><p>And guess what? Our country has changed and the world has changed quite a bit in the last 200-plus years. And what Beto was saying is that perhaps we need to re-visit parts of the Constitution as a result. That's - that's a very common discussion that--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look--</p><p>LERNER: --that scholars would have.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm open-minded. And, by the way, there are things in the Constitution, you know, I - I think we should always have conversations about everything--</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --that we disagree with. But what specifically is he talking about? I think it's also fair to ask, what principles need to be revised.</p><p>LERNER: You know, I - I'm not a spokesperson for Beto or for his campaign. But, you know, I do understand what he's saying as far as needing to re- visit parts of the Constitution. I think the Electoral College is a really good example where you are empowering some voters more so than others, and giving them more of a voice than others.</p><p>And that's - that's really unfair and not what our democracy's about. That's a very good example right there.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what - what does that mean? Look, obviously, we're for fairness. There's a lot of unfairness. I agree with that, for sure, and we should work as hard as we can to rectify it. But just give me one example of the principles that might be changed under a Beto O'Rourke presidency?</p><p>LERNER: I - I do not speak for Beto or - or for his campaign. So I can't--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --I can't do that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. That's totally fair enough. So, he was asked about the Border wall and he said, and I'm paraphrasing, but it's pretty close, \"We are killing people when we build Border walls.\" What is that - how are we - how are we killing people? How have we killed people by doing that?</p><p>LERNER: So, in the context of what he was talking about, he was making two points. One, if we - if when we militarize our border with Mexico, you're increasing the risk that people are going to get hurt or killed when they cross the border in their encounters with our - with our security forces and their side.</p><p>And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous.</p><p>And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people.</p><p>So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders. Democrats aren't for that despite what's often said here.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are.</p><p>LERNER: They're not.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but then - but hold on let's--</p><p>LERNER: They're for - they're for (ph) treating people like humans and treating--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Look, I--</p><p>LERNER: --them is the seaming (ph) way.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. So but, Mexico had over 31,000 murders last year. That's about twice the number we had in the country as a population less than half of ours. So, it's one of the most dangerous countries in the world. And so, it's fair to be concerned about that violence moving north. Any normal country--</p><p>LERNER: Well but it's also fair--</p><p>CARLSON: --would be concerned.</p><p>LERNER: --to understand that people might want to be fleeing that violence that have, you know, for their families' sake--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Because that's - that - that's true.</p><p>LERNER: --and to build up life (ph) here.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean the - the rights and the interests of Americans come first from the perspective of the U.S. government. That's why we have the government to protect--</p><p>LERNER: 100 percent, absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --our rights (ph). So, explain to me, and you can speak slowly if you want, how we are forcing people to come across our border illegally. How are we forcing people to come across? I - I don't understand that.</p><p>LERNER: We're not - we're not forcing people. It's just that we should be treating them in a humane and civil way because they are humans. And despite the way they have been described by Donald Trump and Republicans, you know, they're - they're not - they're not criminals. They're not rapists. They're not all drug dealers.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Many of them are just coming here to seek better lives.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I've - I've always--</p><p>LERNER: And we need to respect and--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, but, but I--</p><p>LERNER: --appreciate that.</p><p>CARLSON: --I totally - but I've never doubted that. And some are bad people. Most are just economic migrants who want to move to a richer country.</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: I get it. I would, as I said many times on this show, I would leave Honduras too, and I would come here illegally if I could. And I mean it. I'm not joking. So, I get it. But I'm not from Honduras. I'm from America. And I don't want people driving - driving down wages in this country.</p><p>So, don't we have a right to say, \"No, you can't come in unless we want you to come in?\"</p><p>LERNER: We absolutely have a right to - to do that. However, as Americans, we also have a duty to treat them a certain way and to respect their humanity and respect them as individuals, and not simply cast them aside.</p><p>And so, when you're - when you're looking at border security, there is a certain way that you should be treating people, and it's not forcing them to, you know, it's not - it's not putting them at a - a massive risk and potentially killing them--</p><p>CARLSON: But how are we putting--</p><p>LERNER: --instead of responding (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --wait but how - how are - if - if we erect a wall and say, you can't cross, that's the same as killing them?</p><p>LERNER: Putting up a wall does put them in greater danger because it forces them to find different points of entry. And a wall is just a massive - it's just - it's not - it doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't solve the main problem of immigration, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --longer visa, which is we--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK, so, so, so I'm--</p><p>LERNER: --people are overstaying their visas. If people can (ph) just throw a--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm glad - I'm glad you're putting that. No, no--</p><p>LERNER: --rope over a wall, there's tunnels that they can use.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's totally fair. That's - that's a talking point, but it's also real, so I'm glad you mentioned it.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And, in fact, Mr. O'Rourke was - was asked it too by Jeff Bezos' newspaper, and his quote was, \"I don't know.\" Now, how could he not know? He represents Texas. He's been asked of immigration for years, and he hasn't thought through visa overstays, which, as you point out, are a driver of our crisis. How could you not have an answer to that?</p><p>LERNER: So, again, I - I - so, again, out of context, that sounds bad. But what he said after that was that he would work with the people who it's affected by, work with policymakers, work with experts, work with people on the ground who deal with this every day to find a solution.</p><p>And actually, I think it's very refreshing that a politician was willing to say, \"I don't know,\" because if you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's sure.</p><p>LERNER: --where immigration reform has gone in the last 20 years, which is nowhere, I think a lot of politicians actually don't know. They have no idea what a solution is because we haven't found one. And so, what he's saying is we need to have a debate. We need to talk it over.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, look, I'm totally for that.</p><p>LERNER: Find a solution.</p><p>CARLSON: And I - and actually do agree with you.</p><p>LERNER: Right. So, sounds like you support him there.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I support being honest about not knowing. I just think--</p><p>LERNER: He's - he's just (ph) being honest.</p><p>CARLSON: --he should like try a little harder. But let me ask you something that I don't know the answer to and I'm not being mean. I'm being sincere.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Here you had in the last election an Irish Catholic guy with a Hispanic nickname running against an actual Hispanic guy with an Anglo name. Would that seem a little weird to you, a little audacious maybe?</p><p>LERNER: You know, Ted Cruz tried to make that point as well, and Texans got over it pretty quickly.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a real point.</p><p>LERNER: It's not - it's not a real point. It's - it's - the point is moot. You know, it's - it's something that - it's something to joke about for a minute. It was his - his nickname.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: It's his nickname growing up. It's I guess people call Ted, you know, Ted Cruz, Ted, his higher enough (ph) as well. And it's - it's not - it's not something people care about. People care about real issues.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know. Well, I asked about real issues and I ended it with, as you pointed out, joking about it for a second, which I didn't have (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Very fair.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate your coming on Nate. Thank you very much.</p><p>LERNER: Of course, anytime.</p><p>CARLSON: Well from The View to all the dumb people on television, what you're hearing this week, and it really is a talking point of the week, is that everybody who's not a Democrat is by nature a bigot. It's what they're telling you.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson responds to that after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well if you've watched TV this week, you have heard this week's talking point. Republicans and the people who vote for them are bigots, every one of them. The geniuses over at The View, the daytime TV show, suggested that almost half the country's just flat-out immoral, and should be shunned on those grounds. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO- HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: But will Republicans now step up to the plate with Donald Trump because he has been using, I think, the Border wall as sort of this dog whistle for racism.

It's The View. You can write it off like what do they know. But it wasn't just The View. Nicole Wallace had a real job at one point. She was White House Communications Director briefly, I think, under last Republican Administration. Here's her view.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ANCHOR, CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC AND NBC NEWS: This does not have a parallel on the Left. They're just - they're just - it - it doesn't. There isn't. There isn't a strain of racism on the Left.</p><p>I don't so - so, I think that - that this gets brushed under the rug. People sort of tolerate - it's been normalized. Like you just said, they don't have anywhere else to go, so they attach to the Republican Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. No racists on the Left, literally not one, says Nicole Wallace.</p><p>Over in ESPN, one of their hosts suggested it was racist, not surprisingly, for the President to serve the Clemson Football Team fast food at the White House. Fast food is the food of bigots. Of course.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOLLY QERIM ROSE, SPORTS ANCHOR AND MODERATOR, ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: When I saw him giving the football players, it's - it's a predominantly Black sport, and fast food, my thought went - went a very different place. Also a - a bunch of--</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, BOXING COMMENTATOR, CO-HOST OF ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: I think the - I think the President likes fast food.</p><p>ROSE: --a bunch of--</p><p>STEPHEN ANTHONY SMITH, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, SPORTS RADIO HOST, SPORTS JOURNALIST, ACTOR, ESPN FIRST TAKE COMMENTATOR: Yes.</p><p>ROSE: --Macs (ph). I mean come on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. OK. So, the consensus is the racism is on the Right. Only Conservatives can be racist. So that raises a few questions.</p><p>What exactly is racism? What does it look like? How'd if - you know if you are racist. And so, we have a handily checklist for you. Get a pen and follow along. See if you can answer these questions.</p><p>A racist - what would a racist do? A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done.</p><p>They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes.</p><p>They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right?</p><p>People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do.</p><p>Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>You know what I noticed, Professor Hanson, and maybe I'm just making this up in my head, but it seems like people have a tendency to accuse others of doing the exact thing that they are doing. Have you noticed that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I think it's really dangerous throughout history when you have a group that sets themselves up as the arbiters of morality.</p><p>We saw that with the Catholic Church and the abuse problems. We saw that in the #MeToo and the Hollywood liberals like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey.</p><p>They feel that they're not subject to the same standards they demand of others. And what's going on here is that if I think that Representative King confused Western civilization with White and - Whiteness, and they're not synonymous, especially in the global world.</p><p>Japan can be more Western than - than Russia. But the point is--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's just interesting that if you--</p><p>HANSON: --we got to find out what the rules are, Tucker because while--</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's what I mean--</p><p>HANSON: --we're condemning him, we have Hank Johnson, another Member of the Congress, who recently said, compared Jews in Israel to termites.</p><p>And then we've got the Editor Board - a person on the Editorial Board in the New York Times, Sarah Jeong, who said, literally (ph), I hate White people, and compared them to dogs urinating on hydrants. The New York Times was not upset.</p><p>Then we've got this whole trope now in - in rap music, all the major marquee rappers, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Scarface, it's just rampant anti- Semitism. And we saw LeBron James, our national icon, re-tweeting an anti- Semitic tweet and with no - of a rapper with no consequences.</p><p>So, the American people are saying to themselves, \"Wow! What are the rules?\" And when you look at Trump supporters are not just derided as stupid or ignorant. But if you'd - this new Left-wing mode is to say that they stink. We saw that with Peter Strzok.</p><p>I think Mr. Caputo from Politico said remember that they don't have any teeth. That was echoed by Rick Wilson. He call - also called them garbage people, a piece of S-H blank, an FBI agent remarked.</p><p>And so, there's this, Jim Carrey, of all, the actor, compared Trump supporters to apes that has a long - that simian synonym and metaphor has a really bad pedigree.</p><p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that anytime somebody says we're progressive, and we're enlightened, and we're not racist, that tends human nature of being what it is to give them a blank check to - to be racist, which is your point.</p><p>Remember 2008, Tucker, when Joe Biden said, do you remember that he said about Barack Obama that he was the first Black candidate who was clean, clean and was articulate. And then Harry Reid sort of echoed that and said, he didn't have a Negro dialect and he was light-skinned.</p><p>And then, Bill Clinton said, well he would have been serving his coffee. Even - even Al Sharpton tried to contextualize that because the idea, again, was these are good--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: --Progressives. They're good people. They couldn't be--</p><p>CARLSON: It's awful.</p><p>HANSON: --guilty of racism.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: That's not a window into their soul. It is with Republicans. But with Democrats and Progressives and Left is they're just inadvertent or it's allowed (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well, these are just tools they use--</p><p>HANSON: It's very dangerous to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: --to win power. And we should remember that. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: By the way, if they meant it, then the Southern Poverty Law Center wouldn't have been on a lot of this stuff. You've heard of the SPLC. It's a phony anti-hate group that exists to crush people they don't like, to tar Conservatives organizations as fellow travelers with the KKK or whatever.</p><p>Mark Krikorian is Executive Director at the Center for Immigration Studies. His group just sued the SPLC for designating them as a hate group. Finally, someone is fighting back against this. What is the basis of this lawsuit, Mark?</p><p>MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Our attorneys decided the way to go was to file a RICO lawsuit, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which is used in the criminal part by, you know, against the Mafia or whatever, by the government.</p><p>But there are civil parts where private individuals can file suit. And the basis of the claim is they are committing wire fraud, by falsely describing us as a hate group in order to do harm to my organization.</p><p>CARLSON: Has it done harm to your organization being designated (ph)?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's done some. I mean, you know, we've - we have a - a body - a reputation and a body of work that makes it hard to plausibly call us a hate group. And we've testified before Congress more than a 100 times. We've been cited in Supreme Court decision.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: We published real professors, the work of - of professors from legitimate universities. Nonetheless, it has, in fact, had an effect. One example that we mentioned in the suit, Amazon has this program where you can designate a non-profit group to get a small amount of revenue every time you buy something.</p><p>We were removed from that program. And the person who communicated that to us made the mistake of actually saying what the reason was. In print, he said, we just get our list from the SPLC.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it's just - that's what's remarkable to me. So, the SPLC is just the Praetorian Guard of the Democratic Party, obviously, fighting for the status quo, seeking to crush anyone who stands in the way of power. But they still seem to be taken seriously by media outlets, and by companies like Amazon. Why?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's good question. I'm not sure why. I mean I think there, you know, this is some - a kind of thing you see a lot in the tech industry, for instance, where they just assume that Progressive political views are just the normal political views, and anybody who doesn't hold them, somehow, is weird is, and to be shunned.</p><p>And I think that's part of what it is. You see the same thing with journalism where a lot of media simply cite the SPLC's hate group designation as just sort of a fact. You know, this person is this old. He's wearing, you know, a blue suit, and he's been designated as a, you know, hate group by the SPLC.</p><p>That's starting to change because they really have overreached, and they've gotten slapped down a couple of times. There was a Muslim reformer, a liberal Muslim--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --anti-extremist--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --they labeled him as an extremist. And he sued. They settled because they knew they were going to lose for as (ph) $3 million-plus. I don't expect them to go quite that easily in this case. But I think we have a pretty strong case.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a very strong case. And I looked at the accusations they leveled against you, because you're a guest on this show and I was interested, and they have - there's no basis for saying that about you. It was shocking. It was, I think, it's libel. But we're rooting for you, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark, thank you.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well a new report exposes Google for blacklisting certain video searches on YouTube. You can probably guess who they targeted. We've got the details after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Big tech companies try to control what you see online, of course. But they also try to control what you don't see.</p><p>A new report, a shocking one, from Breitbart exposes the existence of a Google blacklist for, quote, controversial YouTube queries, questions you ask on YouTube, trying to find videos.</p><p>The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion. After receiving a complaint from a political activist posing as a reporter at Slate.com, there are a lot of those, Google intervened to bury pro-life videos on YouTube, and replace them in search with pro-abortion videos.</p><p>For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN. Well, in a statement, YouTube denied doing anything wrong and said any shifts were purely due to their algorithms which, of course, are controlled by people.</p><p>Robert Epstein has spent a lot of time looking into this question. He's a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he joins us tonight. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>You were the first person I thought of when I read this story because you have done, I think, the cutting-edge research into the effect of search - Google search, and other digital platforms on human behavior and political behavior.</p><p>So, what kind of effect could this sort of distortion have on an election?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Well, Tucker, it would have a devastating effect. And, you know, as you know, I am not a Conservative.</p><p>CARLSON: I do.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I - I - I love America. I love democracy. And I think we should all be rising above our politics here and recognize the extreme danger that we're facing when a company like Google can basically censor anything it wants to censor.</p><p>Now, this new set of leaks is extraordinary because it confirms things that I and others have been saying and writing for years. It confirms, number one that individual employees at Google have the power to manually remove material, remove content that we see. And they do so often with political ends.</p><p>And number two, this tells us that Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, committed perjury when he testified before Congress a few weeks ago, because he said quite specifically that Google never does this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean I - my frustration levels are so high, I don't want to take it out on you. But the first thought is well, why isn't he being recalled back to Congress to explain himself or face charges because you're not allowed to commit perjury.</p><p>But my question is can any of us trust that the next election won't be swayed dramatically in one direction by interference from the tech companies?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I guarantee you that this past election was affected. I'll be releasing some - some data on this, I hope, in early March that'll make the point beyond any doubt.</p><p>I also just published a piece in which I showed that just one manipulation on Google's part, on Election Day, their Go Vote reminder, that one reminder, that Go Vote reminder shifted between 800,000 and 4.6 million votes to Democratic candidates on Election Day in 2018.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why - why isn't this the hacking of our democracy? I mean how can you have a democracy under these circumstances?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, democracy is a kind of illusion at this point because we have let these companies, Google more than any other, go completely wild. There are no rules, no regulations, no laws that restrict anything they do.</p><p>And again, the more one looks at what it is they're actually doing, and these new leaks help a lot, in my opinion, the closer one looks at what they're doing, the more outraged one should become.</p><p>And I want to emphasize, we should all be outraged, not just Conservatives.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I agree. I hope that what you just said pings around the internet unimpeded and winds up in the inbox of every Member of Congress on both sides. Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My pleasure, always.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nobody covering this? It's a great question. And this question as well. Google's manipulation, the one we just told you about, why isn't that a violation of campaign finance law? The companies YouTube blacklist, for example, allegedly suppress negative videos about Maxine Waters. Why is that not an in-kind contribution to Maxine Waters?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, unlike us, is an attorney, and she joins us tonight. So, Harmeet, you just saw a guy plead to a felony because he paid off his client's girlfriend with private funds in the middle of a campaign. That was considered a campaign finance violation.</p><p>Here you have the most powerful company in the world, putting its thumb on the scale on behalf of candidates, but that's not a campaign contribution? How?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Well it is a campaign finance violation. And - and if anybody thinks that this is some sort of aberration, Google has been doing this and bragging about it internally, even in the last election.</p><p>Tucker, I think, your show has previously covered the fact that Google made what, I think, one internal person at Google, a Manager at Google called silent campaign contribution by turning out the vote and contributing turnout the vote efforts in several states that were swing states for Hillary Clinton, and specifically targeting Latino voters.</p><p>I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections.</p><p>But when a corporation does it with its corporate assets, it needs to be dis - disclosed as a campaign finance violation, declared and disclosed on the other side as a campaign finance receipt by the campaign.</p><p>Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one.</p><p>And if it isn't being disclosed as such, then that is a fraud on our democracy. And you can then imagine what they're doing vis-a-vis Donald Trump.</p><p>They're already doing it to Republicans as we - you have previously reported with regard to search engine results for Republican Women, for California Republican Party, for various other Republicans. So, I think this is, you know - you know, we all think every story is important when it comes to Google and what they do online.</p><p>But this is a particularly shocking and alarming story that we really need to see our Members of Congress, Senators and the White House wake up about this issue because otherwise we aren't going to be talking about a democracy in the next two election cycles.</p><p>We'll be talking about what it used to look like before we let Big Tech takeover and control the outcome.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't see how under these circumstances, all things being equal, Donald Trump could get re-elected. I don't. And look, I mean I think we should have a free and fair election where people's votes really matter.</p><p>But under these circumstances, we're not going to have that. I wonder why the White House wouldn't - I mean they do control the Executive Branch of government. Why they wouldn't have been awakened to that but.</p><p>DHILLON: We have seen Donald Trump actually tweet about this issue in September 2018. He tweeted about, frankly, the subject matter of today's story from Breitbart and, you know, people called him a - a conspiracy theorist that it isn't true.</p><p>And, you know, now we see the evidence that actually they are doing this manipulation, and that Sundar Pichai lied to Congress about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But - but these companies skillfully spread the money around, not just to Members of Congress, but also people working in an Administration, who are looking for their exit and thinking--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: --\"Well maybe I'll work on the other side of tech policy and make a bunch of money advising Google on how to speak Conservative--</p><p>CARLSON: Scary. Scary.</p><p>DHILLON: --to Conservatives.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: That's how it happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Vladimir Putin is a much smaller threat to the United States than Google, I would say.</p><p>DHILLON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon, thank you very much.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the country is racing at high speed toward full legalization of marijuana. Why is that exactly? And what are the effects? And what do we know about marijuana? It's uncool to ask, obviously. But being middle-aged, we're going to anyway, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Christophe Guilluy is a well-known author in France. He's written a number of books about that country's middle and working classes. He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government.</p><p>Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras.</p><p>But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar.</p><p>\"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York.</p><p>Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small- business owners outside of the big cities.</p><p>Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this.</p><p>What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else.</p><p>They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests.</p><p>Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later.</p><p>Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world.</p><p>All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too.</p><p>The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix.</p><p>The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non- urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people.</p><p>We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities.</p><p>But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people.</p><p>Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe.</p><p>The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist.</p><p>But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid.</p><p>A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order.</p><p>We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles.</p><p>Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\"</p><p>Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: DRUGGED.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well every election cycle, you probably noticed, more states legalize marijuana. It could soon be legal nationwide, likely will be. But with drug abuse of all kinds soaring and American youth falling apart, is legalization a good idea? What exactly do we know about marijuana?</p><p>David Bienenstock is the Author of How To Smoke Pot Properly and co-host of the podcast, Great Moments in Weed History.

So, I guess--</p><p>DAVID BIENENSTOCK, HOW TO SMOKE POT AUTHOR, GREAT MOMENTS IN WEED HISTORY PODCAST CO-HOST: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: --the first thing I noticed, there was a really interesting piece last - this week by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker. I'm sure you read it. And it asked, and he's kind of agnostic, I think, about the question of marijuana. But he made the point that we really don't know that much about the health effects of marijuana.</p><p>Most of the claims made by its proponents are unproven. But the CDC does say that there is a relationship between marijuana use and rising schizophrenia rates and violence. So, why should we legalize something that we know causes schizophrenia?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well I mean the first thing we need to understand is cannabis is objectively safer than many substances that are legal, alcohol, tobacco- -</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many pharmaceutical drugs. To get to your point about the book you have--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait. I mean I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We - we - could we pause for a second? How do we know that it's safer than - than alcohol and tobacco, since I don't really think we know very much about it? I mean most drugs like we've been studying--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: OK. Well here's the-</p><p>CARLSON: --nicotine for a hundreds of years and alcohol for thousands, we don't really know that much about them. So, how do - why do we say we know that when we don't really know that?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We can compare the number of people who died from each substance every year, hundreds of thousands of people from alcohol and tobacco, and zero people from cannabis. So, you know, just as a shorthand--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Well, no that's not--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --there has never been a death--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's not actually true.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --attributed to cannabis. Absolutely, it's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? There have been many deaths attributed--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Saying something that's not true--</p><p>CARLSON: --well I'm - I'm going to. If - if it is true, as the CDC says that cannabis use looks like it causes or spurs--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose of cannabis, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: --schizophrenia - hold on, hold on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose?</p><p>CARLSON: If it causes schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: How much do you have (ph) to consume?</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. What percentage of people with schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Just answer my question.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>No, I'm saying you're looking at it wrong. If weed smoking causes schizophrenia and there's a suggestion that it does, schizophrenia kills lots of people, and so does suicide, and so does violence. And if marijuana use hikes rates of violence and it seems like there's a lot of evidence that it does, then that kills people.</p><p>So, the question is not, do they die from lung cancer. The question is do they die from suicide or violence. And those are real questions, and you don't know the answers to them. So, why are you saying it's totally safe when you - you don't know that that's true?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I - I did not say it's totally safe. That's a ridiculous--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --standard. Strenuous exercise can lead to a heart attack that's fatal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Drinking too much water can be fatal. I - I think you need to understand the difference between correlation and causation.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I do understand--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The author of the book--</p><p>CARLSON: --the difference.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --apparently, you don't.</p><p>CARLSON: No, wait, I do. And what I understand most of all is the - is the basic precept of science, which is we don't know something until we prove it. And almost nothing about marijuana--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'll tell you what I--</p><p>CARLSON: --has been proven. So, why are you acting like we know when we don't?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: This is what's proven to be harmful, Tucker.</p><p>Arresting 600,000 Americans every year for making the choice to use a substance that's objectively safer than alcohol that - and doing it in a way that targets the poor and minorities disproportionately is devastating to those communities.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're making it - but I'm not arguing but - but you're--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: It creates a police state.</p><p>CARLSON: --missing. I'm - I'm not arguing in favor of that. Well you're making a parallel argument and evading the question that I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, you don't want to arrest anybody for--</p><p>CARLSON: --that they get evading (ph) - look, I'm--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you don't want to arrest anybody for cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --always for unfair application of the law. I'm always for hassling people for things that aren't really bothering others. But that's not really the question. So, I've never been for like rousting people from their homes for smoking weed. I'm totally against that.</p><p>But that's very different from legalizing it everywhere, which increases the rate of kids smoking weed. And if it really does cause schizophrenia, I should be really afraid of that. No?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well youth use is down in the states that have legalized, first of all. And, second of all, if it's not going to be legalized - answer me this. Who's going to grow and sell this cannabis?</p><p>Where is it going to magically appear from if not through a regulated taxed industry? If my aunt in Kansas comes down with cancer, where am I going to send her to buy a safe, lab-tested, medical cannabis product to save her life in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think - I think - I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Who grows and sells the cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought it was the U.S. government grew it in Mississippi for years, as you know. I mean it's look--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not - OK, OK, look, I know, OK--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people.</p><p>CARLSON: --I get it. But it's not impossible to a man--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, who's going to--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. If there - if there are - hold on, let me finish it. If the, look, again--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --who's going to grow and sell it in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: --you're throwing another red herring into the argument and evading the question.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: That's not a red herring.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if - no, it's, look, if we use opioids legally that are prescribed by physicians, it doesn't mean the average person can buy opium.</p><p>So, you could have controlled marijuana growing for its medicinal properties, which I'm willing to believe exists. I'm just saying you're talking about legalizing it, which means many more kids will smoke it.</p><p>And if it causes schizophrenia, it should scare the hell out of us, but it doesn't seem to bother you, because, I don't know, what, you're taking money from them or something? Why doesn't that bother you?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Tucker, you know, you're the one on here repeating old lies, old distortions, debunked claims, the Author of the book that you had on last week, everything he said has been completely debunked. I don't know if you've read my article on--</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --Leafly. I assume that's why you had me on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many of the people in the studies that he cited have gone on Twitter to say, \"You grossly misrepresented our findings.\"</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well let me just ask you - look, I'm not an expert on this.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The National Academy of Medicine report the Author said you misrepresent--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm happy to--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you're not an expert. But you're supposed to do your job.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, no, I'm not - my - my job - wait hold on, wait, wait, wait a second--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: You're supposed to learn about these things. Did you read my article where I debunked all of this?</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you one - let me just end on one question. Is it - this is my real concern is schizophrenia because I think it's such a terrible disease, and we can't cure it, and a lot of people die from it. It's horrible, as you know.</p><p>Is it untrue, do you think that marijuana use looks like it could increase the rate of schizophrenia? Is that a fake statistic? It's a sincere question to you.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'd say, you know, we need to know more, and we should know more. But having you and authors come on and just--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --confuse causation and correlation--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm - I'm not confuse - I'm asking--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --does no one a good service.</p><p>CARLSON: --you a sincere question. And you don't seem to be--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I will say that. Here's my sincere answer.</p><p>CARLSON: --interested in answering it.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We've had societies where the rates of cannabis use has gone way up, and the rates of schizophrenia have not gone up at all. So, to me, that would put a lot of cold water on your idea that there is an epidemic of violence and--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I thought you were just lecturing me about causation--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --schizophrenia caused by cannabis.</p><p>CARLSON: --and correlation. But then aren't - isn't that what you're doing? OK, look, I just - look, it's an open - I - I have zero interest in banning anything. I just think that we don't know that much. I don't think you really--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well, why did you have me on if you have zero--</p><p>CARLSON: --know anything (ph) and you're pretending that you do--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --interest in debating me?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I was debating you. We're out of time. David, thank you. I appreciate your coming on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well earlier today, we told you what many are saying in Washington that fast food is racist. Maybe have a salad instead. Too bad, salads are sexist now. It's 2019. And we'll have details on that, after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with, along with the Second Lady. They'll make some salads. And I said, \"You guys aren't into salads.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Or do I go out, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers?</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Big Macs?</p><p>JOAN MAUREEN WALSH, JOURNALIST, NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION, POLITICAL ANALYST AT CNN, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SALON, AUTHOR: That's appalling. It seems to me like the President will not be happy until there is not one single female Republican voter in the country. It's incredibly sexist.</p><p>We aren't all here to make salads for men. It's--</p><p>ERIN ISABELLE BURNETT, ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT ANCHOR, CNN: Yes. I mean--</p><p>WALSH: --it's disgusting.</p><p>BURNETT: How in the world do you not perceive that as sexist, to say the assumption that his wife's going to go make salads for the bunch of football players? What is she, like--</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXECUTIVE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, FORMER POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: I--</p><p>BURNETT: --the cook?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Joan Walsh, ladies and gentlemen, the single most unhappy person in the world, on CNN today, melting down because the President joked about salads. Salads are now sexist. Fast food is racist. What are you allowed to eat?</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey, a brilliant unraveller of riddles and a podcast host, joins us tonight to sort it out. Thank you for coming on.</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: Yes, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Sexist salads.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes, apparently. So, I mean she was really upset over this. The first reaction she had was not to roll her eyes but to say that this was appalling.</p><p>I mean you just have to wonder what goes on in someone like Jo's - Joan's mind. In the middle of the night, is she tossing and turning, thinking about all of the ways that she can be offended.</p><p>CARLSON: But also, why wouldn't the rest of the country take life advice from someone whose own life has clearly been a disaster and--</p><p>STUCKEY: I mean well, maybe - maybe - but maybe--</p><p>CARLSON: --who is so deeply unhappy.</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes, exactly. Maybe this is why her life is such a disaster because she is hunting for something to hurt her feelings. And she's found it. She's found it in salad.</p><p>But also, I want to say that Melania probably does make salad, so this probably had nothing to do with her sex, whatsoever. She looks like someone who makes a good salad. So, that probably was all the comment at best (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She looks like a salad eater.</p><p>STUCKEY: She does.</p><p>CARLSON: And I say that as someone who should be eating salads--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --but is not. Right, that's not a--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly. Details (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not a slur. I wonder though, in the end if the best way to get people to see your way of thinking, to bring them to your side, is to scream at them for telling jokes.</p><p>STUCKEY: Probably not. But I don't think they're interested in that, not with Conservatives, and certainly not with President Trump. They just kind of repeat this thing over and over again. It's racist, sexist, whatever it is, whatever they can find in today, the poor victim was salad.</p><p>CARLSON: How long before people say, \"You know what? I - I don't really care what you call me anymore.\"</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I think that's already happening.</p><p>CARLSON: It's already happened?</p><p>STUCKEY: Don't you think Trump has already done that? I do.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know about Trump. I've definitely reached that point and this is all fake.</p><p>STUCKEY: That's good (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Allie, it's great to see you. Welcome to Washington.</p><p>STUCKEY: It's great to see you as well. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You've improved the tenor of the city by your presence.</p><p>All right, we're out of time sadly. Tomorrow night, 8:00 P.M., we'll be back, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Needless to say, DVR it if you can figure that out. I can't, but you're probably smarter.</p><p>Good night from Washington. And tonight, with looks like about 18 seconds to go, we're going to give a delayed Christmas present to our pal, Sean Hannity--</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: I--</p><p>CARLSON: --in New York.</p><p>HANNITY: --I think you made up for all of last year, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Use the time wisely, Sean. It's yours.</p><p>HANNITY: We're going to - we're going to give you the radio show. You can host my show one day. And it's going to be hitting the post. I'll teach - I'll - we'll tell you about it.</p><p>CARLSON: No way, I'm in (ph).</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, great show as always.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019011601cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V6W-C9H1-DXH2-64HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We're going to take a night here. Lots of emails coming in. Keep them coming. That's the story for tonight. Tucker Carlson, up next live in D.C.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are.</p><p>Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember.</p><p>Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office.</p><p>So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR 16TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, TEXAS: Will fight when necessary against a President who's focused on building walls.</p><p>No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns.</p><p>Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem.</p><p>We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever!</p><p>Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram.</p><p>But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people.</p><p>O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls.</p><p>As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\"</p><p>Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions.</p><p>The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it.</p><p>When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat.</p><p>Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind.</p><p>Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper.</p><p>Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?</p><p>And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial.</p><p>Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country?</p><p>A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it.</p><p>Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that.</p><p>So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?</p><p>NATE LERNER, CO-FOUNDER, DRAFTBETO.ORG: Right. Right, so on the - on the surface and taken out of context, that certainly sounds bad. But what he's actually talking about is a--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, different.</p><p>LERNER: --is a very common approach to Constitutional law. Constitutional scholars for centuries have debated if the Constitution should be taken literally and at word or if it's a living breathing document that we--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LERNER: --should interpret as things change.</p><p>And guess what? Our country has changed and the world has changed quite a bit in the last 200-plus years. And what Beto was saying is that perhaps we need to re-visit parts of the Constitution as a result. That's - that's a very common discussion that--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look--</p><p>LERNER: --that scholars would have.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm open-minded. And, by the way, there are things in the Constitution, you know, I - I think we should always have conversations about everything--</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --that we disagree with. But what specifically is he talking about? I think it's also fair to ask, what principles need to be revised.</p><p>LERNER: You know, I - I'm not a spokesperson for Beto or for his campaign. But, you know, I do understand what he's saying as far as needing to re-visit parts of the Constitution. I think the Electoral College is a really good example where you are empowering some voters more so than others, and giving them more of a voice than others.</p><p>And that's - that's really unfair and not what our democracy's about. That's a very good example right there.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what - what does that mean? Look, obviously, we're for fairness. There's a lot of unfairness. I agree with that, for sure, and we should work as hard as we can to rectify it. But just give me one example of the principles that might be changed under a Beto O'Rourke presidency?</p><p>LERNER: I - I do not speak for Beto or - or for his campaign. So I can't--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --I can't do that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. That's totally fair enough. So, he was asked about the Border wall and he said, and I'm paraphrasing, but it's pretty close, \"We are killing people when we build Border walls.\" What is that - how are we - how are we killing people? How have we killed people by doing that?</p><p>LERNER: So, in the context of what he was talking about, he was making two points. One, if we - if when we militarize our border with Mexico, you're increasing the risk that people are going to get hurt or killed when they cross the border in their encounters with our - with our security forces and their side.</p><p>And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous.</p><p>And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people.</p><p>So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders. Democrats aren't for that despite what's often said here.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are.</p><p>LERNER: They're not.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but then - but hold on let's--</p><p>LERNER: They're for - they're for (ph) treating people like humans and treating--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Look, I--</p><p>LERNER: --them is the seaming (ph) way.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. So but, Mexico had over 31,000 murders last year. That's about twice the number we had in the country as a population less than half of ours. So, it's one of the most dangerous countries in the world. And so, it's fair to be concerned about that violence moving north. Any normal country--</p><p>LERNER: Well but it's also fair--</p><p>CARLSON: --would be concerned.</p><p>LERNER: --to understand that people might want to be fleeing that violence that have, you know, for their families' sake--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Because that's - that - that's true.</p><p>LERNER: --and to build up life (ph) here.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean the - the rights and the interests of Americans come first from the perspective of the U.S. government. That's why we have the government to protect--</p><p>LERNER: 100 percent, absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --our rights (ph). So, explain to me, and you can speak slowly if you want, how we are forcing people to come across our border illegally. How are we forcing people to come across? I - I don't understand that.</p><p>LERNER: We're not - we're not forcing people. It's just that we should be treating them in a humane and civil way because they are humans. And despite the way they have been described by Donald Trump and Republicans, you know, they're - they're not - they're not criminals. They're not rapists. They're not all drug dealers.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Many of them are just coming here to seek better lives.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I've - I've always--</p><p>LERNER: And we need to respect and--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, but, but I--</p><p>LERNER: --appreciate that.</p><p>CARLSON: --I totally - but I've never doubted that. And some are bad people. Most are just economic migrants who want to move to a richer country.</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: I get it. I would, as I said many times on this show, I would leave Honduras too, and I would come here illegally if I could. And I mean it. I'm not joking. So, I get it. But I'm not from Honduras. I'm from America. And I don't want people driving - driving down wages in this country.</p><p>So, don't we have a right to say, \"No, you can't come in unless we want you to come in?\"</p><p>LERNER: We absolutely have a right to - to do that. However, as Americans, we also have a duty to treat them a certain way and to respect their humanity and respect them as individuals, and not simply cast them aside.</p><p>And so, when you're - when you're looking at border security, there is a certain way that you should be treating people, and it's not forcing them to, you know, it's not - it's not putting them at a - a massive risk and potentially killing them--</p><p>CARLSON: But how are we putting--</p><p>LERNER: --instead of responding (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --wait but how - how are - if - if we erect a wall and say, you can't cross, that's the same as killing them?</p><p>LERNER: Putting up a wall does put them in greater danger because it forces them to find different points of entry. And a wall is just a massive - it's just - it's not - it doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't solve the main problem of immigration, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --longer visa, which is we--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK, so, so, so I'm--</p><p>LERNER: --people are overstaying their visas. If people can (ph) just throw a--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm glad - I'm glad you're putting that. No, no--</p><p>LERNER: --rope over a wall, there's tunnels that they can use.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's totally fair. That's - that's a talking point, but it's also real, so I'm glad you mentioned it.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And, in fact, Mr. O'Rourke was - was asked it too by Jeff Bezos' newspaper, and his quote was, \"I don't know.\" Now, how could he not know? He represents Texas. He's been asked of immigration for years, and he hasn't thought through visa overstays, which, as you point out, are a driver of our crisis. How could you not have an answer to that?</p><p>LERNER: So, again, I - I - so, again, out of context, that sounds bad. But what he said after that was that he would work with the people who it's affected by, work with policymakers, work with experts, work with people on the ground who deal with this every day to find a solution.</p><p>And actually, I think it's very refreshing that a politician was willing to say, \"I don't know,\" because if you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's sure.</p><p>LERNER: --where immigration reform has gone in the last 20 years, which is nowhere, I think a lot of politicians actually don't know. They have no idea what a solution is because we haven't found one. And so, what he's saying is we need to have a debate. We need to talk it over.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, look, I'm totally for that.</p><p>LERNER: Find a solution.</p><p>CARLSON: And I - and actually do agree with you.</p><p>LERNER: Right. So, sounds like you support him there.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I support being honest about not knowing. I just think--</p><p>LERNER: He's - he's just (ph) being honest.</p><p>CARLSON: --he should like try a little harder. But let me ask you something that I don't know the answer to and I'm not being mean. I'm being sincere.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Here you had in the last election an Irish Catholic guy with a Hispanic nickname running against an actual Hispanic guy with an Anglo name. Would that seem a little weird to you, a little audacious maybe?</p><p>LERNER: You know, Ted Cruz tried to make that point as well, and Texans got over it pretty quickly.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a real point.</p><p>LERNER: It's not - it's not a real point. It's - it's - the point is moot. You know, it's - it's something that - it's something to joke about for a minute. It was his - his nickname.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: It's his nickname growing up. It's I guess people call Ted, you know, Ted Cruz, Ted, his higher enough (ph) as well. And it's - it's not - it's not something people care about. People care about real issues.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know. Well, I asked about real issues and I ended it with, as you pointed out, joking about it for a second, which I didn't have (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Very fair.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate your coming on Nate. Thank you very much.</p><p>LERNER: Of course, anytime.</p><p>CARLSON: Well from The View to all the dumb people on television, what you're hearing this week, and it really is a talking point of the week, is that everybody who's not a Democrat is by nature a bigot. It's what they're telling you.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson responds to that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well if you've watched TV this week, you have heard this week's talking point. Republicans and the people who vote for them are bigots, every one of them. The geniuses over at The View, the daytime TV show, suggested that almost half the country's just flat-out immoral, and should be shunned on those grounds. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: But will Republicans now step up to the plate with Donald Trump because he has been using, I think, the Border wall as sort of this dog whistle for racism.

It's The View. You can write it off like what do they know. But it wasn't just The View. Nicole Wallace had a real job at one point. She was White House Communications Director briefly, I think, under last Republican Administration. Here's her view.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ANCHOR, CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC AND NBC NEWS: This does not have a parallel on the Left. They're just - they're just - it - it doesn't. There isn't. There isn't a strain of racism on the Left.</p><p>I don't so - so, I think that - that this gets brushed under the rug. People sort of tolerate - it's been normalized. Like you just said, they don't have anywhere else to go, so they attach to the Republican Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. No racists on the Left, literally not one, says Nicole Wallace.</p><p>Over in ESPN, one of their hosts suggested it was racist, not surprisingly, for the President to serve the Clemson Football Team fast food at the White House. Fast food is the food of bigots. Of course.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOLLY QERIM ROSE, SPORTS ANCHOR AND MODERATOR, ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: When I saw him giving the football players, it's - it's a predominantly Black sport, and fast food, my thought went - went a very different place. Also a - a bunch of--</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, BOXING COMMENTATOR, CO-HOST OF ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: I think the - I think the President likes fast food.</p><p>ROSE: --a bunch of--</p><p>STEPHEN ANTHONY SMITH, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, SPORTS RADIO HOST, SPORTS JOURNALIST, ACTOR, ESPN FIRST TAKE COMMENTATOR: Yes.</p><p>ROSE: --Macs (ph). I mean come on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. OK. So, the consensus is the racism is on the Right. Only Conservatives can be racist. So that raises a few questions.</p><p>What exactly is racism? What does it look like? How'd if - you know if you are racist. And so, we have a handily checklist for you. Get a pen and follow along. See if you can answer these questions.</p><p>A racist - what would a racist do? A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done.</p><p>They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes.</p><p>They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right?</p><p>People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do.</p><p>Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>You know what I noticed, Professor Hanson, and maybe I'm just making this up in my head, but it seems like people have a tendency to accuse others of doing the exact thing that they are doing. Have you noticed that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I think it's really dangerous throughout history when you have a group that sets themselves up as the arbiters of morality.</p><p>We saw that with the Catholic Church and the abuse problems. We saw that in the #MeToo and the Hollywood liberals like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey.</p><p>They feel that they're not subject to the same standards they demand of others. And what's going on here is that if I think that Representative King confused Western civilization with White and - Whiteness, and they're not synonymous, especially in the global world.</p><p>Japan can be more Western than - than Russia. But the point is--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's just interesting that if you--</p><p>HANSON: --we got to find out what the rules are, Tucker because while--</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's what I mean--</p><p>HANSON: --we're condemning him, we have Hank Johnson, another Member of the Congress, who recently said, compared Jews in Israel to termites.</p><p>And then we've got the Editor Board - a person on the Editorial Board in the New York Times, Sarah Jeong, who said, literally (ph), I hate White people, and compared them to dogs urinating on hydrants. The New York Times was not upset.</p><p>Then we've got this whole trope now in - in rap music, all the major marquee rappers, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Scarface, it's just rampant anti-Semitism. And we saw LeBron James, our national icon, re-tweeting an anti-Semitic tweet and with no - of a rapper with no consequences.</p><p>So, the American people are saying to themselves, \"Wow! What are the rules?\" And when you look at Trump supporters are not just derided as stupid or ignorant. But if you'd - this new Left-wing mode is to say that they stink. We saw that with Peter Strzok.</p><p>I think Mr. Caputo from Politico said remember that they don't have any teeth. That was echoed by Rick Wilson. He call - also called them garbage people, a piece of S-H blank, an FBI agent remarked.</p><p>And so, there's this, Jim Carrey, of all, the actor, compared Trump supporters to apes that has a long - that simian synonym and metaphor has a really bad pedigree.</p><p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that anytime somebody says we're progressive, and we're enlightened, and we're not racist, that tends human nature of being what it is to give them a blank check to - to be racist, which is your point.</p><p>Remember 2008, Tucker, when Joe Biden said, do you remember that he said about Barack Obama that he was the first Black candidate who was clean, clean and was articulate. And then Harry Reid sort of echoed that and said, he didn't have a Negro dialect and he was light-skinned.</p><p>And then, Bill Clinton said, well he would have been serving his coffee. Even - even Al Sharpton tried to contextualize that because the idea, again, was these are good--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: --Progressives. They're good people. They couldn't be--</p><p>CARLSON: It's awful.</p><p>HANSON: --guilty of racism.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: That's not a window into their soul. It is with Republicans. But with Democrats and Progressives and Left is they're just inadvertent or it's allowed (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well, these are just tools they use--</p><p>HANSON: It's very dangerous to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: --to win power. And we should remember that. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: By the way, if they meant it, then the Southern Poverty Law Center wouldn't have been on a lot of this stuff. You've heard of the SPLC. It's a phony anti-hate group that exists to crush people they don't like, to tar Conservatives organizations as fellow travelers with the KKK or whatever.</p><p>Mark Krikorian is Executive Director at the Center for Immigration Studies. His group just sued the SPLC for designating them as a hate group. Finally, someone is fighting back against this. What is the basis of this lawsuit, Mark?</p><p>MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Our attorneys decided the way to go was to file a RICO lawsuit, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which is used in the criminal part by, you know, against the Mafia or whatever, by the government.</p><p>But there are civil parts where private individuals can file suit. And the basis of the claim is they are committing wire fraud, by falsely describing us as a hate group in order to do harm to my organization.</p><p>CARLSON: Has it done harm to your organization being designated (ph)?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's done some. I mean, you know, we've - we have a - a body - a reputation and a body of work that makes it hard to plausibly call us a hate group. And we've testified before Congress more than a 100 times. We've been cited in Supreme Court decision.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: We published real professors, the work of - of professors from legitimate universities. Nonetheless, it has, in fact, had an effect. One example that we mentioned in the suit, Amazon has this program where you can designate a non-profit group to get a small amount of revenue every time you buy something.</p><p>We were removed from that program. And the person who communicated that to us made the mistake of actually saying what the reason was. In print, he said, we just get our list from the SPLC.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it's just - that's what's remarkable to me. So, the SPLC is just the Praetorian Guard of the Democratic Party, obviously, fighting for the status quo, seeking to crush anyone who stands in the way of power. But they still seem to be taken seriously by media outlets, and by companies like Amazon. Why?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's good question. I'm not sure why. I mean I think there, you know, this is some - a kind of thing you see a lot in the tech industry, for instance, where they just assume that Progressive political views are just the normal political views, and anybody who doesn't hold them, somehow, is weird is, and to be shunned.</p><p>And I think that's part of what it is. You see the same thing with journalism where a lot of media simply cite the SPLC's hate group designation as just sort of a fact. You know, this person is this old. He's wearing, you know, a blue suit, and he's been designated as a, you know, hate group by the SPLC.</p><p>That's starting to change because they really have overreached, and they've gotten slapped down a couple of times. There was a Muslim reformer, a liberal Muslim--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --anti-extremist--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --they labeled him as an extremist. And he sued. They settled because they knew they were going to lose for as (ph) $3 million-plus. I don't expect them to go quite that easily in this case. But I think we have a pretty strong case.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a very strong case. And I looked at the accusations they leveled against you, because you're a guest on this show and I was interested, and they have - there's no basis for saying that about you. It was shocking. It was, I think, it's libel. But we're rooting for you, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark, thank you.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well a new report exposes Google for blacklisting certain video searches on YouTube. You can probably guess who they targeted. We've got the details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Big tech companies try to control what you see online, of course. But they also try to control what you don't see.</p><p>A new report, a shocking one, from Breitbart exposes the existence of a Google blacklist for, quote, controversial YouTube queries, questions you ask on YouTube, trying to find videos.</p><p>The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion. After receiving a complaint from a political activist posing as a reporter at Slate.com, there are a lot of those, Google intervened to bury pro-life videos on YouTube, and replace them in search with pro-abortion videos.</p><p>For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN. Well, in a statement, YouTube denied doing anything wrong and said any shifts were purely due to their algorithms which, of course, are controlled by people.</p><p>Robert Epstein has spent a lot of time looking into this question. He's a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he joins us tonight. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>You were the first person I thought of when I read this story because you have done, I think, the cutting-edge research into the effect of search - Google search, and other digital platforms on human behavior and political behavior.</p><p>So, what kind of effect could this sort of distortion have on an election?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Well, Tucker, it would have a devastating effect. And, you know, as you know, I am not a Conservative.</p><p>CARLSON: I do.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I - I - I love America. I love democracy. And I think we should all be rising above our politics here and recognize the extreme danger that we're facing when a company like Google can basically censor anything it wants to censor.</p><p>Now, this new set of leaks is extraordinary because it confirms things that I and others have been saying and writing for years. It confirms, number one that individual employees at Google have the power to manually remove material, remove content that we see. And they do so often with political ends.</p><p>And number two, this tells us that Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, committed perjury when he testified before Congress a few weeks ago, because he said quite specifically that Google never does this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean I - my frustration levels are so high, I don't want to take it out on you. But the first thought is well, why isn't he being recalled back to Congress to explain himself or face charges because you're not allowed to commit perjury.</p><p>But my question is can any of us trust that the next election won't be swayed dramatically in one direction by interference from the tech companies?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I guarantee you that this past election was affected. I'll be releasing some - some data on this, I hope, in early March that'll make the point beyond any doubt.</p><p>I also just published a piece in which I showed that just one manipulation on Google's part, on Election Day, their Go Vote reminder, that one reminder, that Go Vote reminder shifted between 800,000 and 4.6 million votes to Democratic candidates on Election Day in 2018.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why - why isn't this the hacking of our democracy? I mean how can you have a democracy under these circumstances?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, democracy is a kind of illusion at this point because we have let these companies, Google more than any other, go completely wild. There are no rules, no regulations, no laws that restrict anything they do.</p><p>And again, the more one looks at what it is they're actually doing, and these new leaks help a lot, in my opinion, the closer one looks at what they're doing, the more outraged one should become.</p><p>And I want to emphasize, we should all be outraged, not just Conservatives.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I agree. I hope that what you just said pings around the internet unimpeded and winds up in the inbox of every Member of Congress on both sides. Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My pleasure, always.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nobody covering this? It's a great question. And this question as well. Google's manipulation, the one we just told you about, why isn't that a violation of campaign finance law? The companies YouTube blacklist, for example, allegedly suppress negative videos about Maxine Waters. Why is that not an in-kind contribution to Maxine Waters?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, unlike us, is an attorney, and she joins us tonight. So, Harmeet, you just saw a guy plead to a felony because he paid off his client's girlfriend with private funds in the middle of a campaign. That was considered a campaign finance violation.</p><p>Here you have the most powerful company in the world, putting its thumb on the scale on behalf of candidates, but that's not a campaign contribution? How?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Well it is a campaign finance violation. And - and if anybody thinks that this is some sort of aberration, Google has been doing this and bragging about it internally, even in the last election.</p><p>Tucker, I think, your show has previously covered the fact that Google made what, I think, one internal person at Google, a Manager at Google called silent campaign contribution by turning out the vote and contributing turnout the vote efforts in several states that were swing states for Hillary Clinton, and specifically targeting Latino voters.</p><p>I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections.</p><p>But when a corporation does it with its corporate assets, it needs to be dis - disclosed as a campaign finance violation, declared and disclosed on the other side as a campaign finance receipt by the campaign.</p><p>Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one.</p><p>And if it isn't being disclosed as such, then that is a fraud on our democracy. And you can then imagine what they're doing vis-a-vis Donald Trump.</p><p>They're already doing it to Republicans as we - you have previously reported with regard to search engine results for Republican Women, for California Republican Party, for various other Republicans. So, I think this is, you know - you know, we all think every story is important when it comes to Google and what they do online.</p><p>But this is a particularly shocking and alarming story that we really need to see our Members of Congress, Senators and the White House wake up about this issue because otherwise we aren't going to be talking about a democracy in the next two election cycles.</p><p>We'll be talking about what it used to look like before we let Big Tech takeover and control the outcome.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't see how under these circumstances, all things being equal, Donald Trump could get re-elected. I don't. And look, I mean I think we should have a free and fair election where people's votes really matter.</p><p>But under these circumstances, we're not going to have that. I wonder why the White House wouldn't - I mean they do control the Executive Branch of government. Why they wouldn't have been awakened to that but.</p><p>DHILLON: We have seen Donald Trump actually tweet about this issue in September 2018. He tweeted about, frankly, the subject matter of today's story from Breitbart and, you know, people called him a - a conspiracy theorist that it isn't true.</p><p>And, you know, now we see the evidence that actually they are doing this manipulation, and that Sundar Pichai lied to Congress about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But - but these companies skillfully spread the money around, not just to Members of Congress, but also people working in an Administration, who are looking for their exit and thinking--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: --\"Well maybe I'll work on the other side of tech policy and make a bunch of money advising Google on how to speak Conservative--</p><p>CARLSON: Scary. Scary.</p><p>DHILLON: --to Conservatives.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: That's how it happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Vladimir Putin is a much smaller threat to the United States than Google, I would say.</p><p>DHILLON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon, thank you very much.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the country is racing at high speed toward full legalization of marijuana. Why is that exactly? And what are the effects? And what do we know about marijuana? It's uncool to ask, obviously. But being middle-aged, we're going to anyway, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Christophe Guilluy is a well-known author in France. He's written a number of books about that country's middle and working classes. He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government.</p><p>Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras.</p><p>But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar.</p><p>\"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York.</p><p>Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small-business owners outside of the big cities.</p><p>Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this.</p><p>What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else.</p><p>They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests.</p><p>Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later.</p><p>Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world.</p><p>All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too.</p><p>The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix.</p><p>The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non-urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people.</p><p>We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities.</p><p>But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people.</p><p>Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe.</p><p>The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist.</p><p>But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid.</p><p>A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order.</p><p>We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles.</p><p>Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\"</p><p>Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: DRUGGED.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well every election cycle, you probably noticed, more states legalize marijuana. It could soon be legal nationwide, likely will be. But with drug abuse of all kinds soaring and American youth falling apart, is legalization a good idea? What exactly do we know about marijuana?</p><p>David Bienenstock is the Author of How To Smoke Pot Properly and co-host of the podcast, Great Moments in Weed History. David, thank you very much for coming on. So, I guess--</p><p>DAVID BIENENSTOCK, HOW TO SMOKE POT AUTHOR, GREAT MOMENTS IN WEED HISTORY PODCAST CO-HOST: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: --the first thing I noticed, there was a really interesting piece last - this week by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker. I'm sure you read it. And it asked, and he's kind of agnostic, I think, about the question of marijuana. But he made the point that we really don't know that much about the health effects of marijuana.</p><p>Most of the claims made by its proponents are unproven. But the CDC does say that there is a relationship between marijuana use and rising schizophrenia rates and violence. So, why should we legalize something that we know causes schizophrenia?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well I mean the first thing we need to understand is cannabis is objectively safer than many substances that are legal, alcohol, tobacco--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many pharmaceutical drugs. To get to your point about the book you have--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait. I mean I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We - we - could we pause for a second? How do we know that it's safer than - than alcohol and tobacco, since I don't really think we know very much about it? I mean most drugs like we've been studying--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: OK. Well here's the-</p><p>CARLSON: --nicotine for a hundreds of years and alcohol for thousands, we don't really know that much about them. So, how do - why do we say we know that when we don't really know that?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We can compare the number of people who died from each substance every year, hundreds of thousands of people from alcohol and tobacco, and zero people from cannabis. So, you know, just as a shorthand--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Well, no that's not--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --there has never been a death--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's not actually true.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --attributed to cannabis. Absolutely, it's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? There have been many deaths attributed--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Saying something that's not true--</p><p>CARLSON: --well I'm - I'm going to. If - if it is true, as the CDC says that cannabis use looks like it causes or spurs--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose of cannabis, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: --schizophrenia - hold on, hold on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose?</p><p>CARLSON: If it causes schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: How much do you have (ph) to consume?</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. What percentage of people with schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Just answer my question.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>No, I'm saying you're looking at it wrong. If weed smoking causes schizophrenia and there's a suggestion that it does, schizophrenia kills lots of people, and so does suicide, and so does violence. And if marijuana use hikes rates of violence and it seems like there's a lot of evidence that it does, then that kills people.</p><p>So, the question is not, do they die from lung cancer. The question is do they die from suicide or violence. And those are real questions, and you don't know the answers to them. So, why are you saying it's totally safe when you - you don't know that that's true?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I - I did not say it's totally safe. That's a ridiculous--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --standard. Strenuous exercise can lead to a heart attack that's fatal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Drinking too much water can be fatal. I - I think you need to understand the difference between correlation and causation.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I do understand--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The author of the book--</p><p>CARLSON: --the difference.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --apparently, you don't.</p><p>CARLSON: No, wait, I do. And what I understand most of all is the - is the basic precept of science, which is we don't know something until we prove it. And almost nothing about marijuana--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'll tell you what I--</p><p>CARLSON: --has been proven. So, why are you acting like we know when we don't?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: This is what's proven to be harmful, Tucker.</p><p>Arresting 600,000 Americans every year for making the choice to use a substance that's objectively safer than alcohol that - and doing it in a way that targets the poor and minorities disproportionately is devastating to those communities.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're making it - but I'm not arguing but - but you're--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: It creates a police state.</p><p>CARLSON: --missing. I'm - I'm not arguing in favor of that. Well you're making a parallel argument and evading the question that I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, you don't want to arrest anybody for--</p><p>CARLSON: --that they get evading (ph) - look, I'm--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you don't want to arrest anybody for cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --always for unfair application of the law. I'm always for hassling people for things that aren't really bothering others. But that's not really the question. So, I've never been for like rousting people from their homes for smoking weed. I'm totally against that.</p><p>But that's very different from legalizing it everywhere, which increases the rate of kids smoking weed. And if it really does cause schizophrenia, I should be really afraid of that. No?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well youth use is down in the states that have legalized, first of all. And, second of all, if it's not going to be legalized - answer me this. Who's going to grow and sell this cannabis?</p><p>Where is it going to magically appear from if not through a regulated taxed industry? If my aunt in Kansas comes down with cancer, where am I going to send her to buy a safe, lab-tested, medical cannabis product to save her life in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think - I think - I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Who grows and sells the cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought it was the U.S. government grew it in Mississippi for years, as you know. I mean it's look--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not - OK, OK, look, I know, OK--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people.</p><p>CARLSON: --I get it. But it's not impossible to a man--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, who's going to--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. If there - if there are - hold on, let me finish it. If the, look, again--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --who's going to grow and sell it in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: --you're throwing another red herring into the argument and evading the question.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: That's not a red herring.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if - no, it's, look, if we use opioids legally that are prescribed by physicians, it doesn't mean the average person can buy opium.</p><p>So, you could have controlled marijuana growing for its medicinal properties, which I'm willing to believe exists. I'm just saying you're talking about legalizing it, which means many more kids will smoke it.</p><p>And if it causes schizophrenia, it should scare the hell out of us, but it doesn't seem to bother you, because, I don't know, what, you're taking money from them or something? Why doesn't that bother you?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Tucker, you know, you're the one on here repeating old lies, old distortions, debunked claims, the Author of the book that you had on last week, everything he said has been completely debunked. I don't know if you've read my article on--</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --Leafly. I assume that's why you had me on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many of the people in the studies that he cited have gone on Twitter to say, \"You grossly misrepresented our findings.\"</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well let me just ask you - look, I'm not an expert on this.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The National Academy of Medicine report the Author said you misrepresent--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm happy to--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you're not an expert. But you're supposed to do your job.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, no, I'm not - my - my job - wait hold on, wait, wait, wait a second--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: You're supposed to learn about these things. Did you read my article where I debunked all of this?</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you one - let me just end on one question. Is it - this is my real concern is schizophrenia because I think it's such a terrible disease, and we can't cure it, and a lot of people die from it. It's horrible, as you know.</p><p>Is it untrue, do you think that marijuana use looks like it could increase the rate of schizophrenia? Is that a fake statistic? It's a sincere question to you.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'd say, you know, we need to know more, and we should know more. But having you and authors come on and just--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --confuse causation and correlation--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm - I'm not confuse - I'm asking--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --does no one a good service.</p><p>CARLSON: --you a sincere question. And you don't seem to be--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I will say that. Here's my sincere answer.</p><p>CARLSON: --interested in answering it.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We've had societies where the rates of cannabis use has gone way up, and the rates of schizophrenia have not gone up at all. So, to me, that would put a lot of cold water on your idea that there is an epidemic of violence and--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I thought you were just lecturing me about causation--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --schizophrenia caused by cannabis.</p><p>CARLSON: --and correlation. But then aren't - isn't that what you're doing? OK, look, I just - look, it's an open - I - I have zero interest in banning anything. I just think that we don't know that much. I don't think you really--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well, why did you have me on if you have zero--</p><p>CARLSON: --know anything (ph) and you're pretending that you do--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --interest in debating me?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I was debating you. We're out of time. David, thank you. I appreciate your coming on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well earlier today, we told you what many are saying in Washington that fast food is racist. Maybe have a salad instead. Too bad, salads are sexist now. It's 2019. And we'll have details on that, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with, along with the Second Lady. They'll make some salads. And I said, \"You guys aren't into salads.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Or do I go out, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers?</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Big Macs?</p><p>JOAN MAUREEN WALSH, JOURNALIST, NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION, POLITICAL ANALYST AT CNN, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SALON, AUTHOR: That's appalling. It seems to me like the President will not be happy until there is not one single female Republican voter in the country. It's incredibly sexist.</p><p>We aren't all here to make salads for men. It's--</p><p>ERIN ISABELLE BURNETT, ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT ANCHOR, CNN: Yes. I mean--</p><p>WALSH: --it's disgusting.</p><p>BURNETT: How in the world do you not perceive that as sexist, to say the assumption that his wife's going to go make salads for the bunch of football players? What is she, like--</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXECUTIVE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, FORMER POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: I--</p><p>BURNETT: --the cook?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Joan Walsh, ladies and gentlemen, the single most unhappy person in the world, on CNN today, melting down because the President joked about salads. Salads are now sexist. Fast food is racist. What are you allowed to eat?</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey, a brilliant unraveller of riddles and a podcast host, joins us tonight to sort it out. Thank you for coming on.</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: Yes, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Sexist salads.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes, apparently. So, I mean she was really upset over this. The first reaction she had was not to roll her eyes but to say that this was appalling.</p><p>I mean you just have to wonder what goes on in someone like Jo's - Joan's mind. In the middle of the night, is she tossing and turning, thinking about all of the ways that she can be offended.</p><p>CARLSON: But also, why wouldn't the rest of the country take life advice from someone whose own life has clearly been a disaster and--</p><p>STUCKEY: I mean well, maybe - maybe - but maybe--</p><p>CARLSON: --who is so deeply unhappy.</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes, exactly. Maybe this is why her life is such a disaster because she is hunting for something to hurt her feelings. And she's found it. She's found it in salad.</p><p>But also, I want to say that Melania probably does make salad, so this probably had nothing to do with her sex, whatsoever. She looks like someone who makes a good salad. So, that probably was all the comment at best (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She looks like a salad eater.</p><p>STUCKEY: She does.</p><p>CARLSON: And I say that as someone who should be eating salads--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --but is not. Right, that's not a--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly. Details (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not a slur. I wonder though, in the end if the best way to get people to see your way of thinking, to bring them to your side, is to scream at them for telling jokes.</p><p>STUCKEY: Probably not. But I don't think they're interested in that, not with Conservatives, and certainly not with President Trump. They just kind of repeat this thing over and over again. It's racist, sexist, whatever it is, whatever they can find in today, the poor victim was salad.</p><p>CARLSON: How long before people say, \"You know what? I - I don't really care what you call me anymore.\"</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I think that's already happening.</p><p>CARLSON: It's already happened?</p><p>STUCKEY: Don't you think Trump has already done that? I do.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know about Trump. I've definitely reached that point and this is all fake.</p><p>STUCKEY: That's good (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Allie, it's great to see you. Welcome to Washington.</p><p>STUCKEY: It's great to see you as well. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You've improved the tenor of the city by your presence.</p><p>All right, we're out of time sadly. Tomorrow night, 8:00 P.M., we'll be back, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Needless to say, DVR it if you can figure that out. I can't, but you're probably smarter.</p><p>Good night from Washington. And tonight, with looks like about 18 seconds to go, we're going to give a delayed Christmas present to our pal, Sean Hannity--</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: I--</p><p>CARLSON: --in New York.</p><p>HANNITY: --I think you made up for all of last year, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Use the time wisely, Sean. It's yours.</p><p>HANNITY: We're going to - we're going to give you the radio show. You can host my show one day. And it's going to be hitting the post. I'll teach - I'll - we'll tell you about it.</p><p>CARLSON: No way, I'm in (ph).</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, great show as always.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2167819945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-424N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

We're going to take a night here. Lots of emails coming in. Keep them coming. That's the story for tonight. Tucker Carlson, up next live in D.C.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are.</p><p>Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember.</p><p>Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office.</p><p>So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR 16TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, TEXAS: Will fight when necessary against a President who's focused on building walls.</p><p>No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns.</p><p>Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem.</p><p>We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever!</p><p>Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram.</p><p>But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people.</p><p>O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls.</p><p>As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\"</p><p>Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions.</p><p>The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it.</p><p>When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat.</p><p>Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind.</p><p>Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper.</p><p>Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?</p><p>And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial.</p><p>Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country?</p><p>A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it.</p><p>Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that.</p><p>So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?</p><p>NATE LERNER, CO-FOUNDER, DRAFTBETO.ORG: Right. Right, so on the - on the surface and taken out of context, that certainly sounds bad. But what he's actually talking about is a--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, different.</p><p>LERNER: --is a very common approach to Constitutional law. Constitutional scholars for centuries have debated if the Constitution should be taken literally and at word or if it's a living breathing document that we--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LERNER: --should interpret as things change.</p><p>And guess what? Our country has changed and the world has changed quite a bit in the last 200-plus years. And what Beto was saying is that perhaps we need to re-visit parts of the Constitution as a result. That's - that's a very common discussion that--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Look--</p><p>LERNER: --that scholars would have.</p><p>CARLSON: --and I'm open-minded. And, by the way, there are things in the Constitution, you know, I - I think we should always have conversations about everything--</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --that we disagree with. But what specifically is he talking about? I think it's also fair to ask, what principles need to be revised.</p><p>LERNER: You know, I - I'm not a spokesperson for Beto or for his campaign. But, you know, I do understand what he's saying as far as needing to re-visit parts of the Constitution. I think the Electoral College is a really good example where you are empowering some voters more so than others, and giving them more of a voice than others.</p><p>And that's - that's really unfair and not what our democracy's about. That's a very good example right there.</p><p>CARLSON: So, but what - what does that mean? Look, obviously, we're for fairness. There's a lot of unfairness. I agree with that, for sure, and we should work as hard as we can to rectify it. But just give me one example of the principles that might be changed under a Beto O'Rourke presidency?</p><p>LERNER: I - I do not speak for Beto or - or for his campaign. So I can't--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --I can't do that.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. That's totally fair enough. So, he was asked about the Border wall and he said, and I'm paraphrasing, but it's pretty close, \"We are killing people when we build Border walls.\" What is that - how are we - how are we killing people? How have we killed people by doing that?</p><p>LERNER: So, in the context of what he was talking about, he was making two points. One, if we - if when we militarize our border with Mexico, you're increasing the risk that people are going to get hurt or killed when they cross the border in their encounters with our - with our security forces and their side.</p><p>And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous.</p><p>And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people.</p><p>So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders. Democrats aren't for that despite what's often said here.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are.</p><p>LERNER: They're not.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but then - but hold on let's--</p><p>LERNER: They're for - they're for (ph) treating people like humans and treating--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. Look, I--</p><p>LERNER: --them is the seaming (ph) way.</p><p>CARLSON: --OK. So but, Mexico had over 31,000 murders last year. That's about twice the number we had in the country as a population less than half of ours. So, it's one of the most dangerous countries in the world. And so, it's fair to be concerned about that violence moving north. Any normal country--</p><p>LERNER: Well but it's also fair--</p><p>CARLSON: --would be concerned.</p><p>LERNER: --to understand that people might want to be fleeing that violence that have, you know, for their families' sake--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Because that's - that - that's true.</p><p>LERNER: --and to build up life (ph) here.</p><p>CARLSON: But I mean the - the rights and the interests of Americans come first from the perspective of the U.S. government. That's why we have the government to protect--</p><p>LERNER: 100 percent, absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: --our rights (ph). So, explain to me, and you can speak slowly if you want, how we are forcing people to come across our border illegally. How are we forcing people to come across? I - I don't understand that.</p><p>LERNER: We're not - we're not forcing people. It's just that we should be treating them in a humane and civil way because they are humans. And despite the way they have been described by Donald Trump and Republicans, you know, they're - they're not - they're not criminals. They're not rapists. They're not all drug dealers.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, they are (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Many of them are just coming here to seek better lives.</p><p>CARLSON: Well I've - I've always--</p><p>LERNER: And we need to respect and--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, but, but I--</p><p>LERNER: --appreciate that.</p><p>CARLSON: --I totally - but I've never doubted that. And some are bad people. Most are just economic migrants who want to move to a richer country.</p><p>LERNER: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: I get it. I would, as I said many times on this show, I would leave Honduras too, and I would come here illegally if I could. And I mean it. I'm not joking. So, I get it. But I'm not from Honduras. I'm from America. And I don't want people driving - driving down wages in this country.</p><p>So, don't we have a right to say, \"No, you can't come in unless we want you to come in?\"</p><p>LERNER: We absolutely have a right to - to do that. However, as Americans, we also have a duty to treat them a certain way and to respect their humanity and respect them as individuals, and not simply cast them aside.</p><p>And so, when you're - when you're looking at border security, there is a certain way that you should be treating people, and it's not forcing them to, you know, it's not - it's not putting them at a - a massive risk and potentially killing them--</p><p>CARLSON: But how are we putting--</p><p>LERNER: --instead of responding (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --wait but how - how are - if - if we erect a wall and say, you can't cross, that's the same as killing them?</p><p>LERNER: Putting up a wall does put them in greater danger because it forces them to find different points of entry. And a wall is just a massive - it's just - it's not - it doesn't accomplish anything. It doesn't solve the main problem of immigration, which is--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: --longer visa, which is we--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, OK, so, so, so I'm--</p><p>LERNER: --people are overstaying their visas. If people can (ph) just throw a--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm glad - I'm glad you're putting that. No, no--</p><p>LERNER: --rope over a wall, there's tunnels that they can use.</p><p>CARLSON: --that's totally fair. That's - that's a talking point, but it's also real, so I'm glad you mentioned it.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And, in fact, Mr. O'Rourke was - was asked it too by Jeff Bezos' newspaper, and his quote was, \"I don't know.\" Now, how could he not know? He represents Texas. He's been asked of immigration for years, and he hasn't thought through visa overstays, which, as you point out, are a driver of our crisis. How could you not have an answer to that?</p><p>LERNER: So, again, I - I - so, again, out of context, that sounds bad. But what he said after that was that he would work with the people who it's affected by, work with policymakers, work with experts, work with people on the ground who deal with this every day to find a solution.</p><p>And actually, I think it's very refreshing that a politician was willing to say, \"I don't know,\" because if you look at--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's sure.</p><p>LERNER: --where immigration reform has gone in the last 20 years, which is nowhere, I think a lot of politicians actually don't know. They have no idea what a solution is because we haven't found one. And so, what he's saying is we need to have a debate. We need to talk it over.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, look, I'm totally for that.</p><p>LERNER: Find a solution.</p><p>CARLSON: And I - and actually do agree with you.</p><p>LERNER: Right. So, sounds like you support him there.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I support being honest about not knowing. I just think--</p><p>LERNER: He's - he's just (ph) being honest.</p><p>CARLSON: --he should like try a little harder. But let me ask you something that I don't know the answer to and I'm not being mean. I'm being sincere.</p><p>LERNER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Here you had in the last election an Irish Catholic guy with a Hispanic nickname running against an actual Hispanic guy with an Anglo name. Would that seem a little weird to you, a little audacious maybe?</p><p>LERNER: You know, Ted Cruz tried to make that point as well, and Texans got over it pretty quickly.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a real point.</p><p>LERNER: It's not - it's not a real point. It's - it's - the point is moot. You know, it's - it's something that - it's something to joke about for a minute. It was his - his nickname.</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>LERNER: It's his nickname growing up. It's I guess people call Ted, you know, Ted Cruz, Ted, his higher enough (ph) as well. And it's - it's not - it's not something people care about. People care about real issues.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know. Well, I asked about real issues and I ended it with, as you pointed out, joking about it for a second, which I didn't have (ph).</p><p>LERNER: Very fair.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate your coming on Nate. Thank you very much.</p><p>LERNER: Of course, anytime.</p><p>CARLSON: Well from The View to all the dumb people on television, what you're hearing this week, and it really is a talking point of the week, is that everybody who's not a Democrat is by nature a bigot. It's what they're telling you.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson responds to that after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well if you've watched TV this week, you have heard this week's talking point. Republicans and the people who vote for them are bigots, every one of them. The geniuses over at The View, the daytime TV show, suggested that almost half the country's just flat-out immoral, and should be shunned on those grounds. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNNY HOSTIN, ABC NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; ANALYST, THE VIEW CO-HOST, COLUMNIST, MULTI-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SOCIAL COMMENTATOR: But will Republicans now step up to the plate with Donald Trump because he has been using, I think, the Border wall as sort of this dog whistle for racism.

It's The View. You can write it off like what do they know. But it wasn't just The View. Nicole Wallace had a real job at one point. She was White House Communications Director briefly, I think, under last Republican Administration. Here's her view.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ANCHOR, CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC AND NBC NEWS: This does not have a parallel on the Left. They're just - they're just - it - it doesn't. There isn't. There isn't a strain of racism on the Left.</p><p>I don't so - so, I think that - that this gets brushed under the rug. People sort of tolerate - it's been normalized. Like you just said, they don't have anywhere else to go, so they attach to the Republican Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. No racists on the Left, literally not one, says Nicole Wallace.</p><p>Over in ESPN, one of their hosts suggested it was racist, not surprisingly, for the President to serve the Clemson Football Team fast food at the White House. Fast food is the food of bigots. Of course.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOLLY QERIM ROSE, SPORTS ANCHOR AND MODERATOR, ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: When I saw him giving the football players, it's - it's a predominantly Black sport, and fast food, my thought went - went a very different place. Also a - a bunch of--</p><p>MAX KELLERMAN, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, BOXING COMMENTATOR, CO-HOST OF ESPN'S FIRST TAKE: I think the - I think the President likes fast food.</p><p>ROSE: --a bunch of--</p><p>STEPHEN ANTHONY SMITH, AMERICAN SPORTS TELEVISION PERSONALITY, SPORTS RADIO HOST, SPORTS JOURNALIST, ACTOR, ESPN FIRST TAKE COMMENTATOR: Yes.</p><p>ROSE: --Macs (ph). I mean come on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. OK. So, the consensus is the racism is on the Right. Only Conservatives can be racist. So that raises a few questions.</p><p>What exactly is racism? What does it look like? How'd if - you know if you are racist. And so, we have a handily checklist for you. Get a pen and follow along. See if you can answer these questions.</p><p>A racist - what would a racist do? A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done.</p><p>They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes.</p><p>They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right?</p><p>People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do.</p><p>Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>You know what I noticed, Professor Hanson, and maybe I'm just making this up in my head, but it seems like people have a tendency to accuse others of doing the exact thing that they are doing. Have you noticed that?</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I think it's really dangerous throughout history when you have a group that sets themselves up as the arbiters of morality.</p><p>We saw that with the Catholic Church and the abuse problems. We saw that in the #MeToo and the Hollywood liberals like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey.</p><p>They feel that they're not subject to the same standards they demand of others. And what's going on here is that if I think that Representative King confused Western civilization with White and - Whiteness, and they're not synonymous, especially in the global world.</p><p>Japan can be more Western than - than Russia. But the point is--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's just interesting that if you--</p><p>HANSON: --we got to find out what the rules are, Tucker because while--</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's what I mean--</p><p>HANSON: --we're condemning him, we have Hank Johnson, another Member of the Congress, who recently said, compared Jews in Israel to termites.</p><p>And then we've got the Editor Board - a person on the Editorial Board in the New York Times, Sarah Jeong, who said, literally (ph), I hate White people, and compared them to dogs urinating on hydrants. The New York Times was not upset.</p><p>Then we've got this whole trope now in - in rap music, all the major marquee rappers, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Scarface, it's just rampant anti-Semitism. And we saw LeBron James, our national icon, re-tweeting an anti-Semitic tweet and with no - of a rapper with no consequences.</p><p>So, the American people are saying to themselves, \"Wow! What are the rules?\" And when you look at Trump supporters are not just derided as stupid or ignorant. But if you'd - this new Left-wing mode is to say that they stink. We saw that with Peter Strzok.</p><p>I think Mr. Caputo from Politico said remember that they don't have any teeth. That was echoed by Rick Wilson. He call - also called them garbage people, a piece of S-H blank, an FBI agent remarked.</p><p>And so, there's this, Jim Carrey, of all, the actor, compared Trump supporters to apes that has a long - that simian synonym and metaphor has a really bad pedigree.</p><p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that anytime somebody says we're progressive, and we're enlightened, and we're not racist, that tends human nature of being what it is to give them a blank check to - to be racist, which is your point.</p><p>Remember 2008, Tucker, when Joe Biden said, do you remember that he said about Barack Obama that he was the first Black candidate who was clean, clean and was articulate. And then Harry Reid sort of echoed that and said, he didn't have a Negro dialect and he was light-skinned.</p><p>And then, Bill Clinton said, well he would have been serving his coffee. Even - even Al Sharpton tried to contextualize that because the idea, again, was these are good--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: --Progressives. They're good people. They couldn't be--</p><p>CARLSON: It's awful.</p><p>HANSON: --guilty of racism.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HANSON: That's not a window into their soul. It is with Republicans. But with Democrats and Progressives and Left is they're just inadvertent or it's allowed (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Well, these are just tools they use--</p><p>HANSON: It's very dangerous to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: --to win power. And we should remember that. Professor, thank you very much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: By the way, if they meant it, then the Southern Poverty Law Center wouldn't have been on a lot of this stuff. You've heard of the SPLC. It's a phony anti-hate group that exists to crush people they don't like, to tar Conservatives organizations as fellow travelers with the KKK or whatever.</p><p>Mark Krikorian is Executive Director at the Center for Immigration Studies. His group just sued the SPLC for designating them as a hate group. Finally, someone is fighting back against this. What is the basis of this lawsuit, Mark?</p><p>MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: Our attorneys decided the way to go was to file a RICO lawsuit, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which is used in the criminal part by, you know, against the Mafia or whatever, by the government.</p><p>But there are civil parts where private individuals can file suit. And the basis of the claim is they are committing wire fraud, by falsely describing us as a hate group in order to do harm to my organization.</p><p>CARLSON: Has it done harm to your organization being designated (ph)?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's done some. I mean, you know, we've - we have a - a body - a reputation and a body of work that makes it hard to plausibly call us a hate group. And we've testified before Congress more than a 100 times. We've been cited in Supreme Court decision.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: We published real professors, the work of - of professors from legitimate universities. Nonetheless, it has, in fact, had an effect. One example that we mentioned in the suit, Amazon has this program where you can designate a non-profit group to get a small amount of revenue every time you buy something.</p><p>We were removed from that program. And the person who communicated that to us made the mistake of actually saying what the reason was. In print, he said, we just get our list from the SPLC.</p><p>CARLSON: So, it's just - that's what's remarkable to me. So, the SPLC is just the Praetorian Guard of the Democratic Party, obviously, fighting for the status quo, seeking to crush anyone who stands in the way of power. But they still seem to be taken seriously by media outlets, and by companies like Amazon. Why?</p><p>KRIKORIAN: It's good question. I'm not sure why. I mean I think there, you know, this is some - a kind of thing you see a lot in the tech industry, for instance, where they just assume that Progressive political views are just the normal political views, and anybody who doesn't hold them, somehow, is weird is, and to be shunned.</p><p>And I think that's part of what it is. You see the same thing with journalism where a lot of media simply cite the SPLC's hate group designation as just sort of a fact. You know, this person is this old. He's wearing, you know, a blue suit, and he's been designated as a, you know, hate group by the SPLC.</p><p>That's starting to change because they really have overreached, and they've gotten slapped down a couple of times. There was a Muslim reformer, a liberal Muslim--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --anti-extremist--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: --they labeled him as an extremist. And he sued. They settled because they knew they were going to lose for as (ph) $3 million-plus. I don't expect them to go quite that easily in this case. But I think we have a pretty strong case.</p><p>CARLSON: You have a very strong case. And I looked at the accusations they leveled against you, because you're a guest on this show and I was interested, and they have - there's no basis for saying that about you. It was shocking. It was, I think, it's libel. But we're rooting for you, of course.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Mark, thank you.</p><p>KRIKORIAN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well a new report exposes Google for blacklisting certain video searches on YouTube. You can probably guess who they targeted. We've got the details after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Big tech companies try to control what you see online, of course. But they also try to control what you don't see.</p><p>A new report, a shocking one, from Breitbart exposes the existence of a Google blacklist for, quote, controversial YouTube queries, questions you ask on YouTube, trying to find videos.</p><p>The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion. After receiving a complaint from a political activist posing as a reporter at Slate.com, there are a lot of those, Google intervened to bury pro-life videos on YouTube, and replace them in search with pro-abortion videos.</p><p>For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN. Well, in a statement, YouTube denied doing anything wrong and said any shifts were purely due to their algorithms which, of course, are controlled by people.</p><p>Robert Epstein has spent a lot of time looking into this question. He's a Senior Research Psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he joins us tonight. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>You were the first person I thought of when I read this story because you have done, I think, the cutting-edge research into the effect of search - Google search, and other digital platforms on human behavior and political behavior.</p><p>So, what kind of effect could this sort of distortion have on an election?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY, PROFESSOR, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST: Well, Tucker, it would have a devastating effect. And, you know, as you know, I am not a Conservative.</p><p>CARLSON: I do.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I - I - I love America. I love democracy. And I think we should all be rising above our politics here and recognize the extreme danger that we're facing when a company like Google can basically censor anything it wants to censor.</p><p>Now, this new set of leaks is extraordinary because it confirms things that I and others have been saying and writing for years. It confirms, number one that individual employees at Google have the power to manually remove material, remove content that we see. And they do so often with political ends.</p><p>And number two, this tells us that Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, committed perjury when he testified before Congress a few weeks ago, because he said quite specifically that Google never does this.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean I - my frustration levels are so high, I don't want to take it out on you. But the first thought is well, why isn't he being recalled back to Congress to explain himself or face charges because you're not allowed to commit perjury.</p><p>But my question is can any of us trust that the next election won't be swayed dramatically in one direction by interference from the tech companies?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I guarantee you that this past election was affected. I'll be releasing some - some data on this, I hope, in early March that'll make the point beyond any doubt.</p><p>I also just published a piece in which I showed that just one manipulation on Google's part, on Election Day, their Go Vote reminder, that one reminder, that Go Vote reminder shifted between 800,000 and 4.6 million votes to Democratic candidates on Election Day in 2018.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why - why isn't this the hacking of our democracy? I mean how can you have a democracy under these circumstances?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, democracy is a kind of illusion at this point because we have let these companies, Google more than any other, go completely wild. There are no rules, no regulations, no laws that restrict anything they do.</p><p>And again, the more one looks at what it is they're actually doing, and these new leaks help a lot, in my opinion, the closer one looks at what they're doing, the more outraged one should become.</p><p>And I want to emphasize, we should all be outraged, not just Conservatives.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I agree. I hope that what you just said pings around the internet unimpeded and winds up in the inbox of every Member of Congress on both sides. Robert, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My pleasure, always.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nobody covering this? It's a great question. And this question as well. Google's manipulation, the one we just told you about, why isn't that a violation of campaign finance law? The companies YouTube blacklist, for example, allegedly suppress negative videos about Maxine Waters. Why is that not an in-kind contribution to Maxine Waters?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, unlike us, is an attorney, and she joins us tonight. So, Harmeet, you just saw a guy plead to a felony because he paid off his client's girlfriend with private funds in the middle of a campaign. That was considered a campaign finance violation.</p><p>Here you have the most powerful company in the world, putting its thumb on the scale on behalf of candidates, but that's not a campaign contribution? How?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Well it is a campaign finance violation. And - and if anybody thinks that this is some sort of aberration, Google has been doing this and bragging about it internally, even in the last election.</p><p>Tucker, I think, your show has previously covered the fact that Google made what, I think, one internal person at Google, a Manager at Google called silent campaign contribution by turning out the vote and contributing turnout the vote efforts in several states that were swing states for Hillary Clinton, and specifically targeting Latino voters.</p><p>I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections.</p><p>But when a corporation does it with its corporate assets, it needs to be dis - disclosed as a campaign finance violation, declared and disclosed on the other side as a campaign finance receipt by the campaign.</p><p>Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one.</p><p>And if it isn't being disclosed as such, then that is a fraud on our democracy. And you can then imagine what they're doing vis-a-vis Donald Trump.</p><p>They're already doing it to Republicans as we - you have previously reported with regard to search engine results for Republican Women, for California Republican Party, for various other Republicans. So, I think this is, you know - you know, we all think every story is important when it comes to Google and what they do online.</p><p>But this is a particularly shocking and alarming story that we really need to see our Members of Congress, Senators and the White House wake up about this issue because otherwise we aren't going to be talking about a democracy in the next two election cycles.</p><p>We'll be talking about what it used to look like before we let Big Tech takeover and control the outcome.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I don't see how under these circumstances, all things being equal, Donald Trump could get re-elected. I don't. And look, I mean I think we should have a free and fair election where people's votes really matter.</p><p>But under these circumstances, we're not going to have that. I wonder why the White House wouldn't - I mean they do control the Executive Branch of government. Why they wouldn't have been awakened to that but.</p><p>DHILLON: We have seen Donald Trump actually tweet about this issue in September 2018. He tweeted about, frankly, the subject matter of today's story from Breitbart and, you know, people called him a - a conspiracy theorist that it isn't true.</p><p>And, you know, now we see the evidence that actually they are doing this manipulation, and that Sundar Pichai lied to Congress about it.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: But - but these companies skillfully spread the money around, not just to Members of Congress, but also people working in an Administration, who are looking for their exit and thinking--</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>DHILLON: --\"Well maybe I'll work on the other side of tech policy and make a bunch of money advising Google on how to speak Conservative--</p><p>CARLSON: Scary. Scary.</p><p>DHILLON: --to Conservatives.\"</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: That's how it happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Vladimir Putin is a much smaller threat to the United States than Google, I would say.</p><p>DHILLON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: Harmeet Dhillon, thank you very much.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the country is racing at high speed toward full legalization of marijuana. Why is that exactly? And what are the effects? And what do we know about marijuana? It's uncool to ask, obviously. But being middle-aged, we're going to anyway, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Christophe Guilluy is a well-known author in France. He's written a number of books about that country's middle and working classes. He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government.</p><p>Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras.</p><p>But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar.</p><p>\"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York.</p><p>Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small-business owners outside of the big cities.</p><p>Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this.</p><p>What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else.</p><p>They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests.</p><p>Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later.</p><p>Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world.</p><p>All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too.</p><p>The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix.</p><p>The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non-urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people.</p><p>We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities.</p><p>But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people.</p><p>Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe.</p><p>The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist.</p><p>But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid.</p><p>A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order.</p><p>We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles.</p><p>Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\"</p><p>Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>TEXT: DRUGGED.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well every election cycle, you probably noticed, more states legalize marijuana. It could soon be legal nationwide, likely will be. But with drug abuse of all kinds soaring and American youth falling apart, is legalization a good idea? What exactly do we know about marijuana?</p><p>David Bienenstock is the Author of How To Smoke Pot Properly and co-host of the podcast, Great Moments in Weed History. David, thank you very much for coming on. So, I guess--</p><p>DAVID BIENENSTOCK, HOW TO SMOKE POT AUTHOR, GREAT MOMENTS IN WEED HISTORY PODCAST CO-HOST: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: --the first thing I noticed, there was a really interesting piece last - this week by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker. I'm sure you read it. And it asked, and he's kind of agnostic, I think, about the question of marijuana. But he made the point that we really don't know that much about the health effects of marijuana.</p><p>Most of the claims made by its proponents are unproven. But the CDC does say that there is a relationship between marijuana use and rising schizophrenia rates and violence. So, why should we legalize something that we know causes schizophrenia?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well I mean the first thing we need to understand is cannabis is objectively safer than many substances that are legal, alcohol, tobacco--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many pharmaceutical drugs. To get to your point about the book you have--</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, wait. I mean I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We - we - could we pause for a second? How do we know that it's safer than - than alcohol and tobacco, since I don't really think we know very much about it? I mean most drugs like we've been studying--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: OK. Well here's the-</p><p>CARLSON: --nicotine for a hundreds of years and alcohol for thousands, we don't really know that much about them. So, how do - why do we say we know that when we don't really know that?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We can compare the number of people who died from each substance every year, hundreds of thousands of people from alcohol and tobacco, and zero people from cannabis. So, you know, just as a shorthand--</p><p>CARLSON: Really? Well, no that's not--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --there has never been a death--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's not actually true.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --attributed to cannabis. Absolutely, it's true.</p><p>CARLSON: Really? There have been many deaths attributed--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Saying something that's not true--</p><p>CARLSON: --well I'm - I'm going to. If - if it is true, as the CDC says that cannabis use looks like it causes or spurs--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose of cannabis, Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: --schizophrenia - hold on, hold on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: What is the lethal dose?</p><p>CARLSON: If it causes schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: How much do you have (ph) to consume?</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. What percentage of people with schizophrenia--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Just answer my question.</p><p>CARLSON: --right.</p><p>No, I'm saying you're looking at it wrong. If weed smoking causes schizophrenia and there's a suggestion that it does, schizophrenia kills lots of people, and so does suicide, and so does violence. And if marijuana use hikes rates of violence and it seems like there's a lot of evidence that it does, then that kills people.</p><p>So, the question is not, do they die from lung cancer. The question is do they die from suicide or violence. And those are real questions, and you don't know the answers to them. So, why are you saying it's totally safe when you - you don't know that that's true?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I - I did not say it's totally safe. That's a ridiculous--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --standard. Strenuous exercise can lead to a heart attack that's fatal.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Drinking too much water can be fatal. I - I think you need to understand the difference between correlation and causation.</p><p>CARLSON: I - I do understand--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The author of the book--</p><p>CARLSON: --the difference.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --apparently, you don't.</p><p>CARLSON: No, wait, I do. And what I understand most of all is the - is the basic precept of science, which is we don't know something until we prove it. And almost nothing about marijuana--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'll tell you what I--</p><p>CARLSON: --has been proven. So, why are you acting like we know when we don't?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: This is what's proven to be harmful, Tucker.</p><p>Arresting 600,000 Americans every year for making the choice to use a substance that's objectively safer than alcohol that - and doing it in a way that targets the poor and minorities disproportionately is devastating to those communities.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're making it - but I'm not arguing but - but you're--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: It creates a police state.</p><p>CARLSON: --missing. I'm - I'm not arguing in favor of that. Well you're making a parallel argument and evading the question that I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, you don't want to arrest anybody for--</p><p>CARLSON: --that they get evading (ph) - look, I'm--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you don't want to arrest anybody for cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --always for unfair application of the law. I'm always for hassling people for things that aren't really bothering others. But that's not really the question. So, I've never been for like rousting people from their homes for smoking weed. I'm totally against that.</p><p>But that's very different from legalizing it everywhere, which increases the rate of kids smoking weed. And if it really does cause schizophrenia, I should be really afraid of that. No?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well youth use is down in the states that have legalized, first of all. And, second of all, if it's not going to be legalized - answer me this. Who's going to grow and sell this cannabis?</p><p>Where is it going to magically appear from if not through a regulated taxed industry? If my aunt in Kansas comes down with cancer, where am I going to send her to buy a safe, lab-tested, medical cannabis product to save her life in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I think - I think - I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Who grows and sells the cannabis?</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought it was the U.S. government grew it in Mississippi for years, as you know. I mean it's look--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not - OK, OK, look, I know, OK--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: For seven people.</p><p>CARLSON: --I get it. But it's not impossible to a man--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: So, who's going to--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on. If there - if there are - hold on, let me finish it. If the, look, again--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --who's going to grow and sell it in your system?</p><p>CARLSON: --you're throwing another red herring into the argument and evading the question.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: That's not a red herring.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if - no, it's, look, if we use opioids legally that are prescribed by physicians, it doesn't mean the average person can buy opium.</p><p>So, you could have controlled marijuana growing for its medicinal properties, which I'm willing to believe exists. I'm just saying you're talking about legalizing it, which means many more kids will smoke it.</p><p>And if it causes schizophrenia, it should scare the hell out of us, but it doesn't seem to bother you, because, I don't know, what, you're taking money from them or something? Why doesn't that bother you?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Tucker, you know, you're the one on here repeating old lies, old distortions, debunked claims, the Author of the book that you had on last week, everything he said has been completely debunked. I don't know if you've read my article on--</p><p>CARLSON: Really?</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --Leafly. I assume that's why you had me on. But--</p><p>CARLSON: No. I--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --many of the people in the studies that he cited have gone on Twitter to say, \"You grossly misrepresented our findings.\"</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well let me just ask you - look, I'm not an expert on this.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: The National Academy of Medicine report the Author said you misrepresent--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm happy to--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --you're not an expert. But you're supposed to do your job.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, no, I'm not - my - my job - wait hold on, wait, wait, wait a second--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: You're supposed to learn about these things. Did you read my article where I debunked all of this?</p><p>CARLSON: --let me ask you one - let me just end on one question. Is it - this is my real concern is schizophrenia because I think it's such a terrible disease, and we can't cure it, and a lot of people die from it. It's horrible, as you know.</p><p>Is it untrue, do you think that marijuana use looks like it could increase the rate of schizophrenia? Is that a fake statistic? It's a sincere question to you.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I'd say, you know, we need to know more, and we should know more. But having you and authors come on and just--</p><p>CARLSON: I mean--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --confuse causation and correlation--</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm - I'm not confuse - I'm asking--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --does no one a good service.</p><p>CARLSON: --you a sincere question. And you don't seem to be--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: I will say that. Here's my sincere answer.</p><p>CARLSON: --interested in answering it.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: We've had societies where the rates of cannabis use has gone way up, and the rates of schizophrenia have not gone up at all. So, to me, that would put a lot of cold water on your idea that there is an epidemic of violence and--</p><p>CARLSON: Well I thought you were just lecturing me about causation--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --schizophrenia caused by cannabis.</p><p>CARLSON: --and correlation. But then aren't - isn't that what you're doing? OK, look, I just - look, it's an open - I - I have zero interest in banning anything. I just think that we don't know that much. I don't think you really--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Well, why did you have me on if you have zero--</p><p>CARLSON: --know anything (ph) and you're pretending that you do--</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: --interest in debating me?</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. I - I was debating you. We're out of time. David, thank you. I appreciate your coming on.</p><p>BIENENSTOCK: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well earlier today, we told you what many are saying in Washington that fast food is racist. Maybe have a salad instead. Too bad, salads are sexist now. It's 2019. And we'll have details on that, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Do we give you some little quick salads that the First Lady will make, along with, along with the Second Lady. They'll make some salads. And I said, \"You guys aren't into salads.\"</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Or do I go out, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, do I go out and send out for about 1,000 hamburgers?</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>TRUMP: Big Macs?</p><p>JOAN MAUREEN WALSH, JOURNALIST, NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION, POLITICAL ANALYST AT CNN, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SALON, AUTHOR: That's appalling. It seems to me like the President will not be happy until there is not one single female Republican voter in the country. It's incredibly sexist.</p><p>We aren't all here to make salads for men. It's--</p><p>ERIN ISABELLE BURNETT, ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT ANCHOR, CNN: Yes. I mean--</p><p>WALSH: --it's disgusting.</p><p>BURNETT: How in the world do you not perceive that as sexist, to say the assumption that his wife's going to go make salads for the bunch of football players? What is she, like--</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXECUTIVE, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, FORMER POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION: I--</p><p>BURNETT: --the cook?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Joan Walsh, ladies and gentlemen, the single most unhappy person in the world, on CNN today, melting down because the President joked about salads. Salads are now sexist. Fast food is racist. What are you allowed to eat?</p><p>Allie Beth Stuckey, a brilliant unraveller of riddles and a podcast host, joins us tonight to sort it out. Thank you for coming on.</p><p>ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST, CRTV: Yes, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Sexist salads.</p><p>STUCKEY: Yes, apparently. So, I mean she was really upset over this. The first reaction she had was not to roll her eyes but to say that this was appalling.</p><p>I mean you just have to wonder what goes on in someone like Jo's - Joan's mind. In the middle of the night, is she tossing and turning, thinking about all of the ways that she can be offended.</p><p>CARLSON: But also, why wouldn't the rest of the country take life advice from someone whose own life has clearly been a disaster and--</p><p>STUCKEY: I mean well, maybe - maybe - but maybe--</p><p>CARLSON: --who is so deeply unhappy.</p><p>STUCKEY: --yes, exactly. Maybe this is why her life is such a disaster because she is hunting for something to hurt her feelings. And she's found it. She's found it in salad.</p><p>But also, I want to say that Melania probably does make salad, so this probably had nothing to do with her sex, whatsoever. She looks like someone who makes a good salad. So, that probably was all the comment at best (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: She looks like a salad eater.</p><p>STUCKEY: She does.</p><p>CARLSON: And I say that as someone who should be eating salads--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: --but is not. Right, that's not a--</p><p>STUCKEY: Exactly. Details (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --it's not a slur. I wonder though, in the end if the best way to get people to see your way of thinking, to bring them to your side, is to scream at them for telling jokes.</p><p>STUCKEY: Probably not. But I don't think they're interested in that, not with Conservatives, and certainly not with President Trump. They just kind of repeat this thing over and over again. It's racist, sexist, whatever it is, whatever they can find in today, the poor victim was salad.</p><p>CARLSON: How long before people say, \"You know what? I - I don't really care what you call me anymore.\"</p><p>STUCKEY: Oh, I think that's already happening.</p><p>CARLSON: It's already happened?</p><p>STUCKEY: Don't you think Trump has already done that? I do.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't know about Trump. I've definitely reached that point and this is all fake.</p><p>STUCKEY: That's good (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Allie, it's great to see you. Welcome to Washington.</p><p>STUCKEY: It's great to see you as well. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You've improved the tenor of the city by your presence.</p><p>All right, we're out of time sadly. Tomorrow night, 8:00 P.M., we'll be back, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Needless to say, DVR it if you can figure that out. I can't, but you're probably smarter.</p><p>Good night from Washington. And tonight, with looks like about 18 seconds to go, we're going to give a delayed Christmas present to our pal, Sean Hannity--</p><p>SEAN HANNITY- HOST: I--</p><p>CARLSON: --in New York.</p><p>HANNITY: --I think you made up for all of last year, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Use the time wisely, Sean. It's yours.</p><p>HANNITY: We're going to - we're going to give you the radio show. You can host my show one day. And it's going to be hitting the post. I'll teach - I'll - we'll tell you about it.</p><p>CARLSON: No way, I'm in (ph).</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, great show as always.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2167819945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V73-6FN1-DY0W-42XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

This article appears in the Summer 2019 issue ofThe American Prospectmagazine.Subscribe here[1]. Ispent the day after the 2016 election at Yale Law School, Hillary Clinton's alma mater. I was supposed to speak to a foreclosure litigation class about my bookChain of Title[2], and then address the local chapter of the American Constitution Society over lunch. I got through the class, but the lunch speech never came off; Yale Law students were too deep in grieving mode over the results of the election. </p><p>The catered lunch was still there, so my contact and I went down to eat in this huge, empty lecture hall where I had been scheduled to speak. As I looked up, already demoralized by the day's events, I saw the massive portrait of one of Yale Law's former professors: Robert Bork. What struck me in that moment, and now, is that Robert Bork had won. Not because Donald Trump was elected, although there is a direct through line between Bork's contributions to jurisprudence and Trump's success, as I'll explain later. No, Bork had won long before he became nationally known as a failed Supreme Court nominee. In a very real sense, we're living in a world Robert Bork constructed. We're all breathing Robert Bork's air, suffering through Robert Bork's wage stagnation and inequality, limping through Robert Bork's twisted version of democracy. Robert Bork changed U.S. policy toward concentrated corporate power without ever serving as an elected official, without altering a single line of text in any statute. His bookThe Antitrust Paradoxsimply reinterpreted the Sherman Antitrust Act as entirely concerned with consumer welfare, defined narrowly as efficiently delivering goods at low prices. He had written the concepts of democracy or economic liberty or protection of markets completely out of the story. After a decades-long crusade, aided by a network of University of Chicago scholars, Reagan administration appointees, judges, corporate lobbyists, and executives, and even some willing Democrats, Bork got the antitrust establishment to adopt his circumscribed, dangerous vision. Federal policy on monopolies, once a subject of public interest, became a cloistered venue for economists, who build models singing the praises of the efficiencies derived from corporate combinations. The next 40 years tell the rest of the story. We've seen economic gains funneled to the very top; monopolization of core industries in technology, health care, communications, defense, and agriculture; a completely anomalous situation of soaring corporate profits amid low private and public investment; a degradation in quality service, because monopolists don't have to compete for your business to thrive; a slow death of entrepreneurship and innovation, with incumbents sitting on their personal fiefdoms and talented people unable to get their ideas into the marketplace; and a democracy that responds only to the very few. Whether you're an environmentalist trying to save the planet from devastation, or a fast-food worker in need of a living wage for your family, or a student survivor of a mass shooting who wants to save lives, you're fighting concentrated corporate power. If you want to travel on an airline, or sign up for cable and internet, or drink a beer, or get treatment for illness, you're transacting with concentrated corporate power. You can see concentrated corporate power's effects in a supermarket aisle, with shelves and shelves full of brands and products that, if you look at the name of the corporate parent on the back, turn out to be from a handful of companies. We have the illusion of choice, but the reality of a captured economy. And yes\u2014the presence of Too Big to Fail banks that crashed our economy and then held up the political system for a bailout convinced many Americans that we had a rigged system, beliefs ripe for a right-wing demagogue to exploit. Moreover, a primary reason Trump sneaked through the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote is that corporate concentration has led to a regional hollowing out, where a few superstar cities with dominant firms have pulled away from the rest of the country, leaving despair in their wake. Startups are heavily concentrated in big cities, while everywhere else, chain stores have replaced mom-and-pop businesses, finance comes from Wall Street instead of local lenders, and money flows out of these regions instead of into them. That too is a monopoly problem. There was a time in America, during the last Gilded Age, when monopoly power played a central role in our political debates. The 1912 election presented multiple solutions for the problem of monopoly, and Woodrow Wilson (and his top adviser, Louis Brandeis) won, with their economic vision of dismantling concentrated power and democratizing corporate America\u2014a project largely halted by our entry into World War I. But today, after decades of near-silence, antitrust\u2014the idea and the movement\u2014has been reborn, midwifed by an economy warped by the concentration of business and the concentration of power. There hasn't been this much talk about monopoly on the presidential campaign trail in over 100 years. Bernie Sanders, in his June speech defending democratic socialism, stated: 'We see huge private monopolies\u2014operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers\u2014with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives.' Sanders has little in common with centrist John Hickenlooper, who hasantagonized Sanders supporters[3]by excoriating their socialist beliefs. But the former Colorado governor, too, hasdecried[4]'competition-strangling mega-firms in many sectors after decades of erosion in antitrust enforcement.' This unanimity spans the full spectrum of the Democratic field, fromJohn Delaney[5]toAmy Klobuchar[6]to Elizabeth Warren, whose proposal tobreak up tech giants[7]has galvanized talk of anti-monopoly policy in the 2020 race. She's backed that up with plans tobust up Big Ag[8], and has long sought totake on big banks[9]. I interviewed Warren about her anti-monopoly work for this section (see page 43). The broader political system is coming around, too. The Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Justice Department, in what seemed like a prelude tolong-delayed action[10], announced they had divvied up Facebook and Amazon (FTC) and Google and Apple (DOJ) for future investigations. In early June, the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committeeheld hearings[11]on the market power of tech platforms and its effect on a free press. This was 'the first significant antitrust investigation undertaken by Congress in decades,' noted subcommittee chair David Cicilline. The hearings, along with the investigations, were bipartisan. So was aremarkable hearing[12]in the House Oversight Committee in May about a military spare-parts contractor calledTransDigm. Committee members ranging from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the left to Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows on the right successfully demanded that the company return $16.1 million in excess profits gained through controlling a monopoly on small parts and marking them up, in one case, by as much as 4,451 percent. This special section ofThe American Prospecthighlights several sectors where monopoly power has run amok, and seeks to understand how these markets went awry and what we can do about it. We examine how the digital platforms control vast amounts of online advertising, peeking under the hood of the process to show the linkages between the loss of our privacy and the concentration of market power. We delve into the insulin market, questioning how a 100-year-old drug could possibly have tripled in price in a decade. We explain the big banks' latest maneuver to frustrate regulation by touting financial literacy programs in an effort to displace the burden for fair dealing onto the individual customer. And we show how antitrust laws have been distorted to reinforce the power of big business, while preventing associations of workers or small producers from banding together to exercise power on their own. The destruction of antitrust policy and the resulting extreme concentration of market power is one more example of the disgrace of neoliberal ideology\u2014the claim that markets can regulate themselves in the public interest. In a concentrated, laissez-faire economic system, regulation does not go away: But private businesses in effect become the regulators, and instead of democratic decision-making we get decisions handed down from the corporate boardroom. The result is naked, predatory self-interest. We intend to stay on the case, as we keep exploring the multiple failures of neoliberal ideology when it is applied as policy. The new awakening on the campaign trail, among regulators, and in the halls of Congress on the dangers of monopoly power won't get very far, however, unless it's matched by a wave of public indignation. Historically, the ability to counteract monopolies has come not from Washington but only when the public demands that their representatives put America back on track. The first step to pursuing a sustained battle lies in understanding the full scope of the challenge that corporate concentration poses. Let this section be part of that guide.

They are the BAT troika of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have certainly had some \u2018down\u2019 moments over the past couple of decades (just ask Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma who is retiring, willingly or otherwise, on September 10). But the overall direction has been upwards and at a meteoric speed that even their founders never envisaged when they respectively set up their companies in 2000, 1998 and 1999.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But their success is attracting domestic detractors who are starting to question the extent of the power they wield. In retrospect, such criticisms may prove to be an early warning sign that the BAT troika will end up following the same path as the increasingly embattled US tech giants known as FAANGs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over in the US, the House of Representatives opened antitrust hearings in mid-June to determine whether four of the five FAANGs are stifling competition and penalising consumers. The Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Amazon and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will examine Apple and Facebook.</p><p>The FAANGs\u2019 higher-ranking officials have already tried to play the China card in a bid to avoid being dismantled. In May, Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg, told CNBC that \u201cwhile people are concerned with the size and power of tech companies, there\u2019s also a concern in the United States with the size and power of Chinese companies and the realisation that those companies are not going to be broken up\u201d.</p><p>This month, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO argued along similar lines to CNN. \u201cThere are many countries around the world, which aspire to be the next Silicon Valley,\u201d he commented \u201cAnd they\u2019re supporting their companies too.\u201d</p><p>Yet back in China, the very same arguments about the suffocating effects of monopolies are rearing their head. One important voice has just joined the fray: Weiyangx.com, an influential news portal run by the fintech lab of Tsinghua University\u2019s PBC School of Finance.</p><p>In a lengthy article published on June 18, an anonymous columnist complained that the BAT troika behave like oligarchs in the fintech sphere to the long-term detriment of the economy and consumers. The article highlighted how their incredible financial firepower means they can (and do) buy up or invest in just about every promising start-up going.</p><p>Indeed Alibaba-backed Ant Financial\u2019s $14 billion financing round in 2018 not only ranked as the world\u2019s second largest fintech deal of the year (after Blackstone\u2019s $17 billion acquisition of Thomson Reuters financial data business), but also boosted its M&amp;A war chest.</p><p>In any start-up\u2019s early days, the author acknowledged, such BAT investment is a boon for its targets, but he then argues that the future outcomes for the local fintech industry might prove less healthy. New entrants will increasingly struggle to gain ground against Alibaba and Tencent, in particular \u2013 which will either buy them or kill them by imitating their technology, he opined.</p><p>\u201cTheir investment and M&amp;A strategy is a type of siege, which will lead them to control fintech,\u201d the author pointed out. \u201cThey\u2019ll eventually become a bottleneck preventing new entrepreneurs from coming through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese monopolies will depress innovation within the fintech eco-system. Big tech authoritarianism will also impact ordinary consumers. How can there be a fair financial pact in an oligarchic financial system?\u201d</p><p>The author references similar arguments from a book about Alibaba\u2019s Ant Financial by Huang Yiping, professor of economics and deputy dean at Peking University. Huang has also argued that new entrants will struggle to replicate Ant Financial\u2019s scale and reach.</p><p>Huang points out that the Chinese government let the fintech industry develop unchecked for years before finally clamping down on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in 2018 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weekinchina.com/2019/06/the-great-implosion/\">see WiC457</url>). This crackdown has severely impacted the smaller fintech players, but the larger ones remain as powerful as ever.</p><p>According to Analysys data, the duopoly of Alipay and WeChat Pay accounted for 92.7% of third party digital payments in China at the end of 2018. Third party payments are now so huge they have eclipsed retail sales spending: Rmb47.2 trillion ($6.8 trillion) compared to Rmb38.1 trillion at the end of last year. As Thomas Friedman pointed out back in 2017, even Chinese beggars use QR codes to plead for funds on the mean streets of Beijing.</p><p>Across the border, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is wary of the impact the duo might have after last year\u2019s liberalisation measures, which created six virtual banks. The new players \u2013 which include Alibaba and Tencent-backed consortiums \u2013 will be regulated like normal banks. The regulator has also warned the tech giants that they must strike \u201can appropriate balance between the desire to build market share and the need to earn a reasonable return on assets and equity and not to engage in predatory tactics\u201d.</p><p>All three of the BAT companies have tried to pre-empt potential antitrust investigations at home by changing the way they operate across the wider fintech space. It may ultimately prove to be their saving grace. As Fortune China journalist, Derek Zhang, recently wrote, they have stopped trying to disintermediate the banks completely in favour of becoming partners in their digital transformation instead.</p><p>Baidu has made the most drastic move. Last year, it sold a majority stake in its financial services arm Du Xiaoman to a consortium including the Agricultural Bank of China, Taikang Insurance and the Carlyle Group.</p><p>The Sino-US tech war means that the emerging markets and Europe have become the favoured hunting ground for foraging abroad. Ant Financial learned its lesson the hard way after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States blocked its $1.2 billion attempted acquisition of funds transfer firm MoneyGram in early 2018 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weekinchina.com/2018/01/ant-problem/\">see WiC393</url>).</p><p>Its attention has switched to the UK, which makes sense given that Accenture recently described London as the fintech capital of Europe. In 2018, the UK attracted 50% of China\u2019s European investments or $3.9 billion in total.</p><p>The biggest deal so far this year has been Ant Financial\u2019s acquisition of World First, which the Financial Times pegs at $700 million. The company, founded in 2004, provides foreign exchange and money transfer services. It has serviced 50,000 Chinese exporters, enabling them to collect payments from around the world.</p><p>Tencent has just participated in the fifth venture capital fundraising round for TrueLayer. According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence it was one of four entities that invested $35 million in TrueLayer, which provides the technology to build financial applications that connect up with bank data, and helps to verify accounts.</p><p>Another recent Tencent investment is Argentina\u2019s Bancar Tenologica, which develops mobile banking apps. According to S&amp;P data, Tencent was the sole investor in the group\u2019s fourth venture capital round this April when it invested $44 million.</p><p>And then there is Airwallex, which became a unicorn after receiving $100 million of financing in March. Tencent is also one of the investors in the Australian firm, which provides international money transfers that help companies to reduce their FX transfer costs.</p><p>Survey after survey shows there is all to play for in the fintech space. EY\u2019s third Biennial Fintech Adoptions Trends survey, published this June, also reveals that China leads the global pack in key areas. Its digital payments adoption rate stands at 87% compared to a 64% global average and just 46% in the US, which ranks 24th.</p><p>WeChat Pay continues to become a more pervasive part of everyday life in China and has notched up 900 million monthly active users. The applications keep growing: witness the popularity of its \u2018Scan to Order\u2019 mini-program that enables users to scan a QR code on a restaurant menu, order their food via the same Tencent smartphone app and automatically settle the bill via their WeChat Pay account.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKINCH-42662</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKINCH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-JTM1-DXD6-30G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472880</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1338\"/><timeReceived>5:34 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ChinTell Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Week in China</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002EUA</classCode><className>THOMSON REUTERS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ordering a Waymo ride is as simple as a few taps on a smartphone, and during their trips passengers are free to read, send emails or even take a nap. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One year in, our early rider programme and our extensive on-road testing is helping us build the world's most experienced driver,\" Waymo said in a post on the website Medium on Thursday. </p><p>Autonomous driving has become an important and symbolic area of competition between the US and China, with a diverse field of big tech firms, start-up and traditional car makers competing for dominance. The technology promises to revolutionise daily life and transport worldwide, with leadership in the field signalling broader strength in science and technology applications such as artificial intelligence. </p><p>So far, US companies operate larger fleets that have driven far more miles than their Chinese counterparts, but the Chinese government is working to shift the balance. In April, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology delegated regulation of autonomous vehicles to provincial and municipal-level governments in a bid to speed the approval process for getting self-driving cars on the road. </p><p>In the US, Waymo and other companies already work directly with state and local governments. In April, Waymo filed an application with the California Department of Motor Vehicles to begin fully driverless field test drives in the state, as it is doing in neighbouring Arizona. The US industry saw a setback in March after two fatalities in the same month, one involving an Uber self-driving car that killed a cyclist, and another where a Tesla electric car driven in autopilot mode crashed and killed its driver. </p><p>Baidu, the first of China's internet giants to enter the self-driving industry, launched a pilot taxi programme last month in Chongqing, with six cars offering autonomous pickup and drop-off in the Liangjiang section of the city. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2144863/baidus-self-driving-cars-require-more-human-intervention-alphabets\">Baidu overtaken by Waymo in US autonomous driving tests</url></p><p>Similar pilot taxi programmes are being conducted in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou by start-ups Jingchi and Pony.ai, both of which were founded in Silicon Valley but relocated their headquarters to mainland China last year. </p><p>Since Jingchi's service launched in January, 24 vehicles have completed more than one thousand rides, said company spokesperson Qu Congcong. Pony.ai's service began with seven vehicles offering rides in a suburb of the city, but chief operating officer Hu Wen declined to say how many cars currently comprise the fleet, adding that operations are \"going smoothly.\" </p><p>Of the many tech and car companies developing autonomous vehicles, Waymo clearly leads the pack. The company's self-driving cars have been on the streets since 2009, and its Phoenix rider programme has given the world its closest look yet at what a community served by self-driving cars might look like. </p><p>Waymo, originally part of Google's self-driving car operations, launched its early rider programme in April last year. The 400 riders, selected from over 20,000 applicants, were asked to use Waymo cars regularly and provide feedback as a step toward Waymo's goal of operating larger autonomous ride-hailing fleets in more American cities. The riders in Phoenix, aged from 9 to 69, come from all walks of life and have diverse transport needs, which Waymo said will help the company maximise utility of it's for future riders. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2131813/former-baidu-employees-self-driving-start-launch-robotaxi-services\">Silicon Valley-born self-driving car start-up learns about Chinese rain</url></p><p>Waymo said user feedback has helped the company refine the pickup and drop-off process, ensuring cars stop in the closest and most convenient locations, while it has also learned how best to communicate with riders and accommodate those with special needs, such as those with young children, physical disabilities or in need of service animals. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://hbnm3eqf9mju26279qj.exp.bcevod.com/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir/mp41080p/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir.mp4\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbnm3eqf9mju26279qj.exp.bcevod.com/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir/mp41080p/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir.mp4\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbnm3eqf9mju26279qj.exp.bcevod.com/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir/mp41080p/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir.mp4\">https://hbnm3eqf9mju26279qj.exp.bcevod.com/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir/mp41080p/mda-hkbnaeth5bdi4zir.mp4</url></p><p>\"As some of the first people in the world to use self-driving vehicles for their everyday transport needs, our early riders are helping shape this technology,\" Waymo said in its Medium post. </p><p>Elsewhere in the US, Waymo has tested its cars in diverse weather and on different terrains in five other US states besides Arizona. Its fleet collectively drives some 24,000 miles (38,624km) a day and in February passed the five-million mile mark. Waymo has even deployed self-driving semi-trucks in Atlanta, Georgia, and is currently working with carmaker Jaguar on production of 20,000 driverless electric cars which would be used to launch a public ride-hailing service later this year. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Sarah Dai</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2018.

It is typically one to two hours, and in some cases as little as 30 minutes; it is not typically 30 minutes. The article also erroneously stated that Western Journal hired experienced copy editors in 2018; it hired experienced editors in prior years, not in 2018. And an earlier version misstated Patrick Brown's height; he is 6-foot-6, not 6-foot-3.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each day, in an office outside Phoenix, a team of young writers and editors curates reality.</p><p>In the America presented on their news and opinion website, WesternJournal.com, tradition-minded patriots face ceaseless assault by anti-Christian bigots, diseased migrants and race hustlers concocting hate crimes. Danger and outrages loom. A Mexican politician threatens the \"takeover\" of several American states. Police officers are kicked out of an Arizona Starbucks. Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, proposes a \"$100 billion handout\" for black families.</p><p>The Western Journal is not quite a household name. Until recently, some of its most prolific writers used pseudonyms. Though it publishes scores of stories each week about national politics, the company has no Washington bureau, or any other bureaus. Indeed, it rarely dispatches reporters into the world to gather news firsthand.</p><p>In the parallel universe of Facebook, though, The Western Journal has been among the most popular and influential publications in America, shaping the political beliefs of more than 36 million deeply loyal readers and followers. In the three years ending in March, according to a New York Times analysis, Western Journal's Facebook posts earned three-quarters of a billion shares, likes and comments, almost as many as the combined tally of 10 leading American news organizations that together employ thousands of reporters and editors.</p><p>But in the last year, as Facebook and Google tried to rein in their own freewheeling, largely unregulated information ecosystems, The Western Journal's publishers have been thrust into a high-stakes clash between the tech industry and Washington.</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Here are </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">three takeaways from The Times's investigation</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> into The Western Journal</emphasis>.]</p><p>The Western Journal rose on the forces that have remade - and warped - American politics, as activists, publishers and politicians harnessed social media's power and reach to serve fine-tuned ideological content to an ever-agitated audience. Founded by the veteran conservative provocateur Floyd G. Brown, who began his career with the race-baiting \"Willie Horton\" ad during the 1988 presidential campaign, and run by his younger son, Patrick, The Western Journal used misleading headlines and sensationalized stories to attract partisans, then profit from their anger.</p><p>But Silicon Valley's efforts to crack down on clickbait and disinformation have pummeled traffic to The Western Journal and other partisan news sites. Some leading far-right figures have been kicked off social media platforms entirely, after violating rules against hate speech and incitement. Republican politicians and activists have alleged that the tech companies are unfairly censoring the right, threatening conservatives' ability to sway public opinion and win elections.</p><p>Those attacks have been led by President Trump. While he and his aides once credited his 2016 upset victory to the power of Facebook and Twitter, they now routinely accuse the same companies of bias.</p><p>In July, Mr. Trump hosted a \"social media summit\" featuring conservative activists who claim to have been censored online. His administration is drafting an executive order that would impose federal oversight of the platforms' content-moderation policies, a startling departure from decades of deregulatory orthodoxy on the right.</p><p>Now The Western Journal - like Mr. Trump - is battling the very technology firms that enabled its rise. Its Facebook traffic has declined sharply. Google News blacklisted the publication last year for what Google ruled were deceptive business practices. Apple News followed suit in June, saying one or more Western Journal stories had advocated \"views overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community.\"</p><p>\"Facebook has determined to put The Western Journal out of business,\" Floyd Brown wrote in a June email to many of the site's 1.6 million newsletter subscribers.</p><p>The Western Journal's parent company has hired a Washington lobbyist to push back against digital censorship, and the website has published a series of stories and in-house studies claiming that Silicon Valley's new rules have discriminated against conservative publishers and politicians. The Browns have also sought to join Mr. Trump's anti-Silicon Valley crusade, dispatching Herman Cain, the onetime presidential candidate and a prominent Western Journal contributor, to represent it at the White House summit in July.</p><p>\"We are committed to the truth,\" said Patrick Brown. \"We are real people. We are a digital media company,\" he continued. \"We are not disinformation.\"</p><p>Both Facebook and Google have denied that they systematically censor conservative views. Many instances of alleged censorship have been traced to user behavior that triggered the platforms' automated safeguards against spam and impersonation.</p><p>\"We enforce our policies vigorously, consistently and without consideration of any perceived political leanings of any site,\" said Maggie Shiels, a Google spokeswoman.</p><p>On Tuesday, Facebook released preliminary findings from an outside review of censorship complaints. Although the report provided no new evidence to support the allegations, Facebook said it would make its content-moderation policies more transparent, a sign of the pressure from Washington.</p><p>Lauren Svensson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company had worked aggressively to cut back on false news, but that suppressing content on the basis of political viewpoint \"would be directly contrary to our mission.\"</p><p>The censorship debate underscores the vast power tech platforms have amassed, and the sometimes unnerving opacity with which they exercise it. Silicon Valley's ever-evolving rule books and secretive enforcement procedures determine how news flows to billions of people. The industry's efforts at reform have disrupted political strategies and business models alike, particularly on the right.</p><p>Highly partisan news sites on the right far outnumber those on the left, according to a tally published last fall by NewsWhip, an analytics company. Conservative readers rely significantly more on hyperpartisan sites for news than liberal ones, and Facebook itself remains a major source of news for older Americans, who will be central to Republicans' electoral fortunes next year.</p><p>\"These are tactics that some people have been using for a long time,\" said Camille Fran\u00e7ois, a former disinformation researcher at Google who is now chief innovation officer at Graphika, a social media data firm. \"This is how they structured their campaigns. This is how they built their businesses.\"</p><p>The Browns did both: For decades, the family's enterprises have blended political campaigns and partisan journalism, helping reshape American politics and earning tens of millions of dollars along the way. Mr. Trump's movement was the family's most lucrative opportunity yet. Now, it may save the Browns - or ruin them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Platform Unlike Any Other</emphasis></p><p>Patrick Brown presents as an unlikely merchant of outrage. He is 6-foot-6, but stoop-shouldered and soft-spoken. When expressing a thought that might draw dispute, he often shrugs uncomfortably and spreads his hands, as if to cushion the blow. Mr. Brown attended a small Christian college in Pennsylvania, and his first company, a site called Liftable.com, featured viral, often religious-themed stories meant to inspire readers rather than enrage them: Good Samaritans who saved the life of an accident victim, for example, or the actor Johnny Depp visiting  a children's hospital.</p><p>\"I grew up not liking politics,\" Mr. Brown said in an interview. \"I grew up seeing just people being jerks to each other.\"</p><p>His exposure to politics came through his father, a larger-than-life veteran of Washington's partisan wars. Floyd G. Brown reveled in the infamy surrounding his successful Horton ads, which featured mug shots of a black convicted murderer to stoke fears that the Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis, was soft on crime. Over the following decades, Mr. Brown would start political organizations employing the same basic formula: Apocalyptic direct-mail appeals to raise money, innuendo-laden ads to thrash Democrats and outrageous claims to draw mainstream news interest.</p><p>During the 1990s, Mr. Brown ran a tax-exempt group, Citizens United, and a subscription newsletter, Clintonwatch, that peddled opposition research and outright conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton. When Barack Obama first ran for president, Mr. Brown helped form a network of political action committees that made anti-Obama attack ads, including one questioning whether Mr. Obama might secretly be Muslim. (The PACs raised millions of dollars - and paid out hundreds of thousands to companies controlled by Mr. Brown or his associates.)</p><p>After Mr. Obama won, Mr. Brown revived a defunct conservative journalism nonprofit, now called the Western Center for Journalism.</p><p>\"I'm essentially a political activist,\" he said in an interview. He focused on writing, he said, after realizing that \"the safest venue for the advocacy of ideas in the United States of America was as a publisher and writer.\"</p><p>Mr. Brown relocated his family to Anthem, an exurb of Phoenix, and began blogging at WesternJournalism.com, a precursor to today's Western Journal site. At the height of the Tea Party movement, he worked the right-wing conference circuit. (\"Obama hates Christianity,\" Mr. Brown declared at a 2010 event, according to a recording published by Media Matters, the liberal watchdog group. \"He is a Muslim.\") WesternJournalism.com ran stories exploring whether Eric Holder, then the United States attorney general, had covered up a murder, and promoting the lie that Mr. Obama was not an American citizen. One direct-mail piece accused Mr. Obama of pledging to ban criticism of Islam to \"please his jihadist 'masters.'\"</p><p>But social media provided Mr. Brown with a platform unlike any other. He discovered he could use Facebook ads to find alienated, angry conservative users. \"I really built Western Journalism with one really unique ad,\" he said at a 2016 conference in Las Vegas, speaking on a panel titled \"How to Change the World and Get Rich Through Social Media.\" As Mr. Brown recounted: \"I went in and I wrote an ad that just said, 'Click \"like\" if you think Barack Obama should be impeached.'\"</p><p>By May 2014, over four million people a month were visiting the Western Journalism site, which delivered steady attacks on the mainstream media and Democrats, and headlines like \"Florida Democrats Just Voted to Impose Sharia Law on Women.\" WesternJournalism.com took in $1.9 million that year, almost three-quarters of the center's revenue.</p><p>At first, Floyd Brown's son worked behind the scenes. During summers home from college, Patrick Brown built websites for his father's PACs, like ExposeObama.com, and taught himself coding and social media marketing. After graduating, he ran the Western Center's marketing department, posting its stories on Facebook and studying what made people click the \"like\" button.</p><p>While Floyd Brown credits his son with WesternJournalism.com's rapid growth - \"it was his technology,\" he said - Patrick Brown described the period with some misgiving. He disliked working on the PACs, he said in a recent interview, and did not share his father's views about Mr. Obama's faith. (\"My perspective is that if he says he's a Christian, he's a Christian.\") In 2012, Patrick and his wife moved to Vietnam to help start an elementary school. When they returned, he worked again briefly at the Western Center, then quit. In summer 2014, with financial backing from his parents, he started Liftable Media, working the sunny end of the Facebook clickbait spectrum.</p><p>In an interview, Patrick Brown described his motivation as \"wanting to be in charge of my own company, wanting to do something my way that I can really feel at the end of the day very proud of.\"</p><p>But within months, he returned to the family business. In January 2015, Liftable acquired WesternJournalism.com from the tax-exempt nonprofit run by his father. The transaction was highly favorable to the Browns: Liftable paid $626,157, according to federal tax records, a fraction of the site's annual advertising revenue. The sale effectively stripped the Western Center of its most valuable asset, built with tax-exempt contributions, and transferred it to a for-profit company owned by the Browns. Not long after, according to corporate records, Mr. Brown's parents joined Liftable's board.</p><p>\"I came to the realization that politics is not in and of itself a bad thing,\" Patrick Brown said.</p><p>Over the next two years, he built one of the most influential political sites in America. With Floyd Brown as chairman, Liftable bought up a slew of rival publishers, such as Conservative Tribune and Liberty Alliance. The acquisitions brought the Browns millions of email addresses and increased to close to 60 their stable of popular conservative Facebook pages with names like Saving Our Future and Trump Truck.</p><p>To expand their reach, the Browns struck deals with dozens of conservative politicians and celebrities, including Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigrant Arizona sheriff. The politicians posted Western Journalism and Conservative Tribune stories to their own widely followed Facebook pages in return for a cut of the ad revenue. (Facebook has since banned this practice, which violates Federal Trade Commission rules against undisclosed sponsorships.)</p><p>Coursing through the Browns' Facebook empire was a torrent of sensationalized, misleading, or entirely made-up stories, often aimed at Muslims and immigrants, and pumped out through dozens of seemingly unconnected Facebook pages that in practice functioned as part of a single publication. Liftable's sites were cited more than a dozen times by fact-checking watchdogs like Snopes.com and FactCheck.org. In a report titled \"Bloodlust,\" The Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group, charged WesternJournalism and other fringe web publishers with engaging in \"the monetizing of digital mobs.\"</p><p>Liftable's political content lived alongside more lighthearted fare - a sports website; stories about cancer survivors; \"Dancing with the Stars\" recaps - in a full-spectrum assault on the viral news market. Liftable soared. Its sites reached nearly a billion page views in the run-up to the 2016 election, according to SimilarWeb, an analytics company. By the time Mr. Trump was sworn in, more than 12 million people were arriving on the sites each month through Facebook or other social media, driving a torrent of advertising revenue. In 2016, the company took in more than $16 million. Instead of leaving the family business, Mr. Brown had supercharged it.</p><p>\"It's as if these publishers discovered - or created, or radicalized - a huge market niche that simply had not been tapped before,\" said Paul Quigley, the chief executive of NewsWhip.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blacklisted, Then Resurrected</emphasis></p><p>But by 2017, tech companies were coming under enormous pressure from regulators and lawmakers. Media and government investigations had revealed how Russian agents used Facebook and Twitter to help Mr. Trump get elected, in part by targeting voters with divisive or misleading stories.</p><p>Facebook had begun incorporating fact-checking ratings into its algorithm, eventually down-ranking content flagged as misleading or false. Both Twitter and Facebook began rooting out networks of secretly coordinated social accounts and web domains, aiming at both state actors, like Russia, and publishers of spam. Facebook also began asking users which publications they trusted most, and ranked content accordingly.</p><p>The cumulative changes slowed Facebook traffic to media outlets across the publishing industry. But for some, including The Western Journal, it was devastating. The accumulation of \"false\" ratings from fact-checking sites meant that Western Journal and Conservative Tribune stories were less likely to pop up in users' feeds. The company - hidden behind its own blizzard of Facebook pages, little-known as a news brand in its own right - ranked poorly on Facebook's trust surveys, hurting their reach still more.</p><p>In fall 2017, Facebook traffic to Liftable's properties began to drop. By early last year, it was nearly zero.</p><p>Patrick Brown's team scrambled. In 2018, Mr. Brown resurrected his site as WesternJournal.com, a new domain that had never been blacklisted by advertising networks or flagged by fact checkers. He began working with Facebook to rename most of his company's stable of Facebook pages to tie them more closely to The Western Journal. (A page once called Donald Trump Is the Man, for example, is now called Donald Trump News by WJ.) Others were shut down.</p><p>Mr. Brown also introduced a corrections page and published editorial standards that stated, among other things, that The Western Journal's \"first value as a company is truth.\" Thousands of old WesternJournalism.com stories, including most of Floyd Brown's columns, were removed.</p><p>In February, Patrick Brown greeted two reporters at the Liftable offices in Anthem, wearing jeans and a faded T-shirt. \"I'd say we're backing into something that looks more like a traditional media company,\" he said in his small office with sweeping views of the Sonoran Desert.</p><p>Over a series of conversations, Mr. Brown answered detailed questions about his business and Liftable's efforts to navigate social media's fast-changing landscape. \"Our goal is to show you who we are and be transparent,\" he said. \"We haven't done this before, so we're nervous.\"</p><p>While Facebook's algorithm changes had knocked around his business, Mr. Brown acknowledged, most of them were about \"protecting the user - and you know, we support that.\"</p><p>His father had little involvement with the company day to day, Mr. Brown said, and served mostly as a sounding board on business and management issues. When asked whether Liftable had anything in common with his father's PACs, Mr. Brown demurred.</p><p>\"I would never want to do what he did,\" Mr. Brown said. \"When you make an ad or something, you are - your whole goal is to just convince someone of something, right? I mean, our goal is not that. Our No. 1 goal is to inform - truthfully.\"</p><p>Yet the reborn Western Journal functions almost like a news outlet in reverse. In interviews, the website's editors spoke often about narratives - narratives in the mainstream media, narratives they wanted to counter, narratives they were seeking. Each workday, a small team of editors, known as \"story finders,\" scours social media data and newswires. \"They're looking for information, narratives that will inform and equip and motivate our audience,\" said Shaun Hair, a former litigator who is The Western Journal's executive editor.</p><p>The message comes first, then facts carefully selected to support it. Only after editors decide the framing of a story, and write the headline, is it handed off to a pool of contract writers, most working remotely. Deadlines are tight: Most articles are filed within an hour or two, and some breaking-news stories are written in as little as 30 minutes.</p><p>Western Journal editors stressed that headlines and frames were often adjusted later to ensure accuracy, and that writers were encouraged to pitch ideas. But as with stories from some other ideological media outlets, those from Western Journal often feel tailored to the daily political needs of one faction. Mr. Brown describes the intended audience as the \"forgotten people\" of heartland America - a staple of Mr. Trump's speeches - and The Western Journal's narratives often echo and amplify those spun by the president.</p><p>Mr. Trump's targets, too, reliably become The Western Journal's: the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, Joy Behar of \"The View,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Last fall, when Mr. Trump sought to mobilize Republican voters by campaigning against the caravan of Central Americans headed toward the United States, The Western Journal published more than 150 stories about the migrants. Most complemented Mr. Trump's message, for example by likening the caravan to a &amp;#34;mob&amp;#34; or \"an army,\" and emphasizing instances of violence.</p><p>Mr. Brown and his colleagues argue that, unlike mainstream outlets, they are at least transparent about the values that color their content.</p><p>\"We're conservative,\" Mr. Hair said. \"And our news is both curated and approached from a conservative reality.\"</p><p>As Big Tech cracked down, the Browns promoted another emerging narrative: that platforms like Google and Facebook were biased against the right.</p><p>In March 2018, Floyd Brown declared on Fox News that Facebook had been \"optimized to the thought police.\" The same month, The Western Journal published an in-house study concluding that Facebook's algorithm changes disproportionately favored liberal news outlets. (Cameron Hickey, a disinformation researcher at Harvard, told The Times he considered the study's methodology flawed, since it did not assess the quality or reliability of the news sources, merely their purported ideological tilt.)</p><p>A few months later, another Western Journal study asserted that the changes had cost Republican members of Congress more Facebook reach than their Democratic counterparts. The company also hired a Republican lobbyist in Washington, Alex Shively, to arrange meetings with lawmakers.</p><p>The claim of censorship was not only a political battle cry. It was a business imperative. As Liftable's Facebook traffic declined, it had moved more aggressively into direct marketing, pitching its reader data and email lists as tool for conservative politicians and political organizations to reach voters. In spring 2018, Liftable hired Gabriel S. Joseph III, a Washington-based operative and a longtime friend of Floyd Brown, to spearhead the business. It was later spun off into a company called Firefly Engagement. Like the elder Mr. Brown, Mr. Joseph has a knack for brass-knuckle political marketing. He is currently appealing a $32 million judgment for a class-action claim that his company illegally spammed millions of people to promote a video about the so-called War on Christmas.</p><p>The new business was critical for Liftable. Even after The Western Journal's reinvention, the site drew only about half the traffic it had during the 2016 campaign. Although it still had some of the highest Facebook engagement rates of any publication, total traffic referred from the social media network had declined catastrophically, according to SimilarWeb data. By the end of 2018, only about two million readers a month were coming to the website from Facebook. After Google News blacklisted the site, the publication lost two-thirds of its traffic from Google's search engine - and with it, ad revenue.</p><p>Correspondence that Patrick Brown shared with The Times shows that, at first, a Google representative blamed the drop on a technical error.</p><p>In a later email, a Google representative offered Mr. Brown a new, different reason: The Western Journal had engaged in practices that \"can be reasonably construed by users as deceptive behavior.\"</p><p>Ms. Shiels, the Google spokeswoman, said that Google News, which includes roughly 80,000 news sources, had blocked about 800 sites for policy violations. She declined to name the sites, but said they spanned the political spectrum.</p><p>Google's decision to blacklist The Western Journal was informed in part by the work of an outside security firm, CounterAction, according to a person briefed on the matter. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of contractual agreements around CounterAction's work, said the firm was one of several that Google worked with to detect and deter disinformation campaigns.</p><p>But Patrick viewed the blacklisting as further evidence of bias. His staff spent weeks vetting their content and procedures against Google News's rules for publishers, even hiring a consultant to audit their practices. \"There was no reason that he could see why we would be removed, except for political bias,\" Mr. Brown said. The financial crunch became so severe, he said, that he and his father temporarily gave up their salaries.</p><p>\"What is happening to Liftable Media isn't important in and of itself,\" Mr. Brown added. \"Except in the way that it's reflecting a clampdown on speech in general in America.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Who Controls the Microphones'</emphasis></p><p>A few months ago, Floyd Brown and Mr. Joseph helped organize a new group, the Coalition for Standardized Digital Media and IT, to call attention to supposed tech censorship.</p><p>In May, Mr. Joseph oversaw the coalition's launch event at the National Press Club in Washington. The gathering featured Laura Loomer, an anti-Muslim activist whom Facebook banned for posts inciting violence against the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar as well as more credentialed conservatives with Trump ties, such as Mr. Cain and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, now acting director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>\"There are a lot of folks who depended on Facebook and Google,\" Mr. Cain said in an interview. \"And then, all of a sudden, they begin trying to decide what is 'appropriate.'\" He emphasized the last word skeptically, with air quotes.</p><p>Independent experts have largely dismissed the claim that platforms are systematically discriminating against conservative content. (The most successful publisher on Facebook in 2019 is FoxNews.com.) But the complaints echo longstanding conservative attacks on the mainstream media, a onetime gatekeeper whose powers have long since been diminished by openly ideological outlets.</p><p>\"This is an argument that is very familiar through history - the idea of one faction being shut out from public debate because of who controls the microphones,\" said Ms. Fran\u00e7ois, the former Google disinformation researcher.</p><p>To prevent publishers from gaming their rules, platforms like Facebook and Google News typically do not identify precisely what content or action will result in a penalty.</p><p>But a review of Liftable's operations showed a range of potential violations of Google's policies against spam, misrepresentation and overreliance on other outlets' content - activities that, taken together, would help explain the company's suspension.</p><p>Almost none of The Western Journal's news coverage arises from original reporting, for example. Almost all of it is \"aggregated\" - borrowed and rewritten, with attribution - from stories on other sites, ranging from Breitbart and Daily Caller to traditional news organizations like the The Times and The Washington Post. For much of this year, The Western Journal's home page was dominated by headlines that linked to other media outlets, such as Fox News or CNN, without clearly indicating that the stories had not originated on The Western Journal.</p><p>Western Journal authors do not always use their real names, another violation of Google News policies. In late 2018, when Western Journal was suspended, a search for some of the site's most prominent bylines yielded no digital fingerprints beyond Liftable. A few of the writers, Mr. Brown explained at the time, used pseudonyms or middle names. After The Times asked about the practice, those authors began using their real names. But some Western Journal bylines are still pseudonyms, like an author named C. O. Jones (i.e., \"Cojones.\")</p><p>Mr. Brown also appears to have used frowned-upon techniques to game Google's algorithms. At The Times's request, Matthew Hindman, a professor at George Washington University and author of \"The Internet Trap,\" found at least 50 domains linked to the Browns that appeared to be promoting The Western Journal.</p><p>Those domains, which included ExposeObama.com, the former website of Floyd Brown's anti-Obama PAC, have posted nearly 150,000 links to Western Journal articles since 2017, a technique known as \"spammy backlinking.\" Some are still configured as \"doorway sites,\" with little more than a rotating collection of Western Journal headlines and links, a tactic to create the appearance of popularity but explicitly banned by Google.</p><p>\"This is not a new technique,\" Mr. Hindman said. \"And they can't have been surprised that Google thought it was cheating.\"</p><p>Most striking, the Browns' company also has unusually close ties with a pro-Trump PAC, America Fighting Back. The PAC was co-founded last September by Mr. Cain, shortly before The Western Journal absorbed his personal website and began hosting his internet radio show. The PAC's chief strategist, Todd Ceferrati, is also a consultant to Liftable. Floyd Brown is the PAC's chairman.</p><p>Almost every post on the PAC's Facebook page is a link to a Western Journal story or commentary. Most of the PAC's email solicitations are sent out over Liftable-owned domains, according to a Times review, and feature Western Journal stories. A welcome message on the America Fighting Back site celebrates the PAC's \"amazing group of marketing and social media and grass-roots experts dedicated to our nation, President Trump and his agenda.\"</p><p>Liftable appears to have shut down its backlinking network sometime this year; most of the sites now merely direct readers to WesternJournal.com. Executives said this summer that they had made further changes to the site to hew more closely to Google's public policies, and appealed the suspension.</p><p>But the PAC appears to be a sticking point: In July, shortly after the White House summit, a Google representative told Mr. Brown's team that The Western Journal was not adequately disclosing to readers its relationship with the political organization. It was hard to tell, the representative seemed to suggest, where The Western Journal ended and the PAC began.</p><p>Liftable editors said it had no formal connection to the PAC; the group simply employed Liftable and Firefly as vendors. In an email to The Times, Mr. Brown accused Google of a double standard.</p><p>\"I challenge Google to remove The Washington Post from Google News because of the political contributions and political activities of Jeff Bezos,\" Mr. Brown said. \"Americans of all political persuasions used to be allowed their personal political beliefs, but Google punishes our entire company because of my personal giving and activities. All we have ever asked for is to be treated with equality.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Direct Line</emphasis></p><p>In mid-August, Patrick Brown told Liftable's staff he was stepping down as chief executive to take a medical leave. The elder Mr. Brown now runs the family business once again, right as Liftable is fighting for its life. The company has parted ways with some freelancers and left some openings unfilled. Today, according to Floyd Brown, Liftable Media is half its former size.</p><p>But the Browns have always adapted. Later this year, a new company started by the Browns and Mr. Ceferrati will release a smartphone app called Feedme. Created by Patrick Brown, the app is designed to neuter Silicon Valley's control over its own platforms. Feedme will allow users to import public content from Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, but decide which of the content they see, instead of letting those companies' algorithms decide. In theory, it could allow the Browns to broadcast anything to their Facebook followers, without interference.</p><p>A marketing email sent to Western Journal readers in July presented Feedme as a solution to \"Silicon Valley's theft of the First Amendment.\" The message - political and commercial - will be bolstered by Floyd Brown's next book, due out in September: \"Big Tech Tyrants: How Silicon Valley's Stealth Practices Addict Teens, Silence Speech, and Steal Your Privacy.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Millie Tran and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.

Until recently, some of its most prolific writers used pseudonyms. Though it publishes scores of stories each week about national politics, the company has no Washington bureau, or any other bureaus. Indeed, it rarely dispatches reporters into the world to gather news firsthand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the parallel universe of Facebook, though, The Western Journal has been among the most popular and influential publications in America, shaping the political beliefs of more than 36 million deeply loyal readers and followers. In the three years ending in March, according to a New York Times analysis, Western Journal\u2019s Facebook posts earned three-quarters of a billion shares, likes and comments, almost as many as the combined tally of 10 leading American news organizations that together employ thousands of reporters and editors.</p><p>But in the last year, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">Facebook</url> and Google tried to rein in their own freewheeling, largely unregulated information ecosystems, The Western Journal\u2019s publishers have been thrust into a high-stakes clash between the tech industry and Washington.</p><p>[Here are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">three takeaways from The Times\u2019s investigation</url> into The Western Journal.]</p><p>The Western Journal rose on the forces that have remade \u2014 and warped \u2014 American politics, as activists, publishers and politicians harnessed social media\u2019s power and reach to serve fine-tuned ideological content to an ever-agitated audience. Founded by the veteran conservative provocateur Floyd G. Brown, who began his career with the race-baiting \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad during the 1988 presidential campaign, and run by his younger son, Patrick, The Western Journal used misleading headlines and sensationalized stories to attract partisans, then profit from their anger.</p><p>But Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to crack down on clickbait and disinformation have pummeled traffic to The Western Journal and other partisan news sites. Some leading far-right figures have been kicked off social media platforms entirely, after violating rules against hate speech and incitement. Republican politicians and activists have alleged that the tech companies are unfairly censoring the right, threatening conservatives\u2019 ability to sway public opinion and win elections.</p><p>Those attacks have been led by President Trump. While he and his aides once credited his 2016 upset victory to the power of Facebook and Twitter, they now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">routinely</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">accuse the same companies of bias</url>.</p><p>In July, Mr. Trump hosted a \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">social media summit</url>\u201d featuring conservative activists who claim to have been censored online. His administration is drafting an executive order that would       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">impose federal oversight</url> of the platforms\u2019       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">content-moderation policies</url>, a startling departure from decades of deregulatory orthodoxy on the right.</p><p>Now The Western Journal \u2014 like Mr. Trump \u2014 is battling the very technology firms that enabled its rise. Its Facebook traffic has declined sharply. Google News blacklisted the publication last year for what Google ruled were deceptive business practices. Apple News followed suit in June, saying one or more Western Journal stories had advocated \u201cviews overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFacebook has determined to put The Western Journal out of business,\u201d Floyd Brown wrote in a June email to many of the site\u2019s 1.6 million newsletter subscribers.</p><p>The Western Journal\u2019s parent company has hired a Washington lobbyist to push back against digital censorship, and the website has published a series of stories and in-house <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">studies</url> claiming that Silicon Valley\u2019s new rules have discriminated against conservative publishers and politicians. The Browns have also sought to join Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Silicon Valley crusade, dispatching Herman Cain, the onetime presidential candidate and a prominent Western Journal contributor,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">to represent it at the White House summit in July</url>.</p><p>\u201cWe are committed to the truth,\u201d said Patrick Brown. \u201cWe are real people. We are a digital media company,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are not disinformation.\u201d</p><p>Both Facebook and Google have denied that they systematically censor conservative views. Many instances of alleged censorship have been traced to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">user behavior that triggered the platforms</url>\u2019 automated safeguards       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">against spam and impersonation</url>.</p><p>\u201cWe enforce our policies vigorously, consistently and without consideration of any perceived political leanings of any site,\u201d said Maggie Shiels, a Google spokeswoman.</p><p>On Tuesday, Facebook released preliminary findings from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">an outside review of censorship complaints</url>. Although the report provided no new evidence to support the allegations, Facebook said it would make its content-moderation policies more transparent, a sign of the pressure from Washington.</p><p>Lauren Svensson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said the company had worked aggressively to cut back on false news, but that suppressing content on the basis of political viewpoint \u201cwould be directly contrary to our mission.\u201d</p><p>The censorship debate underscores the vast power tech platforms have amassed, and the sometimes unnerving opacity with which they exercise it. Silicon Valley\u2019s ever-evolving rule books and secretive enforcement procedures determine how news flows to billions of people. The industry\u2019s efforts at reform have disrupted political strategies and business models alike, particularly on the right.</p><p>Highly partisan news sites on the right far outnumber those on the left, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">according to a tally published last fall by NewsWhip</url>, an analytics company. Conservative readers rely       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">significantly more on hyperpartisan sites for news</url> than liberal ones, and Facebook itself remains a major source of news for older Americans, who will be central to Republicans\u2019 electoral fortunes next year.</p><p>\u201cThese are tactics that some people have been using for a long time,\u201d said Camille Fran\u00e7ois, a former disinformation researcher at Google who is now chief innovation officer at Graphika, a social media data firm. \u201cThis is how they structured their campaigns. This is how they built their businesses.\u201d</p><p>The Browns did both: For decades, the family\u2019s enterprises have blended political campaigns and partisan journalism, helping reshape American politics and earning tens of millions of dollars along the way. Mr. Trump\u2019s movement was the family\u2019s most lucrative opportunity yet. Now, it may save the Browns \u2014 or ruin them.</p><p>A Platform Unlike Any Other</p><p>Patrick Brown presents as an unlikely merchant of outrage. He is 6-foot-6, but stoop-shouldered and soft-spoken. When expressing a thought that might draw dispute, he often shrugs uncomfortably and spreads his hands, as if to cushion the blow. Mr. Brown attended a small Christian college in Pennsylvania, and his first company, a site called Liftable.com, featured viral, often religious-themed stories meant to inspire readers rather than enrage them: Good Samaritans who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">saved the life of an accident victim</url>, for example, or the actor Johnny Depp visiting       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">a children\u2019s hospital</url>.</p><p>\u201cI grew up not liking politics,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cI grew up seeing just people being jerks to each other.\u201d</p><p>His exposure to politics came through his father, a larger-than-life veteran of Washington\u2019s partisan wars. Floyd G. Brown reveled in the infamy surrounding his successful Horton ads, which featured mug shots of a black convicted murderer to stoke fears that the Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">was soft on crime</url>. Over the following decades, Mr. Brown would start political organizations employing the same basic formula: Apocalyptic direct-mail appeals to raise money, innuendo-laden ads to thrash Democrats and outrageous claims to draw       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">mainstream news interest</url>.</p><p>During the 1990s, Mr. Brown ran a tax-exempt group, Citizens United, and a subscription newsletter, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">Clintonwatch</url>, that peddled opposition research and outright conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton. When Barack Obama first ran for president, Mr. Brown helped form a network of political action committees that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">made anti-Obama attack ads</url>, including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">one questioning</url> whether Mr. Obama might secretly be Muslim. (The PACs raised millions of dollars \u2014 and paid out hundreds of thousands to companies controlled by Mr. Brown or his associates.)</p><p>After Mr. Obama won, Mr. Brown revived a defunct conservative journalism nonprofit, now called the Western Center for Journalism.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m essentially a political activist,\u201d he said in an interview. He focused on writing, he said, after realizing that \u201cthe safest venue for the advocacy of ideas in the United States of America was as a publisher and writer.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Brown relocated his family to Anthem, an exurb of Phoenix, and began blogging at WesternJournalism.com, a precursor to today\u2019s Western Journal site. At the height of the Tea Party movement, he worked the right-wing conference circuit. (\u201cObama hates Christianity,\u201d Mr. Brown declared at a 2010 event, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">according to a recording</url> published by Media Matters, the liberal watchdog group. \u201cHe is a Muslim.\u201d) WesternJournalism.com ran stories exploring whether Eric Holder, then the United States attorney general,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">had covered up a murder</url>, and promoting the lie that Mr. Obama was not an American citizen. One direct-mail piece accused Mr. Obama of pledging to ban criticism of Islam to \u201cplease his jihadist \u2018masters.\u2019\u201d</p><p>But social media provided Mr. Brown with a platform unlike any other. He discovered he could use Facebook ads to find alienated, angry conservative users. \u201cI really built Western Journalism with one really unique ad,\u201d he said at a 2016 conference in Las Vegas, speaking on a panel titled \u201cHow to Change the World and Get Rich Through Social Media.\u201d As Mr. Brown recounted: \u201cI went in and I wrote an ad that just said, \u2018Click \u201clike\u201d if you think Barack Obama should be impeached.\u2019\u201d</p><p>By May 2014, over four million people a month were visiting the Western Journalism site, which delivered steady attacks on the mainstream media and Democrats, and headlines like \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">Florida Democrats Just Voted to Impose Sharia Law on Women</url>.\u201d WesternJournalism.com took in $1.9 million that year, almost three-quarters of the center\u2019s revenue.</p><p>At first, Floyd Brown\u2019s son worked behind the scenes. During summers home from college, Patrick Brown built websites for his father\u2019s PACs, like ExposeObama.com, and taught himself coding and social media marketing. After graduating, he ran the Western Center\u2019s marketing department, posting its stories on Facebook and studying what made people click the \u201clike\u201d button.</p><p>While Floyd Brown credits his son with WesternJournalism.com\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 \u201cit was his technology,\u201d he said \u2014 Patrick Brown described the period with some misgiving. He disliked working on the PACs, he said in a recent interview, and did not share his father\u2019s views about Mr. Obama\u2019s faith. (\u201cMy perspective is that if he says he\u2019s a Christian, he\u2019s a Christian.\u201d) In 2012, Patrick and his wife moved to Vietnam to help start an elementary school. When they returned, he worked again briefly at the Western Center, then quit. In summer 2014, with financial backing from his parents, he started Liftable Media, working the sunny end of the Facebook clickbait spectrum.</p><p>In an interview, Patrick Brown described his motivation as \u201cwanting to be in charge of my own company, wanting to do something my way that I can really feel at the end of the day very proud of.\u201d</p><p>But within months, he returned to the family business. In January 2015, Liftable acquired WesternJournalism.com from the tax-exempt nonprofit run by his father. The transaction was highly favorable to the Browns: Liftable paid $626,157, according to federal tax records, a fraction of the site\u2019s annual advertising revenue. The sale effectively stripped the Western Center of its most valuable asset, built with tax-exempt contributions, and transferred it to a for-profit company owned by the Browns. Not long after, according to corporate records, Mr. Brown\u2019s parents joined Liftable\u2019s board.</p><p>\u201cI came to the realization that politics is not in and of itself a bad thing,\u201d Patrick Brown said.</p><p>Over the next two years, he built one of the most influential political sites in America. With Floyd Brown as chairman, Liftable bought up a slew of rival publishers, such as Conservative Tribune and Liberty Alliance. The acquisitions brought the Browns millions of email addresses and increased to close to 60 their stable of popular conservative Facebook pages with names like Saving Our Future and Trump Truck.</p><p>To expand their reach, the Browns struck deals with dozens of conservative politicians and celebrities, including Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigrant Arizona sheriff. The politicians <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">posted Western Journalism and Conservative Tribune</url> stories to their own widely followed Facebook pages in return for a cut of the ad revenue. (Facebook has since       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">banned this practice</url>, which violates Federal Trade Commission       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">rules against undisclosed sponsorships</url>.)</p><p>Coursing through the Browns\u2019 Facebook empire was a torrent of sensationalized, misleading, or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">entirely made-up</url> stories, often aimed at Muslims and immigrants, and pumped out through dozens of seemingly unconnected Facebook pages that in practice functioned as part of a single publication. Liftable\u2019s sites were cited more than a dozen times by fact-checking watchdogs like Snopes.com and FactCheck.org. In a report titled \u201cBloodlust,\u201d The Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">charged</url> WesternJournalism and other fringe web publishers with engaging in \u201cthe monetizing of digital mobs.\u201d</p><p>Liftable\u2019s political content lived alongside more lighthearted fare \u2014 a sports website; stories about cancer survivors; \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d recaps \u2014 in a full-spectrum assault on the viral news market. Liftable soared. Its sites reached nearly a billion page views in the run-up to the 2016 election, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">according to SimilarWeb</url>, an analytics company. By the time Mr. Trump was sworn in, more than 12 million people were arriving on the sites each month through Facebook or other social media, driving a torrent of advertising revenue. In 2016, the company took in more than $16 million. Instead of leaving the family business, Mr. Brown had supercharged it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if these publishers discovered \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">or created, or radicalized</url> \u2014 a huge market niche that simply had not been tapped before,\u201d said Paul Quigley, the chief executive of NewsWhip.</p><p>Blacklisted, Then Resurrected</p><p>But by 2017, tech companies were coming under enormous pressure from regulators and lawmakers. Media and government investigations had revealed how Russian agents used Facebook and Twitter to help Mr. Trump get elected, in part by targeting voters with divisive or misleading stories.</p><p>Facebook had begun <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">incorporating</url> fact-checking ratings into its algorithm, eventually down-ranking content flagged as misleading or false. Both Twitter and Facebook began rooting out networks of secretly coordinated social accounts and web domains, aiming at both state actors, like Russia, and publishers of spam. Facebook also began asking users which publications they trusted most, and ranked content accordingly.</p><p>The cumulative changes slowed Facebook traffic to media outlets across the publishing industry. But for some, including The Western Journal, it was devastating. The accumulation of \u201cfalse\u201d ratings from fact-checking sites meant that Western Journal and Conservative Tribune stories were less likely to pop up in users\u2019 feeds. The company \u2014 hidden behind its own blizzard of Facebook pages, little-known as a news brand in its own right \u2014 ranked poorly on Facebook\u2019s trust surveys, hurting their reach still more.</p><p>In fall 2017, Facebook traffic to Liftable\u2019s properties began to drop. By early last year, it was nearly zero.</p><p>Patrick Brown\u2019s team scrambled. In 2018, Mr. Brown resurrected his site as WesternJournal.com, a new domain that had never been blacklisted by advertising networks or flagged by fact checkers. He began working with Facebook to rename most of his company\u2019s stable of Facebook pages to tie them more closely to The Western Journal. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">A page once called Donald Trump Is the Man</url>, for example, is now called Donald Trump News by WJ.) Others were shut down.</p><p>Mr. Brown also introduced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">a corrections page</url> and published       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">editorial standards</url> that stated, among other things, that The Western Journal\u2019s \u201cfirst value as a company is truth.\u201d Thousands of old WesternJournalism.com stories, including most of Floyd Brown\u2019s columns, were removed.</p><p>In February, Patrick Brown greeted two reporters at the Liftable offices in Anthem, wearing jeans and a faded T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re backing into something that looks more like a traditional media company,\u201d he said in his small office with sweeping views of the Sonoran Desert.</p><p>Over a series of conversations, Mr. Brown answered detailed questions about his business and Liftable\u2019s efforts to navigate social media\u2019s fast-changing landscape. \u201cOur goal is to show you who we are and be transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done this before, so we\u2019re nervous.\u201d</p><p>While Facebook\u2019s algorithm changes had knocked around his business, Mr. Brown acknowledged, most of them were about \u201cprotecting the user \u2014 and you know, we support that.\u201d</p><p>His father had little involvement with the company day to day, Mr. Brown said, and served mostly as a sounding board on business and management issues. When asked whether Liftable had anything in common with his father\u2019s PACs, Mr. Brown demurred.</p><p>\u201cI would never want to do what he did,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWhen you make an ad or something, you are \u2014 your whole goal is to just convince someone of something, right? I mean, our goal is not that. Our No. 1 goal is to inform \u2014 truthfully.\u201d</p><p>Yet the reborn Western Journal functions almost like a news outlet in reverse. In interviews, the website\u2019s editors spoke often about narratives \u2014 narratives in the mainstream media, narratives they wanted to counter, narratives they were seeking. Each workday, a small team of editors, known as \u201cstory finders,\u201d scours social media data and newswires. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for information, narratives that will inform and equip and motivate our audience,\u201d said Shaun Hair, a former litigator who is The Western Journal\u2019s executive editor.</p><p>The message comes first, then facts carefully selected to support it. Only after editors decide the framing of a story, and write the headline, is it handed off to a pool of contract writers, most working remotely. Deadlines are tight: Most articles are filed within an hour or two, and some breaking-news stories are written in as little as 30 minutes.</p><p>Western Journal editors stressed that headlines and frames were often adjusted later to ensure accuracy, and that writers were encouraged to pitch ideas. But as with stories from some other ideological media outlets, those from Western Journal often feel tailored to the daily political needs of one faction. Mr. Brown describes the intended audience as the \u201cforgotten people\u201d of heartland America \u2014 a staple of Mr. Trump\u2019s speeches \u2014 and The Western Journal\u2019s narratives often echo and amplify those spun by the president.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s targets, too, reliably become The Western Journal\u2019s: the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, Joy Behar of \u201cThe View,\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Last fall, when Mr. Trump sought to mobilize Republican voters by campaigning against the caravan of Central Americans headed toward the United States, The Western Journal published more than 150 stories about the migrants. Most complemented Mr. Trump\u2019s message, for example by likening the caravan to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">a \"mob\"</url> or \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">an army</url>,\u201d and emphasizing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">instances of violence</url>.</p><p>Mr. Brown and his colleagues argue that, unlike mainstream outlets, they are at least transparent about the values that color their content.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re conservative,\u201d Mr. Hair said. \u201cAnd our news is both curated and approached from a conservative reality.\u201d</p><p>As Big Tech cracked down, the Browns promoted another emerging narrative: that platforms like Google and Facebook were biased against the right.</p><p>In March 2018, Floyd Brown declared on Fox News that Facebook had been \u201coptimized to the thought police.\u201d The same month, The Western Journal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">published</url> an in-house study concluding that Facebook\u2019s algorithm changes disproportionately favored liberal news outlets. (Cameron Hickey, a disinformation researcher at Harvard, told The Times he considered the study\u2019s methodology flawed, since it did not assess the quality or reliability of the news sources, merely their purported ideological tilt.)</p><p>A few months later, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">another Western Journal study</url> asserted that the changes had cost Republican members of Congress more Facebook reach than their Democratic counterparts. The company also hired a Republican lobbyist in Washington, Alex Shively, to arrange meetings with lawmakers.</p><p>The claim of censorship was not only a political battle cry. It was a business imperative. As Liftable\u2019s Facebook traffic declined, it had moved more aggressively into direct marketing, pitching its reader data and email lists as tool for conservative politicians and political organizations to reach voters. In spring 2018, Liftable hired Gabriel S. Joseph III, a Washington-based operative and a longtime friend of Floyd Brown, to spearhead the business. It was later spun off into a company called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">Firefly Engagement</url>. Like the elder Mr. Brown, Mr. Joseph has a knack for brass-knuckle political marketing. He is currently appealing a $32 million judgment for a class-action claim that his company illegally spammed millions of people to promote       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">a video about the so-called War on Christmas</url>.</p><p>The new business was critical for Liftable. Even after The Western Journal\u2019s reinvention, the site drew only about half the traffic it had during the 2016 campaign. Although it still had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">some of the highest Facebook engagement rates of any publication</url>, total traffic referred from the social media network had declined catastrophically, according to SimilarWeb data. By the end of 2018, only about two million readers a month were coming to the website from Facebook. After Google News blacklisted the site, the publication lost two-thirds of its traffic from Google\u2019s search engine \u2014 and with it, ad revenue.</p><p>Correspondence that Patrick Brown shared with The Times shows that, at first, a Google representative blamed the drop on a technical error.</p><p>In a later email, a Google representative offered Mr. Brown a new, different reason: The Western Journal had engaged in practices that \u201ccan be reasonably construed by users as deceptive behavior.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Shiels, the Google spokeswoman, said that Google News, which includes roughly 80,000 news sources, had blocked about 800 sites for policy violations. She declined to name the sites, but said they spanned the political spectrum.</p><p>Google\u2019s decision to blacklist The Western Journal was informed in part by the work of an outside security firm, CounterAction, according to a person briefed on the matter. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of contractual agreements around CounterAction\u2019s work, said the firm was one of several that Google worked with to detect and deter disinformation campaigns.</p><p>But Patrick viewed the blacklisting as further evidence of bias. His staff spent weeks vetting their content and procedures against Google News\u2019s rules for publishers, even hiring a consultant to audit their practices. \u201cThere was no reason that he could see why we would be removed, except for political bias,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The financial crunch became so severe, he said, that he and his father temporarily gave up their salaries.</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening to Liftable Media isn\u2019t important in and of itself,\u201d Mr. Brown added. \u201cExcept in the way that it\u2019s reflecting a clampdown on speech in general in America.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Who Controls the Microphones\u2019</p><p>A few months ago, Floyd Brown and Mr. Joseph helped organize a new group, the Coalition for Standardized Digital Media and IT, to call attention to supposed tech censorship.</p><p>In May, Mr. Joseph oversaw the coalition\u2019s launch event at the National Press Club in Washington. The gathering featured Laura Loomer, an anti-Muslim activist whom Facebook banned for posts inciting violence against the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar as well as more credentialed conservatives with Trump ties, such as Mr. Cain and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, now acting director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of folks who depended on Facebook and Google,\u201d Mr. Cain said in an interview. \u201cAnd then, all of a sudden, they begin trying to decide what is \u2018appropriate.\u2019\u201d He emphasized the last word skeptically, with air quotes.</p><p>Independent experts have largely dismissed the claim that platforms are systematically discriminating against conservative content. (The most successful publisher on Facebook in 2019 is FoxNews.com.) But the complaints echo longstanding conservative attacks on the mainstream media, a onetime gatekeeper whose powers have long since been diminished by openly ideological outlets.</p><p>\u201cThis is an argument that is very familiar through history \u2014 the idea of one faction being shut out from public debate because of who controls the microphones,\u201d said Ms. Fran\u00e7ois, the former Google disinformation researcher.</p><p>To prevent publishers from gaming their rules, platforms like Facebook and Google News typically do not identify precisely what content or action will result in a penalty.</p><p>But a review of Liftable\u2019s operations showed a range of potential violations of Google\u2019s policies against spam, misrepresentation and overreliance on other outlets\u2019 content \u2014 activities that, taken together, would help explain the company\u2019s suspension.</p><p>Almost none of The Western Journal\u2019s news coverage arises from original reporting, for example. Almost all of it is \u201caggregated\u201d \u2014 borrowed and rewritten, with attribution \u2014 from stories on other sites, ranging from Breitbart and Daily Caller to traditional news organizations like the The Times and The Washington Post. For much of this year, The Western Journal\u2019s home page was dominated by headlines that linked to other media outlets, such as Fox News or CNN, without clearly indicating that the stories had not originated on The Western Journal.</p><p>Western Journal authors do not always use their real names, another violation of Google News <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">policies</url>. In late 2018, when Western Journal was suspended, a search for some of the site\u2019s most prominent bylines yielded no digital fingerprints beyond Liftable. A few of the writers, Mr. Brown explained at the time, used pseudonyms or middle names. After The Times asked about the practice, those authors began using their real names. But some Western Journal bylines are still pseudonyms, like an author named C. O. Jones (i.e., \u201cCojones.\u201d)</p><p>Mr. Brown also appears to have used frowned-upon techniques to game Google\u2019s algorithms. At The Times\u2019s request, Matthew Hindman, a professor at George Washington University and author of \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">The Internet Trap</url>,\u201d found at least 50 domains linked to the Browns that appeared to be promoting The Western Journal.</p><p>Those domains, which included ExposeObama.com, the former website of Floyd Brown\u2019s anti-Obama PAC, have posted nearly 150,000 links to Western Journal articles since 2017, a technique known as \u201cspammy backlinking.\u201d Some are still configured as \u201cdoorway sites,\u201d with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">little more than a rotating collection of Western Journal</url> headlines and links, a tactic to create the appearance of popularity but       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">explicitly banned</url> by Google.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a new technique,\u201d Mr. Hindman said. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t have been surprised that Google thought it was cheating.\u201d</p><p>Most striking, the Browns\u2019 company also has unusually close ties with a pro-Trump PAC, America Fighting Back. The PAC was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">co-founded last September by Mr. Cain</url>, shortly before The Western Journal absorbed his personal website and began hosting his internet radio show. The PAC\u2019s chief strategist, Todd Ceferrati, is also a consultant to Liftable. Floyd Brown is the PAC\u2019s chairman.</p><p>Almost every post on the PAC\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/anti-christian-crowd-already-trying-ruin-one-best-upsets-ncaa-tourney/\">Facebook page</url> is a link to a Western Journal story or commentary. Most of the PAC\u2019s email solicitations are sent out over Liftable-owned domains, according to a Times review, and feature Western Journal stories. A welcome message on the America Fighting Back site celebrates the PAC\u2019s \u201camazing group of marketing and social media and grass-roots experts dedicated to our nation, President Trump and his agenda.\u201d</p><p>Liftable appears to have shut down its backlinking network sometime this year; most of the sites now merely direct readers to WesternJournal.com. Executives said this summer that they had made further changes to the site to hew more closely to Google\u2019s public policies, and appealed the suspension.</p><p>But the PAC appears to be a sticking point: In July, shortly after the White House summit, a Google representative told Mr. Brown\u2019s team that The Western Journal was not adequately disclosing to readers its relationship with the political organization. It was hard to tell, the representative seemed to suggest, where The Western Journal ended and the PAC began.</p><p>Liftable editors said it had no formal connection to the PAC; the group simply employed Liftable and Firefly as vendors. In an email to The Times, Mr. Brown accused Google of a double standard.</p><p>\u201cI challenge Google to remove The Washington Post from Google News because of the political contributions and political activities of Jeff Bezos,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAmericans of all political persuasions used to be allowed their personal political beliefs, but Google punishes our entire company because of my personal giving and activities. All we have ever asked for is to be treated with equality.\u201d</p><p>A Direct Line</p><p>In mid-August, Patrick Brown told Liftable\u2019s staff he was stepping down as chief executive to take a medical leave. The elder Mr. Brown now runs the family business once again, right as Liftable is fighting for its life. The company has parted ways with some freelancers and left some openings unfilled. Today, according to Floyd Brown, Liftable Media is half its former size.</p><p>But the Browns have always adapted. Later this year, a new company started by the Browns and Mr. Ceferrati will release a smartphone app called Feedme. Created by Patrick Brown, the app is designed to neuter Silicon Valley\u2019s control over its own platforms. Feedme will allow users to import public content from Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, but decide which of the content they see, instead of letting those companies\u2019 algorithms decide. In theory, it could allow the Browns to broadcast anything to their Facebook followers, without interference.</p><p>A marketing email sent to Western Journal readers in July presented Feedme as a solution to \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s theft of the First Amendment.\u201d The message \u2014 political and commercial \u2014 will be bolstered by Floyd Brown\u2019s next book, due out in September: \u201cBig Tech Tyrants: How Silicon Valley\u2019s Stealth Practices Addict Teens, Silence Speech, and Steal Your Privacy.\u201d</p><p>Millie Tran and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.

During summers home from college, the younger Mr. Brown learned how to code and built websites for his father\u2019s PACs, like ExposeObama.com. (PHOTOGRAPH BY STUART ISETT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES); One Story, Many Posts: This Western Journal article was shared on dozens of Facebook pages owned by or affiliated with Liftable, most of which have hundreds of thousands of followers. In 2017, the accumulation of \u201cfalse\u201d ratings from fact-checking sites meant that Western Journal and Conservative Tribune stories were less likely to pop up in users\u2019 feeds. So in 2018, Patrick Brown resurrected his site as WesternJournal.com, a new domain that had never been blacklisted by advertising networks or flagged by fact checkers. He began working with Facebook to rename most of his company\u2019s stable of Facebook pages to tie them more closely to The Western Journal. (A page once called Donald Trump Is the Man, for example, is now called Donald Trump News by WJ.) (A14); Patrick Brown, left, has built one of the most influential political websites in America. \u201cI came to the realization that politics is not in and of itself a bad thing,\u201d he said. On Facebook, the Browns\u2019 empire pumped out a torrent of sensationalized or entirely made-up stories, often aimed against Muslims and immigrants.

Instead, the company is helping stoke some aspects of the tech critique in D.C. itself \u2014 highlighting the distinction between its own fee-for-service model and free, ad-based businesses.What they're saying: 'We have been working hard to point out that there is no techlash. There is a substantial backlash against the business model where purportedly 'free services' are offered in exchange for massive and unconstrained collection of consumer data untethered to the underlying service, \" said Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president and top Washington lobbyist. </p><p>\"Winter is here for that business model.'Driving the news: Over the last two years, Oracle has turned is sights on Amazon, a competitor in the cloud-computing business. Amazon recently lost the fight[1] for a major Defense Department cloud contract worth up to $10 billion after the White House instructed the department to re-examine awarding the contract, according to The Washington Post[2].While Oracle didn't win the contract, either \u2014the Defense Department chose Microsoft \u2014 Oracle has a better relationship with Microsoft and prefers this outcome to an Amazon win.Oracle CEO Safra Catz reportedly discussed the contract issue[3] with Trump during a dinner at the White House in April 2018.Glueck created a flow chart detailing the connections between Amazon executives and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, per the Post.Oracle was also among the funders of the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, an anti-Amazon group, according to a Wall Street Journal report[4]. The backstory: Catz developed ties with the Trump administration early on. Catz and other technology executives met with President Trump[5] at Trump Tower in New York in Dec. 2016 before the inauguration, and Catz joined the transition team.Her name was floated for administration positions, including national security adviser.'Safra Catz in particular would have very good access, and different from the rest of the tech industry,' said a former administration official. 'She was for Trump before a lot of other people, and a lot of the tech industry is still not for Trump. She gets meetings, she gets access.' The big picture: Oracle grew rich and strong as a corporate database provider in the '90s and expanded into an array of business software markets from retail to HR via acquisition. It has held onto a big chunk of the business software market amid a shift from onsite servers to the cloud.Its market cap remains significantly smaller than that of Big Tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google.It has staked out positions on net neutrality and online platforms' legal immunity for user-posted content that set it apart from competitors. Details: Oracle has successfully supported law and policy changes that may not directly benefit the company, but could cause problems for its rivals. The company weighed in with the FCC to support the repeal of Obama-era net neutrality rules that were favored by Google and other tech companies. Catz met with[6] FCC Chairman Ajit Pai ahead of the commission's Dec. 2017 vote to back the repeal.Oracle publicly supported a legislative carve-out to the law that protects online platforms from liability over user-generated content. The Internet Association, whose members include Google and Facebook, fought the change before reaching a compromise with lawmakers.Glueck said the liability shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, would never be signed into law today if proposed again. \"There is no longer any justification for Section 230 in an era of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics,\" he said, adding, \"If there are concerns for small businesses and small innovators, then 230 should be modified to protect those kinds of contributors.\" What's next: Google is facing antitrust probes from the Justice Department, a bevy of state attorneys general and Congress. That has opened up a new front for Oracle. Oracle confirmed it received information requests relating to Google from states and congressional investigators, per Reuters[7], as well as regulators in Australia. Oracle and Google have also fought a decade-long copyright battle[8] over code in the Android operating system that could end up at the Supreme Court. Google declined comment for this story.

Two titans of spin, locked in a fast-moving battle over a dead terrorist's smartphone. Now, as dramatically as it exploded, the FBI's legal demand that Apple help it crack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino killers has evaporated - the agents hacked their way in anyway, assisted by a mysterious third party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was always more to the Apple v FBI case than met the eye - and it is true for this latest twist too. The biggest issue is that both sides stand to gain a lot more from this battle than any of us. With little bearing to reality, and backed by a worryingly partisan chorus, the notoriously closed Apple is emerging as a champion of users' rights. Equally worryingly, a government agency is claiming the power to keep to itself a tool that can potentially break security features on millions of phones, while earmarking a demand for further judicial or legislative intervention in the future. Whichever way you look, this feud is far from a road to freedom in the digital environment. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                                        Breaching Fortress Apple                                      </p><p>From the FBI's side, it seems clear that the case was opportunistically selected. No-one wants to defend a terrorist. And after hammering on about law enforcement \" going dark \" on secured communications, the authorities were salivating for a pin-up case. Terror on home soil provided it. </p><p>But the FBI failed to account for one thing: the fallout of enraging a cultishbrand on top of the most guarded, controllingecosystem that computing has ever seen. Apple, incensed at the idea of anyone trespassing on its authority, went public - an equally opportunistic move, straight from the Taylor Swift playbook. And in so doing, Apple debunked the FBI's otherwise earnest rhetoric that it only wanted to get at one iPhone, from one terrorist.</p><p>This case has been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre all along because it presents minimal threat to vested interests and power</p><p>The key fact is that the FBI demanded a general tool: a modified operating system able to circumvent certain user-set security features in any given iPhone. There are clear dangers in bringing such a tool into existence. As forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski puts it, this is \" a bomb on a leash \"; a leash that can be undone, legally or otherwise. The FBI's last-minute deferral of the court hearing in this case would, ideally, have been the enlightened recognition of this reality, as well as the multiple case-handling incompetencies and dubious legal foundations of the FBI's request. Bizarrely, the withdrawal was on another ground: a third party had emerged with a hack. With the case now wholly dropped, we have a new danger: a classified bomb held by the FBI and unknown third party hackers - but not by Apple, the one party capable of defusing it.</p><p>These facts are as much as the public debate has countenanced, resulting in predictable mud-slinging between techies and bureaucrats; big tech and big brother. What this misses is that this case has been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre all along because it presents minimal threat to vested interests and power.</p><p> Related:  The FBI may have dropped one case against Apple, but the battle is far from over | Trevor Timm</p><p>                                        Battles on Mount Insecurity                                      </p><p>Apple v FBI was never the mother of all privacy battles. It is and always has been a security battle, between alleged national security and individual security, fought over a landscape of increasing insecurity. </p><p>It is this insecurity - existing, pervasive, worsening, global vulnerability of our infrastructure, communications and rights - that has been the greatest deception in this battle to date. Because despite how Apple has portrayed itself and been valorized by the media, phones are not impregnable, nor are our data and the platforms they reside on. Not by a long shot. The outside hack proves just that: if an external source that decided to cooperate with the FBI could break into the phone, and in shockingly short time, other less savory sources could do so too.</p><p>This case should be a tremendous opportunity for a global conversation about technology fragility. We need responsible leadership that recognizes that there is no such thing as perfect security, and that responds with restraint and redundancy, rather than a headlong tumble into connecting all the things.</p><p>Coupled to this must be a specific concession at the heart of the case and the unsatisfactory truce now reached. Digital locks and picks, by their very nature, are binary - they work for all or for none. In the current state of the art, it is impossible to manufacture what the FBI wants: implanted vulnerabilities, or \"backdoors\", that work exclusively for \"good guys with a warrant\". Whatever the FBI is holding now, it suffers from this reality. But the problem is also bigger than that. As renowned computer security expert Matt Blaze describes the essence of the dilemma: \"we can't discuss how to make our systems secure with backdoors until we can figure out how to do it without backdoors\".</p><p>                                        Boxing in the shadows of vast corporate power                                      </p><p>This case, and others like it, are also an opportunity for a deep and reaching conversation about corporate power, and about the increasing intrusion of tech majors into democratic space. This is an angle that has been worryingly absent in most of the case's commentary.</p><p> Related:  Big pharma, tobacco, tech - how the first amendment is being abused</p><p>Regardless of the merits of its position, many of the arguments that have been marshaled at Apple's feet in recent weeks set a dangerous, potentially pernicious trend. In particular, the argument that corporations are subjects entitled to human rights such as freedom of expression is deeply problematic, undermining reasonable regulation and presenting a destabilizing influence on democracy. The black box society is real, and this case and inevitable future iterations of the same battle have every indication of making it worse.</p><p>So we are at the crossroads. And out in the cold. Many decisive questions still remain open, and despite the reams of technical jargon written about this case, its core is not primarily technical, but political.</p><p>The argument that corporations are subjects entitled to human rights such as freedom of expression is deeply problematic</p><p>Under ideal circumstances, and privilege against self-incrimination aside, we should expect that any society would reasonably cooperate with law enforcement to investigate heinous crimes. But what is the most rational response to take when authorities such as the FBI, as well as lawmakers around the world, continue to overreach in their demands, seemingly unwilling to protect an already fragile technology ecosystem and our rights within it ?</p><p>At the same time, the sheer scale of corporate power challenges the very foundations of democracy, while keeping us locked within walled gardens. Apple, Google, Facebook and the rest have received a tremendous windfall from this case, with nothing more than their words to induce our trust. But trust must be earned. It is predicated on transparency and it demands accountability, not marketing and press releases. Big tech will maintain privacy (or whatever they define as privacy ) as far as it is convenient for their business. And when it is not, they will gladly forgo it. Apple is no more immune to this than any other business, and we should be as vigilant about its power as we are about any government.</p><p>Political, legal and technical solutions (in that order) for these problems may exist. Only honest, open, democratic discussion can find them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-39183975</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JDJ-RK71-F021-63PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1310\"/><timeReceived>9:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

What this misses is that this case has been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre all along because it presents minimal threat to vested interests and power.</p><p> Related:  The FBI may have dropped one case against Apple, but the battle is far from over | Trevor Timm</p><p>                                        Battles on Mount Insecurity                                      </p><p>Apple v FBI was never the mother of all privacy battles. It is and always has been a security battle, between alleged national security and individual security, fought over a landscape of increasing insecurity. </p><p>It is this insecurity - existing, pervasive, worsening, global vulnerability of our infrastructure, communications and rights - that has been the greatest deception in this battle to date. Because despite how Apple has portrayed itself and been valorized by the media, phones are not impregnable, nor are our data and the platforms they reside on. Not by a long shot. The outside hack proves just that: if an external source that decided to cooperate with the FBI could break into the phone, and in shockingly short time, other less savory sources could do so too.</p><p>This case should be a tremendous opportunity for a global conversation about technology fragility. We need responsible leadership that recognizes that there is no such thing as perfect security, and that responds with restraint and redundancy, rather than a headlong tumble into connecting all the things.</p><p>Coupled to this must be a specific concession at the heart of the case and the unsatisfactory truce now reached. Digital locks and picks, by their very nature, are binary - they work for all or for none. In the current state of the art, it is impossible to manufacture what the FBI wants: implanted vulnerabilities, or \"backdoors\", that work exclusively for \"good guys with a warrant\". Whatever the FBI is holding now, it suffers from this reality. But the problem is also bigger than that. As renowned computer security expert Matt Blaze describes the essence of the dilemma: \"We can't discuss how to make our systems secure with backdoors until we can figure out how to do it without backdoors.\"</p><p>                                        Boxing in the shadows of vast corporate power                                      </p><p>This case, and others like it, are also an opportunity for a deep and reaching conversation about corporate power, and about the increasing intrusion of tech majors into democratic space. This is an angle that has been worryingly absent in most of the case's commentary.</p><p> Related:  Big pharma, tobacco, tech - how the first amendment is being abused</p><p>Regardless of the merits of its position, many of the arguments that have been marshaled at Apple's feet in recent weeks set a dangerous, potentially pernicious trend. In particular, the argument that corporations are subjects entitled to human rights such as freedom of expression is deeply problematic, undermining reasonable regulation and presenting a destabilizing influence on democracy. The black box society is real, and this case and inevitable future iterations of the same battle have every indication of making it worse.</p><p>So we are at the crossroads. And out in the cold. Many decisive questions still remain open, and despite the reams of technical jargon written about this case, its core is not primarily technical, but political.</p><p>The argument that corporations are subjects entitled to human rights such as freedom of expression is deeply problematic</p><p>Under ideal circumstances, and privilege against self-incrimination aside, we should expect that any society would reasonably cooperate with law enforcement to investigate heinous crimes. But what is the most rational response to take when authorities such as the FBI, as well as lawmakers around the world, continue to overreach in their demands, seemingly unwilling to protect an already fragile technology ecosystem and our rights within it ?</p><p>At the same time, the sheer scale of corporate power challenges the very foundations of democracy, while keeping us locked within walled gardens. Apple, Google, Facebook and the rest have received a tremendous windfall from this case, with nothing more than their words to induce our trust. But trust must be earned. It is predicated on transparency and it demands accountability, not marketing and press releases. Big tech will maintain privacy (or whatever they define as privacy ) as far as it is convenient for their business. And when it is not, they will gladly forgo it. Apple is no more immune to this than any other business, and we should be as vigilant about its power as we are about any government.</p><p>Political, legal and technical solutions (in that order) for these problems may exist. Only honest, open, democratic discussion can find them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-39184227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JDJ-RK71-F021-63PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1310\"/><timeReceived>9:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But in looking at these deals there's very little consistency, so its worth taking time to figure out what actually makes a city smart as opposed to just making it connected.</p><p><br/> On Wednesday, Intelsaid it is part of a pilot project with the Silicon Valley city of San Jos\u00e9, California, to add a network of connected sensors in various places as part of an effort to communicate information about air quality and encourage citizens and the government to act sustainably. The city is starting out with three projects: one related to how downtown events affect air quality, a sustainable traffic planning effort and a plan to use air quality data in making decisions about where to put housing in urban areas.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-11-at-11-55-48-am.png\">http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-11-at-11-55-48-am.png</url><br/> San Jos\u00e9 has installed a sensor demonstration platform using an Intel gateway server (it has an Intel-based Quark chip inside) to take in existing sensor data that might be in older formats and convert it to a more modern format before sending it to Intel's Hadoop cluster in the cloud. The sensors are from third-party vendors and talk to the Intel-powered hub. <br/>Intel's rationale here is not only to help its neighbor San Jos\u00e9 meet its goals of saving energy, it's also about the anticipated $41 trillion cities around the world[1] are expected to spend in the next 20 years upgrading their infrastructure. In Miami-Dade County, IBM has managed to sign a 'smart cities contract'[2] where IBM helps manage information coming in from 35 different agencies via a dashboard. Cisco, too, has a smart cities initiative that it has been investing in, most recently in Kansas City, Missouri[3]. Earlier this year Cisco signed a partnership with Switzerland's AGT[4] to advance the Cisco smart cities platform.<br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/seeing-the-big-data-picture-in-miami-dade.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/seeing-the-big-data-picture-in-miami-dade.jpg</url><br/> That move made sense, especially since Europe has been investing more heavily in connected cities, both at the municipal level and in pilot projects implemented in select neighborhoods. But before we embrace the marketing language of these giants in talking about smart cities, it's worth taking a look at how these projects are evolving to see if they are really going to change how we move around and build our cities or if they will just pad the balance sheets of big tech organizations.<br/> In writing about connected platforms there are four important issues any organization has to deal with. Once an entity decides that it wants to connect its office, city or home, here's how it should plan to move ahead. <br/>Where does this platform draw the line between openness and usability?<br/><br/>Every connected platform makes a tradeoff between true openness and ease of use. While in the home it may make sense for a consumer to accept that convenience is worth living in a closed system, but when it comes to municipalities it would be shortsighted to spend big on proprietary gear and software just to avoid paying high quality programmers to stay on staff and help troubleshoot and design new systems as time goes on and the networks get more complex. <br/> As part of the discussion around openness I think it's also worth talking about how the sensors are accessed and how their data is shared among citizens. If my city has an air quality monitor near my house, I'd like access to that data; not just because I want to know the air quality of my home environment, but also because I might want to test how it is working compared to my own air quality sensor. One might even argue that I should be allowed to somehow certify my own air quality monitor and have it send its data to the city to both offer more data but also to cut down on costs associated with covering a city with sensors. <br/>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/thingful.jpg\">https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/thingful.jpg</url><br/> A startup called Thingful[5] has a platform that hopes to do this. Meanwhile Opensensors.io has a software and consulting effort[6] designed around letting cities own their data and build on top of it.<br/>How do we make it work?<br/>Once you have a system or maybe a collection of sensors and some software, it's time to start deploying it and figuring out how to make it work. This isn't a neat process, even if it's a proprietary product from a big vendor. For example, when Celebration Health, a Florida hospital, implemented a real-time staff and patient monitoring system[7], they spent a year troubleshooting problems. A variety of issues were discovered, such as the fluorescent lights in the bathroom interfering with the hubs used to track employee badges. <br/> The point is that a network of sensors is inevitably going to be complicated and allocating a lot of time to makes sure it works makes sense. Also, expect that things will change over time as you add new sensors or update software. As these networks evolve, advances in AI should help CIOs monitor and plan these million-node networks. Splunk is one company easing into this space as is Mnubo[8].<br/>What are we going to do with the data?<br/>Here's where things get tricky. Even if the software or sensors are open, how will you handle the data generated by these devices? In the home, generally a consumer can export their data but doesn't actually own it in the sense that he or she can monetize it. In the corporation it's the opposite. For cities, having open data should be the starting point, and as I noted a few paragraphs ago, I think it may even be possible for cities to be open to using other people's data for some applications. <br/> And openness doesn't mean a CSV file[9], but ideally a structured API that citizens and developers[10] can use to take sensor data and create new services using it. Should some sensor data be kept offline or in the dark? Probably, but I think cities and the courts should develop regulations and laws that assume openness and require cities to defend a decision to keep information hidden. And ideally I won't have to file a Freedom of Information Act request to get the air quality metrics from the sensors near my home.<br/>What else do we want to do?<br/>This is the fun part. Once you have a system in place and it's working and open, you or others will see all kinds of possibilities for improvement. Once you start seeing the how to put sensors and web services together to create new applications you can't stop seeing them. As new sensors are introduced you see even more possibilities. That's why it's so important that this infrastructure is built to be open.<br/> And that openness, plus the ingenuity of citizens and staff, is what will really make a connected city smart.<br/> Image copyright Walter Bibikow/Shutterstock[11].<br/><br/>Related research and analysis from Gigaom Research: Subscriber content.

He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with \u201cthe exception of M.L.P.s,\u201d all are expensively priced.</p><p>Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. \u201cThe problem with cash is you don\u2019t make any money,\u201d Mr. Brightman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return.\u201d</p><p>Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least \u201cthinking about\u201d tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.</p><p>He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.</p><p>Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&amp;P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.</p><p>Low-volatility stocks outperformed the market for most of 2018, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product research and development for Oppenheimer funds. Through December, portfolios of low-volatility stocks in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oppenheimerfunds.com/advisors/fund/russell-1000-dynamic-multifactor-etf/04841\">Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor Exchange-Traded Fund</url> lost 2.43 percent as opposed to the fund\u2019s benchmark, the Russell 1000, which lost 4.78 percent, Mr. Haghbin said. High-quality companies \u2014 defined by superior grades on such metrics as return on assets, profits, margins and leverage \u2014 also outperformed, losing 2.68 percent.</p><p>But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.</p><p>Two low-volatility E.T.F.s that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2018 were: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/etfs/lvus.html\">Hartford Multifactor Low Volatility US Equity E.T.F.</url>, which was basically flat, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/investors/etfs/product-detail?productId=SPLV\">Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility E.T.F</url>., which lost just over 2 percent. The S&amp;P 500 was down 6.2 percent last year.</p><p>Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.</p><p>Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.</p><p>Although Kevin Landis is portfolio manager of the tech-focused <url normalizedValue=\"http://firsthandfunds.com/index.php?fuseaction=funds.tefqx\">Firsthand Technology Opportunities</url> fund, he said he is wary of the big tech stocks. \u201cWhen companies get bigger, they start looking more and more like government agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the biggest opportunities are at the saturation point. There\u2019s only so many iPhones you can sell.\u201d</p><p>With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. \u201cI spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the idea that they\u2019ve become more aware.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix\u2019s $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.</p><p>But many advisers say investors should simply hold tight. Brian McMahon, manager of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thornburg.com/products-performance/mutual-funds/overview.aspx?id=FIB\">Thornburg Investment Income Builder</url> mutual fund, said that in many ways, the recent downturn \u201cis pretty normal. This is not something to panic about.\u201d He said his largest investment, the CME Group, benefits from an active market. It makes good profits when people trade on options and futures contracts made on its platforms, he said. \u201cCME Group benefits from volatility,\u201d he said.</p><p>In a similar vein, Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blackrock.com/investing\">BlackRock, said,</url> \u201cThis is not a time to derisk and become completely defensive.\u201d There are still \u201cpockets of quality\u201d in the volatile markets, she added, citing the Chinese tech sector as one example.</p><p>But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. \u201cWe are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market,\u201d she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.</p><p>Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect any major regulatory changes in 2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor\u2019s view of the larger economy. \u201cIf an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies.\u201d</p><p>But, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. \u201cThings can change very quickly,\u201d he said.</p><p>PHOTO: Coca-Cola stock has been a steady performer and may be useful in a defensive portfolio, according to Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco.

New blogs will be posted in this space on Tuesdays.As shelter-in-place orders take their toll on the economy, many organizations will no doubt face pressure to reduce operating costs, including legal spending. With CCPA compliance programs now hopefully \"complete,\" and no federal privacy legislation on the horizon, it is tempting to think that resources can be cut in the privacy space.But news coverage of COVID-19\u2014and Big Tech's reaction to the virus\u2014shows that the privacy landscape has changed dramatically in recent years, such that risk associated with collecting information about customers, potential customers, and employees is ever present. </p><p>If anything, the pandemic shows why your organization needs a privacy program more than ever.Here's why: There Is Renewed Media Attention on Collection of Information Deemed Sensitive, Like Location Data and Health Information The potential for use of individuals' data for public health purposes such as contact sharing has ignited debate over government access to data collected by Big Tech, individual control over their data, and transparency about use. Media attention will, in turn, put pressure on lawmakers to legislate and give fodder to class-action attorneys. New Products and Services Will Create New Collections and Uses of Consumer Data Working from home en masse and shelter-in-place orders are changing the types of goods and services we need and the way we purchase them. As demand changes, so will supply as organizations innovate their offerings\u2014but with new goods and services come new ways to collect and use personal information.Each of these collections and uses must align with the organization's privacy policy as well as applicable law. Offensive use and lack of transparency create reputational risk, not just legal risk. CCPA Is an Ongoing Obligation, Not a One-Time Update to Your Privacy Policy Organizations must comply with CCPA on a daily basis, including responding to consumer rights promptly, and enforcement is now only 10 weeks away. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra recently reminded residents[1] of the state to be vigilant about protecting their privacy during the current crisis, including by submitting CCPA access and deletion requests.Regulations are still looming, and the draft regulations include several requirements that were likely not covered by initial compliance (for example, a separate notice of collection, honoring global opt-outs in browser). Further, CCPA requires annual reviews of privacy policies, which should be more than just a rubber stamp and well documented. Litigation Risk Is Growing The implementation of the CCPA means that unauthorized access of information may require disclosure under state law and could lead to a class action lawsuit. And though the CCPA's private right of action only covers data breaches, the statutory damages incentive is likely to result in class action lawyers offering theories that disclosure of data that is surprising to the consumer is \"unauthorized\" and therefore a data breach.Claims that violations of CCPA rights violate California's unfair and deceptive trade practices act are also likely to be asserted. Add to this the private right of action in Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act, which has spawned a 9th Circuit decision holding that a mere statutory violation could constitute injury-in-fact for purposes of standing[2]. Many of these emerging lawsuits put forth theories that may not survive motions to dismiss, but such claims can still cause an organization to undergo high legal costs.Against this backdrop and inevitable budget pressures, there are practical, low-cost solutions that organizations can consider to mitigate possible exposure: 1. Conduct an Enterprise Risk Assessment - NIST recently released its Privacy Framework[3], which provides a model for organizations to assess their maturity and identify privacy program priorities. This framework compliments NIST's existing Cybersecurity Framework[4], which also emphasizes the importance of self-assessments. 2. Form a Data Governance Council - Efficient, robust data management requires cross-collaboration between the business units that derive value from personal information, IT personnel who provide the infrastructure where data is managed, and legal counsel who can identify risks associated with data management. A formal structure that brings these stakeholders together can provide legal counsel with much-needed insight as to how data is being used on the front lines and create opportunities for alignment of data management priorities. 3. Set Yourself Up for Success With Limited Pilots - Creating data inventories and assessing risk associated with certain information assets is invaluable to ensuring compliance\u2014potentially reducing your compliance burden entirely if you can identify data that the organization does not actually need. But data mapping exercises can easily fail when there are incomplete responses from business and/or lack of resources for legal counsel to chase information.The antidote to these issues is starting small. Focus on a discrete business unit\u2014for example, marketing or website operations\u2014and get buy-in from a senior leader in the group who will impress upon others the importance of participation. Work with someone in the group to design a survey that works for a non-lawyer, and complement the survey with interviews and follow-up emails. Use the experience gained from the pilot to inform the process for future stages of the project. Final Thought The bottom line is that the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the CCPA have ushered in a new era in privacy rights. The post-COVID-19 world is going to look different for sure, but if anything it will offer more and not less privacy regulation.

In addition, the agency approved its first high-profile consumer mobile apps in 2018, with the\u00a0Apple Watch\u00a0ECG apps\u00a0and another company's\u00a0contraceptive app.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On top of these product-by-product advances, the FDA moved toward a launch of an experimental \"pre-certification\" approach to digital health oversight, and issued additional guidances and policies impacting the development of clinical-grade health software. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT122569//\">\"FDA Readies Digital Health PreCert Program For Lift Off\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>This is all to say that digital tech was central to FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb's overall pro-innovation focus. But it did not end with digital. The agency launched\u00a0several 510(k) pilot programs\u00a0to try to further streamline that path by which a majority of new and updated devices reach the US market, and it continued to progress policies to address advanced diagnostics, including next-generation sequencing and direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Breakthrough Device Program, originally envisioned to apply to a handful of devices per year, has exploded, with almost 100 investigation devices chosen to participate in the accelerated development pathway since 2015, and most industry feedback so far is positive. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT123338//\">\"Jeff Shuren Talks Breakthrough Bonanza TPLC And Innovating Safety\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>Impending Progress With Medicare</p><p>But industry clearly does not love everything coming out of FDA. There have been some questions whether the agency is over-stepping its authority in some areas, including the digital health pre-cert program, and whether it is providing favorable treatment to big tech companies, like Apple, compared to traditional device firms. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT123322//\">\"FDAs Speedy Apple Watch De Novos Raise Questions For Industry\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>For most of 2018, the sense was that the agency continued to become a more welcoming place to go to get innovative products to market. That has been a trend for the past few years. Meanwhile, FDA's sister agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), has been the source of greater sector anxieties. Companies might be enjoying quicker FDA market approvals, but they often face an unclear path to the coverage and payment necessary to support market adoption. Nadim Yared, CEO of CVRx and outgoing chair of AdvaMed, calls this period the \"valley of death\" for industry.</p><p>But in US reimbursement policy in 2018, there were positive signs for industry, if not clear-cut advancements. White House and CMS officials made it clear in multiple public statements throughout the year that the administration is prioritizing the reimbursement process for innovative devices and diagnostics.  (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT123308//\">\"The Skys The Limit When It Comes To Device Reimbursement Reforms White House Official Says\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)\u00a0</p><p>That promise was formalized somewhat when CMS put a break-through device reimbursement pathway on its latest regulatory agenda, with a proposal expected to emerge by March 2019. The plan, supported by US industry, would establish automatic, but temporary, Medicare coverage for devices designated by FDA as \"breakthrough,\" while manufacturers collect real-world data for the new technology. It would also establish a similar approach that can be tapped by device manufacturers, even if their device has not formally been designated as a breakthrough.</p><p>Scrutiny Escalates</p><p>This is all a positive for the device ecosystem, but companies should not get too comfortable. Several serious safety issues that have cropped up with particular devices in recent years are driving an increasingly vocal community of patient and consumer advocates. They are demanding stricter safety oversight of devices, including more pre-market data requirements.</p><p>Those passions were captured earlier in the year in a documentary,\u00a0The Bleeding Edge, which was picked up by Netflix and has attracted public attention. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT123191//\">\"Top Medtech Lobbyist Doubts Legislative Repercussions Of New Netflix Documentary\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p> Later in the year, the International Consortium of Investigative journalists (ICIJ) launched the\u00a0Implant Files, an investigation of the industry that paints a picture of unsafe products and unchecked companies putting profits over safety. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT124282//\">\"The Implant Files EU Blamed For Regulatory Inadequacies The World Over While WrathBehrendt Fumes\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>The ongoing series has a global focus, and puts an unflattering spotlight on the EU regulatory system in particular. But US FDA is feeling pressure as well. In the weeks before the investigation was made public (but when FDA was being asked for input by ICIJ reports), the agency released multiple announcements highlighting its focus on device safety and catching problems early. These appear to represent a tone switch away from a more prominent focus in public announcements on streamlining the path of new innovations to market.</p><p>On Nov. 26, the day after the Implant Files came out, FDA released a series of pre-planned proposals to reform the 510(k) pathway, by which most products and product updates reach the US market. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT124338//\">\"Opinion The Great Implant Scandal Or 77 Billion Reasons To Celebrate Medical Devices\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>) Primarily, the agency says it plans to encourage less use of older predicate devices (the previously-marketed devices that a device-maker references to prove substantial equivalence to gain their own 510(k) clearance). It makes a point in the announcement to stress that 510(k) submissions have become longer and have been subjected to more scrutiny in recent years.</p><p>It will be interesting to discover precisely where the agency's balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring safety comes to rest in terms of policy development in 2019.</p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.filmore@informa.com\">David Filmore</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVIVO-IV124183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVIVO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V4S-05H1-F0JS-Y4FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436900</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><timeReceived>6:03 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>In Vivo</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FOOD &amp;

Dressed down, bearded, often wearing a wooly hat and speaking in a slow, quiet voice, you might even call Dorsey the anti-CEO. He eschews many of the stereotypical trappings of the executive life and mannerisms in favor of taking silent retreats and traveling to countries like Burma.<br/>In November 2019, Dorsey's itchy feet took him to Africa, where he visited Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and Ethiopia on a listening tour. He had meetings at incubators in Lagos and Addis Ababa; and talked to a number of African tech-leaders, including Tayo Oviosu, the CEO of Nigerian payments startup Paga; and Yeli Bademosi, the director of Binance Labs.<br/>And before he departed back for the US, he did something more: he announced that he would return in 2020 to live somewhere on the continent for up to six months.<br/>\"Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I'll be living here for 3-6 months mid 2020,\" he Tweeted from Ethiopia.<br/>Why Africa?And where? And when? If you have ever spoken to Dorsey - or more likely read an interview with him - you'll note that the he can be somewhat oblique. It's rare that he gives straight answers to straight questions, even if he always responds with something.<br/>So when spokespeople from both Twitter and Square declined to comment on what his plans will be and if they will relate to those two companies, it might be just as likely that they don't want to disclose anything as they don't actually know.<br/>But one thing is clear: Africa's 54 countries and 1.2 billion people is one of the last blue oceans for global tech growth (one that not only Dorsey has identified).<br/>To that end, TechCrunch talked to several people from Africa's tech world to get their thoughts on what he could do, and what bears remembering as the world follows Dorsey's spotlight.<br/>The state of the marketWhen you look at year-over-year expansion in VC investment in the region, startup formation and incubators, the African continent is one of the fastest-growing technology markets in the world - even if today, by monetary value, it's tiny by Shenzhen or Silicon Valley standards.<br/>Three of the top destination countries for startup investment - Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - collectively surpassed $1 billion in investment for the first time in 2018, with fintech businesses currently receiving the bulk of the capital and dealflow, according to Partech and WeeTracker stats.<br/>\u00a0<br/>By most accounts, Dorsey's first foot forward last November was to make himself a student of the continent's innovation scene - but specifically as it relates to fintech (and by association, his affiliation with Square and latterly Bitcoin).<br/>\"It was more them listening than anything else. Not just Jack, but the other senior members of his team,\" CcHub's CEO Bosun Tijani said of Dorsey's meetings at the incubator.<br/>After acquiring Kenya's iHub, CcHub is the largest incubator in Africa. Other members of Dorsey's team who joined him there included Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal and Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour.<br/>\"[Dorsey] said the main reason [he was in Ethiopia and Africa] was to listen and to learn what's going on in the region,\" said Ice Addis' Markos Lemma .<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Over recent years, Nigeria has become Africa's leader in startup formation, VC, and the entry of big tech players, such as Facebook - which opened an incubator in Lagos in 2018.<br/>Since 2014, the country of 200 million has held the dual distinction as Africa's most populous nation and largest economy. This makes it a compelling market for fintech and social media apps.<br/>Twitter in Africa, according to sources, was less of a topic during Jack Dorsey's meetings with founders and techies. This makes some sense. The service has lower penetration in the region estimated at 7.46%, higher than Instagram but lower than Pinterest - and that essentially means that the business opportunities there are fewer, since the majority of Twitter's revenues comes from advertising.<br/>\"The only concrete thing in all this communication...is he seems to be interested in Bitcoin,\" said Tijani.<br/>Markos Lemma had the same takeaway after talking with Dorsey. \"I think he's specifically interested in Bitcoin,\" he said.<br/>CryptoDorsey's crypto focus in Africa isn't such a surprise, given his bullish stance on Bitcoin and blockchain-based technology.<br/>In October, he invested $10 million in CoinList, a startup that facilities and manages token sales. And rather than create its own cryptocurrency, like Facebook's Libra experiment, Square is using Bitcoin as the basis for its digital-currency strategy. The company added Bitcoin trades to CashApp, its P2P payment and investment product, in 2018 and its Square Crypto effort announced this year aims to \"support and promote Bitcoin\" through open source development.<br/>A recent interview with Australia's Financial Review could offer further insight into Dorsey's crypto Africa vision.<br/>\"I think the internet will have a native currency and anything we can do to make that happen we'll do,\" he said in reference to Square's moves.<br/>\"In the long term it will help us be more and more like an internet company where we can launch a product...and the whole world can use it, instead of having to go from market to market, to bank to bank to bank and from regulatory body to regulatory body.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>What Dorsey is describing, in part, is the primary use case for cryptocurrency in Africa - where there remain all kinds of inefficiencies around moving money. The continent's people pay the highest remittance costs in the world largely due to fragmented (and often inadequate) financial infrastructure and expensive cross-border transaction costs.<br/>By several estimates, Africa is also home to the largest share of the world's banked\u00a0and\u00a0underbanked consumer and SME populations.<br/>Roughly 66% of Sub-Saharan Africa's 1 billion people don't have a bank account, according to World Bank data.<br/>There are hundreds of payments startups across the region looking to move that needle by getting these people on the financial map - and more opportunistically, getting them to use their products.<br/>To be fair, the adoption of digital finance products, such as M-Pesa in Kenya, have succeeded in reaching tens of millions.<br/>A characteristic of successful African fintech products, however, is that their use has been geographically segregated, with few apps able to scale widely across borders. Some of that relates to vastly different regulatory structures and the difficulty in shaping product-market-fit from country to country.<br/>Cryptocurrency's potential to bypass inefficient or deficient finance structures has been getting attention in Africa.<br/>The last two years saw several ICOs on the continent. One of the largest coin offerings ($7 million) was in 2018 by SureRemit - a startup that launched a crypto-token aimed at Africa's incoming and intra-country remittance markets.<br/>SureRemit's CEO, Adeoye Ojo, sees the relevance and timing of Jack Dorsey's interest in cryptocurrencies on the continent.<br/>\"Right now a lot of people and governments in Africa are aware of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, compared to two years ago, and asking questions about how this can be leveraged; what kind of products can we build around this,\" Ojo told TechCrunch.<br/>Bitcoin, according to Ojo, is finding utility on the continent. \"It has helped people with value transfer significantly. A lot of businesses trying to make payments outside Nigeria...frustrated with access to forex or access to USD, are leveraging Bitcoin to make payments directly to vendors or suppliers in Asia and Europe,\" he said.<br/>On business motivations for Dorsey's move to Africa, \"I think he is definitely looking at the opportunity to get more people to adopt payments on Bitcoin, buying Bitcoin with Square here,\" Ojo said - based on the collective information he's followed re Dorsey's crypto motives and what emerged from Jack's recent trip.\u00a0<br/>Square has yet to launch any services in Africa, but if there is a business purpose to Dorsey's residency, one could be considering how and if the company has scope for building out services in the region, specifically one based around cryptocurrency.<br/>SureRemit CEO Adeoye Ojo believes Dorsey could also look to establish a unique African Bitcoin exchange.<br/>But Ojo underscored the specific hurdles to cryptocurrency adoption on the continent. The first is regulation. Regulatory reviews on digital-currency use are ongoing in major economies Nigeria and Kenya. South Africa's Central Bank is considering rules that would limit use of cryptocurrencies for foreign transfers.<br/>\"Even if the application for crypto works here, if the regulations that come forward don't support it, it won't happen,\" said Ojo.<br/>As with other parts of the world, Africa also faces a trust issue on digital currency adoption, he added, due to Bitcoin's implication in several scams - most notably to defraud millions of Nigerians in the Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox (MMM) ponzi scheme.<br/>\"For many Nigerians, their first introduction to Bitcoin was this MMM scam...People have been adopting\u00a0 mobile money in Africa, but it's gonna take a bit of market education for them to understand using Bitcoin isn't just some scam,\" he said.<br/>Advice for DorseyOn where Dorsey should spend time on his return, Cellulant CEO Ken Njoroge, thinks Kenya is a must, given its lead as one of the top countries in the world for mobile-money adoption.<br/>\"Coming to live in the ecosystem is a good thing...it's the best way to really understand...and get the nuances of business in Africa,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Njoroge, whose Nairobi-based fintech company processes payments in 35 African countries, also suggested Dorsey understand any tech play in Africa requires a long-game commitment, given the infrastructure challenges in the ecosystem compared to others.<br/>On that topic, Ice Addis co-founder Markos Lemma suggested Dorsey provide founders advice on operating around and influencing tech-regulation. \"He's had a lot experience navigating the U.S. and other markets with Twitter and Square. I don't know any entrepreneur in Ethiopia or other African markets who has that experience navigating and negotiating regulations,\" he said.<br/>For all the likelihood Dorsey's pending move could be motivated by Square and Bitcoin, three of the founders interviewed by TechCrunch - Bosun Tijani, Ken Njoroge, and Markos Lemma - underscored the rise of Twitter in Africa's civic and political spheres.<br/>Square doesn't operate in Africa but Twitter is the fourth most used social media app on the continent and sells ads in Africa through partner, Ad Dynamo, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"Twitter is quite powerful in Nigeria,\" CcHub's CEO said of the social media platform in the country, which has been plagued by theft of state resources in the hundreds of billions.<br/>\"It's not just a social media platform for Nigeria. It's changing the dynamics between people with power and those that they're meant to serve,\" Tijani explained.<br/>Twitter (along with Facebook) has also been implicated in Africa's first (notable) social media political interference campaigns.<br/>\"There's a lot of hate speech and misinformation that's been showing up on social media,\" said Ice Addis' Markos Lemma. \"With [Ethiopia's] 2020 elections on the horizon, I think it would be important for him to address how Twitter can mitigate that risk.\"<br/>Dorsey has faced flak from some analysts and Twitter board members for his planned move outside the U.S., given risks associated with Twitter and the upcoming American election.<br/>So Dorsey's 2020 Africa move could certainly uncover opportunities for cryptocurrency and Square on the continent.<br/>It could also become a reminder that wherever he travels so too do the complications of his social media company back home.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-476301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXC-DJ01-JBYT-H26J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Ponzi Schemes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzQ4MzAzQzUxOUVFNDREMUE0NzY2QTZBMUNDNDZDOTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQxNTVCMjZFQUYwNDk1OEIzNzAxQjI0NTk5QTA0NEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X6L</classCode><className>RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001624</classCode><className>STARTUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followed a $5.7-billion (U.S.) investment it recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 37,000-kilometre undersea fibre-optic cable encircling Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Thursday, Facebook confirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising startups.</p><p>Other technology giants are engaging in similar behaviour. Apple has bought at least four companies this year and released a new iPhone. Microsoft has purchased three cloud computing businesses. Amazon is in talks to acquire an autonomous vehicle startup, has leased more airplanes for delivery and has hired an additional 175,000 people since March. Google has unveiled new messaging and video features.</p><p>Even with the global economy reeling from a pandemic-induced recession and dozens of businesses filing for bankruptcy, tech's largest companies - still wildly profitable and flush with billions of dollars from years of corporate dominance - are laying the groundwork for a future where they will be bigger and more powerful than ever.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are aggressively placing new bets as the coronavirus pandemic has made them near-essential services, with people turning to them to shop online, entertain themselves and stay in touch with loved ones. The skyrocketing use has given the companies new fuel to invest as other industries retrench.</p><p>The expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe are sounding the alarm over the tech giants' concentration of power and how that may have hurt competitors and led to other issues, such as spreading disinformation.</p><p>This past week, European Union officials were preparing antitrust charges against Amazon for using its e-commerce dominance to box out smaller rivals, while Britain began an inquiry into Facebook's purchase of the GIF company.</p><p>Some of the tech behemoths have made little secret of their intention to forge ahead in a recession that has put more than 44 million Americans out of work and that officials warn will be protracted.</p><p>\"I've always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is keep investing in building the future,\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in an investor call last month. \"When the world changes quickly, people have new needs, and that means there are more new things to build.\"</p><p>In doubling down on growth in a time of economic pain, the largest tech companies are continuing a pattern. In previous recessions, those that invested while the economy was at its most vulnerable often emerged stronger. In the 1990s, IBM used a recession to reorient itself from a hardware company into a software and services company. Google and Facebook both rose out of the dot-com bust about 20 years ago.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhones now dominate their market, doubled its research and development budget for two years during the downturn in the early 2000s. That led the company, which nearly went bankrupt in the late 1990s, to create its iPod music player and iTunes music store - and eventually the iPhone, the App Store and an unbridled growth streak, said Jenny Chatman, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Ranjan Roy, a tech commentator for The Margins, an internet industry blog, said it was clear that the tech behemoths were unafraid to get more aggressive now and that the power they were accruing should give people pause.</p><p>\"Without any pushback from regulators, big tech companies would almost unquestionably come out of the pandemic more powerful,\" he said. \"So many additional parts of our daily lives are becoming dependent on their products, or they could just buy or copy the services they don't yet deliver.\"</p><p>Still, the companies are taking risks by spending in an uncertain period, said John Paul Rollert, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p><p>\"To double and even triple down when the casino is on fire is a remarkable move, because they may not even be able to cash in their chips later on,\" he said.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which declined to or did not respond to requests for comment, have plenty of cash on hand. Combined, they are sitting atop about $557 billion, enabling them to maintain a pace of acquisitions and investments similar to last year's, when the economy was humming, according to a tally of financial disclosures. They have been among the top corporate spenders on research and development for most of the past decade, according to the accounting firm PwC.</p><p>The companies have ramped up their activity since March, when shelter-in-place orders began. As Amazon, Facebook and others adapted to their employees working from home, they experienced a spike in use. Messaging and other teleconferencing software soared in popularity.</p><p>That created opportunities. Microsoft, for one, started promoting its Teams videoconferencing service, which allows people to talk and collaborate online. Microsoft also snapped up three cloud computing companies in the past few months - Affirmed Networks, Metaswitch Networks and Softomotive - to offer more technology to businesses.</p><p>Google, too, updated products that people can use to work from home. In April, it said that its video chat service, Google Meet, would be easily available inside people's Gmail windows and free to anyone with a Google account. It also said it would start making listings in its shopping search results mostly free, instead of having merchants pay for all their products to appear in the results, to bolster e-commerce searches.</p><p>Amazon was initially overwhelmed with a surge of online orders and safety concerns over its warehouse workers. In response, the company added more than 175,000 jobs to keep up with demand.</p><p>Amazon has since invested further. While aviation all but ground to a halt in the pandemic, the company said this month that it was adding 12 Boeing 767s to its fleet of more than 70 cargo planes. It also discussed buying Zoox, an autonomous vehicle startup valued at $2.7 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The discussions were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Apple, with $193 billion in cash and debt, went on its own buying spree. This year, it bought DarkSky, a popular weather smartphone app; NextVR, a virtual reality company; Voysis, a digital assistant and speech recognition software company; and Xnor.ai, an artificial intelligence startup.</p><p>The company will soon hold a developer conference virtually and is managing a surge in activity on FaceTime and iMessage as people use those services to communicate in quarantine.</p><p>Facebook's activity has been the most pronounced. When the coronavirus swept through the United States in March, the social network was inundated with people flocking to its apps to use voice and video chat services. Zuckerberg said Facebook was \"just trying to keep the lights on.\"</p><p>But the company soon capitalized on the momentum. Zuckerberg accelerated the building of some products, introducing Messenger Rooms, a group video chat service, in April.</p><p>That same month, Facebook said it was taking a $5.7-billion stake in India's Reliance Jio. It was the company's largest investment in an outside company, giving it more access to one of the world's fastest-growing digital markets.</p><p>\"We are committed to connecting more people in India together with Jio,\" Facebook said of the deal, noting that Jio had brought more than 388 million people online in less than four years.</p><p>Last month, Facebook bought the GIF company Giphy for an estimated $400 million. Giphy is to be integrated with Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook. And last week, the social network invested millions in Gojek. Based in Jakarta, Indonesia, Gojek makes an app for digital payments, transportation and other services that is used by more than 170 million people in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Facebook is now working on the new venture fund, which will help it spot new popular apps. The fund was reported earlier by Axios.</p><p>In driving the activity, Zuckerberg may be taking a cue from a Facebook board member, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. In April, Andreessen wrote a blog post titled \"It's Time To Build.\"</p><p>\"We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors,\" Andreessen said.</p><p>Less than two weeks later, Zuckerberg said on the investor call that he was doing exactly that: building.</p><p>He said he felt \"a responsibility and duty to invest\" and added, \"We're in a fortunate position to be able to do this.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020062758268550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6077-CR21-JBTY-W4HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 27, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This report profiles 46 key players in the cardiovascular device market that are shaping the industry.At Fitch Solutions, we believe that a range of industry trends will continue to impact medical device manufacturers, including an increased focus on cybersecurity to limit any vulnerabilities that can lead to device recalls, a greater focus on the international supply chain of companies to limit the impact of US-China trade war, and an increase of product innovation and small scale M&amp;A. We also believe that continued technological advancements will enable tech firms to further penetrate the medical device industry as a whole.Product innovations will remain central to outperformance in a value-based care environment, although this is balanced by risks relating to cybersecurity and regulation. Uptake of devices within the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a trend seen across the healthcare industry. Medical devices are increasingly becoming more versatile in order to allow users to have a more personalised approach to their healthcare. Medical device companies are working alongside developers such as Apple in order to produce apps that will help users to better manage their diseases. </p><p>The drawback to an increase of CDD and IoT is the increased risk of cybersecurity threats. In the past, a lapse in cybersecurity has led to the recall of devices such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist system by Abbot Laboratories.The US political outlook presents mixed implications for the medical device industry, as an improved business environment could be hindered by continued uncertainty over healthcare reform.Medical device manufacturers will continue to invest heavily in R&amp;D in order to have a regular and steady output of products. Product innovation has remained a major driver of investment sentiment throughout FY18 and we anticipate this will be a trend that will be continued into FY19. In an effort to increase R&amp;D, mergers and acquisitions in 2018 for the medical device industry experienced increased investor interest and many notable deals by strategic investors and private equity investors, including Stryker's acquisition of OrthoSpace, a privately held company, GTCR/Regatta Medical's investment in Resonetics and Boston Scientific's acquisition of the remaining shares of Millipede. We expect this theme to continue as new technologies come to the market. An ageing population, as well as longer life spans and a growing middle class in developing countries - especially in Asia, positions the medical device market for continued growth increasing the attraction of the medical device market.The structural heart market remains highly profitable. With an increasingly ageing population, there is also an increase in cardiovascular diseases, as well as an increase in minimally invasive surgery for structural heart diseases. These factors combined propel the structural heart market forward. Furthermore, an increase in healthcare spending in developed countries, as well as an increase in the number of outpatient procedures, and market expansion opportunities in emerging markets provide an opportunity for market growth.Small-Scale Bolt-On Deals To Be Core Focus Of Medical Device 2019 M&amp;ABoston Scientific exercised its option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede. The companies initially entered into an investment and acquisition agreement in January 2018. The acquisition will expand Boston Scientific's Structural Heart portfolio to include the IRIS transcatheter annuloplasty ring system, which is in development for the treatment of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) who are not able to tolerate open-heart surgery. The IRIS system uses a complete annuloplasty ring to reduce the size of a dilated mitral annulus. It is delivered via a transcatheter-transseptal delivery system and can be used as a stand-alone device, or in combination with other technologies in patients with severe MR.The acquisition will expand Boston Scientific's Structural Heart portfolio to include the IRIS transcatheter annuloplasty ring system, which is in development for the treatment of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) who are not able to tolerate open-heart surgery. The IRIS system uses a complete annuloplasty ring to reduce the size of a dilated mitral annulus. It is delivered via a transcatheter-transseptal delivery system and can be used as a stand-alone device, or in combination with other technologies in patients with severe MR.Edwards Lifesciences completed two acquisitions in Q219; the first transaction involves Coriva Medical, a developer of a transcatheter device designed to treat heart failure with preserved or mid-range ejection. The device, InterAtrial shunt device, is designed to provide continuous and dynamic decompression of the left atrium, which has shown to reduce symptoms and also slow the progression of heart failure. InterAtrial currently has a CE mark, which it received in 2016, and is being evaluated by the FDA for approval as well. Edwards Lifesciences will be investing USD35mn in an exclusive deal to acquire the company. Coriva Medical has stated that it will use the funds invested to complete the REDUCE LAP-HF II clinical trial of the InterAtrial shunt device.The second acquisition involves certain assets of Mitralign, a developer of investigational transcatheter annuloplasty system designed to treat functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The assets acquired include intellectual property and associated clinical and regulatory experience.Abbott Laboratories acquired Cephea Valve Technologies, a company that develops a less-invasive heart valve replacement technology for people with mitral valve disease. Financial terms for this transaction were not disclosed. Abbott provided capital and secured an option to purchase Cephea in 2015. Cephea's technology is being developed to provide an option for people whose diseased mitral valves need to be replaced.Small tuck-in deals are likely to become more prevalent in Q219. Smaller and more frequent deals are able to support a more comprehensive growth strategy for companies and can often deliver substantially higher returns. By undertaking regular, small, low-value acquisitions, companies can further solidify their position in markets they are already participating in.Medtronic will be completing its acquisition of EPIX Therapeutics in Q419. EPIX Therapeutics designs and manufactures catheter-based, temperature-controlled cardiac ablation system for the treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. EPIX's flagship technology, the DiamondTemp ablation system, is a unique closed-loop, temperature-controlled system that provides physicians with improved feedback and control during an ablation procedure. The DiamondTemp system uses radiofrequency energy to create scar tissue in the heart and complements Medtronic's cryoballoon technology that uses cryo energy to isolate the pulmonary veins.Medical Devices To Enhance Minimally Invasive Cardiovascular SurgeriesAt the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC) conference long-term management for chronic heart disease remained a primary issue, as well as an increased focus on improving quality of life for patients. Companies showcased data from clinical trials of their devices that reveal benefits for medical devices implanted through minimally invasive surgeries for disease management.Abbott Laboratories presented data from the MOMENTUM 3 clinical trial for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. The data provided further confirms Abbott's HeartMate 3 device elevates the performance of LVAD therapy and provides physicians with better outcomes when compared to previous generation, HeartMate II, for patients living with advanced heart failure. Analysis of the study's patients after two years showed they had showed met and exceeded primary endpoint, the long-term group of patients showed survival of 79% at two years with the HeartMate 3 LVAD (vs 76.7% with HeartMate II). The patients were also shown to have the lowest adverse event rates in a randomised controlled trial; at two years 98.6% of patients avoided thrombosis in their pump. Additionally, 90.1% and 95.0% of patients avoided all strokes and debilitating stroke respectively.Abbott also presented data to demonstrate how treatment with MitraClip results in significant and sustained long-term quality-of-life improvements compared to medical therapy. Data from a sub-analysis of imaging data measured baseline characteristics of heart failure patients prior to enrollment in the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial and indicated that all subgroups of patients enrolled in the trial benefited from MitraClip therapy in the long-term. Analyses from this study also showed that Mitraclip provides great benefits for patients with advanced heart failure. MitraClip received CE mark in Europe in 2008 and was approved by the FDA in 2013 for primary mitral regurgitation (MR) prohibitive risk patients (patients not eligible for open-heart surgery). The FDA approved an expanded indication for MitraClip to treat secondary MR in March 2019.Boston Scientific announced data from the AF-FICIENT I study that demonstrated the positive safety and efficacy results with the Luminize radiofrequency (RF) balloon catheter for isolation of pulmonary veins (PV) when treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The global AF-FICIENT I study examined acute procedural success and safety for the single-shot Luminize RF balloon catheter in two phases. Phase one tested the original design of the device and phase two included changes to enhance manoeuvrability and add dedicated pacing and sensing electrodes. Phase one study data showed PV isolation was achieved in 88.9% of veins. In phase two, with the enhanced steering capability and electrodes activated, PV isolation increased to 99.4% of veins. Additionally, the median time the balloon was in the left atrium - known as balloon dwell time - decreased from 92 minutes in phase one to 29 minutes in phase two, bringing the total procedure time down to a median 71 minutes.Edwards Lifesciences showcased results of the randomised PARTNER 3 trial which demonstrated superiority for the Sapien 3transcatheter aortic valve over outcomes with surgery. The PARTNER 3 Trial was an independently evaluated, clinical trial comparing outcomes between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and open-heart surgery in this patient group. TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve achieved superiority, with a 46% reduction in the event rate for the primary endpoint of the trial, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke and rehospitalisation at one year.The PARTNER 3 trial randomised 1,000 patients at 71 centres between March 2016 and October 2017. Patients were assigned to undergo either TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve or surgery with any commercially available surgical valve. All patients were followed for at least one year, and a 10-year clinical and echocardiographic follow-up is planned for all patients.The data demonstrated that TAVR with the Sapien 3 valve gives low surgical risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) a treatment with better outcomes, less time in the hospital and the ability to resume their everyday lives more quickly. 96% of TAVR patients were discharged to home as opposed to remaining in a hospital or specialised care setting which further demonstrated the efficacy of the device. Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) remains the most profitable segment for Edwards Lifesciences. Global sales for Q418 were USD595mn, up 11% on an underlying basis and over 12% for the full year. Worldwide sales for Edwards Lifesciences grew at a lower rate due to y-o-y share decline as the company continues to exercise price discipline and holds global average selling prices stable.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"360\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> THVT Segment Remains The Most Profitable </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Segmental Sales (USDmn) Q417 - Q418</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file20688QnWWQMaPg981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: Edwards Lifesciences, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Medtronic presented results from the WRAP-IT trial. The trial is a randomised, prospective, multicentre, single-blinded, global, post-market, interventional clinical trial. It compared the incidence of major infections in patients whose CIED implantation included the Tyrx envelope and patients whose procedure did not, with follow up to 12 months. The study was conducted in 181 centres in 25 countries in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, and included 776 implanters. A total of 6,983 patients participated in the trial with 3,495 randomised to receive the Tyrx envelope and 3,488 randomised to the control group (without the envelope).The trial met its primary endpoint showing effectiveness of the Tyrx envelope in reducing major infections by 40% in patients at increased risk for infections resulting from CIED implantation: at 12 months, 1.2% of patients in the control group experienced a major infection, while only 0.7% of patients who received the Tyrx envelope had a major infection (p=0.04). The trial also showed a 61% reduction in pocket infections with the envelope (p&lt;0.01).The Tyrx envelope was successfully implanted in 99.7% of procedure attempts, with no significant difference in procedure time between the two groups. The trial also met its safety objective: the envelope did not increase the risk of procedure-related or system-related complications through 12 months (p&lt;0.001 for non-inferiority).Medtronic also released results from its Evolut low-risk trial comparing the minimally invasive Evolut TAVR system to the gold standard of open-heart surgery in characteristically younger, healthier aortic stenosis patients. The randomised trial, which met its primary non-inferiority endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at two years compared to surgery (5.3% versus 6.7%, posterior probability of non-inferiority &gt;0.999). Currently, the Evolut TAVR system is not approved for use in any geography for use in patients considered to be at low risk of surgical mortality. This new data will need to be submitted to government regulators to support the safety and effectiveness of this device for this use.Philips showcased data from the DEFINE PCI study, which involved approximately 500 patients and was led by investigators from the Cardiovascular Research Foundation (US), Duke Clinical Research Institute (US) and the Imperial College London (UK).PCI is an image-guided, minimally invasive treatment to open a coronary artery blockage (stenosis) that is causing a reduced blood flow (ischemia) to heart tissue. Under interventional x-ray guidance (coronary angiography), clinicians navigate a balloon catheter and coronary stent to the treatment area to deploy them and restore the arterial blood flow.The findings from the DEFINE PCI study revealed opportunities for physicians to optimise procedural results which can help more patients in the long-term. The findings show that the current approach to PCI has limitations for identifying the locations of physiologically significant arterial lesions in patients suffering from coronary artery disease. From the patients with residual ischemia, the study showed that 81.6% had untreated focal stenosis. Further analysis of the data demonstrated that if all focal stenosis had been successfully identified and treated then only one in 20 patients would still have residual ischemia. This indicates that if the precise locations causing ischemia are better detected prior to stenting, patient outcomes may be improved.Omron Healthcare's Incorporation Of Alexa Will Bolster Amazon's Healthcare SegmentIn December 2018, Omron Healthcare released Omron Connect blood pressure monitor, which is currently the only blood pressure monitor on the market to offer connection to Alexa - Amazon's cloud-based voice service. Users of the Omron connected blood pressure monitor that pairs with the company's Omron Connect mobile app are able to ask Alexa to connect with and open their app, locate and read back their latest blood pressure reading, calculate their average reading over a period of time such as day/week/month, and these readings can then be compared across different dates and times of day.Through the Omron Connect app, Omron Alexa 'skill' - Amazon's term for an Alexa app - is able to differentiate higher than normal readings and alert the user while also providing guidelines and tips to ensure accurate blood pressure measurement. Alexa can also be used to set reminders to regularly monitor their blood pressure. The Omron Connect app syncs with all of the Omron connected blood pressure monitors, so users can track, store and share their data with healthcare professionals. In order to enable Omron Alexa skill, users need the Alexa app and the Omron Connect mobile app - both are available to download for free from Apple iOS and Google Play stores.With the aid of these apps, patients will have greater autonomy over their health and are likely to make fewer visits to physicians and hospitals for checkups, therefore, reducing the strain on hospitals in the long-term. The American Heart Association estimates that there are currently 103mn people in the US with blood pressure levels in the hypersensitive range, this is a 32% increase from 2014 (77.9mn). According to the Journal of the American Heart Association, hypertension-related direct healthcare costs accumulated to USD131bn per year.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"392\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> An Increasing Problem </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Number Of People With Hypertension In The US (mn)</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2098kFh7v4AadX482\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: AHA, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Alexa has been developing a presence in the healthcare sector over the past few years. In 2016 Boston Children's Hospital developed the first healthcare Alexa skill: KidMD - used to answer parent's queries about their child's symptoms. To further solidify its position in the USD3trn US healthcare industry Amazon has created an Alexa health and wellness team that focuses on a variety of applications ranging from maternity care to chronic disease. However, Amazon has not yet updated the Alexa to be in compliance with federal privacy policies that govern how health information is stored and shared, called Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).The connectivity between health records is increasing. The linkage between medical devices, electronic medical records (EMRs) and IT systems will increase the volume of data available to patients and medical professionals, allowing for a streamlined approach to care whether at home or hospital. Data are becoming increasingly important in the treatment paradigm; text mining and big data analytics play a fundamental role in processing data at an aggregate level to understand patterns of usage to make medicines more effective. Medical device manufacturers will progressively invest in internet and mobile-based technologies that improve patient medicine compliance, including voice-activated devices and smartphone apps. With internet technology becoming more pervasive globally, connected devices will be used more readily to improve care.Technological Advancements Will Allow Tech Firms To Further Penetrate The Medical Device IndustryGlobal healthcare expenditure will continue to increase due to an ageing and growing population, and is projected to reach USD8.7tn in 2020. This presents big opportunities for technology companies, essentially providers of digital electronics, software, and internet-related services, which are looking to diversify and increase profitability. These companies are well aware of the inefficiencies of healthcare systems, such as the need for greater automation and cost constraint, as well as the fact that they are well-positioned to tackle a lot of them by providing innovative technology solutions.Although in the past technology firms have found it challenging to enter the healthcare market (eg GoogleHealth, a subsidiary of Google), they now have enough experience to make more targeted moves and therefore cause significant changes to the industry. Perhaps more notably, Amazon has driven growth by successfully disrupting key industries and it has been speeding up procedures to improve its healthcare offering. Finally, such companies possess sufficient capital to fund a medical device market penetration as well as widespread brand recognition to make an immediate impact.The complexity of the healthcare marketplace poses significant obstacles. Success in the healthcare industry requires strong scientific expertise and appropriate, large-scale development facilities, which technology firms do not possess. Moreover, the industry is very tightly regulated and the law can be inflexible towards breakthrough products which integrate innovative features and advanced technology. Even in case these breakthrough products make it into the market, there remains the issue of reimbursement. Governments have been constantly looking to control healthcare expenses, and therefore technology companies will need to engage in reimbursement procedures and negotiations, something which they have traditionally been unfamiliar with. Furthermore, the use of new technologies in healthcare raises ethical questions, such as invasion of privacy and commercialisation of personal information.Technology firms are increasingly making calculated moves to enter the medical device industry. Learning from past experiences and understanding the risks associated with the healthcare market, tech companies are now staying close to areas where they know well and where they can leverage their experience and expertise. These companies have identified the medical device industry as presenting more opportunities for them due to technological innovation being inherent to it. Hitherto, they have focused on the development of diagnostic and health monitoring devices and applications and have avoided areas which require strong scientific knowledge and are heavily regulated. This is exemplified by Apple's Apple Watchwhich contains sensors which allow people to monitor activity levels and heart rates and the plans of Amazon to enhance the capabilities of Alexa so it can help manage a chronic illness or to simply remind people to take their medication. Moreover, technology firms chose to partner with healthcare companies in order to benefit from their scientific and regulatory expertise while they can stay focused on engineering, design and product development.Improved and increased healthcare offerings will come as a result of advances in technology. Big technology firms are expected to use novel technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to complement and significantly improve current standards of care rather than offer a completely new medical product. Automation of laborious procedures and acceleration of other standard procedures such as automatic fill of electronic health records are the current focus of Google Brain, the AI division of Google. Furthermore, personalised treatments are highly valued by patients and strongly advocated by physicians. Tech companies are likely to capitalise on this by using data collected from personal devices and applications to offer a more personalised and targeted approach to treatment. In 2017, Amazon acquired Grail, a start-up that uses deep sequencing technology to detect the earliest signs of cancer in the blood, while it is still treatable. That requires a huge amount of data processing and storage. Early diagnosis is an area where traditional approaches have not been greatly successful, and technology has a clear role to play. It is highly likely that other big tech firms will move to acquire smaller companies with a clear niche market potential.Software Issues Continue To Result In Medical Device RecallsThe FDAs database shows that there were 1,056 medical device recalls in Q218, an increase from the 979 recorded in Q118. In Q218, there were 53 Class I recalls (the most serious type of recall), 980 Class II recalls and 23 Class III recalls (the least serious type of recall). The majority of recalls fall into the Class II category and this is defined by the FDA as a situation where a product may cause a temporary or reversible health problem or where there is a slight chance that it will cause serious health problems or death. The primary causes of recalls relate to parts issues, mislabelling, sterility issues and software malfunctions.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"328\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Medical Device Recalls </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>FDA Recalls Listed In Database, Q116-Q218</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2056VARShwgPTI643\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: FDA, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>The most serious recalls will continue to result from vulnerabilities in devices critical to the sustenance of a patient's health status. These include ambulatory insulin pumps capable of monitoring and responding in real time to blood glucose fluctuations with the release of rapid-acting insulin; and cardiac resynchronisation management (CRM) devices that monitor and control critical heart dynamics. During Q218, Medtronic initiated recall for its Amplia MRI cardiac resynchronisation therapy defibrillators (CRTDs) because of possible prevention of high and low voltage therapy. Abbott Laboratories initiated a recall following reports of outflow graft twist occlusions in the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist system. Also worthy of note, the FDA classified Draeger Medical Systems' jaundice metre JM-103 and jaundice metre JM-105 recall, initiated on May 21 2018, as Class I. Draeger is recalling their jaundice meter JM-103 and JM-105 models which are used to measure bilirubin in newborn infants because users have misinterpreted display messages that have resulted in serious injuries.We note that the increasing connectivity of medical devices and a greater reliance on digitisation and cloud computing cloud computing for healthcare delivery is likely to lead to a greater number of recalls that result from software issues.As medical devices become increasingly connected there will be a heightened risk of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The mitigation of cybersecurity risks will remain a priority for companies such as St Jude Medical (Abbott), which have in the past, been accused of widespread cybersecurity failings in regards to its pacemaker and defibrillator devices. During Q218, Abbott released a planned upgrade to the firmware installed on certain implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or CRTD devices. The ICD and CRTD firmware upgrade incorporates two updates designed to strengthen the security and improve the performance of the devices. The security update provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorised access and it is intended to prevent anyone other than a doctor from changing device settings.FDA 510(K) Modernisation To Galvanise Product InnovationThe FDA has provided further guidelines for the modernisation of the 510(k) programme for medical devices. The regulatory framework for evaluating safety and effectiveness of medical devices was first established in 1976 and whilst the core framework still stands, modernisation is necessary to match the pace of technology innovation.The 510(k) premarket notification is the pathway taken for the marketing of Class I (lowest risk) and Class II (moderate risk) medical devices. These devices are required to demonstrate substantial equivalence to a device already on the market - otherwise known as a predicate device. Higher risk Class III devices are subject to submissions of clinical trial evidence that reasonably assures the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. The 510(k) pathway is the most commonly used device premarket review pathway. In 2018, there were 3,022 cleared through the 510(k) pathway, representing 61% of the total devices cleared or approved. In recent years the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has made systematic, concerted effort to improve the programme's performance, predictability, efficacy, and safety.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"432\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> 510(k) Remains The Most Commonly Used Approval Pathway </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Total 510(k) Clearances (Jan 2018 - Dec 2018)</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2066vHQhXPYURz393\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: FDA, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>High number of older predicate devices catalyses change. The changes being proposed for the 510(k) pathway would require manufacturers to compare new device applications against modern predicates as opposed to relying on older predicate devices. Currently, more than 20% of current 510(k) applications are cleared based on predicates that are more than 10 years old. Whilst the safety of these devices is not under question the FDA believes this comparison could be hindering the progression of device innovation as older predicates may not correctly reflect modern technological advances. With greater incorporation of modern predicates, older predicates can be retired. Encouraging product developers to use more modern predicates would give patients and healthcare professionals the choice between older and newer versions of a type of device, promoting greater competition to adopt modern features that improve safety and performance as well as ensuring that newer devices reflect more modern technology and standards that can improve patient care and outcomes. It would also help with the overall production environment to continue to evolve in the direction towards more modern performance standards.Newer medical devices are often more interconnected and interoperable, increasing cybersecurity threats. Miniaturisation has also permitted devices to become smaller and more portable compared to older devices. There is also an increased amount of automation, robotics and advanced materials utilised in newer devices that older devices do not have. Looking forward, instead of using predicate devices that are sometimes decades old, the premarket review would be based on a contemporary baseline that looks to the future and a baseline that can be updated as technologies advance. This new approach will be renamed the 'Safety and Performance Based Pathway'. Through this pathway, device manufacturers will have to demonstrate that new devices meet modern performance-based criteria that have been established or recognised by the FDA and reflect current technological principals. This pathway will eventually supersede the practice of manufacturers comparing their new technology to a specific and at times old predicate devices.Due to the exponential advancements in technology, the FDA expects an increased utilisation of the de novo pathway.The de novo pathway provides a means for a new device, without a valid predicate, to be classified into Class I or II if it meets the required criteria.Currently through the 510(k) pathway, if a device has been recalled it can still be used as a valid predicate to get newer devices cleared as they are substantially equivalent. This, in turn, can lead to further recalls in the future. With a more standardised approval pathway, the number of recalls may be reduced in the future and the safety and efficacy of products can be improved.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"328\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Medical Device Recalls Remain High </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>FDA Recalls Listed In Database, Q416-Q418</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2035FJzdQBoKRk945\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: FDA, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Medtronic Strengthens Cardiovascular Segment With The Aid Of MHealth AppsIn January 2019, Medtronic launched MyCareLink Heart mobile app, which will support pacemakers. The pacemakers are compatible with BlueSync technology allowing the MyCareLink Heart app to securely and wirelessly send device data to the Medtronic CareLink network via smart technology, therefore, eliminating the need for a bedside monitor or other remote monitoring hardware.Medtronic's devices are currently the only pacemakers on the market that can communicate directly with smartphones and tablets. This communication allows patients to have greater autonomy over their health and allows them to have better remote monitoring systems, whilst also gearing towards an enhanced and more efficient patient engagement with healthcare professionals. Patients having access to their pacemaker data means they have to make fewer visits to the hospitals for queries such as remaining battery life on pacemakers thus reducing some of the strain on healthcare establishments in the long-term. The implementation of mobile health (mHealth) apps with devices will help to boost revenue for the company's Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG) segment, which is already Medtronic's most profitable segment and accounted for 38% of total global revenue for Q219 (November 20 2018).Upgrades to the MyCareLink Heart mobile app technology will be available to patients' devices over the lifetime of their BlueSync-enabled devices. Features currently include:* Transmission History: Provides patients with information about transmissions that have been sent to their doctors, as well as confirmation when transmissions are received by physicians.* Vitals Tracking: Allows patients to record weight, blood pressure and heart rate in the app, and to track these measurements over time to help better understand health status. This information is only stored on their mobile device; it is not sent to the clinic.* Battery Longevity: Displays the estimated remaining battery life of patients' Medtronic heart devices enabled with BlueSynctechnology.* Symptom Journal: Allows patients to catalogue symptomatic events which can be reviewed with their physicians during in-person clinic visits. This information is only stored on their mobile device; it is not sent to the clinic.* Device Information: Displays device implant date, heart device name, model number and serial number - as well as patients' clinic information.* Education: Offers helpful information and common questions about living with a pacemaker.* Physical Activity: Provides information about patients' activity levels. The app uses data from patients' heart devices to create daily, weekly and monthly views of physical activity.Medtronic has prioritised high-level security design capabilities that are incorporated within the BlueSync technology-enabled heart devices and the MyCareLink Heart app uses encryption and access restrictions designed to protect the device and data transmissions.The American Heart Association estimates there are three million people with pacemakers worldwide, with an additional 600,000 receiving implants each year. Pacemakers not only help older users but are also increasingly being used for the treatment of young and middle-aged people with genetic heart conditions, a demographic age group that overlaps with the target market for smartphones - 26-55 years. The global mHealth market was estimated to be worth USD28.320bn in 2018 and is expected to grow to at a CAGR of 25% from 2018-2023. The increasing adoption of smartphones as well as continued heavy investment in the digital health market is driving the growth of the mHealth market. The most popular use case for mHealth apps, of which 30% of the market provide services for, is 'Connection to doctors', followed by 'Diabetes', 'Heart, circulation, blood' and 'Medication'.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"304\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Demand For Pacemakers Expected To Grow </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Global Pacemakers Sales (USDmn)</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2017QH0clOrAwb947\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>MyCareLink Heart currently only works with Medtronic's BlueSync-enabled pacemakers. Supported models include Azurepacemaker, and three quadripolar cardiac resynchronisation therapy pacemakers called Percepta, Serena, and Solara. Each of these pacemakers uses a low-power Bluetooth low energy to ensure there is a minimal impact on the pacemaker's battery life - average battery longevity of Medtronic's pacemakers is 14 years. MyCareLink Heart is currently available on iOS App Store globally and on Google Play Store in a select few European countries.US Approval Strengthens Abbott In Mitral Valve Repair MarketIn July 2018, Abbott Laboratories received FDA approval for a third generation version of its MitraClip heart valve repair device used to repair a leaky mitral valve without open-heart surgery. The third generation MitraClip system provides cardiologists with advanced steering, navigation, and positioning capabilities for the clip, making it easier to use in difficult anatomies. The enhanced system is designed to allow for more precise placement during deployment, resulting in more predictable procedures, and additionally offers a second clip size with longer arms that expands the reach of the clip-based device. The additional clip size is designed to help doctors treat patients who have more complex anatomies when repairing the mitral valve.An underserved patient population will drive the market. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a progressive heart disease in which the flaps of the mitral valve do not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward into the heart. Incidence of mitral regurgitation increases with age, with nearly one in 10 people over the age of 75 having moderate-to-severe disease. Before the introduction of minimally invasive mitral valve repair, patient's not eligible for the standard-of-care surgery to treat their MR could only manage their symptoms with medications that do not stop the progression of the disease. Left untreated, MR leads to severe complications, and may ultimately lead to heart failure and death. MitraClip treats people with degenerative mitral regurgitation and is a therapy that is delivered via a catheter to the heart through a blood vessel in the leg. For MR patients not eligible for the standard-of-care surgery because of advanced age, frailty, multiple comorbidities or other complicating factors, the therapy offers a minimally invasive alternative.Abbott's clinical trial will support uptake and bolster its competitive position. In April 2018, the company began enrollment in the MitraClip EXPAND clinical study, a prospective study evaluating the safety and performance of the third generation MitraClip system in a contemporary real-world setting. EXPAND will enroll approximately 1,000 patients in more than 50 centres across the US and Europe and interim results from the study are expected in Q418. MitraClip received initial CE mark approval in Europe in 2008 and was approved by the FDA in 2013. By securing a portion of the leaflets of the mitral valve with an implanted clip, the heart can pump blood more efficiently throughout the body, thereby relieving the symptoms of severe MR.We have highlighted the nascent transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMRV) market as a key theme dominating the global cardiovascular devices market. The market for TMVR is believed to represent a significant growth opportunity and will be fuelled by the rising burden of cardiovascular disease. The global mitral valve market is estimated to be worth approximately USD4bn. In the US, Abbott's MitraClip is the only mitral valve repair device with FDA approval, which the company received in October 2013, but several companies have CE mark approval, including NeoChord, Mitralign, Valtech, and Cardiac Dimensions. Although Abbott has first-mover advantage, successful study results will potentially enable domination of the market. Cardiovascular heavyweights such as Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences as well as smaller developers such as Caisson Interventional and Neovasc, all have clinical trials underway with their respective MR replacement devices.<table><title>MV REPAIR DEVICES</title><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Device</emphasis></p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage Of Development</emphasis></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Abbott Laboratories</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>MitraClip</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>FDA approved</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Edwards Lifesciences</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Pascal</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Clinical trials underway</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Harpoon</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Clinical trials underway</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p/></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Cardioband</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>CE mark</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>NeoChord</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>DS1000</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>CE mark</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Mitralign</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>MPAS</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>CE mark</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Valcare</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Amend</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Clinical trials underway</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Millipede (Boston Scientific)</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Iris</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Clinical trials underway</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Cardiac Dimensions</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>Carillion</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>CE mark</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>Mardil Medical</p></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><p>VenTouch</p></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><p>Clinical trials underway</p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>   Source: Fitch Solutions   At Fitch Solutions, we have emphasised that the established sales channels and transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR) brand equity of Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic will facilitate their entry to the TMVR market. With its acquisition option agreement with Milipede, Boston Scientific will execute its initiative to move fast in the mitral valve repair market to avoid future struggles for market share, as was the case with TAVR. The reasons for choosing repair over replacement include lower operative mortality, and improved left ventricular function without left ventricle obtrusion (LVOT). Research suggests that repair has a lower perioperative mortality rate while replacement seems to demonstrate longer-term effectiveness, including a decreased risk in MR recurrence. Highlighting the focus on replacement over repair, Boston Scientific is following the increasing number of firms aiming to bolster their position in the TMVR market by acquiring early stage companies. Tendyne, Twelve and CardiAQ were acquired by Abbott, Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences during 2015 and Boston Scientific increased its investment in MValve Technologies in the same year. Edwards Lifesciences also acquired Valtech in November 2016, underscoring the investments that are being made to bring MV repair and replacement technologies to the market. Most recently in May 2017, LivaNova acquired the remaining outstanding interests in Caisson Interventional, a developer of a mitral valve replacement device.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"368\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p> Large Market Opportunity </p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p>US and Europe TMVR Procedure Volume, 2020-2030</p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"file2066xxRVO5BkzD666\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></p></entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Source: LivaNova, Fitch Solutions </emphasis></p></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1466432</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB2-RXD1-JD33-J196-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

JESUS G. ``CHUY'' GARCIA of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, November 19, 2019 Mr. GARCIA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce the Protecting Consumers from Market Manipulation Act, which guards against market manipulation in a range of industries by strengthening the separation of banking and commerce. For decades, federal banking regulation has established a separation between banking and commerce. This longstanding doctrine--a fundamental underpinning of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA)--is spurred by the belief that banks should not use their leverage as financial actors to game economic outcomes. Under the doctrine, banks may facilitate business through the extension and underwriting of loans, etc., but not through direct production or sale of goods. Commercial entities were purposefully walled off from the definition of banking in order to avoid conflicts of interests between the actors and operators of markets. Now is a crucial moment to strengthen the separation between banking and commerce, with tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Uber moving swiftly into financial services. We know we can't trust big monopolies with our financial information. The potential for collusion and manipulation of outcomes is just too great. This bill will keep tech companies and other large non-financial companies from deriving more than 5 percent of their annual revenue from banking activity. This bill also shores up the banking/commerce separation by limiting commodities ownership by commercial banks. When the lines between banking and commerce are blurred, monopolization and concentration are usually the result. Working people suffer the consequences, whether it's Big Tech undermining small businesses or big banks gouging consumers by manipulating the price of oil, aluminum, and electricity. We must protect consumers from big banks and big tech--and separate banking and commerce. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2631382</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJJ-B681-F0YC-N2GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"348\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But it has faced increasing competition from a nimble start-up, Credit Karma Inc., which has become one of the preferred financial apps for young people by giving out free credit scores and helping them find auto loans and credit cards. And since 2017, it has offered a completely free tax-filing service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Intuit Inc., the parent company of TurboTax, took note and agreed to spend $7.1 billion to buy Credit Karma last week. Several legal experts say the deal raises serious antitrust concerns, and see parallels to a 2011 attempt by H&amp;R Block Inc. to acquire another DIY tax software company that regulators blocked.</p><p>The prospect for tech deals may be even weaker now, amid calls for greater federal scrutiny. Increasingly, legal experts are flagging concerns about the harms posed by large companies buying smaller ones before they develop into serious threats.</p><p>Intuit is the biggest provider of DIY tax-filing software in the U.S., splitting about 80% of the market with H&amp;R Block, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Julie Chariell. Credit Karma's market share is only 3%, but it's growing fast. Founded in 2007, the San Francisco company has attracted more than 100 million users, including about half of all U.S. millennials. That's twice as many as Intuit. Credit Karma's free tax-preparing business grew by about 50% last year, according to the company.</p><p>\"There's no question the acquisition could and should face scrutiny,\" said Aaron Edlin, a law and economics professor at UC Berkeley. \"There's a huge concern when the leading firm in an industry such as tax software buys another firm that is competitive, particularly that's offering free tax software.\"</p><p>Eleanor Fox, a law professor at New York University, said regulators wouldn't just be looking at the companies' size, but could also be concerned about whether the deal is \"cornering a market.\"</p><p>Intuit has told investors the Credit Karma deal should be finalized by the second half of the year, a sign that it's optimistic it can pass an antitrust review. The company argues that taxes are only one part of Credit Karma's offerings, which mostly revolve around selling financial products based on the data it collects from free services, including tax filings. Intuit says the deal isn't about stifling competition and that the two companies would operate separately.</p><p>When asked on a conference call about market consolidation, Intuit Chief Executive Sasan Goodarzi said: \"This is all about playing offense and delivering for customers.\"</p><p>Representatives for the Justice Department, Intuit and Credit Karma declined to comment.</p><p>In Intuit's latest annual financial report, it lists Credit Karma as a primary U.S. competitor. Some customers certainly see it that way. One person complained on Twitter about TurboTax's charges. \"My kids make like 2k last year but because she made 401k contributions she has to pay $80 to get a $200 refund. No thanks, @creditkarma to the rescue.\"</p><p>Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, called it \"embarrassing\" that Intuit even proposed the merger. \"These kinds of mergers are obviously illegal and enforcers just don't uphold the law,\" he said.</p><p>In 2011, a court sided with the Justice Department and prevented H&amp;R Block, the second-largest player in digital do-it-yourself tax-preparation software, from buying its third-place rival, the creator of the software \"TaxAct.\" In that case, Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the proposed merger would give H&amp;R Block and Intuit a combined 90% control over the tax market.</p><p>Barak Orbach, a law professor at the University of Arizona, said he believes the Credit Karma acquisition will be approved because it could help create competition with the tech giants, who are moving further into financial products. And, despite the tough stance taken by regulators against big tech companies, T-Mobile US Inc. recently won approval for its $26.5-billion takeover of Sprint Corp. after a state-led lawsuit that sought to block the deal.</p><p>Even before the Credit Karma acquisition, the government was scrutinizing Intuit's actions. The company is facing lawsuits and regulatory inquiries into its approach to the Internal Revenue Service's Free File tax program. That federal program -- not to be confused with software that's advertised as free -- is meant to provide low-income people truly free tax software. ProPublica has reported that Intuit hid its federal free file program in search results and redirected people to its commercial service. Intuit subsequently agreed to stop the practice.</p><p>The antitrust review of Credit Karma will probably hinge on a few points, said James Tierney, who supervised the case against H&amp;R Block at the Justice Department: \"Is this company restraining Intuit's pricing? If you got rid of Credit Karma, could Intuit raise prices? That's one question and the other question might be, is Credit Karma driving innovation in the market?\"</p><p>Tierney, now an attorney at Orrick, said the Justice Department was unlikely to take Intuit by its word that Credit Karma would operate independently. \"The fact of the matter is that Intuit will control Credit Karma and they have the ability to do whatever they want with it,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: TURBOTAX maker Intuit and H&amp;R Block control 80% of the DIY tax software market.

We have our core manufacturing here in Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>Intuitive Surgical's core technology, which Dun &amp; Bradstreet describes as \"advanced surgical equipment\" with an \"artistic flair,\" has an impressive pedigree. The Da Vinci system was born at legendary SRI International, originally the Stanford Research Institute. The Da Vinci robots also have connections with NASA-Ames and the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA).</p><p>\"The talent and the ecosystem that is Silicon Valley fuels us and we wanted to be here,\" Guthart said. \"To support the growth of the company, we needed additional space in Silicon Valley. We wanted to acquire properties near our headquarters. We have rented offices near our main hub in Sunnyvale. We try to consolidate where we can.\"</p><p>One major cluster of buildings consists of the company headquarters at 1020 Kifer Road, as well as adjacent or nearby buildings at 1016, 1018, 1050, and 1090 Kifer. Next to this cluster is a one-story building at 950 Kifer.</p><p>\"I remember walking into the first building we bought, at 950 Kifer Road,\" Guthart said.</p><p>The Intuitive CEO recalls that the office building had been occupied by a golf-oriented dot-com firm. One room contained an artificial putting green. That golfing carpet had to be ripped out.</p><p>In 2001, Intuitive Surgical was leasing the building, which totaled 105,000 square feet, regulatory filings show. The building was the fledgling firm's corporate headquarters at that time. In 2004, Intuitive Surgical bought the 950 Kifer site for $19.9 million in cash.</p><p>\"We decided, why rent when we can buy,\" Guthart said.</p><p>These days, the 950 Kifer building that was the first headquarters could accommodate about 525 workers. Today, Intuitive Surgical says it employs 7,000 worldwide, of which more than half are located in Northern California.</p><p>\"We have mechanical engineers, computer engineers, electrical engineers, people who are experts in optics, artificial intelligence, machine learning,\" Guthart said. \"We are not a cloud company. We make physical products and do physical things in health care.\"</p><p>Having manufacturing operations in Silicon Valley creates important operational synergies, according to Intuitive.</p><p>\"We believe that some parts of manufacturing are important to have where our engineers are located,\" Guthart said. About 10,000 individual components go into a Da Vinci surgical robot. Guthart added, \"This is very high precision work and very low volume. That's why you want manufacturing engineers and product lines to be co-located.\"</p><p>During a stretch of three and a half years from January 2017 through June 2020, Intuitive Surgical's shopping spree totaling $109.1 million has encompassed at least nine parcels with 13 addresses on streets that include Kifer Road, Commercial Street, and Sonora Court.</p><p>Besides the recent property purchases, the multi-building cluster that is the core of Intuitive's Sunnyvale presence has an assessed value of $203.8 million, county documents show.</p><p>Intuitive Surgical also has leased two big buildings in Santa Clara, a few minutes from the Sunnyvale headquarters. These offices total a combined 210,000 square feet.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/07/investors-buy-san-jose-real-estate-google-village-deal-tech-transit/\">Google village sale leads to San Jose deals </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/07/letters-11-2/\"> Letters: Who will decide election | Yes on Prop. 15 | Homeland chief disgraceful | Save newspapers | Rioting isn't protesting </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/06/big-lease-guardant-health-deal-palo-alto-office-real-estate-jobs/\"> Guardant signs major Palo Alto lease </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/05/big-project-homes-office-retail-downtown-san-jose-real-estate/\"> Big mixed-use project planned near downtown San Jose </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/08/05/five9-big-lease-san-ramon-bishop-ranch-tech-real-estate-office/\"> Big tech lease signals East Bay market strength </url> At the same time that the property purchases have been ongoing, Intuitive is constructing a brand-new building at 1050 Kifer Road that is part of a new engineering campus for the company.</p><p>The expansion and property deals are occurring amid the coronavirus and social distancing protocols.</p><p>Plus, long-term challenges loom. Among these: housing prices, traffic woes, the cost of living, and the education system.</p><p>\"It's not the geography of Silicon Valley, it's the people who make it work,\" Guthart said. \"It the quality of life and the ability of people to move here are impaired, then the discussion becomes different. But so long as Silicon Valley keeps attracting fantastic human beings from around the world, it will remain a great place to be.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-7268978</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-43D1-F0C5-X54C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00027TL</classCode><className>INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00023VC</classCode><className>SRI INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS339113 SURGICAL APPLIANCE &amp;

We have our core manufacturing here in Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>Intuitive Surgical's core technology, which Dun &amp; Bradstreet describes as \"advanced surgical equipment\" with an \"artistic flair,\" has an impressive pedigree. The Da Vinci system was born at legendary SRI International, originally the Stanford Research Institute. The Da Vinci robots also have connections with NASA-Ames and the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA).</p><p>\"The talent and the ecosystem that is Silicon Valley fuels us and we wanted to be here,\" Guthart said. \"To support the growth of the company, we needed additional space in Silicon Valley. We wanted to acquire properties near our headquarters. We have rented offices near our main hub in Sunnyvale. We try to consolidate where we can.\"</p><p>One major cluster of buildings consists of the company headquarters at 1020 Kifer Road, as well as adjacent or nearby buildings at 1016, 1018, 1050, and 1090 Kifer. Next to this cluster is a one-story building at 950 Kifer.</p><p>\"I remember walking into the first building we bought, at 950 Kifer Road,\" Guthart said.</p><p>The Intuitive CEO recalls that the office building had been occupied by a golf-oriented dot-com firm. One room contained an artificial putting green. That golfing carpet had to be ripped out.</p><p>In 2001, Intuitive Surgical was leasing the building, which totaled 105,000 square feet, regulatory filings show. The building was the fledgling firm's corporate headquarters at that time. In 2004, Intuitive Surgical bought the 950 Kifer site for $19.9 million in cash.</p><p>\"We decided, why rent when we can buy,\" Guthart said.</p><p>These days, the 950 Kifer building that was the first headquarters could accommodate about 525 workers. Today, Intuitive Surgical says it employs 7,000 worldwide, of which more than half are located in Northern California.</p><p>\"We have mechanical engineers, computer engineers, electrical engineers, people who are experts in optics, artificial intelligence, machine learning,\" Guthart said. \"We are not a cloud company. We make physical products and do physical things in health care.\"</p><p>Having manufacturing operations in Silicon Valley creates important operational synergies, according to Intuitive.</p><p>\"We believe that some parts of manufacturing are important to have where our engineers are located,\" Guthart said. About 10,000 individual components go into a Da Vinci surgical robot. Guthart added, \"This is very high precision work and very low volume. That's why you want manufacturing engineers and product lines to be co-located.\"</p><p>During a stretch of three and a half years from January 2017 through June 2020, Intuitive Surgical's shopping spree totaling $109.1 million has encompassed at least nine parcels with 13 addresses on streets that include Kifer Road, Commercial Street, and Sonora Court.</p><p>Besides the recent property purchases, the multi-building cluster that is the core of Intuitive's Sunnyvale presence has an assessed value of $203.8 million, county documents show.</p><p>Intuitive Surgical also has leased two big buildings in Santa Clara, a few minutes from the Sunnyvale headquarters. These offices total a combined 210,000 square feet.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/07/investors-buy-san-jose-real-estate-google-village-deal-tech-transit/\">Google village sale leads to San Jose deals </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/07/letters-11/\"> Letters: Who will decide election | Yes on Prop. 15 | Homeland chief disgraceful | Save newspapers | Rioting isn't protesting </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/06/big-lease-guardant-health-deal-palo-alto-office-real-estate-jobs/\"> Guardant signs major Palo Alto lease </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/05/big-project-homes-office-retail-downtown-san-jose-real-estate/\"> Big mixed-use project planned near downtown San Jose </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/08/05/five9-big-lease-san-ramon-bishop-ranch-tech-real-estate-office/\"> Big tech lease signals East Bay market strength </url> At the same time that the property purchases have been ongoing, Intuitive is constructing a brand-new building at 1050 Kifer Road that is part of a new engineering campus for the company.</p><p>The expansion and property deals are occurring amid the coronavirus and social distancing protocols.</p><p>Plus, long-term challenges loom. Among these: housing prices, traffic woes, the cost of living, and the education system.</p><p>\"It's not the geography of Silicon Valley, it's the people who make it work,\" Guthart said. \"It the quality of life and the ability of people to move here are impaired, then the discussion becomes different. But so long as Silicon Valley keeps attracting fantastic human beings from around the world, it will remain a great place to be.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-7334532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-43F1-F0C5-X15T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00027TL</classCode><className>INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00023VC</classCode><className>SRI INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS339113 SURGICAL APPLIANCE &amp;

Corzine</url> is a 6-foot-2 bear of a man who has spent decades roaming expansive halls of power. He held the top job at the old       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/goldman-sachs-group-inc?inline=nyt-org\">Goldman Sachs</url> office tower, a concrete pinnacle of American capitalism. And after that, he had the run of the governor\u2019s mansion in New Jersey \u2014 all 18,000 square feet of it.</p><p>On a recent afternoon, however, he squeezed into a 100-square-foot office in the Flatiron district of Manhattan \u2014 no nameplate on the door \u2014 where a pair of Bloomberg terminals consumed much of the space. His eyes fixed on one, Mr. Corzine scribbled notes about his trades on a yellow legal pad as a computer chimed an imitation closing bell.</p><p>In the final seconds of trading, Mr. Corzine watched as a tiny sliver of his day\u2019s profits slipped away, prompting him to utter a profanity or two and grumble about not ending the afternoon on more of \u201ca high note.\u201d</p><p>It has been years since the last major high note in Mr. Corzine\u2019s career. In 2011, he faced the ignominy that came with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/a-romance-with-risk-that-brought-on-a-panic/?action=click&amp;contentCollection=DealBook&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article\">collapse of the brokerage firm he ran</url>, MF Global, when about $1 billion of customer money temporarily went missing. It ranked as one of the largest Wall Street bankruptcies since Lehman Brothers\u2019.</p><p>Now, here in his cramped office, Mr. Corzine is plotting his next and possibly final act: starting a hedge fund. And not just any hedge fund, but one designed to take advantage of the turmoil in the Trump era.</p><p>Wall Street\u2019s wheel of fortune has spun plenty of comeback stories over the years, from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/dealbook/michael-milken-returns-to-wall-street-for-uja-federation-dinner.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FMilken%2C%20Michael%20R.&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\">Michael Milken</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/business/media/axel-springer-to-acquire-controlling-stake-in-business-insider.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBlodget%2C%20Henry&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection\">Henry Blodget</url>. This will be the third spin of the wheel for Mr. Corzine, who won a United States Senate seat after being maneuvered out of Goldman, and who took the reins of MF Global after losing the New Jersey governorship to Chris Christie.</p><p>If the third time\u2019s the charm, few comebacks will have had the operatic extremes of Mr. Corzine\u2019s past decade. It is a period that includes not only MF Global\u2019s demise but also his own near-death experience in a car accident and, later, the death of his youngest son.</p><p>In his first interview since the MF Global meltdown began, Mr. Corzine detailed his plans for a new hedge fund, saying that he will seek to anticipate what often seems unpredictable: how the Trump administration and other world leaders will enact policy and, in turn, move markets.</p><p>One of his Trump trades, for example, is designed to pay off in the event of a broad decline in the stock market, not unlike what happened Wednesday when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/business/dealbook/stocks-markets.html\">shares swooned</url> on Trump-related worries. On the bullish side, he hopes to ride a wave of a corporate-tax overhaul while trading in big tech, banking and industrial companies poised to gain from a policy shift.</p><p>After straddling the worlds of Washington and Wall Street for decades, Mr. Corzine, a liberal Democrat with a capitalist streak, argues that he is well suited for this strategy. He has mulled a hedge fund for years, ambitions <url normalizedValue=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/no-criminal-case-is-likely-in-loss-at-mf-global/\">f</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/no-criminal-case-is-likely-in-loss-at-mf-global/\">irst reported by The Times in 2012</url>, and he believes that the populist movements sweeping the Western world (not just Trump, but \u201cBrexit\u201d) provide an opening.</p><p>\u201cI think I can read between the lines more than a lot of people can on these issues,\u201d he said last month, on the eve of a trip to raise money for his fund with wealthy investors.</p><p>In the first few weeks of marketing, Mr. Corzine has secured commitments and indications of interest in the tens of millions of dollars, according to a colleague who is helping him reach an initial goal of roughly $150 million. At a time when the stars of the hedge fund world can raise billions of dollars in a matter of weeks, Mr. Corzine\u2019s financial ambition is modest. The real test will come, he said, if after several months the fund can demonstrate healthy returns and expand to a broader base of investors.</p><p>Wearing his trademark sweater and beard, Mr. Corzine, now 70, added, \u201cAnd, you know, I am competitive.\u201d</p><p>That competitive streak may stoke a romance with risk that has trailed Mr. Corzine\u2019s career from Wall Street to Washington (and Trenton) and back again. A friend who works on Wall Street acknowledged that Mr. Corzine, even when placing a prudent bet, sometimes has trouble taking his foot off the gas \u2014 Exhibit A being MF Global.</p><p>During interviews, Mr. Corzine discussed new details about the final days of MF Global, including an interaction with Carl C. Icahn, as well as his regrets over not booking a big loss up front, a decision that came back to bite the firm. Still, he defended his tenure at MF Global. He noted that, despite a federal investigation, there was no evidence he misused the $1 billion in missing customer money, which was ultimately found and returned. This year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/business/dealbook/mf-global-jon-corzine-penalty-settlement.html\">he reached a civil settlement</url> over accusations that he failed to supervise employees who handled the money.</p><p>Mr. Corzine also spoke publicly for the first time about the death of his son Jeffrey, who was by his side during his time at MF Global and who invested his own money in the firm. Jeffrey\u2019s death in 2014 led Mr. Corzine to name the hedge fund JDC/JSC Opportunity Fund, using his son\u2019s initials and his own as he resumes his trading career.</p><p>\u201cHe is a legendary trader who has spent his life deeply interested and involved in markets,\u201d Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary who worked with Mr. Corzine atop Goldman in the late 1990s, said in an interview.</p><p>While MF Global investors might view some of Mr. Corzine\u2019s trades as dangerous, his friends credit his risk-taking with scoring some of his life\u2019s surprising victories: walking onto the basketball team at the University of Illinois having come from a tiny farming town, winning a Senate seat when he had never held even local office, and then voting against the Iraq war long before public opinion was on his side.</p><p>Sharon Elghanayan, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/fashion/weddings/28CORZINE.html\">his wife</url> and a psychotherapist, put it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s not risk to him. It\u2019s conviction.\u201d</p><p>Back in the Spotlight</p><p>Soon after MF Global imploded in the fall of 2011, Mr. Corzine was walking down Fifth Avenue when, he said, a stranger unleashed an expletive-filled assault. These days, venturing outside is no longer perilous.</p><p>Strangers greet him on the street as \u201cGovernor.\u201d And most Sundays, Mr. Corzine and Ms. Elghanayan walk to the 3 Guys Restaurant on the Upper East Side to eat among the financial upper crust. Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman executive who is now a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor, are said to frequent the restaurant, where, for the price of a $20 Reuben and fries, Wall Street titans <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/31/inside-new-york-s-most-powerful-diner\">can see and be seen.</url></p><p>Now, Mr. Corzine is being seen on a much bigger stage. On Friday, he appeared at the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.saltconference.com/index.html\">SALT Conference in Las Vegas</url>, the premier hedge fund schmooze-fest, where he joined Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ben Bernanke and the singer Jewel, as well as hundreds of fund managers and reporters.</p><p>That appearance coincides with Mr. Corzine\u2019s fund-raising tour. And while it\u2019s early days yet, there are signs his pitch is resonating with some investors.</p><p>After securing commitments from family and friends, he recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, where he met with a number of wealthy investors. He also plans to visit Latin America and Hong Kong.</p><p>When the fund-raising concludes, Mr. Corzine hopes to have collected just shy of $150 million, the amount at which private funds must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That sum will include several million dollars of his own money.</p><p>In addition to trading, Mr. Corzine will help clients decipher the inner workings of Washington, particularly for investors feeling bewildered in the age of Trump. Sure, he has not worked in Washington in a dozen years. But he says he has a social network encompassing Goldmanites (Lloyd C. Blankfein, the current chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Cohn, for example) and a younger crew of Wall Street insiders whom he recruited to MF Global, including Omeed Malik, a Bank of America executive who oversees a unit that helps hedge funds open their doors.</p><p>Mr. Corzine is joining the business at a shaky time. Some major investment firms, including Fortress Investment Group, have shut down funds, while another notable trip-up came from Marc Mezvinsky, Hillary Clinton\u2019s son-in-law, who closed his fund last year after a failed bet on an economic revival in Greece.</p><p>But others are raking in money, and Mr. Corzine argues that this moment provides him a leg up. He can interpret a poll better than your average trader, he said, and scan the news media knowing \u201cwhich reporters are full of\u201d it, he added, using an expletive.</p><p>If all goes according to plan, Mr. Corzine expects to open his fund in the fall. He hopes to hire a half-dozen employees, up from the current two: Sean Roberts, a trader and investment professional he first hired at MF Global, and Nancy Dunlap, his longtime lawyer.</p><p>The fund will hire at least one more lawyer, he said, because \u201cI can\u2019t afford a reputational issue.\u201d</p><p>Growing Up With Risk</p><p>Mr. Corzine said he was not stamped as a risk-taker at Goldman Sachs or on Capitol Hill. He traces the trait much earlier, to his hometown, Willey Station, Ill., population 40, where every year his father would plant corn and soybeans hoping they would sprout and praying that the weather would not destroy them.</p><p>\u201cI grew up with risk,\u201d Mr. Corzine said.</p><p>Yet his father avoided financial risk, refusing to ever use a credit card, scarred by his own parents losing a fortune in <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">the Great Depression</url>. And his father stuck to farming, frustrating a young Mr. Corzine, who had hoped his father would venture into local politics.</p><p>Years later, after a stint in the Marine Corps Reserves and graduation from the University of Chicago\u2019s business school, Mr. Corzine learned risk-taking for himself Wall Street-style.</p><p>In 1976, Goldman hired him for an entry-level job. Within a few years, he took over the government bond trading division and ascended to the top of Goldman in 1994, as senior partner. He soon set the firm on a path to becoming a public company.</p><p>That process unfolded in fits and starts as Mr. Corzine faced opposition from some partners. He won overwhelmingly, but after a number of other disagreements with fellow managers, what happened next was cutthroat even by Wall Street standards. He returned from a family ski trip to learn that he had been ousted.</p><p>The 2011 book <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/books/money-and-power-about-goldman-sachs-by-william-d-cohan-review.html\">\u201cMoney and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World\u201d</url> details how Mr. Corzine, without telling Mr. Paulson or other top executives, met once with the chief executive of Mellon Bank about a potential merger, a move that aggravated tensions and may have contributed to his ouster. Mr. Paulson, who declined to discuss the events surrounding Mr. Corzine\u2019s departure, then took over the firm.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Corzine acknowledged meeting the Mellon bank chief, and said he had a duty to explore other options before the I.P.O. He paused, and then added: \u201cMaybe they\u2019re right. Maybe I should have told people I was going to do that.\u201d</p><p>It did not take long to move on. Within months, he was running in New Jersey for the United States Senate.</p><p>After dropping about $60 million of his own money on the race \u2014 along with some cash from Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, now Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law \u2014 Mr. Corzine cruised to victory.</p><p>In the Senate, he helped lead an effort to provide a tax holiday for the families of 9/11 victims, and was one of only 23 senators to vote against the Iraq war. During that period, he also sought a divorce from his wife of 33 years, whom he met in the second grade.</p><p>Mr. Corzine was dating a New Jersey union leader at the time, and although the relationship ended, the romance raised eyebrows as his ambitions were expanding: Mr. Corzine planned a run for New Jersey governor.</p><p>He prevailed at the polls, but a little over a year later, he nearly died. Rushing to a meeting, Mr. Corzine\u2019s driver was traveling 91 miles an hour when he lost control of the sport utility vehicle. Mr. Corzine, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was induced into a coma.</p><p>\u201cIt happened like this,\u201d Mr. Corzine recalled, snapping his finger.</p><p>A month after waking up, he was back working on his liberal agenda. Mr. Corzine eventually won early childhood education for underprivileged children. He established paid family leave. And he abolished the death penalty, the first state in a generation to do so.</p><p>Even in deep blue New Jersey, those changes were not enough to secure him a second term. As he has committed to memory, \u201cI lost by 3.61\u201d points.</p><p>\u2018Single Greatest Mistake\u2019</p><p>Ms. Elghanayan advised Mr. Corzine to \u201cwait, don\u2019t do anything\u201d after the campaign loss. It was advice that Mr. Corzine declined to follow.</p><p>In an interview, he said he had chosen between offers at the prominent hedge fund D. E. Shaw and the second-tier brokerage firm MF Global. D. E. Shaw offered more money and prestige. MF Global offered the chairman and chief executive roles. He chose MF Global.</p><p>By the time he arrived, the firm had recorded three consecutive years of losses, and Mr. Corzine concluded that a bolder approach was needed. He became one of the firm\u2019s most profitable traders of its own money, and convened a weekly meeting with other traders to solicit \u201cbest ideas.\u201d</p><p>One idea was to buy European government debt at a time when some countries with the euro currency were experiencing a crisis, a trade that was well underway before Mr. Corzine arrived. He saw an opportunity to expand the firm\u2019s use of a technique that would produce steady returns from the trade while the European Union effectively pledged to backstop the eurozone sovereign debt. Just in case, Mr. Corzine had an insurance policy, taking a short position against the euro, a fact he now wishes he had trumpeted louder to investors.</p><p>The investment was paying off, helping the firm return to profitability. But Mr. Corzine\u2019s strategy had its critics. One of MF Global\u2019s risk officers questioned the trade, and so did regulators.</p><p>\u201cHistory has proven that the trade was entirely correct,\u201d said David Gelber, an MF Global board member who until now had not spoken publicly about the firm\u2019s collapse. \u201cBut I think we were too introverted. We knew it to be safe, but we didn\u2019t appreciate the reaction of the outside world to the size of these positions.\u201d</p><p>Investors were on edge.</p><p>In October 2011, Mr. Corzine said, the firm\u2019s auditors forced it to write down the value of an unrelated future tax benefit. That caused a huge quarterly loss, an oft-ignored explanation for the firm\u2019s decline. Amid confusion at the time, investors generally conflated that loss with the eurozone sovereign debt trade.</p><p>Mr. Corzine called his decision not to take the write-down earlier his \u201csingle greatest mistake\u201d at the firm.</p><p>But the final blow arguably came that same week in late October from the rating agencies, when Moody\u2019s cut its assessments of MF Global twice in a matter of days, citing the European trade and \u201cincreased risk appetite.\u201d This prompted a run on the firm.</p><p>Mr. Corzine argued that Moody\u2019s was well aware of the European trade. But he also acknowledged that he had overlooked and failed to communicate with the analyst Moody\u2019s had recently assigned to MF Global, leading him to wonder now whether \u201cthat\u2019s one of my mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Those next few days, Mr. Corzine worked through each night and slept on his office floor. Sensing things were improving, he went home to shower in the predawn hours of Oct. 28 when the phone rang with bad news: The firm had overdrawn a JPMorgan Chase bank account.</p><p>Mr. Corzine returned to work and phoned a back-office employee who handled wire transfers. He told her to meet JPMorgan\u2019s demands, declaring that it was \u201cthe most important thing\u201d to do because otherwise the bank would halt business with MF Global, court records show.</p><p>She complied. But in doing so, she transferred customer money to JPMorgan, not MF Global\u2019s own money, violating a cardinal rule of the brokerage industry. It was one of several wire transfers to a bank or clearinghouse that included customer money.</p><p>Mr. Corzine, who later hired the defense attorney Andrew Levander, said he was unaware that the money belonged to customers, citing an email he received at the time indicating that it was the firm\u2019s.</p><p>As that problem unfolded, Mr. Corzine had another pressing assignment: selling the firm and its various holdings.</p><p>By Oct. 30, Interactive Brokers was planning to buy the firm, while Mr. Corzine met with Mr. Icahn, the billionaire investor, who was interested in the euro positions. Mr. Icahn promised to make a decision by morning, Mr. Corzine recalled.</p><p>Both deals fell apart (investors who later bought the euro positions reaped a huge profit) when the firm discovered a roughly $1 billion shortfall in its customers\u2019 assets. MF Global went out of business.</p><p>\u201cThe MF Global episode provided a very stark example of a failure to supervise a broker dealer,\u201d said Christopher Whalen, the chairman of Whalen Global Advisors and a longtime Wall Street analyst. \u201cWall Street is filled with examples of people who are really smart and have great skills as bankers and traders but maybe are not the right people to run an enterprise.\u201d</p><p> The Trump Trade</p><p>When Mr. Corzine turned 70 on New Year\u2019s Day, he took his children and grandchildren to the Caribbean for a celebration. The birthday was not the only significant event that week.</p><p>Days later, the <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/commodity_futures_trading_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</url> announced that Mr. Corzine had agreed to pay $5 million to settle accusations that he had failed to supervise MF Global. A criminal investigation fizzled years earlier, and the customer money was long since recovered and returned.</p><p>With all of that behind him, Mr. Corzine was free to start a hedge fund, a business that need not operate under the gaze of public shareholders or rating agencies.</p><p>Although the settlement imposed a lifetime prohibition from registering with the trading commission \u2014 effectively preventing his fund from trading more than a small amount of other people\u2019s money in the futures industry \u2014 stocks, bonds and most currencies are fair game. And that could leave plenty of room, he says, for the Trump trade.</p><p>Mr. Corzine would hardly be the only hedge fund manager seizing the moment in Washington. Some expect <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/business/dealbook/trump-stocks.html\">a correction in the stock market</url> as investors come to terms with turmoil in the White House.</p><p>Mr. Corzine worries that the administration will make \u201ca serious foreign policy mistake,\u201d he said, which would be \u201chorrible for markets.\u201d He said that he planned to place a major bet that the market would fall but added that, as an American, \u201cI\u2019m hoping that I\u2019m wasting money.\u201d</p><p>His thesis is not solely that the Trump presidency will fail, but also that, with policies like tax reform, \u201cthe functional element of Washington may create opportunities, too.\u201d</p><p>The fund, he said, will help him expand philanthropic efforts at a time when his personal fortune is a fraction of what it once was. Mr. Corzine\u2019s net worth has shrunk to less than $40 million today from about $500 million at its height, friends say. He forfeited money in the divorce and spent well over $100 million funding his own political campaigns and many millions more on legal bills, expenses and charity, including donations to the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.</p><p>On Wednesday, he joined the board of Covenant House, a charity that works with homeless children, a cause he took up soon after the death of his son, a photographer who regularly distributed food to the homeless. Discussing his son, who <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/former_gov_corzines_son_took_his_own_life_family_spokesman_confirms.html\">committed suicide</url> at the age of 31, Mr. Corzine said, \u201cI take, in my heart, some responsibility,\u201d fighting back tears.</p><p>\u201cUntil you\u2019ve lost a child, it\u2019s impossible to understand how deeply someone who\u2019s suffered that loss will go to save other children from a similar tragedy,\u201d said Kevin Ryan, the head of Covenant House, who was the children and families commissioner in New Jersey under Mr. Corzine. \u201cI think the loss of Jeff fuels and haunts and inspires Jon.\u201d</p><p>Now that he is focusing on opening his new fund, Mr. Corzine wakes up at 4 a.m. for the opening of European markets and lands in the office by the 9:30 a.m. opening bell in New York.</p><p>\u201cThere are some people who look forward to using the blessing of what happens with the 70-plus life,\u201d he said, by \u201ccatching up on things that they weren\u2019t able to do. I want to do that in a context where I feel like I\u2019m still contributing.\u201d</p><p>Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.</p><p>PHOTOS: Jon S.

Instead, the disclosure showed something refreshing for a young technology company these days: Twitter is acting like an adult.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That may not have been apparent in August when Twitter announced - via a tweet, naturally - that it had filed its initial I.P.O. prospectus confidentially. The 2012 Jump Start Our Business Start-ups, or JOBS Act, made that possible, allowing companies to file their offering documents confidentially to be reviewed by the <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/securities_and_exchange_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Securities and Exchange Commission</url>. Once the review is done, the I.P.O. documents are made public. The idea is to provide a period for small companies to test the waters and perhaps avoid a media frenzy like the one that accompanied       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=FB&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Facebook</url> as each version of its I.P.O. document was feverishly reviewed and commented on in public.</p><p>The JOBS Act has its opponents, though, and has been criticized for reducing regulation but not really doing much to encourage offerings. The Twitter I.P.O. released some of this pent-up criticism as commentators assailed the confidentiality of Twitter's filing, asserting that the public would lose out.</p><p>In Twitter's case, though, it doesn't seem like the confidentiality provisions helped. The reason is that the eventual public filing didn't change much from the original confidential one.</p><p>To compare the confidential and the public Twitter prospectuses, I ran them through plagiarism software to see the amount of change from the two versions. The idea is that the more changes there are, the more intensive the S.E.C. review and the less prepared the initial filing were. The Twitter I.P.O. filing released last week had 86 percent of the initial one's content.</p><p>Compare this with Facebook, <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=ZNGA&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Zynga</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GRPN&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Groupon</url>. Facebook and Zynga's final I.P.O. prospectuses were 78 percent similar to their initial one, while Groupon's final filing was 68 percent similar to its initial filing.</p><p>Twitter will most likely update its prospectus again with new information before it goes public. So far, it has filed four versions of its prospectus, while Zynga had nine amendments. A perusal of the Twitter I.P.O. documents also shows that the changes from one filing to another are not terribly significant.</p><p>Sure, Twitter eventually noted that up to 5 percent of its users might be spammers, but the accounting numbers had few changes - and most of them were updates for the next quarter. Most of Twitter's other revisions that were not related to accounting appear to be about a new incentive compensation program.</p><p>The reasons for the fewer changes may be that Twitter simply did a better job on its initial filing and didn't try to play games. In the cases of Groupon and Zynga, for example, the companies pushed the envelope on their accounting, using novel metrics more akin to Grouponics and Zyngametrics than real accounting numbers. Faced with this, is there any wonder that the S.E.C. pushed back, resulting in more changes?</p><p>Not only that, but Twitter surprised many by electing to maintain a more traditional corporate governance structure, spurning the dual-class shares that are in favor with technology companies because they give the founders control of the company. For example, Mark Pincus, the founder of Zynga, issued himself shares that had 70 votes apiece, and <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/mark_e_zuckerberg/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Mark Zuckerberg</url> of Facebook put in place voting stock that could conceivably give his heirs control of the social networking company.</p><p>And unlike the I.P.O.'s for other tech companies, in which the founders cash in by selling their shares, Twitter is the only seller and its founders are holding their shares. Twitter also elected to largely not follow the rest of the JOBS Act rules for less disclosure.</p><p>In short, the Twitter I.P.O. looks more like a mature company's I.P.O.</p><p>There is a lesson here.</p><p>After Twitter announced that it had made a confidential filing, Groupon's co-founder, Andrew Mason, wrote on Twitter: \"Confidential S1s? But what could be wrong with releasing 100s of pages of new financial and strategic co. info to the Internet while gagged?\" While Mr. Mason may be decrying the regulatory process, he has only himself to blame.</p><p>Since <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GOOG&amp;inline=nyt-org\">Google</url> sought to sell its I.P.O. shares in a modified Dutch auction, the princes of Silicon Valley have believed that not only can they change the way we use technology, but that they should change everything else, including the I.P.O. process.</p><p>Innovation can be a good thing, but when it comes to I.P.O.'s, it often hasn't worked. In some cases, these companies have appeared to be petulantly saying that anything other than their way is suboptimal. In the case of the Facebook I.P.O., the company came off looking as if it was acting to benefit itself at the expense of its new shareholders.</p><p>Twitter appears to be the first big tech I.P.O. in which a company simply prepared a thorough filing without pushing the boundaries.</p><p>In this light, perhaps confidentiality provisions did not do as much for Twitter as simply doing a good job did.</p><p>Confidentiality may be a good thing for companies that do not have their act together. But it can cut both ways. Maybe the S.E.C. will be harder on those companies because of the confidentiality granted to them and the fact that they are not being scrutinized publicly.</p><p>Commentators have also focused on the fact that information is lost when a review is made in private, but perhaps the real virtue of public scrutiny is that it exposes the companies that have not done a thorough job. And admittedly, if each Twitter revision had been made public, there would have been media attention with each filing. But that is what goes with becoming a public company.</p><p>This still does not mean that all will go smoothly for Twitter's I.P.O. Over the weekend, Twitter's chief executive ended up getting into a spat about the lack of women in high positions at the company, which was not a good idea. Still, the fact that Twitter is simply pursuing an I.P.O. on relatively friendly shareholder terms rather than trying to transform the markets is a good sign. The future billionaires of Silicon Valley may want to pay attention. Humility and diligence can sometimes work wonders for your I.P.O.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/suntrust-analyst-explains-his-50-a-share-price-target-for-twitter/\">SunTrust Analyst Explains His $50 a Share Price Target for Twitter</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/as-twitter-opens-up-employees-do-too/\">As Twitter Opens Up, Employees Do, Too</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYTBLG-243581683</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYTBLG2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59J0-VNR1-JBKK-52FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379740</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 The News York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times Blogs <br/>(DealBook)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>October 8, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000CPCV</classCode><className>GROUPON INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

The rapid pace of technological change -- including artificial intelligence and facial recognition -- is mingling ever more with national security concerns that European leaders have been slow to grasp and respond to, analysts say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  As global technology shapes up into a battleground between China and the United States, Europe is finding it harder to set the rules of the road while others in Beijing and Washington are in the diver's seat.</p><p>  ''Europe needs to get its act together,'' said Marietje Schaake, international policy director at the Cyber Policy Center of Stanford University and a former member of the European Parliament. ''I worry the tempo is too slow for the pace at which changes are forthcoming.''</p><p>  The most recent example is TikTok, the wildly popular Chinese short video app, which the Trump administration has challenged by using many of the same national security arguments it employed against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and its bid to become the globe's dominant 5G provider.</p><p>  Time and again, such disputes have left European leaders, regulators and industries squeezed between Beijing and Washington, risking retaliation against carmakers, financial services firms or agriculture companies if they choose one side over the other.</p><p>  In response, European leaders have belatedly embarked on a generational project toward ''digital sovereignty,'' mixing tougher rules against foreign tech companies with efforts to boost local innovation.</p><p>  Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission vice president in charge of digital issues, has called it a ''new phase'' for technology policy in the region.</p><p>  But those policies will take years to shift the balance meaningfully in Europe's favor, analysts say, and many question whether they are really enough to close the technology gap with the United States and China.</p><p>  One reason Brussels risks falling behind is that security remains the responsibility of individual member nations, not one ceded to the European Union, Ms. Schaake said.</p><p>  ''TikTok confronts Europe with the weaknesses of its digital and national security policies,'' she said. ''Europe is na\u00efve about certain of the technologies coming from China and the United States, and just says that anyone doing business in Europe has to respect our rights and regulations.''</p><p>  After months of debate, some European leaders are coming around to views closer to those held in Washington, where President Trump has moved to try to force the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company, charging that the company's Chinese ties present a national security threat.</p><p>  It has used the same argument against Huawei, the telecommunications giant, though both companies deny any explicit link to the Chinese government.</p><p>  In Europe, the American point of view on Huawei, backed by the threat of secondary sanctions, has gained ground, most recently in Britain, where a ban was adopted in July.</p><p>  But most Europeans mostly still see TikTok not as a security threat, but as a risk to privacy. Even if the White House-orchestrated TikTok sale goes through, the European operations will remain under the ownership of the Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p><p>  TikTok uses both facial recognition and artificial intelligence, important technologies that are not regulated by the United States or the European Union. ''With the combination of competition, artificial intelligence and security, it makes sense why some policymakers are concerned,'' said Andreas Aktoudianakis, a digital policy analyst with the European Policy Center, a research institution in Brussels.</p><p>  ''Europe wants to regulate artificial intelligence and other technologies, but it's slow and there's no real timeline,'' he added. ''We're late to catch the train.''</p><p>  Gerard de Graaf, director for the digital single market for the European Commission, said that the European Union needed ''a lot more cooperation among member states on the issue of security.''</p><p>  Europe has no major social media platforms, he conceded in a seminar at Bruegel, a Brussels research institution, but is doing well in financial technology, robotics and 5G. ''It's not that the E.U. is way behind everyone else,'' he said, ''but we have challenges.''</p><p>  But Francesca Bria, chair of the Italian National Innovation Fund, argued that Europe risked being squashed between the Chinese state model -- which is represented by Huawei, WeChat, Alibaba, Tencent and TikTok, with their state subsidies -- and the ''big company, big tech surveillance'' of the American giants.</p><p>  ''If we fail to regain digital sovereignty,'' she said, ''we risk becoming a colony caught between the U.S. and China,'' with risks to democracy.</p><p>  American tech shares alone are more valuable than the whole European stock market, Ms. Bria said. ''Europe needs to remain relevant as a global economic power, not just a regulatory power,'' she said.</p><p>  The weaknesses are stark. The world's most popular smartphones are made in China, South Korea and the United States. The biggest social media and online shopping platforms come from American and Chinese companies, as do the largest providers of cloud computing and artificial intelligence services.</p><p>  Europe has been missing from the list of the world's most influential technology companies since the fall of Nokia about a decade ago. For reasons including lack of venture capital, language barriers and a cultural aversion to risk, European companies have struggled to match the entrepreneurial pace in a technology industry now dominated by mobile devices, internet services and online communication tools.</p><p>  Europe has attempted to influence the digital economy through regulation, adopting tough data protection rules and aggressively enforcing antitrust laws.</p><p>  But European leaders are realizing the limits of those efforts, particularly as its citizens depend on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in the absence of European alternatives. The biggest European technology company is Germany's SAP, a business software provider that competes with American companies like Microsoft and Oracle.</p><p>  Along with privacy and security issues, TikTok also raises questions about disinformation and about censorship exercised by the company on issues of sensitivity to China. The European Data Protection Board said in June that it would set up a task force to assess TikTok's activities across the bloc.</p><p>  But it is not clear what European agency would take the lead, especially since TikTok in July shifted data protection functions to Dublin. That might give the Irish Data Protection Commission oversight of the company when it comes to privacy issues. But the agency has faced criticism in the past for not being more aggressive.</p><p>  Noah Barkin, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said Europe's lack of influence ultimately stemmed from its dearth of influential tech businesses. Europe will face these difficulties for years as China and the United States battle for tech supremacy.</p><p>  ''Europe hasn't developed its own global digital companies to compete with the big U.S. and Chinese firms, and ultimately that's what digital sovereignty is all about,'' Mr. Barkin said. ''It can't just be a regulator.''</p><p>  Europe's plans for ''digital sovereignty'' are still vague, said Rebecca Arcesati, an analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin.</p><p>  ''This is a talking point, but it is a long way before Europe can develop its own digital champions,'' she said. ''It may be too late.''</p><p>  Fabrice Pothier, chief strategy officer at the Rasmussen Global consulting firm in Brussels, said American pressure was forcing Europe to recalibrate its relationship with China, particularly on technology matters.</p><p>  ''It's a wake-up call to Europe,'' he said. ''There is no such thing as a benign technology and network operator from China.''</p><p>  On this matter, the Trump administration is ''not necessarily wrong,'' he said. ''Europe is generally behind the curve.''</p><p>  Steven Erlanger reported from Brussels, and Adam Satariano from London.

Although U.S. manufacturers still dominate in industries such as aerospace and U.S. farmers remain the most productive in the world, their role is the economy is being eclipsed by services.   There are many reasons for this shift, not the least of which are the income and lifestyle aspirations of American workers. Working on a farm or an assembly line is hard , and many\u2014perhaps most\u2014Americans would rather do something else.    The Internet has made that dream possible for a growing number of people, spawning millions of new enterprises and transforming old ones with its unique capacity to stimulate commerce. It is no coincidence that America\u2019s greatest business successes of the new century\u2014companies like Amazon  AMZN  and Alphabet and Facebook  FB  \u2014all depend on the Internet and focus on providing services.    This is a revolutionary trend in business, and unsettling to some. There is a fear that Internet-based enterprises will destroy jobs, evade taxes, invade privacy, spread vices and otherwise cause disruption. Whatever validity these fears may have, they result from the voluntary choices of consumers rather than the business strategies of Big Tech.          It is not common in U.S. political culture to oppose trends set in motion by the behavior of millions of consumers seeking the best solutions to their needs.    Nonetheless, on July 27 some members of the House Judiciary Committee are likely to do precisely that. The committee\u2019s antitrust panel has been investigating the nation\u2019s biggest technology companies for a year, and on that day the CEOs of four of them will appear before the committee: Tim Cook of Apple  AAPL  , Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet (Google  GOOGL  \u2019s parent).    This has never happened before, and it underscores the importance that both political parties assign to restraining potential excesses in an Internet-based economy. Federal law governing the Internet hasn\u2019t changed much since the World Wide Web was in its infancy, so there\u2019s a case to be made for legislative review.    The case for an antitrust inquiry is less convincing. Antitrust law originated over a century ago when industrialists sought to monopolize segments of the economy as a way of assuring profits. The laws were intended to prevent combinations that might weaken competition, discourage innovation and reduce consumer choice.    For instance, Standard Oil, which had come to control 90% of U.S. petroleum refining, was broken up.    The difference between Standard Oil and today\u2019s Internet behemoths, though, is that consumers have plenty of alternatives for what Big Tech provides, and the barriers to new market entrants are not high the way they were for refiners in 1900. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet got big because consumers preferred them to other options. That was due in no small part to their continuous innovation.    You really have to twist the intent of antitrust law to make a case against companies like Alphabet\u2019s Google, because its market dominance in search resulted from consumer choice rather than a lack of alternatives. The imposition of antitrust sanctions would amount to punishment for success or mere bigness, rather than a rational application of regulatory power.    Or take the example of Facebook, which, like the other companies testifying on July 27, is the subject of an antitrust inquiry by the government\u2019s executive branch. The main complaint antitrust types seem to have against Facebook is that it supposedly made acquisitions as it grew aimed at dominating social networking.    Exhibit A in this case is the 2012 acquisition of Instagram, which has become phenomenally successful under Facebook\u2019s tutelage. At the time it was bought, though, the company had only 13 employees and no ability to scale to what it has now become. People laughed that Zuckerberg would be willing to pay a billion dollars for such a modest business.    It turned out to be a smart move, but as Instagram took off many younger users shifted their attention from Facebook to the new platform, so there was a downside.    But trying to retrospectively fit the acquisition of Instagram (or WhatsApp, or Oculus VR) into a pattern aimed at restraining competition and squelching innovation is simply misleading. There are plenty of places outside the Facebook family that people can go online to network or game or post photos or get the news, and they all innovate furiously.    The same can be said of all the Big Tech companies. They have to run as fast as they can just to stay where they are. Innovation has been the key to their success, and new market entrants are constantly emerging to challenge that success.    What makes this relevant to national security is that the new entrants increasingly aren\u2019t American, they\u2019re Chinese. The biggest reason U.S. manufacturing has receded since 2000 is the rise of China, and the success of companies like Beijing-based Bytedance\u2014TikTok\u2019s parent\u2014is a signal that China is capable of doing the same thing to U.S. tech companies that it has already done to steel makers and electronics manufacturers.    TikTok was downloaded over 300 million times during the first quarter on 2020, making it the most downloaded app during a single quarter in history. Six of the top ten apps in India, soon to be the world\u2019s most populous country, are Chinese. Indian authorities reversed that trend when they banned Chinese apps after a border skirmish, but America\u2019s Internet-based service providers can expect continuous assaults by Chinese rivals for the foreseeable future.    Beijing is undoubtedly encouraging if not subsidizing such assaults. The contrast between how the Chinese government treats its tech companies and the way Washington treats its own players is hard to miss. Whether we like it or not, companies like Alphabet and Facebook have become the leading purveyors of American ideas and influence to the world. If they are hobbled, Chinese competitors will eagerly take their place.    There is no compelling argument for breaking up or otherwise sanctioning U.S. technology leaders. If you think America\u2019s Big Tech companies have too much power, imagine how it will feel when their successors are run out of the People\u2019s Republic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42612862255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CF-BYH1-JCSC-J4C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Another judge represented AT&amp;T Inc. as a private lawyer and later presided over a case involving the telecommunications company.</p><p> Mr. Morinville estimates that the review board has invalidated patents in 92 percent of the cases it has resolved.</p><p> Eyebrows were raised this summer when a lawyer representing the patent office in a federal court appeal of a board decision acknowledged that the agency had added extra judges to reviews in order to achieve the desired outcome. The patent office attorney said the move was necessary to \"ensure the [director's] policy positions are being enforced.\"</p><p> The Supreme Court will take up the issue in a case that asks the justices to declare the appeals board process unconstitutional.</p><p> Oral arguments in the case, Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group, are scheduled for Nov. 27.</p><p>Congress created the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to address complaints that the patent office was approving too many applications that were vague or overly broad. The board was expected to be cheaper and more efficient than courts to resolve patent disputes.</p><p> It handles contested patent cases through administrative proceedings known as inter partes reviews. All cases are managed by panels of three to five administrative law judges.</p><p> Inventors say the rulings often seem arbitrary and are particularly irked by what they see as a pro-corporate bent among the administrative law judges. They say anyone can bring a challenge, and the judges can continue a case even if the complaint is withdrawn.</p><p> The appeals board is not subject to review by the regular court system, which the inventor community says leaves it with little recourse.</p><p> \"There is no code of conduct for PTAB judges,\" Mr. Morinville said. \"There is no rule of law in the PTAB, and that is what really angers people in terms of the invalidation which should rely on the rule of law.\"</p><p> The patent office's chief information officer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p> The test case before the Supreme Court involves Houston-based Oil States, a company that provides equipment for the oil and gas industry. It received a patent for a tool that pumps fluid into an oil well without fluid making contact with the wellhead.</p><p>Greene's Energy Group of Imperial, Pennsylvania, challenged that patent through a review, and the board invalidated it. Oil States asked the board if it could amend the patent, but that motion was denied. The company then filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p><p>Oil States said the review process is unconstitutional because a patent is a form of private property and the same agency that grants a property right can eliminate it without a jury trial in federal court.</p><p> The Federal Circuit rejected Oil States' argument and affirmed the board's decision. Oil States petitioned the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.</p><p> The Supreme Court denied similar requests over the past few years to determine the constitutionality of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's reviews.</p><p> Some patent analysts said Justice Neil M. Gorsuch may be the reason the court chose to hear Oil States. Justice Gorsuch, who was confirmed to the court this year, has expressed concerns about administrative adjudication in judicial opinions.</p><p> \"Clearly, the court took this on to not just leave things as status quo,\" said Art Monk, vice president of patent transactions at TechInsights, a San Jose, California-based provider of patent data. \"They could do something radical like invalidate the entire America Invents Act or do something more benign like provide guidance on how property rights need to he handled.\"</p><p> If the Supreme Court decides the board's reviews are unconstitutional, then the ruling could restrict other federal agencies' uses of administrative tribunals to resolve disputes. The Federal Election Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Communications Commission are among the agencies that rely on such systems, known as administrative adjudication.</p><p> \"A ruling striking down PTAB would show the Supreme Court wants to tighten the constraints on administration adjudication and could lead to challenges over other well-established forms of adjudication,\" said Greg Reilly, who teaches patent law at Chicago-Kent College of Law.</p><p> Small companies and independent inventors say patents are property rights and can be revoked only by a federal court. Several groups, including conservative organizations and a coalition of patent law professors, have filed briefs in support of Oil States.</p><p> \"We have judicial opinions written over the past 150 years affirming patents as private property rights,\" said Greg Dolin, a patent law professor at the University of Baltimore Law School who filed a brief in support of Oil States. \"Court after court and justice after justice keep saying patents are private property rights that can only be adjudicated in courts.\"</p><p>Large tech companies contend that patents are public property and the same government that recognizes them can regulate how they are adjudicated.</p><p> The Patent Trial and Appeal Board system gives challengers more leeway to invalidate a patent based on the portion of the technology used instead of the entire patent.</p><p> \"The PTAB and its review process are constitutional,\" Mr. Reilly said. \"Patents are created by federal statute, which also gives Congress the right to specify administrative adjudication. Inter parties reviews are appealable to Federal Circuit which protects due process concerns.\"</p><p> Even if the court finds the review process unconstitutional, it's not clear what would happen to the patents the PTAB has already invalidated.</p><p> \"I think we could have a situation in which changes to the law don't apply retroactively. I think there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding this case,\" Mr. Reilly said.</p><p> The debate over the Patent Trial and Appeal Board has attracted attention on Capitol Hill. In June, Sen. Christopher A. Coons, Delaware Democrat, introduced legislation dubbed the Stronger Patents Act. Delaware is the nation's busiest jurisdiction for patent disputes. More than 6,500 patent cases were filed in federal court in Delaware in 2014, according to the most recently available data from PwC, the brand name for PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p> Mr. Coons said the bill would bring more balance to the board's reviews. If passed, the bill will attempt to bar patent challengers from seeking both a Patent Trial and Appeal Board review and a district court hearing, limit board reviews to one claim per patent, and ensure a challenger has a business or financial reason to attack a patent.</p><p> \"The bill requires the PTAB to use the same standards that a district court applies when evaluating if a patent claims something truly new and nonobvious, standards that are fairer because they account for the fact that inventors have already had to prove to a patent examiner that they deserve a patent,\" Mr. Coons said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-16815BF8A21CFC88</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXH-N711-JBCN-43XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1318\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>10 November 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>PATENT &amp;

108.</p><p>(2)\u00a0 Source: Refinitiv.</p><p>.</p><p>CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT</p><p>The Company</p><p>The Company's investment objective is to provide shareholders with a choice of investment strategies and policies, each intended to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p>The Company's share capital comprises four share classes: UK Equity Shares, Global Equity Income Shares, Balanced Risk Allocation Shares and Managed Liquidity Shares, each of which has its own separate portfolio of assets and attributable liabilities.</p><p>The investment objectives and policies of all of the Portfolios are set out on pages 29 to 32.</p><p>The Company enables shareholders to adjust their asset allocation to reflect their views of prevailing market conditions. As set out on the inside of the front cover, shareholders have the opportunity to convert between share classes, free of capital gains tax, every three months.</p><p>Performance</p><p>The NAV total return of the UK Equity Share Portfolio over the year was -4.9%, which compares with the total return of -3.2% from the FTSE All-Share Index. The share price total return was -3.1%.</p><p>The NAV total return of the Global Equity Income Share Portfolio over the year was -1.3%, which compares with the total return from the MSCI World Index (\u00a3) of +5.3%. The share price total return was -0.1%.</p><p>The NAV total return of the Balanced Risk Allocation Share Portfolio was -2.7%, which compares with its benchmark of 3 months LIBOR plus 5% which returned +5.8%. The share price total return was -0.7%.</p><p>The NAV total return of the Managed Liquidity shares was +1.3%. The share price total return was -0.5%.</p><p>It is disappointing, both for the Board and for shareholders, to report on a year in which all three portfolios based on risk assets failed to meet or exceed their benchmarks. It is some small consolation that the second half of the financial year saw a significant improvement. The total return of the UK Equity Share Portfolio was +7.1% for the six months to the end of May compared with a return of +4.5% for the FTSE All-Share Index. Similarly the Balanced Risk Allocation Share Portfolio recovered its poise and rose by 4.7% compared with a rise in 3 months LIBOR plus 5% of 3.0%. The margin of underperformance by the Global Equity Income Share Portfolio was much smaller than in the first half of the year with a rise of 1.6% compared with a rise of 2.7% in the MSCI World Index (\u00a3). The Board has engaged in active discussion with the portfolio management team to understand the sources of this underperformance.</p><p>The UK Portfolio benefited from the listing of AJ Bell, our only unquoted investment. The company has been extremely successful during our ownership of the shares and was very well received on its public debut. The holding dates from 2007 and was the only exception to a policy of not investing in unquoted companies that has been in place from the Company's launch. With the listing of AJ Bell we have taken the decision to include this restriction in the annual report investment policy disclosure. Otherwise the Portfolio benefited from better recognition of the significant inherent value within the unloved UK market, especially when it became apparent through strong corporate progress. The Board has recognised that the UK Equity Share Portfolio manager's stance is based on clear value and remains supportive. The Global Equity Income Share Portfolio's improvement stemmed from the better relative performance of the laggard UK and Continental European markets and also the unfashionable oil sector as the large US technology stocks lost some of their bounce.</p><p>On the other two share classes, the Balanced Risk Allocation Share Portfolio seems to be recovering from a setback, the causes of which are well articulated by the portfolio manager, in October and November; and holders of Managed Liquidity Shares will recall from my statement in the half year report that the principal investment has been changed to PIMCO Sterling Short Maturity Source UCITS ETF, from the Invesco Money Fund (UK), following a regulatory change. \u00a0</p><p>Economic development over the period was quite stable though there does appear to be a gentle trend towards slower growth worldwide. This caused some sharp reversals in financial markets as they swung from the expectation of several rises in the US Federal Reserve (Fed) Funds rate to the belief that the next change is more likely to be downwards.</p><p>The political scene was much more dramatic, especially in the UK and the US. The Brexit saga seems to come in several acts, each painfully like the previous one. It remains to be seen whether the new Prime Minister will adopt a different and more implementable policy both towards the European Union and the House of Commons. The US government, or at least the President, seems unconcerned by major policy swings, especially in trade, and, regarding the Middle East, seems only to be committed to Israel (or at least a Likud-led government there) and Saudi Arabia as allies. It also appears to have decided that China is a long-term adversary and not a collaborator.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>After a financial year of low returns and reasonable profit growth, markets have become rather cheaper. Economic growth is still continuing, though at a slightly slower pace, and profits are still rising. Given the prevalence of very low nominal and real interest rates, markets should offer reasonable, though probably not very exciting returns, especially because there is very little euphoria around. However, it seems likely that growth will be slower and may indeed tip over into recession further out as US tax cuts lose their effect and China suffers from possible weakness of demand as it shifts from export and investment-led growth to domestic consumption. Europe still suffers from the problems of the Euro, exacerbated by German economic policy and the weakness of the banking system. To combat any recessionary tendency may require a shift towards government-led infrastructure and climate change based investment and therefore a different mix of fiscal and monetary policy.</p><p>The political scene is different and unpredictable. At any given moment it is possible that there is about to be either a real war in, for example, the Gulf or Venezuela, or a trade war between the US and almost any other country. Most of this comes from the extremely volatile character of the current US administration and President and it is impossible to predict whether sabre-rattling will turn into anything serious. The greatest restraint is the polling knowledge that the US public now has a deep aversion to foreign adventures and wars. More parochially, I wrote a year ago that \"a Brexit settlement will be reached [during this year].\" It hasn't, yet a year on the prediction still seems valid. What form it will take is still unclear, and even a new Prime Minister may take a little while to assess the opposing forces bearing on his government and formulate a coherent policy. Meantime 31 October isn't very far away.</p><p>If one tries to stand back from the immediate noise and look further ahead it is probable that China's relative rise will continue, even if its lack of population growth holds it back a little. It will acquire competitive technology where it doesn't have it and the existing economic interdependence makes it much harder for the US to shut it out than was the case with the Soviet Union. Climate change will be a dominant theme for decades to come, whether its effects are ultimately contained or cause major dislocation and political strife. Politicians, whether in democracies or autocracies, will have to deal with the disillusionment now felt by many of their citizens.</p><p>The Board</p><p>I am retiring as Chairman, and as a Director, at the Annual General Meeting in October. My successor will be Graham Kitchen who has great knowledge of investment and the investment company sector. We are also close to appointing a new Director, details of whom will be announced in due course. I am proud to have been a Director, and then Chairman, of an innovative investment company whose aim has always been to satisfy the needs of the groups of shareholders who originally joined this Company's predecessor in 1999 and to provide the same service to like minded individuals. I believe that despite occasional setbacks we have achieved this and that the Company is well placed to continue to do so.</p><p>Dividends</p><p>We continue to apply the dividend policy adopted four years ago, and approved, albeit with advisory votes, by shareholders last year, whereby for both UK Equity and Global Equity Income Shares, dividends are paid by way of three equal interim dividends declared in July, October and January with a 'wrap-up' fourth interim declared in April. For the year under review the first three dividends declared for both Share classes were 1.5p per share. The fourth dividends were 2.1p per share for the UK Equity Shares, bringing the total to 6.6p per share for the year, and 2.4p per share for the Global Equity Income Shares, bringing that total to 6.9p per share for the year.</p><p>For the Global Equity Income Shares the revenue earned in the year matched the dividends paid and no contribution from capital was required (2018: nil). However, for the UK Equity Shares a contribution from capital of approximately 0.9p per share was required to achieve the dividend level (2018: 0.3p) per share.</p><p>We intend to continue with this policy and investors are again being given advisory votes on it. We continue to target at least maintaining the dividend level from year to year for each of the equity Portfolios.</p><p>The first interim dividends declared in respect of the year to May 2020, which will be paid on 16 August 2019 to shareholders on the register on 26 July 2019, were 1.5p per share for UK Equity and 1.55p per share for Global Equity Income.</p><p>It continues to be the case that in order to maximise the capital return on the Balanced Risk Allocation Shares, the Directors only intend to declare dividends on the Balanced Risk Allocation Shares to the extent required, having taken into account the dividends paid on the other Share classes, to maintain the Company's status as an investment trust. No dividends have been paid on the Balanced Risk Allocation Shares.</p><p>In the prevailing low interest rate environment the Managed Liquidity Portfolio had not been producing sufficient net revenue to cover the administrative costs of distribution and Managed Liquidity shareholders had consequently not received any dividends since May 2012. I am pleased to report the situation has improved a little during this past year and the Board has declared a dividend of 0.8p per Managed Liquidity Share, payable on 16 August 2019 to shareholders on the register on 26 July 2019. It remains the Directors' intention to distribute substantially all net revenues earned by the Portfolio going forward. Given the quantum involved it is unlikely that such payments will be more frequent than annual and may indeed be less frequent.</p><p>Discount Policy</p><p>The Company adopted a discount control policy for all four Share classes in January 2013, whereby the Company offers to issue or buy back Shares of all classes with a view to maintaining the prices of the Shares at close to their respective net asset values. The policy has been successful to date and the level of share buy backs since its adoption has been relatively modest. The ongoing implementation of this policy is dependent upon the Company's authority to buy back Shares, and the Directors' authority to issue Shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis being renewed at general meetings of the Company.</p><p>Share Capital Movements</p><p>During the year to 31 May 2019, the Company bought back and placed in treasury 2,313,500 UK Equity Shares, 2,422,023 Global Equity Income Shares, 376,218 Balanced Risk Allocation Shares and 472,000 Managed Liquidity Shares. Other than as an artefact of the share conversion process no Shares were issued or sold from treasury and no treasury shares were cancelled. Since the year end a further 39,772 UK Equity Shares and 201,766 Global Equity Income Shares have been bought back into treasury. The Board intends to use the Company's buy back and issuance authorities when this will benefit existing shareholders as a whole and to operate the discount control policy mentioned above, and will ask shareholders to renew the authorities as and when appropriate.</p><p>Share Class Conversions</p><p>The Company enables shareholders to adjust their asset allocation to reflect their views of prevailing market conditions. Shareholders have the opportunity to convert their holdings of Shares into any other class of Share, without incurring any tax charge (under current legislation). The conversion dates for the forthcoming year are as follows: 1 August 2019; 1 November 2019; 3 February 2020; and 1 May 2020. Should you wish to convert Shares at any of these dates, conversion forms, which are available on the Manager's website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.invesco.co.uk/investmenttrusts\">http://www.invesco.co.uk/investmenttrusts</url>, or CREST instructions must be received at least 10 days before the relevant conversion date.</p><p>Annual General Meeting ('AGM')</p><p>The business of the AGM is summarised in the Directors' Report on pages 54 to 56. The AGM will be held at 43-45 Portman Square, London W1H 6LY at 11.30 am on 3 October 2019 and shareholders are cordially invited to attend. Refreshments will be provided. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions as each of the Directors intend to do in respect of their own shares.</p><p>Patrick Gifford<br/>Chairman<br/>30 July 2019</p><p>.</p><p>STRATEGIC REPORT</p><p>UK EQUITY SHARE PORTFOLIO</p><p>MANAGER'S REPORT</p><p>Investment Objective</p><p>The investment objective of the UK Equity Portfolio is to provide shareholders with an attractive real long-term total return by investing primarily in UK quoted equities.</p><p>Market and Economic Review</p><p>The last twelve months have been a challenging time to manage equity portfolios. The FTSE All-Share Index reached a record high a week before the period under review began. I wrote at the time that the outlook for global economic growth had improved. Expectations for interest rates had increased accordingly and, along with more positive signs from Brexit negotiations, this suggested that a recovery in the share prices of modestly valued, economically sensitive companies, especially UK Financials, could be imminent. This would have been to the benefit of the Portfolio. Sadly, a year on, this has proved to have been a false dawn with two principal issues affecting global growth and weighing on extremely volatile equity markets over the last twelve months.</p><p>The first is the US-China trade war. What began with an innocuous-looking tariff on Chinese solar panels escalated through the year with increasing levies affecting a wider range of goods before ratcheting up significantly in December with the arrest in Canada of the Huawei CFO. From the start of the period under review in June 2018, confidence was dented and equity markets began to decline.</p><p>The second and arguably bigger impact was US interest rate policy. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) had begun to raise rates two years earlier. Against the supportive backdrop this time last year of full employment, wage growth of 3%, strong consumer confidence and GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 of over 4%, they saw the opportunity to continue the progress towards more normal monetary policy. However just as the boost from tax cuts faded, the trade dispute worsened and growth weakened. After three rate rises through the balance of the year and with bond markets increasingly nervous of the economic outlook, the Fed's assertion in December that policy was on \"autopilot\" caused a loss of confidence and bond markets moved to price in cuts to interest rates.</p><p>A sharp fall in the price of Brent crude oil from $85 in October to $50 in December added to the narrative that global growth was slowing, and by the half-year stage in November, the FTSE All-Share Index had fallen by almost 8%. In December, the worst final month of the year for the S&amp;P since 1931, the FTSE All-Share Index declined a further 4%.</p><p>The new year saw greater optimism surrounding US-China trade talks as well as signals from the Fed that monetary policy may not be on \"autopilot\" after all. Between October and May the bond market moved from pricing in three increases for 2019 to three cuts and global equity markets duly rallied. By the end of March the FTSE All-Share Index had recovered two thirds of the losses from the fourth quarter of 2018 and by the end of April was 14% above the December low. Brent crude oil had climbed back to US$75 per barrel.</p><p>Despite the optimism creeping into headline index levels, political uncertainty persisted at home. The Bank of England cut its official 2019 UK growth estimate from +1.7% to just +1.2% as the question of the UK's departure from the European Union continued to dominate the agenda. As the 29 March deadline for Britain's exit drew closer, Parliament prepared to take control of the process. The Prime Minister's stance softened and the chances of leaving without a deal were seen to recede. Sterling strengthened against international currencies over the first quarter, peaking at US$1.33 and (EURO)1.17 in March as an extension to Article 50 was secured, avoiding a no-deal exit.</p><p>The UK economy proved remarkably resilient throughout this period, as did trends in employment and disposable income. However, as the 29 March deadline was missed and the new 31 October deadline was set, some uncertainty crept in and impacted consumer confidence and retail sales, the latter not helped by an extremely tough comparative period in 2018, which was boosted by both weather and the Royal wedding. UK GDP and manufacturing output data for the month of April were very weak at -0.4% and -3.9% respectively, hinting at an artificial boost in the prior quarter as inventories were built into March to ensure continuity of supply.</p><p>In late May the Prime Minister announced her intention to resign as leader of the Conservatives. With most of the candidates to replace her from the Eurosceptic wing of the party and a number of them stating that they intended to take the UK out on 31 October with or without a deal, sterling showed renewed weakness and at the end of May had fallen to US$1.255.</p><p>Whilst the index was volatile during the period there were even more extreme relative sector and style moves as the market once again defaulted to old favourites, leaving reliable sources of growth such as Consumer Staples and Industrial Engineering companies trading at elevated levels.</p><p>Portfolio Performance</p><p>AJ Bell provided the standout contribution to returns over the period. The investment platform is a longstanding holding and completed an initial public offering in December 2018. The shares traded very strongly, ending the period up 150% on the IPO price, as strong institutional demand increased further following a positive trading update at the end of April.</p><p>In retail, the holdings in JD Sports Fashion and Next defied the crisis facing many high-street retailers to provide strong contributions to performance over the year. In March 2019, Next released full-year results that were in line with consensus expectations. The 15% rise in online sales offset declines in-store, demonstrating the resilience of the company's multi-channel offering as industry sales move increasingly online. Meanwhile, JD Sports Fashion completed the acquisitions of US sportswear retailer The Finish Line Inc., and smaller UK rival Footasylum.</p><p>The Portfolio has only very selective exposure to the mining sector and the sole industrial metal name, Bushveld Minerals, proved a notable contributor. Shares in the AIM-listed vanadium producer rose steadily through to November 2018. The shares were buoyed by rising vanadium prices and by news that the company had struck a deal to consolidate its ownership of Strategic Minerals Corporation, the holding company of Vametco, Bushveld's South African vanadium asset. More recent performance has been subdued, but the miner remained among the biggest contributors to performance over the year.</p><p>Media business Future was another strong performer. The company has executed to plan over the past year, trading well and making a number of strategic acquisitions. This mix of organic and acquisition-led growth resulted in meaningful upgrades to analyst forecasts which in turn drove a rerating, a powerful combination that saw the shares almost treble. Johnson Service performed particularly strongly in 2019 as the market began to recognise the quality and defensive nature of the earnings, supported by the release of its full year results for 2018.</p><p>Conversely, the Portfolio's holding in Babcock International proved very disappointing for performance over the year. The company's share price had started the period well, rallying almost 50% from the February 2018 low, as management appeared to convince the market that concerns around margins and the outlook for revenues were unfounded. However, the company then reduced its full year revenue growth guidance in July and the share price once again came under pressure. This negativity persisted for the rest of the review period compounded by an anonymous piece of research that questioned the sustainability of margins. Despite subsequent downgrades the recent capital markets day provided reassurance that the current levels of profitability and returns are sustainable. In light of the extreme reached in the valuation the position has been substantially increased.</p><p>easyJet was also among the largest detractors to performance. The share price was weak for much of the year, beset by disappointing demand during an unusually hot summer across Northern Europe and also by Brexit. In May 2019, the company released half-year results that were in line with guidance and reiterated full-year forecasts.</p><p>The share price of floorings manufacturer Victoria fell very sharply at the end of October 2018, following the release of an unexpected trading update. The company had sought to simplify and extend its debt finance arrangements, and in so doing was obliged to release commentary on trading and near-term strategy. The guidance for lower margins but higher revenues was taken badly by the market and the logic of the proposed bond issue was misunderstood, leaving the shares exposed to heavy short-selling. A meeting with company management provided comfort that the fundamental investment case remained intact. I have since conducted visits to three of the company's manufacturing sites and my conviction in the stock remains. As such I have taken advantage of the significant share price weakness to increase the Portfolio's holding by almost half.</p><p>Amid extended political uncertainty, the market has continued to avoid domestically exposed cyclicals and banks have been weak globally given the declining outlook for interest rates. The Portfolio retains a large weighting in Barclays and the attempt by activist investor Sherborne Investors (Guernsey) to gain a seat on the Board of Directors created further uncertainty. The size of the position reflects my continued conviction that the stock market's valuation of Barclays is overly pessimistic, failing to reflect the company's prospects of achieving long standing targets for capital generation and therefore the potential to return additional capital to shareholders. The shares are priced for no improvement in net interest margins and for a sharp increase in impairments, which looks something like a worst case scenario. This leaves the balance of risk and reward skewed firmly in favour of holding the shares.</p><p>Elsewhere in financials a relatively new position in Plus500, a financial trading platform, proved problematic. The company guided downwards on revenues which called into question the quality and sustainability of the business and introduced significant volatility to the outlook for profits. On balance I decided to exit the position.</p><p>Portfolio Strategy and Outlook</p><p>Once again I find myself reflecting on a very difficult environment to be managing money, at least with a valuation focused philosophy and a portfolio so weighted to outright Value. There have been the odd rays of sunlight - AJ Bell, HomeServe, Future - all holdings in high growth companies that have performed very strongly and now trade on very high multiples of near term earnings. However, this performance has also served to underline the polarisation that now exists in the market between perceived winners and losers, between the Value style on one hand and the Growth and Quality styles on the other.</p><p>Unfortunately there are few signs of imminent relief. Geopolitics and the global economic picture look more uncertain by the day, most obviously as a result of the escalating US-China trade war which has seen lead indicators weaken globally and forced a reluctant Fed to back off tightening interest rates and contemplate monetary easing of one form or another.</p><p>Low growth and low interest rates therefore look set to persist and central banks appear as determined as ever to do \"whatever it takes\" to avoid a debt deflation. No sooner has unconventional monetary policy been reversed than it is once again being contemplated, such that the 'Japanification' of other developed economies is now a regularly discussed theme. The UK picture is clouded further by Theresa May's resignation and the ensuing leadership contest which leaves a parliamentary stalemate and a no deal exit from the EU a possibility once again.</p><p>Companies with predictable revenues and earnings have always attracted a premium rating and those offering less visibility have always merited a discount. However, the current climate has produced a divergence in valuations between perceived winners and losers that is extreme, levels only seen twice in the last thirty years, at the height of the tech bubble in 1999 and immediately prior to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/9. At the top end, I believe stock markets are now at the limits of the rerating that has driven share price performance in recent years. The reciprocal of these high multiples is such low earnings yields that even if growth expectations are met, investing in these companies is unlikely to deliver an attractive total return. At the bottom end, earnings yields are so high that they alone offer a compelling total return. Should these companies grow earnings in the way I believe possible or ever be considered worthy of a rerating by the market, the total return from this point will be significant. This is not what the market expects. It is an increasingly contrarian approach that has seen underperformance in recent periods. Regardless, now is not the time to compromise on my conviction that valuation does matter.</p><p>So I am not changing the shape of the Portfolio but have exited positions where conviction had fallen or where I saw some risk of missing earnings forecasts that was not adequately reflected in the valuation. In the process I have taken gearing from 11% to 3%. This both reduces risk and creates scope to take advantage of any pronounced market weakness that may emerge in the future. I have also increased the weighting to gold miners to 8%. These holdings should provide insurance against tail risks, both geo-political (Iran, US/China tensions, loss of the US dollar's reserve currency status) and economic (a credit event, widening US fiscal deficit and dollar weakness) and should in theory be inversely correlated with the market in times of stress.</p><p>I believe that a low valuation is the ultimate defensive attribute and a stretched valuation is a risk. The stock market seems instead to be interpreting a low valuation as evidence of a weak business and a high valuation to be the evidence of a company that can do no wrong. The investment objective for this Portfolio is \"to provide shareholders with an attractive, real, long-term total return\". The Portfolio today consists largely of companies that provide the prospect of that return from the current level of capital generation: if earnings do not grow and current depressed multiples simply persist, I believe that objective can still be met. If earnings grow as I anticipate or if a rerating should occur, it should be exceeded.</p><p>James Goldstone<br/>Portfolio Manager<br/>30 July 2019</p><p>.</p><p>UK EQUITY SHARE PORTFOLIO</p><p>LIST OF INVESTMENTS<br/>AT 31 MAY 2019</p><p>Ordinary shares listed in the UK unless stated otherwise</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p><p><br/></p> COMPANY</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p><p><br/></p> SECTOR</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">MARKET<p><br/></p> VALUE<p><br/></p> \u00a3'000</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p> % OF<p><br/></p> PORTFOLIO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">BP</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Oil &amp;

Economic growth disappointed almost everywhere except for the US, where the equity market continued to be supported by fiscal stimulus in the shape of tax cuts and still-favourable domestic financial conditions. Disappointingly for us, UK and European equity markets were weak in comparison, with concerns around Brexit and political uncertainty in Italy affecting European equities. Our expectation throughout the reporting period was that a sensible deal between the EU and the UK would eventually be struck on Brexit, originally by 31 March 2019 and then by the extended EU deadlines. This did not happen and it increasingly appears that our optimism may have been misplaced.</p><p>The Japanese and Asian equity markets were held back by a slowing Chinese economy and fears over a tariff war between China and the US. Despite efforts to increase domestic consumption and wean the key Asian economies off reliance on exports to generate growth, the US economy remains a key driver of that regional economy. Other emerging markets were also affected by the malaise of slowing world trade growth, with Brazil and to some extent South Africa bucking the weak trend as investors welcomed new governments with reformist agendas.</p><p>Volatility peaked in the fourth quarter of 2018 and markets were led lower by the US as concerns over economic slowdown and high stock market valuations, particularly of previously high flying e-commerce and technology companies, intensified. The December slump was amongst the worst in history, with the US equity market having its biggest December fall since the Great Depression of 1931.</p><p>Markets regained some of the lost ground in January as fears of recession and a trade war eased and continued to rally in February in view of an increased likelihood of a trade deal between the US and China. Indications from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) of a softening of stance on monetary policy normalisation, together with some modest Chinese fiscal stimulus, helped to underpin sentiment further. Overall, global equity markets ended the first quarter of 2019 in positive territory amid hopes for progress in US-China trade talks and optimism that the Fed would remain less aggressive in raising interest rates. With the US equity market being the strongest performer, global stocks saw their largest quarterly gains since 2010.</p><p>Global equity markets remained in positive territory in April, driven by strong performance from US stocks in particular. The US equity market reached fresh record highs on the back of better than forecast company earnings. Sentiment was also boosted by stronger than expected US economic growth for the first three months of 2019. However, in a reversal of fortune, global equity markets had their worst month of the year in May as escalating trade tensions once again left market participants assessing the implications for slower economic growth. China hit back at Washington with its own retaliatory tariffs. The escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies drew investors back to so-called 'safe-haven' assets. Market sentiment soured further as Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on Mexican goods.</p><p>Portfolio Strategy and Review</p><p>On a total return basis, the Portfolio's net asset value fell by 1.3% over the 12 months to the end of May 2019, compared to a rise of 5.3% in the MSCI World Index (in sterling terms, total return, net of withholding tax).</p><p>The Portfolio's disappointing performance against its reference index over the year was largely due to its underweight exposure to the US (the US equity market was by far the strongest performer of all the major regions) and its overweight exposure to the UK and Europe (relatively weak markets versus the reference index). Our underweight exposure to the US has been longstanding due in large part to the relatively high valuations we see across a range of sectors and the low level of dividends available in that region.</p><p>We acknowledge the underperformance of the portfolio in recent years and it is of deep concern to us in the portfolio management team. We constantly review and reappraise our approach in view of market conditions and ongoing news relating to stocks within the portfolio. Prolonged periods in which a valuation driven approach underperforms is not unknown - the last prolonged period was from 1998 to 2000. In addition we note that competitors with similar income objectives have also struggled to perform. We continue to believe our focus on corporate valuations and free cashflow will deliver outperformance across a full economic and stock market cycle.</p><p>At the sector level, global equity market leadership has been dominated by a narrow range of growth orientated stocks concentrated in US 'Big tech' companies and the Portfolio's lack of exposure to the so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, APPLE, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google)) detracted from returns. However, these companies appear expensive to us on many metrics and they offer zero income, hence the Portfolio's underweight exposure versus the reference index. Furthermore, we see very strong valuation upside in the financial sector, in the last few years our holdings have underperformed, with European financials particularly weak. This is the result of slower than expected monetary policy normalisation, together with renewed political instability in Italy and, in our view, excessive regulation. However, we would highlight the outstanding valuations we see in this sector and significant dividend yields. Many well capitalised banks are trading at a significant discount to book value. Whist we believe this to be an anomaly, our overexposure to the banking sector was a material drag on performance versus the benchmark in the year.</p><p>Furthermore, our industrials and semiconductor holdings such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom have come under pressure more recently as trade tensions flared between the US and China. Markets have digested the implications of new US export restrictions placed on Chinese telecom firm Huawei and many US semiconductor companies, which are heavily exposed to China, have seen their share prices fall as a result of the ongoing trade dispute. We remain confident these businesses offer attractive upside and are clear market leaders in their respective areas of the market.</p><p>The consumer staples sector generally performed well through the year as it benefitted from its status as a safe haven on the assumption that company earnings will be sheltered from the economic fallout of the trade war. However, our underweight exposure, together with negative share price performance from our holding in the tobacco sector, had a negative impact on relative returns. We have been longstanding holders of British American Tobacco and continue to like its strong cash generation and attractive dividend yield. The shares reacted badly to comments from the US Federal Drug Administration restricting sales of certain tobacco products, exacerbated by strong competition in the new 'lower risk' non-combustible products. We believe the market has overreacted and the company offers solid long term returns.</p><p>Our large energy exposure also detracted from returns and the decline in the price of oil was a significant factor. The price of oil peaked in October at around US$85 and then started its rather rapid decline in November, ending that month down over 20%. The weakness was driven by concerns over the demand risk outlook as global growth concerns increased. Furthermore, investors fretted over increases in supply as shale oil production in the US continues to grow rapidly, and OPEC seems unwilling to cut production further, which had a negative impact on a number of the energy stocks held within the Portfolio. Our bullishness on the sector, however, is not around the oil price being extremely strong, but rather on operating cost reductions and cuts to capital expenditure, which we believe is leading to extremely strong cash generation and will enable both rising dividends and some share buybacks over the coming three years.</p><p>Health care delivered positive performance for the Portfolio over the 12 months as markets became more defensively positioned, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. The share prices of Pfizer, Novartis and Roche all benefited as a result.</p><p>Portfolio Changes</p><p>Over the period new positions were established in Rolls-Royce, Carrefour, CRH, Samsung Electronics, Verizon Communications and Sanofi.</p><p>In our view Rolls-Royce is set to become a highly cash generative business and it has a good self-help story arising from increased operating efficiencies and new engine rollouts. The industry is highly regulated, with cutting-edge engineering giving them strong barriers to entry and has meant they have gained market share in respect of wide bodied jets. Increased flight hours per engine also makes the maintenance and spares business increasingly profitable.</p><p>Carrefour is a well-known food retailer in France. We believe that it has a strong balance sheet and an impressive new management team, who we feel will be able to bring about change and improve margins in what remains a strong franchise.</p><p>CRH supplies a broad range of products to the construction industry. It currently generates lower margins than its peers and is more lowly valued. However, it has a clear roadmap to improve margins and a management team we believe to be focussed on returns and capable of delivering on targets. The business has significant US exposure and thus should benefit from any pick up in US infrastructure spending.</p><p>Samsung Electronics has an improving corporate governance record which is important to us. The biggest improvement has been to its shareholder returns policy. Its stated policy is to improve dividend payout, and to pay out 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in either buybacks or dividends. It is attractively valued in our opinion, with a very robust balance sheet.</p><p>Verizon Communications, the US telecoms company, is likely to see growth in its mobile telecommunications business over the coming years, in our view. The competitive dynamics in the wireless industry are improving in the US, which sets the stage for more consistent growth and returns for Verizon in the near-to-medium term. Verizon offers a dividend yield in excess of 4%, while in our view the improving company fundamentals should be positive for shareholders over the next several years.</p><p>Finally, we initiated a new holding in Sanofi, the French multinational pharmaceutical company, because we believe it looks cheap relative to the rest of the sector. It appears that no value has been attributed to the new product pipeline and existing products are being valued at a discount to peers. The discount to the sector has in large part been due to a perceived weak management team and disappointing cost management. This we believe is now changing, with a new management team who we think can unlock the value in this business. The company has no significant patent expiry issues until 2028. We see it as a defensive stock offering predictable earnings growth at a discounted valuation.</p><p>We sold out of three positions (Union Pacific, Hiscox and China Mobile) after strong share price performance. We also exited our position in Airbus as we felt the share price had reached a level that reflected the positive outlook for the company. Lastly, we disposed of Nielsen. The company reported a surprisingly weak set of results and delivered a very negative outlook. This would not necessarily have prompted a sale of the position, but the lack of a credible strategy to improve and signs of structural shifts in one of its key businesses as well as the departure of members of senior management led us to the conclusion that the capital could be better deployed elsewhere.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>The global economic outlook is uncertain in our view. On the one hand central banks across the globe are maintaining a very pro-growth policy stance, and fiscal policy in many major economies is mildly expansionary. However, on the other, trade tensions between major trading blocks in Europe (the Brexit issue) and more importantly between the US and China, together with the ongoing secular trend of lower productivity improvements, are dragging on economic growth. Corporate earnings growth is therefore likely to be muted in the coming years. Our view is that major economies will continue to grow slowly, avoiding both recession and rising inflation, and that equity markets may grind higher over the next 12 months.</p><p>Whilst in our view not yet of bubble proportions, valuations in global equity markets are extremely bifurcated. Those stocks which seem to offer secular growth opportunities and low earnings volatility have risen sharply in price in recent years and have become increasingly expensive and offer low or no dividend yields, hence we do not own them. Meanwhile, companies with more obvious exposure to the economic cycle have, by and large, underperformed and are, in our view, trading at significant discounts to their intrinsic value. The gap in valuation terms between stocks exhibiting those differing characteristics is at record levels, whether you look at price/earnings ratios or measures related to asset values. Any reversion to mean will be of clear benefit to the Portfolio, though of course we cannot predict when this might happen.</p><p>Our investment strategy remains constant: to invest in companies at discounted valuations relative to their history and the market, with strong sustainable cash flows. We believe that growing and sustainable dividends flow from that, and in the long run that capital growth from such companies will outperform the broader market.</p><p>Nick Mustoe<br/>Portfolio Manager<br/>30 July 2019</p><p>.</p><p>GLOBAL EQUITY INCOME SHARE PORTFOLIO</p><p>LIST OF INVESTMENTS<br/>AT 31 MAY 2019</p><p>Ordinary shares unless stated otherwise.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p><p><br/></p> COMPANY</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p><p><br/></p> INDUSTRY GROUP</entry><entry colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p><p><br/></p> COUNTRY</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">MARKET<p><br/></p> VALUE<p><br/></p> \u00a3'000</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p> % OF<p><br/></p> PORTFOLIO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Chevron</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Energy</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">US</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">2,167</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">3.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Royal Dutch Shell - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A shares</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Energy</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">Netherlands</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">2,098</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">3.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Orange</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Telecommunication Services</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">France</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">2,090</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">3.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">BP</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Energy</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">UK</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">2,041</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">3.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">United Technologies</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Capital Goods</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">US</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">1,848</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">2.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Pfizer</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology &amp;

Poor's Global Industry Classification Standard.</p><p>.</p><p>BALANCED RISK ALLOCATION SHARE PORTFOLIO</p><p>MANAGER'S REPORT</p><p>Investment Objective</p><p>The investment objective of the Balanced Risk Allocation Share Portfolio is to provide shareholders with an attractive total return in differing economic and inflationary environments, and with low correlation to equity and bond market indices by gaining exposure to three asset classes: debt securities, equities, and commodities.</p><p>Market and Economic Review</p><p>Equities started the financial year in positive territory, but then weakened over the second half of 2018, becoming particularly volatile over the fourth quarter as investors fretted over the effects of trade tensions and central bank actions. Equities staged an impressive rally in the first quarter of 2019, but still posted negative performance, in US dollar terms, for the Company's financial year, with volatility returning in May. Bonds posted strong performance over the financial year, with yields falling across all markets in which the strategy invests as central banks turned dovish amid signs of weakening economic measures and below-target inflation. Commodities started the financial year in positive territory, but ended with negative returns as a strong US dollar and concerns over international trade caused most raw materials markets to decline.</p><p>Portfolio Performance</p><p>The Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio posted a positive return for the year of -2.7%, compared with +5.8% for the benchmark, Merrill Lynch 3 month LIBOR plus 5%.</p><p>For the year to 31 May 2019 strategic exposure to bonds was the principal positive contributor to performance. Strategic exposure to both equities and commodities detracted from performance for the fiscal year.</p><p>Portfolio Strategy and Update</p><p>The Balanced Risk strategy seeks to achieve returns through balancing risk exposure between three asset classes: developed market equities, global government bonds and commodities. The asset class weightings are determined using a proprietary investment process, with assets being selected according to three key criteria: a correlation matrix to ensure diversification; the ability to generate excess returns relative to cash; and specific liquidity and transparency criteria. Exposure to the asset classes is principally obtained through highly liquid and transparently priced exchange-traded futures contracts, with cash and cash equivalents being held as collateral.</p><p>Bond markets started the fiscal year positively, but prices retreated in the third quarter of 2018 as yields increased across the markets in which the strategy invests. Prices rebounded in the fourth quarter, as the return of volatility in equities and commodities engendered safe-haven flight, and the positive performance continued through the first quarter of 2019. The primary driver of returns across the asset class was the dovish tone emanating from the central banks in each of the markets in which the strategy is involved. The shift removed fears of additional tightening, which was further supported by revisions to growth and inflation forecasts, especially in Europe. A general weakening of economic data, particularly in global manufacturing, may be underpinning some of the flight-to-safety response as bonds held their gains despite the very strong rally in risk assets. Bond performance was led by Australia, followed by Canada. Australian yields fell as they played into the weakness of Chinese economic growth, to which they are geared.</p><p>Strategic exposure to equities detracted from performance as volatility entered the market. Equities started the fiscal year with positive performance, but fell markedly in both October and December in response to uncertainty regarding trade tensions between the US and China as well as concerns over central bank actions. Many markets entered bear market territory from peaks set earlier in the year. Equities staged an impressive rally in the first quarter of 2019 as central banks indicated they would hold off on future rate hikes. Japanese equities were the top detractor, followed by Hong Kong. Japanese equities were hurt by trade tensions as Japan's trade balance shifted to a deficit. Hong Kong equities detracted as they tend to trade in line with China and manufacturing data from China indicated that activity had begun to contract, with signs of political unrest also beginning to appear.</p><p>Strategic exposure to commodities also detracted, led by agriculture. Agricultural commodities started the fiscal year in negative territory as prices suffered on fears of escalating trade war impacts and improvement in growing conditions. Agriculture prices continued to struggle throughout the fiscal year on conditions of oversupply. Energy also detracted from performance. Evidence of slowing manufacturing and economic activity resulting from the trade spat between the US and China and the effects of central bank actions, tempered demand expectations. This bearish demand sentiment along with concerns about robust production led to the sharp drops in energy prices. Within industrial metals, aluminium prices fell on continued strong exports and production from China while copper also declined. Within precious metals, silver declined to a greater extent than gold as it tends to trade in sympathy with industrial metals. Gold fell on the stronger US dollar.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>The ongoing trade tensions ratcheted higher in May as the US-China talks broke down and the Trump administration threatened Mexico with a new schedule of tariffs. Additionally, it seems that other countries are in the administration's crosshairs. While seeming unpredictable in business or personal negotiations may be a viable tactic, unpredictability around national policy and the great potential for disrupting trust between nations and carefully structured business plans is most unwelcome. The surprise decision on Mexican tariffs - that seems to have been made unilaterally by the president without the support of or even foreknowledge by his party - could present several issues. First, Congress potentially could fail to support the measure against Mexico and wrest the tariff-levying power from the president. This would weaken Trump's stance in the eyes of his adversaries. Secondly, China may dig in its heels, recognising the US administration's inner-party turmoil and seeing that the president has opened a multi-front war on himself. The other major issue is a lack of confidence from US businesses. Companies have spent many years crafting intricate supply chains and manufacturing capabilities across borders that may now be upended through these tariff actions. A lack of trust in the stability of policy along with evidence of weakening economic activity across the globe may have a stifling impact on companies' willingness to engage in capital expenditures until meaningful clarity returns. Given the level of uncertainty at present, we believe a focus on economic diversification is a reasonable approach.</p><p>Scott Wolle<br/>Portfolio Manager<br/>30 July 2019</p><p>.</p><p>BALANCED RISK

Economic data around that time appeared to indicate that the dip in output earlier in the year had been temporary with momentum recovering in the second quarter. At the same time, the unemployment rate had continued to fall, and average earnings had risen to the highest levels since the financial crisis, signalling some tightness in the labour market. Therefore, with inflation expected to remain slightly above target over the forecast horizon, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) deemed it necessary to tighten policy.</p><p>However, overall, the MPC have remained cautious about the economic outlook, recognising the potential significant impact around Brexit and have continued to state that any further increases to the base rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked rates twice. However, having previously forecast further hikes during 2019, the Fed have recognised the outlook for growth and inflation, partly due to concerns over potential trade wars, meant that a pause in the tightening cycle was the most appropriate course of action, with potentially some easing later in the year. This change of tone has driven core Government bond yields lower across the globe in recent months.</p><p>Portfolio Performance</p><p>The Managed Liquidity Portfolio NAV total return for the year ended 31 May 2019 was +1.3%.</p><p>Portfolio Strategy and Review</p><p>As explained in the half year report, from 18 January 2019 the investment strategy followed for this Portfolio has been to invest principally in the PIMCO Sterling Short Maturity Source UCITS ETF, which is managed by PIMCO with Invesco acting as co-promoter, and also in the Sterling Liquidity Portfolio of Short-Term Investments Company (Global Series) plc, which is a money market fund managed by Invesco. Prior to that date the principal investment had been the Invesco Money Fund (UK). The catalyst for this change was regulatory and the Board decided that it would be in investors' best interests to switch the principal investment to an alternative with characteristics in line with the original intent of the Portfolio.</p><p>The PIMCO Sterling Short Maturity Source UCITS ETF seeks to maximise current income consistent with the preservation of capital and a high degree of liquidity. The fund is actively managed by PIMCO and invests in a diversified portfolio of government, corporate and asset-backed bonds, denominated in, or hedged back to, sterling. To limit the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk (the likelihood of an issuer defaulting), these bonds are both short dated and of high quality. The portfolio manager at PIMCO is Andrew Bosomworth.</p><p>The Sterling Liquidity Portfolio of the Short-Term Investments Company (Global Series) plc is managed by Invesco in a laddered maturity structure, investing in repurchase agreements, time deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, medium-term notes and floating rate notes rated A-1/P-1 or better. At 31 May 2019 the Sterling Liquidity Portfolio was rated AAAm by Standard and Poor's and AAAmmf by Fitch Ratings.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>The PIMCO Sterling Short Maturity Source UCITS ETF is actively managed by PIMCO and has the flexibility to navigate changes in the macroeconomic outlook. PIMCO's baseline outlook includes a\u00a0shallow recession in the next three to five years, which means that inflation is likely to remain low and central banks are likely to maintain base rates below historic averages. However, this relatively benign baseline is only one of several realistic scenarios and the probability distribution of economic outcomes is wider and less certain than usual.</p><p>Invesco<br/>30 July 2019</p><p>.</p><p>MANAGED LIQUIDITY SHARE PORTFOLIO</p><p>LIST OF INVESTMENTS<br/>AS AT 31 May</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry align=\"center\" colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">2018</entry><entry align=\"center\" colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">2017</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">MARKET<p><br/></p> VALUE<p><br/></p> \u00a3'000</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p> % OF<p><br/></p> PORTFOLIO</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">MARKET<p><br/></p> VALUE<p><br/></p> \u00a3'000</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p> % OF<p><br/></p> PORTFOLIO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Invesco Money Fund (UK)*</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">-</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">-</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">\u00a04,905</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">99.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">PIMCO Sterling Short Maturity Source UCITS ETF</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">\u00a04,490</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">95.3</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">-</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Short-Term Investments Company (Global Series) plc</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">\u00a0220</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">4.7</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">\u00a048</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">1.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">\u00a04,710</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">100.0</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">\u00a04,953</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col5\" valign=\"top\">100.0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>* During the year, the Managed Liquidity Share Portfolio switched its investment in the Invesco Money Fund (UK) to the PIMCO Sterling Short Maturity Source UCITS ETF, with effect from 18 January 2019, following an announcement made on that date.</p><p>BUSINESS REVIEW</p><p>Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc is a UK investment company with four Share classes, each of which has separate investment objectives, as set out below, and is represented by a separate Portfolio. The strategy the Board follows to achieve its overall objective and those of each Share class is to set investment policy and risk guidelines, together with investment limits, and to monitor how they are applied. These are also set out below.</p><p>The business model the Company has adopted to achieve its objective has been to contract the services of Invesco Fund Managers Limited ('IFML' or the 'Manager') to manage the Portfolios in accordance with the Board's strategy and under its oversight. The Manager is also responsible for providing company secretarial, marketing, accounting and general administration services. In practice, many of these services are performed under delegated authority by Invesco Asset Management Limited (IAML), a company related to IFML. References to the Manager in this annual financial report should consequently be considered to include both entities.</p><p>All administrative support is provided by third parties under the oversight of the Board. In addition to the management and administrative functions of the Manager, the Company has contractual arrangements with Link Asset Services to act as registrar and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Limited (BNYMIL) as depositary and custodian.</p><p>Investment Policy</p><p>The Company's and respective Share classes' investment objectives, investment policies and risk and investment limits combine to form the 'Investment Policy' of the Company.</p><p>The Company</p><p>Investment Objective and Policy</p><p>The Company's investment objective is to provide shareholders with a choice of investment strategies and policies, each intended to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p>The Company's share capital comprises four Share classes: UK Equity Shares, Global Equity Income Shares, Balanced Risk Allocation Shares and Managed Liquidity Shares, each of which has its own separate portfolio of assets and attributable liabilities. The investment objectives, policies and risks and limits of the Portfolios for these Share classes follow. With the exception of borrowings, the limits for the Company and the four Share classes are measured at the point of acquisition of investments, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Investment Limits of the Company</p><p>The Board has prescribed limits on the Investment Policy of the Company, which include the following:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 15% of the gross assets of the Company may be invested in a single investment; and</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 10% of the gross assets of the Company may be invested in other listed investment companies (excluding property companies structured as REITs).</p><p>UK Equity Share Portfolio</p><p>Investment Objective</p><p>The investment objective of the UK Equity Portfolio is to provide shareholders with an attractive real long-term total return by investing primarily in UK quoted equities.</p><p>Investment Policy and Risk</p><p>The UK Equity Portfolio is invested primarily in UK equities and equity-related securities of UK companies across all market sectors. The Portfolio will not invest in companies which are not listed, quoted or traded at the time of investment, although it may have exposure to such companies where, following investment, the relevant securities cease to be listed, quoted or traded.</p><p>The Manager invests the UK Equity Portfolio so as to maximise exposure to the most attractive sectors and securities, within a portfolio structure that reflects the Manager's view of the macroeconomic environment. The Manager does not set out to manage the risk characteristics of the UK Equity Portfolio relative to the FTSE All-Share Index (the 'benchmark index') and the investment process may result in potentially very significant over or underweight positions in individual sectors versus the benchmark. The size of weightings will reflect the Manager's view of the attractiveness of a security and the degree of conviction held. If a security is not considered to be a good investment, it will not be held in the UK Equity Portfolio, irrespective of its weight in the benchmark index.</p><p>The Manager controls the stock-specific risk of individual securities by ensuring that the UK Equity Portfolio is always diversified across market sectors. In-depth and continual analysis of the fundamentals of investee companies allows the Manager to assess the financial risks associated with any particular security.</p><p>It is expected that, typically, the Portfolio will hold between 45 and 80 securities.</p><p>The Directors believe that the use of borrowings can enhance returns to shareholders and the UK Equity Portfolio will generally use borrowings in pursuing its investment objective.</p><p>Investment Limits</p><p>The Board has prescribed limits on the investment policy of the UK Equity Portfolio, which include the following:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 12% of the gross assets of the UK Equity Portfolio may be held in a single investment;</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 10% of the gross assets of the UK Equity Portfolio may be held in other listed investment companies (excluding REITs);</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 20% of the gross assets of the UK Equity Portfolio may be held in overseas assets; and</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 borrowings may be used to raise equity exposure up to a maximum of 25% of the net assets of the UK Equity Portfolio when it is considered appropriate.</p><p>Global Equity Income Share Portfolio</p><p>Investment Objective</p><p>The investment objective of the Global Equity Income Portfolio is to provide an attractive and growing level of income return and capital appreciation over the long term, predominantly through investment in a diversified portfolio of equities worldwide.</p><p>Investment Policy and Risk</p><p>The Portfolio will be invested predominantly in a portfolio of listed, quoted or traded equities worldwide, but may also hold other securities from time to time including, inter alia, fixed interest securities, preference shares, convertible securities and depositary receipts. Investment may also be made in regulated or authorised collective investment schemes. The Portfolio will not invest in companies which are not listed, quoted or traded at the time of investment, although it may have exposure to such companies where, following investment, the relevant securities cease to be listed, quoted or traded. The Manager will at all times invest and manage the Portfolio's assets in a manner that is consistent with spreading investment risk, but there will be no rigid industry, sector, region or country restrictions.</p><p>The Portfolio may utilise derivative instruments including index-linked notes, contracts for differences, covered options and other equity-related derivative instruments for efficient portfolio management and investment purposes. Any use of derivatives for investment purposes will be made on the basis of the same principles of risk spreading and diversification that apply to the Portfolio's direct investments, as described above.</p><p>It is expected that, typically, the Portfolio will hold between 45 and 80 securities.</p><p>The Directors believe that the use of borrowings can enhance returns to shareholders, and the Global Equity Income Portfolio may use borrowings in pursuing its investment objective.</p><p>The Company's foreign currency investments will not be hedged to sterling as a matter of general policy. However, the Manager may employ currency hedging, either back to sterling or between currencies (i.e. cross hedging of portfolio investments).</p><p>Investment Limits</p><p>The Board has prescribed the following limits on the investment policy of the Global Equity Income Portfolio:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 20% of the gross assets of the Global Equity Income Portfolio may be invested in fixed interest securities;</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 10% of the gross assets of the Global Equity Income Portfolio may be held in a single investment;</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 10% of the gross assets of the Global Equity Income Portfolio may be held in other listed investment companies (excluding REITs); and</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 borrowings may be used to raise equity exposure up to a maximum of 20% of the net assets of the Global Equity Income Portfolio, when it is considered appropriate.</p><p>Balanced Risk Allocation Share Portfolio</p><p>Investment Objective</p><p>The investment objective of the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio is to provide shareholders with an attractive total return in differing economic and inflationary environments, and with low correlation to equity and bond market indices by gaining exposure to three asset classes: debt securities, equities and commodities.</p><p>Investment Policy and Risk</p><p>The Portfolio utilises two main strategies: the first seeks to balance the risk contribution from each of three asset classes (equities, bonds and commodities), with the aim of reducing the probability, magnitude and duration of capital losses, and the second seeks to shift tactically the allocation among the assets with the aim of improving expected returns.</p><p>The Portfolio is constructed so as to achieve appropriate diversity and to balance risk by asset class (bonds, equities and commodities) and by asset within each asset class. Neutral risk weighting is achieved when each asset class contributes an equal proportion of the total Portfolio risk and each asset contributes an equal proportion of the total risk for its respective asset class. The Manager is permitted to actively vary asset class weightings, subject to a maximum of 150% and a minimum of 50% of each asset class's neutral weight. The Manager is also permitted to actively vary individual asset weightings, provided the asset class guidelines are not violated. Asset weights may not be less than zero (short) and will not exceed twice the neutral weight. For the purposes of the maximum weighting only, commodity exposures are aggregated and measured by commodity complex rather than by individual assets.</p><p>The Portfolio will be mainly invested directly in highly liquid and transparently priced exchange-traded futures contracts, with cash and cash equivalents being held as collateral. However, the Portfolio may also be invested in equities, equity-related securities and debt securities (including floating rate notes). Financial derivative instruments (including but not limited to futures and total return swaps) are used only to achieve long exposure to the three asset classes. The Portfolio may also use financial derivative instruments, including currency futures and forwards, for efficient portfolio management, hedging and investment purposes. Financial derivative instruments will not be used to create net short positions in any asset class. The derivatives portfolio will typically comprise between 20 and 33 investment positions.</p><p>It is expected that the Portfolio's investments will mainly be denominated in sterling. Any non-sterling derivative investments may be hedged back into sterling at the discretion of the Manager when it is economic to do so.</p><p>Investment Limit</p><p>The Board has prescribed the following limits on the investment policy of the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the aggregate notional amount of financial derivative instruments positions may not exceed 250% of the net assets of the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio; and</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 10% of the gross assets of the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio may be held in other listed investment companies.</p><p>Managed Liquidity Share Portfolio</p><p>Investment Objective</p><p>The investment objective of the Managed Liquidity Portfolio is to produce an appropriate level of income return combined with a high degree of security.</p><p>Investment Policy and Risk</p><p>The Managed Liquidity Portfolio invests mainly in a range of sterling-based or related high quality debt securities and similar assets (which may include transferable securities, money market instruments, warrants, collective investment schemes and deposits), either directly or indirectly through authorised funds investing in such instruments, including funds managed by Invesco.</p><p>The Managed Liquidity Portfolio generally invests in funds authorised as UCITS schemes (Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, being open ended retail investment funds in the EU), which are required under governing regulations to provide a prudent spread of risk. In the event that the Managed Liquidity Portfolio is invested directly in securities and instruments, the Manager will observe investment restrictions and risk diversification policies that are consistent with UCITS regulations.</p><p>Investment Limits</p><p>The Board has prescribed limits on the investment policy of the Managed Liquidity Portfolio, which include the following:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 10% of the gross assets of the Managed Liquidity Portfolio may be held in a single investment, other than authorised funds or high quality sovereign debt securities; and</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no more than 5% of the gross assets of the Managed Liquidity Portfolio may be held in unquoted investments, other than authorised funds.</p><p>Investors should note that the Managed Liquidity Shares are not designed to replicate the returns or other characteristics of a bank or building society deposit or money market fund. In particular, the Portfolio will typically contain some assets with a greater residual maturity, and as a whole will have greater weighted average maturity, than is prescribed by regulation governing money market funds.</p><p>Key Performance Indicators</p><p>The Board reviews the performance of the Company by reference to a number of Key Performance Indicators, at either a Company or Portfolio level, which include the following:</p><p>\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0 Investment Performance</p><p>\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0 Revenue and Dividends</p><p>\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0 Discount/Premium</p><p>\u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0 Ongoing Charges</p><p>Investment Performance</p><p>To assess investment performance the Board monitors the net asset value (NAV) performance of the individual Share classes relative to that of benchmark indices it considers to be appropriate. However, given the requirements and constraints of the investment objectives and policies followed, no index can be expected to fully represent the performance that might reasonably be expected from any one or all of the Company's Share classes.</p><p>The NAV total return performance of each of the Portfolios over the year to 31 May 2019 and of relevant benchmark indices were as follows:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"544\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">UK Equity Portfolio</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">-4.9%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">FTSE All-Share Index</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">-3.2%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Global Equity Income Portfolio</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">-1.3%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">MSCI World Index (\u00a3)</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">5.3%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">-2.7%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">3 month LIBOR plus 5%</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">5.8%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Managed Liquidity Portfolio</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">1.3%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Refinitiv.</p><p>Other performance periods, together with share price total returns, are shown on page 2.</p><p>Revenue and Dividends</p><p>The Directors review revenue estimates and prospective dividend levels at each Board meeting. For the equity share classes the Directors have become more focused on total return since sanctioning contributions to dividends from capital, but dividends paid continue to be mostly constituted from revenue and revenue is an important element of overall Portfolio returns.</p><p>UK Equity Shares</p><p>Revenue earnings per Share for the UK Equity Share Portfolio was 5.73p (2018: 5.49p), based on net revenue for the year of \u00a31,982,000 (2018: \u00a32,038,000), which included receipts of \u00a396,000 (2018: \u00a3110,000) of non-recurring special dividends, equivalent to 0.28p (2018: 0.30p).</p><p>Dividend Policy:</p><p>The Directors have set a target of at least maintaining, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the level of annual UK Equity dividends per share from year to year. Further, they have implemented a model of declaring (with payment in the month following) three equal interim dividends in July, October and January with a 'wrap-up' fourth interim in April. Depending on the level of income received in each quarter, and in the year, these four dividends may be enhanced with contributions from capital profits to achieve the target.</p><p>Dividends Declared:</p><p>The Directors have declared and paid four interim dividends for the year ended 31 May 2019 totalling 6.60p per UK Equity Share (2018: 6.45p) of which 5.73p was met from revenue earned in the year. The aggregate of dividends paid in respect of the year was \u00a32,279,000 (2018: \u00a32,397,000) - the decrease reflects the reduction of shares in issue following conversions and buybacks in the year.</p><p>A first interim dividend for the year to 31 May 2020 of 1.5p was declared on 17 July 2019, setting the level for the next two dividends, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Global Equity Income Shares</p><p>Revenue earnings per Share for the Global Equity Income Share Portfolio was 6.90p (2018: 6.50p), based on net revenue for the year of \u00a32,234,000 (2018: \u00a32,149,000), which included \u00a338,000 (2018: \u00a3128,000) of special dividends.</p><p>Dividend Policy:</p><p>The Directors have set a target of at least maintaining, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the level of annual Global Equity Income dividends per share from year to year. Further, they have implemented a model of declaring (with payment in the month following) three equal interim dividends in July, October and January with a 'wrap-up' fourth interim in April. Depending on the level of income received in each quarter, and in the year, these four dividends may be enhanced with contributions from capital profits to achieve the target.</p><p>Dividends Declared:</p><p>The Directors have declared and paid four interim dividends for the year ended 31 May 2019 totalling 6.90p (2018: 6.70p) per Global Equity Income Share, all of which was met from revenue earned in the year. The aggregate of dividends paid in respect of the year was \u00a32,232,000 (2018: \u00a32,211,000).</p><p>A first interim dividend for the year to 31 May 2020 of 1.55p was declared on 17 July 2019, setting the level for the next two dividends, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Balanced Risk Allocation Shares</p><p>In order to maximise the capital return on the Balanced Risk Allocation Shares, the Directors only intend to declare dividends on the Balanced Risk Allocation Shares to the extent required, having taken into account the dividends paid on the other Share classes, to maintain the Company's status as an investment trust under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.</p><p>No dividends are required to be declared or paid for the year to retain investment trust status.</p><p>Managed Liquidity Shares</p><p>The Board intends to declare dividends on the Managed Liquidity Portfolio when the level of income available allows. The Managed Liquidity Portfolio recorded a net revenue profit for the year of \u00a327,000 (2018: \u00a312,000). An interim dividend of 0.8p per Managed Liquidity Share was declared on 17 July 2019 in respect of the year ended 31 May 2019 (2018: nil). It currently appears unlikely, given the quantum of revenue being earned, that future dividends will be more frequent than annual and they could be less frequent.</p><p>Discount/(Premium)</p><p>The Company has a discount control policy in place for all four Share classes, whereby the Company offers to issue or buy back Shares of all classes with a view to maintaining the market price of the shares at close to their respective net asset values and, by so doing, avoid significant overhangs or shortages in the market. It is the Board's policy to buy back shares and to sell shares from treasury on terms that do not dilute the net asset value attributable to existing shareholders at the time of the transaction.</p><p>The operation of this policy is dependent upon the authorities to buy back and issue shares being renewed by shareholders. Notwithstanding the intended effect of this policy, there can be no guarantee that the Company's shares will trade at close to their respective net asset values.

The Board also has a longer-term objective to increase the size of the Company in the belief that increasing the assets of the Company in this way will make the Company's Shares more attractive to investors and improve the liquidity of the Shares.</p><p>Details of trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance and position of the Company's business can be found in the portfolio managers' reports and further details as to the risks affecting the Company are set out under 'Principal Risks and Uncertainties' below.</p><p>Principal Risks and Uncertainties</p><p>The Audit Committee regularly undertakes a robust assessment of the risks the Company faces, on behalf of the Board (see Audit Committee Report on pages 44 to 46).</p><p>The following are considered to be the most significant risks to the Company and to shareholders in relation to their investments in the Company. Further details of risks and risk management policies as they relate to the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are detailed in note 17 to the financial statements.</p><p>Investment Objectives and Attractiveness to Investors</p><p>There is no guarantee that the Investment Policy of the Company and of each Portfolio will provide the returns sought by the Company. There can be no guarantee, therefore, that the Company will achieve its investment objectives or that the Shares will continue to meet investors' needs.</p><p>The Board monitors the Share registers and the performance of the Company and each Portfolio. It has established a structure offering a range of options for investors and has set guidelines to ensure that the Investment Policy of the Company and each Portfolio is pursued by the Manager.</p><p>Market Movements and Portfolio Performance</p><p>Individual Portfolio performance is substantially dependent on the performance of the securities (including derivative instruments) held within the Portfolio. The prices of these securities are influenced by many factors including the general health of regional and worldwide economies; interest rates; inflation; government policies; industry conditions; political and diplomatic events; tax laws; environmental laws; and by the demand from investors. The Manager strives to maximise the total return from Portfolios, but the investments held are influenced by market conditions and the Board acknowledges the external influences on the performance of each Portfolio. Further risks specifically applicable to the Balanced Risk Allocation Shares are set out on page 38.</p><p>The performance of the Manager is carefully monitored by the Board, and the continuation of the Manager's mandates is reviewed each year. The Board has established guidelines to ensure that the investment policies of each class of Share are pursued by the Manager.</p><p>For a fuller discussion of the economic and market conditions facing the Company and the current and future performance of the different Portfolios of the Company, please see both the Chairman's Statement on pages 3 to 5 and the portfolio managers' reports starting on page 7.</p><p>Risks Applicable to the Company's Shares</p><p>Shares in the Company are designed to be held over the long-term and may not be suitable as short-term investments. There can be no guarantee that any appreciation in the value of the Company's Shares will occur and investors may not get back the full value of their investments. Owing to the potential difference between the mid-market price of the Shares and the prices at which they are sold, there is no guarantee that their realisable value will reflect their mid-market price.</p><p>The market value of a Share, as well as being affected by its net asset value (NAV), is also influenced by investor demand, its dividend yield, where applicable, and prevailing interest rates, amongst other factors. As such, the market value of a Share can fluctuate and may not reflect its underlying NAV. Shares may therefore trade at discounts to their NAVs. However, the Board has adopted a discount control policy that applies to all Share classes and the Board and the Manager monitor the market rating of each Share class.</p><p>Past performance of the Company's Shares is not necessarily indicative of future performance.</p><p>While it is the intention of the Directors to pay dividends to holders of the UK Equity, Global Equity Income and Managed Liquidity Shares, this will be affected by the returns achieved by the respective Portfolios and the dividend policy adopted by the Board. Accordingly, the amount of dividends paid to shareholders may fluctuate. Any change in the tax or accounting treatment of dividends received or other returns may also affect the level of dividend paid on the Shares in future years. The Directors have resolved, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to supplement revenue with capital profits in order to pay equity Portfolio dividends at specified target levels (see pages 32 and 33).</p><p>Viability and Compulsory Conversion of a Class of Share</p><p>It is possible that through poor performance, market sentiment, or otherwise, lack of demand for one of the Company's share classes could result in the relevant Portfolio becoming too small to be viable. The Board monitors share conversions and Portfolio sizes and liaises with the Manager on the continued viability of each Share class. The Board has received assurances from the Manager that the size of the portfolios is not critical to the Manager being able to continue to offer its investment management services in respect of any of the Company's four portfolio strategies.</p><p>The continued listing on the Official List of each class of Share is dependent on at least 25% of the Shares in that class being held in public hands. This means that if more than 75% of the Shares of any class were held by, inter alia, the Directors, persons connected with Directors or persons interested in 5% or more of the relevant Shares, the listing of that class of Share might be suspended or cancelled. The Listing Rules state that the FCA may allow a reasonable period of time for the Company to restore the appropriate percentage if this rule is breached, but in the event that the listing of any class of Shares were cancelled the Company would lose its investment trust status.</p><p>Accordingly, if at any time the Board considers that the listing of any class of Share on the Official List is likely to be cancelled and the loss of such listing would mean that the Company would no longer be able to qualify for approval as an investment trust under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act\u00a02010, the Board may serve written notice on the holders of the relevant Shares requiring them to convert their Shares into another Share class.</p><p>Liability of a Portfolio for the Liabilities of Another Portfolio</p><p>The Directors intend that, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, each Portfolio will effectively operate as if it were a stand-alone company. However, investors should be aware of the following factors:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a matter of law, the Company is a single entity. Therefore, in the event that any of the Portfolios has insufficient funds or assets to meet all of its liabilities, on a winding-up or otherwise, such a shortfall would become a liability of the other Portfolios and would be payable out of the assets of the other Portfolios in such proportions as the Board may determine; and</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Companies Act 2006 prohibits the Directors from declaring dividends in circumstances where, following the distribution, the Company's assets would represent less than one and a half times the aggregate of its liabilities or the amount of net assets would be less than the aggregate of its share capital and undistributable reserves. If the Company were to incur material liabilities in the future, a significant fall in the value of the Company's assets as a whole may affect the Company's ability to pay dividends on a particular class of Share, even though there are distributable profits attributable to the relevant Portfolio.</p><p>Gearing</p><p>Performance may be geared by use of the \u00a325 million 364 day multicurrency revolving credit facility. The Company also has an uncommitted overdraft facility of up to 10% of net assets. There is no guarantee that these facilities will be renewed at maturity or on terms acceptable to the Company. If it were not possible to renew these facilities or replace them with one from another lender, the amounts owing by the Company would need to be funded by the sale of securities.</p><p>The Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio may also be geared (by up to 250%, according to the investment policy set out on page 31) by means of the derivative instruments in which it invests. This is discussed separately below, under the heading: Additional Risks Applicable to Balanced Risk Allocation Shares.</p><p>Gearing levels of the different Portfolios will change from time to time in accordance with the respective portfolio managers' assessments of risk and reward. Where market exposure is geared, any reduction in the value of the geared Portfolio's investments may lead to a correspondingly greater percentage reduction in its NAV (which is likely to affect Share prices adversely). Any reduction in the number of Shares in issue (for example, as a result of buy backs) will, in the absence of a corresponding reduction in borrowings, result in an increase in a Portfolio's gearing.</p><p>Whilst the use of borrowings by the Company should enhance the total return on a particular class of Share where the return on the underlying securities is rising and exceeds the cost of borrowing, it will have the opposite effect where the underlying return is falling, further reducing the total return on that Share class. Similarly, the use of gearing by investment companies or funds in which the Company invests increases the volatility of those investments.</p><p>Hedging</p><p>The Company may use derivatives to hedge its exposure to currency or other risks and for the purpose of efficient portfolio management. There may be a correlation between price movements in the underlying securities, currency or index, on the one hand, and price movements in the investments, which are the subject of the hedge, on the other hand. In addition, an active market may not exist for a particular hedging derivative instrument at any particular time.</p><p>Regulatory and Tax Related</p><p>The Company is subject to various laws and regulations by virtue of its status as a public limited investment company registered under the Companies Act 2006, its status as an investment trust and its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Loss of investment trust status could lead to the Company being subject to Capital Gains Tax on the sale of its investments. A serious breach of other regulatory rules could lead to suspension from the London Stock Exchange, a fine or a qualified Audit Report. Other control failures, either by the Manager or any other of the Company's service providers, could result in operational or reputational problems, erroneous disclosures or loss of assets through fraud, as well as breaches of regulations.</p><p>The Manager reviews the level of compliance with the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and other financial regulatory requirements on a daily basis. All transactions, income and expenditure are reported to the Board. The Board regularly considers the risks to which the Company is exposed, the measures in place to control them and the potential for other risks to arise. The Board ensures that satisfactory assurances are received from service providers. The depositary and the Manager's compliance and internal audit officers report regularly to the Company's Audit Committee.</p><p>The risks and risk management policies and procedures as they relate to the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are also detailed in note 17 to the financial statements.</p><p>Additional Risks Applicable to Balanced Risk Allocation Shares</p><p>The use of financial derivative instruments forms part of the investment policy and strategy of the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio. The Portfolio's ability to use these instruments may be limited by market conditions, regulatory limits and tax considerations. The absence of a liquid market for any particular instrument at any particular time may inhibit the ability of the Manager to liquidate a financial derivative instrument at an advantageous price. However, the Manager actively seeks the most liquid means of obtaining the required exposures. The financial derivative instruments used for the strategy are geared instruments and the aggregate notional exposure will usually exceed the net asset value of the Portfolio. Whilst this could result in greater fluctuations in the net asset value, and consequently the share price, the use of leverage is normally necessary to achieve the target volatility required to meet the return objective. The degree of leverage inherent in futures trading potentially means that a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in an immediate and substantial loss and it would be necessary to increase the collateral held at the clearing broker to cover such loss. This is mitigated by the Company not using financial derivative instruments to create net short positions in any asset class combined with holding cash balances sufficient to meet collateral requirements.</p><p>Reliance on Third Party Service Providers</p><p>The Company has no employees and the Directors have all been appointed on a non-executive basis. The Company is therefore reliant upon the performance of third party service providers for its executive function. In particular, the Manager performs services that are integral to the operation of the Company and the custodian appointed by the depositary holds assets on its behalf. Failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the Company in accordance with the terms of its appointment could have a materially detrimental impact on the operation of the Company and could affect the ability of the Company to successfully pursue its Investment Policy.</p><p>The Manager may be exposed to reputational risks. In particular, the Manager may be exposed to the risk that litigation, misconduct, operational failures, negative publicity and press speculation, whether or not it is valid, will harm its reputation. Any damage to the reputation of the Manager could result in potential counterparties and third parties being unwilling to deal with the Manager and by extension the Company. This could have an adverse impact on the ability of the Company to successfully pursue its Investment Policy.</p><p>Viability Statement</p><p>The Directors' view of the Company's viability has not changed since last year. The Company is an investment company which operates as a collective investment vehicle, designed and managed for long term investment. The Board considers long term for this purpose to be at least three years and so has assessed the Company's viability over this period. However, the life of the Company is not intended to be limited to that or any other period.</p><p>In assessing the viability of the Company the Board considered the principal risks to which it is exposed, as set out on pages 36 to 39, together with mitigating factors. The risks of failure to meet the Company's and the Portfolios' investment objectives, contributory market and investment risks and the challenges of lack of scale were considered to be of particular importance. The Board also took into account the capabilities of the Manager and the varying market conditions already experienced by the Company since its launch in 2006. On the question of scale, the Board has concluded that if an individual Portfolio became too small it should not cause the Company itself to be unviable.</p><p>In terms of financial risks to viability, materially all of the investments comprising the portfolios are readily realisable. The equity portfolios also produce a stream of dividend income, which may fluctuate but which the Board expects to continue. The Company has no long term liabilities and the total value of the portfolios is a multiple of the value of the Company's short term liabilities and annual operating costs. Consequently, there appears little to no prospect of the Company not being able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due in the next three years.</p><p>Based on the above, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.</p><p>Corporate Governance</p><p>The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of Corporate Governance. The Corporate Governance Statement required by the UKLA Listing Rules is set out on page 43.</p><p>Audit Committee Report</p><p>The extended audit committee report required by the UK Corporate Governance Code is set out on pages 44 to 46. There are no areas of concern in relation to the financial statements to bring to the attention of shareholders.</p><p>Board Responsibilities</p><p>As set out in the Directors' Report on page 47 the Directors have a statutory duty to promote the success of the Company, whilst also having regard to certain broader matters, including the need to engage with employees, suppliers, customers and others, and to have regard to their interests (s172\u00a0Companies Act 2006). However, the Company has no employees and no customers in the traditional sense. In accordance with the Company's nature as an investment trust the Board's principal concern has been, and continues to be, the interests of the Company's shareholders taken as a whole. Notwithstanding this, the Board has a responsible governance culture and also has due regard for broader matters so far as they apply. In particular, the Board engages with the Manager at every Board meeting and reviews its relationships with other service providers at least annually.</p><p>Board Diversity</p><p>The Company's policy on diversity is set out on pages 49 and 50. At the year end the Board comprised four male and one female non-executive Directors resulting in female representation of 20%. As disclosed on page 47 the current Chairman (a male) will retire at the forthcoming AGM. A recruitment process is underway for a new Director, in respect of which the Board has a strong preference for the appointee to be female. If an appropriate female appointee is identified, female representation on the Board will become 40%. Summary biographical details of all the current Directors are set out on page?41. The Company has no employees.</p><p>Social and Environmental Matters</p><p>As an investment company with no employees, property or activities outside investment, environmental policy has limited application. The Manager considers various factors when evaluating potential investments. While a company's policy towards the environment and social responsibility, including with regard to human rights, is considered as part of the overall assessment of risk and suitability for the Portfolio, the Manager does not make investment decisions on environmental and social grounds alone. The Manager applies the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.</p><p>Modern Slavery Act</p><p>The Company is an investment vehicle and does not provide goods or services in the normal course of its business, or have customers. Accordingly, the Directors consider that the Company is not within the scope of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.</p><p>This Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 30 July 2019.</p><p>Invesco Asset Management Limited</p><p>Company Secretary</p><p>.</p><p>STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES</p><p>in respect of the preparation of the annual financial report</p><p>The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual financial report in accordance with applicable law and regulations.</p><p>Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under the law the Directors have elected to prepare financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.' Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.</p><p>In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.</p><p>The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.</p><p>Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, a Directors' Report, which includes a Corporate Governance Statement, and a Directors' Remuneration Report that comply with that law and those regulations.</p><p>The Directors confirm that:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's Auditor is unaware; and</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's Auditor is aware of that information.</p><p>The Directors of the Company each confirm to the best of their knowledge that:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, net return and cash flows of the Company; and</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 this annual financial report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.</p><p>The Directors consider that this annual financial report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy.</p><p>Signed on behalf of the Board of Directors</p><p>Patrick Gifford</p><p>Chairman</p><p>30 July 2019</p><p>.</p><p>INCOME STATEMENT<br/>FOR THE YEAR ENDED

STATEMENTS</p><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accounting policies</p><p>Accounting policies describe the Company's approach to recognising and measuring transactions during the year and the position of the Company at the year end.</p><p>The principal accounting policies are set out below:</p><p>(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basis of preparation</p><p>(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accounting Standards applied</p><p>The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 'the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland', and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP)) and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies (AIC) in November 2014 (SORP) as updated in February 2018. The financial statements are issued on a going concern basis as disclosed on page 51.</p><p>The accounting policies applied to these financial statements are consistent with those applied for the preceding year.</p><p>(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Definitions used in the financial statements</p><p>'Portfolio' the UK Equity Share Portfolio, the Global Equity Income Share Portfolio, the Balanced Risk Allocation Share Portfolio and/or the Managed Liquidity Share Portfolio (as the case may be). Each comprises, or may include, an investment portfolio, derivative instruments, cash, loans, debtors and other creditors, which together make up the net assets as shown in the balance sheet.</p><p>'Share'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UK Equity Share, Global Equity Income Share, Balanced Risk Allocation Share, Managed Liquidity Share and/or Deferred Share (as the case may be).</p><p>The financial statements for the Company comprise the income statement, reconciliation of movements in shareholders' funds, the total column of the balance sheet and the company totals shown in the notes to the financial statements.</p><p>The UK Equity, Global Equity Income, Balanced Risk Allocation and Managed Liquidity Share Portfolios' income statements and summaries of net assets (shown on pages 12, 19, 25 and 28) do not represent statutory accounts, are not required under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and are not audited. These have been disclosed to assist shareholders' understanding of the assets and liabilities, and income and expenses of the different Share classes.</p><p>In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the income statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the income statement.</p><p>(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Functional and presentational currency</p><p>The Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency and is the currency of the Company's share capital and the predominant currency in which the Company's shareholders operate. This is also the currency in which these accounts are prepared.</p><p>(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transactions and balances</p><p>Transactions in foreign currency, whether of a revenue or capital nature, are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated to sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gains or losses, whether realised or unrealised, are taken to the capital reserve or to the revenue account, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature. All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.</p><p>(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements</p><p>The preparation of the financial statements may require the Directors to make estimations where uncertainty exists. It also requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions, in the process of applying the accounting policies. There have been no significant judgements, estimates or assumptions for the current or preceding year.</p><p>(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Financial instruments</p><p>The Company has chosen to apply the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in full in respect of the financial instruments, which is explained below.</p><p>(i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities</p><p>The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Company will offset financial assets and financial liabilities if the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and interests and intends to settle on a net basis.</p><p>(ii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Derecognition of financial assets</p><p>The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the right to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in the transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Company is recognised as an asset.</p><p>(iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Derecognition of financial liabilities</p><p>The Company derecognises financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.</p><p>(iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trade date accounting</p><p>Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.</p><p>(v)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities</p><p>Financial assets</p><p>The Company's investments, including financial derivative instruments, are classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.</p><p>Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, which is taken to be their cost, with transaction costs expensed in the income statement, and are subsequently valued at fair value.</p><p>Fair value for investments, including financial derivative instruments, that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted bid prices at the balance sheet date. For investments that are not actively traded or where active stock exchange quoted bid prices are not available, fair value is determined by reference to a variety of valuation techniques including broker quotes and price modelling. Where there is no active market, unlisted/illiquid investments are valued by the Directors at fair value with regard to the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and on recommendations from Invesco's Pricing Committee, both of which use valuation techniques such as earnings multiples, recent arm's length transactions and net assets.</p><p>Financial liabilities</p><p>Financial liabilities, excluding financial derivative instruments but including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p><p>(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Derivatives and hedging</p><p>Derivative instruments are valued at fair value in the balance sheet. Derivative instruments may be capital or revenue in nature and, accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognised in revenue or capital in the income statement as appropriate.</p><p>Forward currency contracts entered into for hedging purposes are valued at the appropriate forward exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Profits or losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves.</p><p>Futures contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes and any profits and losses on the closure or revaluation of positions are included in capital reserves. Where futures contracts are used for investment exposure any income element arising on bond futures is recognised as a\u00a0gain on derivative instruments in the income statement and shown in revenue.</p><p>(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cash and cash equivalents</p><p>Cash and cash equivalents may comprise cash (including short term deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value) as well as cash equivalents, including money market funds. Investments are regarded as cash equivalents if they meet all of the following criteria: highly liquid investments held in the Company's base currency that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and provide a return no greater than the rate of a three-month high quality government bond. For the Balanced Risk Allocation and Managed Liquidity Portfolios, cash and cash equivalents do not include investments in Short Term Investments Company (Global Series) plc as this forms part of those Portfolio's fixed assets.</p><p>(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Income</p><p>Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' right to receive payment has been established, normally the ex-dividend date. UK dividends are stated net of related tax credits. Interest income arising from cash is recognised on an accruals basis and underwriting commission is recognised as earned. Special dividends are taken to revenue unless they arise from a return of capital, when they are allocated to capital in the income statement. Income from fixed income securities is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.</p><p>(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Expenses and finance costs</p><p>All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are charged to the income statement and shown in revenue except where expenses are presented as capital items when a\u00a0connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments held can be demonstrated and thus management fees and finance costs are charged to revenue and capital to reflect the Directors' expected long-term view of the nature of the investment returns of each Portfolio.</p><p>Expenses charged to the Company in relation to a specific Portfolio are charged directly to that Portfolio.</p><p>Expenses charged to the Company that are common to more than one Portfolio are allocated between those Portfolios in the same proportions as the net assets of each Portfolio at the latest conversion date.</p><p>Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.</p><p>The management fees and finance costs are charged in accordance with the Board's expected split of long-term returns, in the form of capital gains and income, to the applicable Portfolio as follows:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_17\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\"><p><br/></p> PORTFOLIO</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">REVENUE<p><br/></p> RESERVE</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">CAPITAL<p><br/></p> RESERVE</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">UK Equity</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">30%</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">70%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Global Equity Income</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">30%</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">70%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Balanced Risk Allocation</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">30%</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">70%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" valign=\"top\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" valign=\"top\">Managed Liquidity</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" valign=\"top\">100%</entry><entry align=\"right\" colname=\"col4\" valign=\"top\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Any entitlement to any investment performance fee which is attributable to the UK Equity and/or the Global Equity Income Portfolio is allocated 100% to capital as it is principally attributable to the capital performance of the investments in that Portfolio.</p><p>(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dividends</p><p>Dividends are accrued in the financial statements when there is an obligation to pay the dividends at the balance sheet date.</p><p>(h)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Taxation</p><p>Tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Any tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.</p><p>For the Company, any allocation of tax relief to capital is based on the marginal basis, such that tax allowable capital expenses are offset against taxable income. Where individual Portfolios have extra tax capacity arising from unused tax allowable expenses which can be used by a different Portfolio, this extra tax capacity is transferred between the Portfolios at a valuation of 1% of the amount transferred.</p><p>Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred. Timing differences are differences between the Company's taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. Deferred taxation assets are recognised where, in the opinion of the Directors, it is more likely than not that these amounts will be realised in future periods.</p><p>A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of surplus management expenses as the Company is unlikely to have sufficient future taxable revenue to offset against these.</p><p>Investment trusts which have approval under the appropriate tax regulations are not liable for taxation on capital gains.</p><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Income</p><p>This note shows the income generated from the portfolios

Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.</p><p>The Company's principal risks and uncertainties are outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 36\u00a0to 39. This note expands on risk areas in relation to the Company's financial instruments. The portfolios are managed in accordance with the Company's investment policies and objectives, which are set out on pages 29 to 32. The management process is subject to risk controls, which the Audit Committee reviews on behalf of the Board, as described on pages 45 and 46.</p><p>The principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below:</p><p>Market risk- arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk:</p><p>Currency risk- arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates;</p><p>Interest rate risk- arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates; and</p><p>Other price risk- arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.</p><p>Liquidity risk- arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.</p><p>Credit risk, incorporating counterparty risk- arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.</p><p>Risk Management Policies and Procedures</p><p>As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term in accordance with its investment policies so as to meet its investment objectives. In pursuing its objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Company's net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends. The risks applicable to the Company and the Directors' policies for managing these risks follow. These have not changed from those applying in the previous year.</p><p>The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities of the Company as more fully described in the Directors' Report.</p><p>The main risk that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments is market risk - this risk is reviewed in detail below. Since the Company mainly invests in quoted investments and derivative instruments traded on recognised exchanges, liquidity risk and credit risk are significantly mitigated.</p><p>17.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Market Risk</p><p>Market risk arises from changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of movements in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk (17.1.1), interest rate risk (17.1.2) and other price risk (17.1.3).</p><p>The Company's portfolio managers assess the individual investment portfolio exposures when making each investment decision for their Portfolios, and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. The Board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance for the four Portfolios and the Company, as disclosed in the Board Responsibilities section of the Directors' Report on pages 47 and 48. Borrowings can be used by the UK Equity and Global Equity Income Portfolios, which will increase the Company's exposure to market risk and volatility. The borrowing limits for these Portfolios are 25% and 20% of attributable net assets, respectively.</p><p>17.1.1Currency Risk</p><p>A majority of the Global Equity Income Portfolio, derivative instruments in the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio and a small proportion of the UK Equity Portfolio consist of assets, liabilities and income denominated in currencies other than sterling. As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.</p><p>Management of Currency Risk</p><p>The portfolio managers monitor the separate Portfolios' exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and report to the Board on a regular basis. Forward foreign currency contracts can be used to limit the Company's exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates and to achieve portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives in line with its investment policies. All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the exposure to those currencies. No such contracts were in place at the current or preceding year end. Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt. The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is accrued and its receipt.</p><p>Foreign Currency Exposure</p><p>The fair value or amortised cost of the Company's monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 May are shown below. Where the Company's equity investments (which are not monetary items) are priced in a foreign currency they have been included separately in the analysis in order to show the overall level of exposure.</p><p>UK EQUITY PORTFOLIO:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_43\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\"

be bought or sold in a\u00a0transaction between willing parties, i.e. a market-based, independent measure of value. This note sets out the fair value hierarchy comprising three 'levels' and the aggregate amount of investments in each level.</p><p>The financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value (investments and derivative instruments), or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.</p><p>FRS 102 as amended for fair value hierarchy disclosures (March 2016) sets out three fair value levels. These are:</p><p>Level 1 - The unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.</p><p>Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable (i.e. developed using market data) for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.</p><p>Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable (i.e. for which market data is unavailable) for the asset or liability.</p><p>Categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset/liability.</p><p>The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies note. The majority of the Company's investments are quoted equity investments and Treasury bills which are deemed to be Level 1. Level 2 comprises all other quoted fixed income investments, derivative instruments and liquidity funds held in the Balanced Risk Allocation and Managed Liquidity Portfolios. Level 3 investments comprise any unquoted securities and the remaining hedge fund investments of the Balanced Risk Allocation Portfolio.

The capital is funded from monies invested in the Company by shareholders (both initial investment and any retained amounts) and any borrowings by the Company.</p><p>The Company's total capital employed at 31 May 2019 was \u00a3144,525,000 (2018: \u00a3168,792,000) comprising borrowings of \u00a312,230,000 (2018: \u00a317,576,000) and equity share capital and other reserves of \u00a3132,295,000 (2018: \u00a3151,216,000).</p><p>The Company's total capital employed is managed to achieve the Company's investment objective and policy as set out on pages 29 and 32, including that borrowings may be used to raise equity exposure up to a maximum of 25% of net assets. At the balance sheet date, maximum gross gearing was 18.9% (2018: 17.3%). The Company's policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding year.</p><p>The main risks to the Company's investments are shown in the Directors' Report under the 'Principal Risks and Uncertainties' section on pages 36 to 39. These also explain that the Company has borrowing facilities which can be used in accordance with each Portfolio's investment objectivity and policy and that this will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of each applicable portfolio.</p><p>The Board can also manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers, which it is seeking to renew, to issue and buy back shares and it also determines dividend payments.</p><p>The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends by Corporation Tax Act 2010 and by the Companies Act 2006, respectively, and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility, by the terms imposed by the lender. The Board regularly monitors, and has complied with, the externally imposed capital requirements. This is unchanged from the prior year.</p><p>Borrowings comprise any drawings on the credit and/or overdraft facilities, details of which are given in note 12.</p><p>20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contingencies, guarantees and financial commitments</p><p>Any liabilities the Company is committed to honour but which are dependent on a future circumstance or event occurring would be disclosed in this note if any existed.</p><p>There were no contingencies, guarantees or financial commitments of the Company at the year end (2018: \u00a3nil).</p><p>21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Related party transactions and transactions with the Manager</p><p>A related party is a company or individual who has direct or indirect control or who has significant influence over the Company. Under accounting standards, the Manager is not a related party.</p><p>Under UK GAAP, the Company has identified the Directors as related parties. The Directors' remuneration and interests have been disclosed on pages 58 to 60 with additional disclosure in note 4. No other related parties have been identified.</p><p>Details of the Manager's services and fees are disclosed in the Director's Report on pages 51 and 52, and note 3.</p><p>22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Post Balance Sheet Events</p><p>Any significant events that occurred after the Company's financial year end but before the signing of the balance sheet will be shown here.</p><p>There are no significant events after the end of the reporting period requiring disclosure.</p><p>.</p><p>The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for the year ended 31 May 2019.\u00a0 The financial information for 2018 is derived from the statutory accounts for the year ended 31 May 2018, which have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\u00a0 The auditor has reported on the 2018 accounts; the audit report was unqualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report and did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.\u00a0 The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 May 2019 have been finalised and audited but have not yet been delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\u00a0</p><p>The audited annual financial report will be available to shareholders, and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies, shortly.\u00a0 Copies may be obtained during normal business hours from the Company's Registered Office, from its correspondence address, 43-45 Portman Square, London W1H 6LY, and via the web pages of all of the Share classes on the Manager's website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.invesco.co.uk/investmenttrusts\">http://www.invesco.co.uk/investmenttrusts</url>.</p><p>The Annual General Meeting will be held on 3 October 2019 at 11.30am at 43-45 Portman Square, London W1H 6LY.</p><p>By order of the Board<br/>Invesco Asset Management Limited<br/>30 July 2019</p><p>Contacts:<br/>Angus Pottinger\u00a0 020 3753 1000<br/>Paul Griggs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 020 3753 1000</p><p>.</p><p>NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING</p><p>NOTICE IS GIVEN that the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc will be held at 43-45 Portman Square, London W1H 6LY at 11.30am on 3 October 2019 for the following purposes:</p><p>Ordinary Business of the Company</p><p>1.
