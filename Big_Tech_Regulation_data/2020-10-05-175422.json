Global Innovation Centers (GICs)\u2014particularly in India\u2014are on the upswing and increasingly used by companies to unlock this potential while keeping value creation inside the enterprise.The Digital Universe: Data is driving growth and change in the 21st century in the way that oil did last century. As noted in The Economist: 'Flows of data have created new infrastructure, new businesses, new monopolies, new politics and\u2014crucially\u2014new economics. Digital information is unlike any previous resource; it is extracted, refined, valued, bought and sold in different ways. </p><p>It changes the rules for markets and it demands new approaches from regulators. Many a battle will be fought over who should own, and benefit from, data.' (The Economist, 'Fuel of the future / Data is giving rise to a new economy / How is it shaping up?,' May 6, 2017)As more business activities migrate to, and depend on, the Internet and cloud computing, huge volumes of data are collected and stored. The so-called 'digital universe' is expanding at a staggering rate. The quality of data has also changed from somewhat static databases of names and personal information (such as age, sex, income and address) into real-time flows of information (such as searches on Google, photos and 'like' posts on social media, shopping preferences on e-commerce platforms, information generated by smart phones, and the flood of data from connected sensors in engines, refrigerators and other devices on the Internet of Things). Users are leaving a rich digital trail wherever they go. Moreover, as the volume of data rises, the value of data is increasing. Data that was initially collected for targeted advertising can now be deployed with artificial intelligence (AI) or 'cognitive' technologies (such as fraud alerts, speech recognition and facial detection) to identify new revenue sources. According to a recent research report by Radius, based on a survey conducted by the Harvard Business Review, companies with advanced data strategies are twice as likely to report more than 30 percent annual revenue growth. They also do a better job of attracting and retaining customers and generate more revenue than competitors struggling with data analytics. To respond to the threat posed by data-driven enterprises like Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Alibaba, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014which already are among the top companies in market capitalization worldwide\u2014businesses need to be able to collect, mine, analyze and exploit massive quantities of digital information in an innovative, agile and cost-effective manner. Data-driven transformation is becoming a question of survival in many industry sectors. The Case for GICs: A Global Innovation Center or GIC\u2014sometimes referred to as a Global In-house Center or Captive Center\u2014is an offshore shared services facility, owned and operated by the enterprise, to source high quality and scalable IT and business services to support its business. GICs have experienced tremendous growth in recent years across a broad range of industries\u2014outpacing the growth rate of outsourcing services\u2014with India being home to a majority of GICs. There are currently about 1,100 GICs in India, employing more than 800,000 individuals and generating approximately $23 billion in revenue, according to a 2017 report ('Global In-house Centers in India' by Arpan Sheth, Bhanu Singh and Prateek Majumdar, Bain ...mpany, April 20, 2017). Underpinning this impressive growth is a compelling business case for GICs as companies make the transformation to compete in a data-driven digital economy: Agility. Digital technologies (social, mobility, analytics, cloud and others) require a quantum leap in the agility of operations. A company's digital operations are fast paced with short transaction cycle times that require high levels of interactivity and collaboration. As an internal shared services organization within the enterprise, GICs provide the control and transparency required to quickly adapt to the priorities of the business and facilitate speed-to-market on digital technologies. For example, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group's GIC in Bengaluru deployed about 100 robots in the first six months of its Robotics Process Automation (RPA) program, thereby generating substantial cost savings (often over 40 percent) for the bank. (Everest Group, 'Practitioner Perspectives | A Conversation with Simen Munter and Pankajam Sridevi, ANZ Global Hubs Leadership,' 2015) Alignment and Integration With the Business. Effective transformation activities and responses to digital disruption require strong alignment and integration with the business and its evolving core objectives and strategic initiatives, especially those involving high-value customer interactions. GICs offer an opportunity to build an internal team of highly talented and motivated employees who are intimately familiar with the company's business and priorities, imbued with the company's culture and practices, and equipped to take advantage of the potential of digital technologies. The interests and incentives of GIC employees can be fully aligned with the business, unlike third-party service providers which have competing interests of enhancing their own revenue and profits on client accounts. Talent. Talent represents the ultimate source of advantage for a business. GICs allow companies to recruit individuals who are the right match for the company's culture and business needs (rather than rely on supplier-selected personnel) and manage them to the standards of the enterprise and aligned with its objectives. India has a very large pool of highly skilled IT resources, which can avoid the challenge of finding comparable talent onshore (and at a much lower cost). GICs are attractive to top talent in India for a number of reasons, including the cache of working for global brands. In addition, there is a burgeoning ecosystem of innovative start-ups in India with which GICs can collaborate. An accelerator program sponsored by a single GIC\u2014 Socit Gnrale Global Solution Centre, an innovation hub of the Socit Gnrale Group\u2014'successfully generated new ideas and converted them to formal commercial engagements' with 10 Indian start-ups in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, text analytics, predictive analytics and chatbots (Finextra, 'SocGen gears up for second round of Indian innovation programme Catalyst,' April 17, 2017). Similarly, to assist it in building a large omni-channel business, Target worked closely with five Indian start-ups to innovate in areas such as search on apps, 3D imaging and data analytics (livemint, 'Target India to work with five start-ups for retail innovation,' July 15, 2015). Risk Mitigation. Data and digital technologies that drive revenue growth and profitability represent valuable intellectual property for an enterprise. As an internal shared services organization, value created by the GIC remains within the enterprise. GICs also reduce the risk of leakage of data, trade secrets and knowhow. Third party service providers operate in a multi-client environment often with other clients in the same industry\u2014thus increasing the possibility of transgression. In addition, GIC resources who train, work and build their skills on new digital platforms and capabilities are employees of the enterprise, thereby reducing dependencies on third party service providers for core competencies and minimizing the risk that knowledge and knowhow will be lost as services are transitioned to successor service providers. Cost Savings. Like outsourcing, GICs can provide substantial cost savings through labor arbitrage in moving operations offshore. GICs may also compare favorably to offshore outsourcing from a cost standpoint. Wages tend to be higher to attract top talent, but supplier profit margin is eliminated. Also, third party service providers may not have strong incentives to reduce client costs through automation and digitally streamlined processes and, in a GIC, all of the savings realized from productivity improvements accrue to the enterprise. Low Barrier to Entry. After three decades of India offshore services and the growth of a robust ecosystem, setting up a GIC is no longer viewed as exotic or risky. It is much easier to set up GICs than in the past because the infrastructure, including first-class office parks, supply chains and communication lines, has matured. There are skilled partners and service providers with substantial experience in setting up GICs who can help companies navigate the local market for real estate and talent. In addition, local legal, accounting, finance and other advisors can be readily retained. The Path Forward: The digital universe and the rise of data-driven companies cannot be ignored. Indeed, in a recent survey conducted by New Vantage Partners, nearly 80 percent of the executive respondents acknowledged the threat of disruption and displacement from 'data-driven, highly agile competitors, including the big Tech Giants\u2014Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook\u2014as well as those competitors within their own industry who are demonstrating the ability to compete on data and analytics, especially whose who have forged data cultures which give them agility and speed.' As a result, over 97 percent of executives indicated that 'their firms are investing in building or launching Big Data and AI initiatives' (New Vantage Partners, 'Big Data Executive Survey 2018 | Executive Summary of Findings | How Big Data and AI are Driving Business Innovation, 2018). GICs are an attractive option for companies seeking to advance their capabilities in exploiting big data for competitive advantage. Unlike traditional IT operations and back office support services\u2014where predictability, accuracy and stability are paramount and which are well served by current sourcing models\u2014digital technologies that support the front office and drive business growth require speed, agility, flexibility, talent and innovation. GICs are particularly well suited to that task. Like any business strategy, GICs require careful planning and execution and strong internal leadership to realize the desired outcomes. There are a number of legal, regulatory, tax and other considerations that need to be addressed in setting up and operating a GIC. Effective management of a GIC is critical. It is particularly important to integrate a GIC within the broader enterprise, immerse the GIC workforce in company culture, and view the GIC as a source of strategic innovation and not merely a vehicle for cost savings through labor arbitrage. Fortunately, many companies have already taken the path forward with GICs and achieved success, providing a blueprint for others seeking a strategy to thrive in the digital economy. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111518729091822251761700153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RNC-NNC1-F03R-N0VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1849\"/><timeReceived>9:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While topics like wearable tech, connected cars and the smart home enjoy the limelight, other subsets of the IoT which reside in much less glamorous environments - like smart cities or the use of IoT in manufacturing or in product maintenance - will deliver the biggest economic benefits. The IoT lies within the eye of a storm that has been whipped up by a combination of several megatrends: the decline in cost of the core technologies (sensors, chips, batteries and communications modules); the increasing ubiquity and falling cost of connectivity; the growth in the capacity of data analytics and processing technology; and the increasing ease with which applications can be integrated with one another.

Interestingly, the UK came out on top as the most trusting of algorithm-based investing, with a higher percentage than peers in Europe, the US and Asia.<br/> \u00a0<br/> There is a clear trend that shows as young investors become more sophisticated, their willingness to buy elsewhere and to look at non-traditional players increases, indicating that loyalty to current providers does not necessarily increase over time.<br/> \u00a0<br/> This comes at a time when challenger banks and mobile money management platforms are drawing millennials \u20ac\u201c and their wallets \u20ac\u201c from mainstream finance. When it comes to investing, Calastone's survey highlights that there could be a shift to \u20ac\u0153big tech\u20ac for the global funds sector. As other areas of financial services have reacted to the evolving needs and increasing tech-savviness of younger generations, the investment and funds world must also start to focus on the areas that make big techs' successful, such as accessibility and user experience.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Whilst the Silicon Valley behemoths have yet to immerse themselves within the investment management world, they have encroached on other areas of financial services. The current regulatory environment may not deter big technology companies from moving into the funds industry given the scale of the opportunity, especially as trust in technology has never been so high.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Andrew Tomlinson (pictured), Chief Marketing Officer at Calastone, says: \u20ac\u0153With the knowledge that there is already a growing level of trust from millennials, who would consider buying investment products from big tech companies, the potential for the technology giants to enter the investment world only increases. Whoever controls access to the investor, controls the market. Fund managers and distributors need to be mindful of this.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Many big techs already offer basic financial products and in Asia we've already seen Alibaba's, Ant Financial, entering the investment funds market and in doing so attracting a huge investor base to creating the world's largest money market fund. Given the opportunity for these companies and the scale of their client base, other markets could follow. The industry should look at what makes these big techs so successful \u20ac\u201c accessibility with a positive user experience \u20ac\u201c and learn from that if it is to navigate the coming changes.\u20ac offCopy type:\u00a0pressrelease</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTDV-279789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTDV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-0161-DXSP-90NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><timeReceived>11:18 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GFM Ltd.

Interestingly, the UK came out on top as the most trusting of algorithm-based investing, with a higher percentage than peers in Europe, the US and Asia.<br/> \u00a0<br/> There is a clear trend that shows as young investors become more sophisticated, their willingness to buy elsewhere and to look at non-traditional players increases, indicating that loyalty to current providers does not necessarily increase over time.<br/> \u00a0<br/> This comes at a time when challenger banks and mobile money management platforms are drawing millennials \u20ac\u201c and their wallets \u20ac\u201c from mainstream finance. When it comes to investing, Calastone's survey highlights that there could be a shift to \u20ac\u0153big tech\u20ac for the global funds sector. As other areas of financial services have reacted to the evolving needs and increasing tech-savviness of younger generations, the investment and funds world must also start to focus on the areas that make big techs' successful, such as accessibility and user experience.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Whilst the Silicon Valley behemoths have yet to immerse themselves within the investment management world, they have encroached on other areas of financial services. The current regulatory environment may not deter big technology companies from moving into the funds industry given the scale of the opportunity, especially as trust in technology has never been so high.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Andrew Tomlinson (pictured), Chief Marketing Officer at Calastone, says: \u20ac\u0153With the knowledge that there is already a growing level of trust from millennials, who would consider buying investment products from big tech companies, the potential for the technology giants to enter the investment world only increases. Whoever controls access to the investor, controls the market. Fund managers and distributors need to be mindful of this.<br/> \u00a0<br/> Many big techs already offer basic financial products and in Asia we've already seen Alibaba's, Ant Financial, entering the investment funds market and in doing so attracting a huge investor base to creating the world's largest money market fund. Given the opportunity for these companies and the scale of their client base, other markets could follow. The industry should look at what makes these big techs so successful \u20ac\u201c accessibility with a positive user experience \u20ac\u201c and learn from that if it is to navigate the coming changes.\u20ac offCopy type:\u00a0pressrelease</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELTDV-279763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELTDV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-0161-DXSP-90P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><timeReceived>09:50 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GFM Ltd.

The EU\u2019s trade deal with the Mercosur bloc will impose requirements ranging from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/02/eu-imposes-hen-welfare-standards-on-egg-imports-for-first-time\"> animal welfare standards</url> to respecting the Paris agreement on climate change. Cambodia has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce8cb586-ccd6-4df0-a527-db5d6401a7e6\"> stripped of tariff-free access</url> to EU markets for human rights violations. Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative aims to tie countries into Chinese trade and financial networks.</p><p>As the examples above show, it is smaller economies that are squeezed when the big trading blocs insist on their standards. Emerging countries have little choice but to acquiesce to the demands of the world\u2019s biggest markets. Even sizeable national economies can be caught in the squeeze, as demonstrated by the UK\u2019s illusory hope to have close trade relations with both the EU and the US, while being completely free to set whatever standards it likes.</p><p>What is new is that countries are increasingly forced to align entire sectors with one of the big blocs. In the past, when trade was mostly in basic commodities and finished industrial goods, exporters could adjust production to each foreign market. But, for many reasons, rules increasingly cover the whole process of production. Take the growing trade in services, which even physical goods, such as software-rich cars, now embody. That raises the stakes for the three big blocs to make sure it is their rules that are chosen. Demands for countries to make a choice will not go away with Mr Trump. </p><p>Tensions will rise even in the area where America\u2019s return to the fold is most welcome. A Biden White House would recommit the US to the Paris agreement and may pursue an ambitious climate change policy at home. Mr Biden promises carbon border taxes on imports from countries that are deemed to be \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/#\"> cheating on their climate commitments</url>\u201d, a policy the EU also intends to introduce. But making peace with Europe raises the risk of confrontation with China. It clears the field for a reunited west to form a \u201ccarbon club\u201d demanding Beijing cracks down on its own emissions or lose market access.\u00a0</p><p>It is a mistake to think of this as protectionism. It is, rather, a deeper form of globalisation, where cross-border economic activity is accompanied by cross-border rules to govern it. This re-regulation of cross-border economic flows is a natural, and potentially healthy, consequence of the earlier mistake of conflating globalisation with deregulation.</p><p>There are many possible outcomes of the looming regulatory battles. One is harmonisation: countries agree on similar (or similar enough) rules. This is the model of European economic integration, but is extremely unlikely on a global scale. Climate, however, could be an exception. A western carbon club covering half of the global economy could be a strong enough economic force field to force others into alignment.\u00a0</p><p>A second outcome is that countries outside the three blocs are more deeply absorbed into the sphere they are economically closest to. This creates dilemmas for those economies close to more than one \u2014 think Latin America choosing between China and the US, or Africa between China and Europe. The latest example is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-brazil-5g/brazil-may-face-consequences-if-it-gives-huawei-5g-access-says-u-s-ambassador-idUSKCN24U20X\">Brazil being told by the US</url> to avoid Chinese telecoms group Huawei.</p><p>A third is splintering. In some areas, the rule books of the three main trading blocs are irreconcilable and will probably remain so. This seems true of personal data processing, where Europeans prioritise consumers over digital producers, the US favours Big Tech, and China facilitates state surveillance.</p><p>But a final, more optimistic, possibility is that countries converge on the most demanding standards. In the tendency known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-brussels-effect-9780190088583\"> \u201cthe Brussels effect\u201d</url>, countries sometimes adopt European-style rules because once their companies satisfy them they can typically also export to other markets. As Nate Persily, a Stanford law professor, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/what-can-america-learn-from-europe-about-regulating-big-tech\"> told the New Yorker</url>: \u201cEurope is the only functioning regulator of Silicon Valley.\u201d</p><p>The previous phase of globalisation was often criticised for triggering a race to the bottom. In the next phase, a titanic struggle for regulatory dominance could paradoxically produce a race to the top.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Letter in response to this column</emphasis>: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5dae102-b7c9-4cd4-8696-2ccecc9386fc\"> The future of globalisation depends on better trade protection / From Robert Wade, Professor of Global Political Economy, London School of Economics, London WC2, UK</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a04c186bab3f4df399fb638b5aa1ce50</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MT-6461-JB77-K3V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Foreign Service</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzJBMjRBMDM3REM1NEIyMTgxOEY2QjQ3NEVCOEYwNEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTI2NDJCMTgxOUQwNDFCOEJDQkMxREE1MTk2NEIzNzc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GATT &amp;

Like its sister deal TTIP, it is a threat to our public services like the NHS, our food standards and our privacy online. The government can't kid us that this isn't a corporate powergrab because unlike the deal they're negotiating with Trump, the TPP exists already, and we can read the provisions for ourselves.</p><p>\"We know that there is a corporate court system which can be used to bully governments out of taking public health or environmental action that big business doesn't like. We know that the 'right to regulate' provisions are not worth the paper they are written on. We know it contains one of the most extensive sets of privileges for Big Tech corporations which threaten to undermine our rights online.</p><p>\"What will also strike many people as absurd is that the government seems to think an economic deal with countries thousands of miles away can make up for their failure to negotiate a deal with our biggest trading partners only 20 miles away. Nothing could better demonstrate the ideological crusade which this government has embarked on to strip away our protections, rights, and standards.\"</p><p>Campaigners are particularly concerned that the TPP would:</p><p>* Introduce a new corporate court system, allowing corporations from many countries to sue British governments for regulations and laws they dislike, and allowing British corporations to sue other governments in a similar manner</p><p>* Undermine food standards by treating food manufactured to lower standards as 'equivalent'</p><p>* Undermine public services, which will be subject to liberalisation disciplines unless specifically opted out, and will contain a 'ratchet' clause to expand liberalisation across services</p><p>* Includes a digital services chapter which would prevent governments from effectively regulating Big Tech corporations, allowing them to relocate your personal data and keep their source code secret from regulators</p><p>* Contain weak and unenforceable 'right to regulate' provisions</p><p>* Cover rules to give Big Pharma corporations greater powers to dictate the price of drugs they produce.

The recently updated report from IDTechEx Research, 'Digital Health 2019: Trends, Opportunities and Outlook', acts as a primer to the digital health space.  Digital health promises to change the face of healthcare. </p><p>Reflecting this is growing interest in the digital health space, as evidenced by a substantial growth in investment over the 5 years. Digital health continues to take prominence at healthcare conferences such as the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2019, illustrating its growing importance - but it is not limited to strictly the healthcare space.  Digital health is a convoluted and complex field, much of which is made up of technologies and services that enable healthcare outside of traditional clinical settings. It follows a global trend in the healthcare industry of decentralization to alleviate overburdened hospitals and clinics. Coupled with escalating healthcare costs, shrinking profit margins and ageing populations suffering with chronic conditions, digital health offers a solution to these problems for all players in the space including patients, providers and payers. In fact, it presents such an alluring and lucrative opportunity that companies not previously in the healthcare space are making significant investments and moves to do so. Big tech companies such as Amazon, Apple and Alphabet have made significant strides into the healthcare space since their announcements in January 2018.  The time is ripe for digital health due to the combination of a number of factors. These include changing population demographics, such as ageing populations with increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as current and upcoming changes to regulations and reimbursements which mean that the route to market and take-up of digital health services and technologies is more likely in 2019 and beyond.  By whichever name it comes under, whether that's digiceuticals, digital therapeutics or software-as-a-drug, this idea of software replacing drugs is a worry for large, established pharmaceutical companies. Coupled with the changing landscape of healthcare which is moving away from treating patients and towards a model of preventative care and a move from fee-based to value-based services, big pharma is being disrupted and digital health threatens to cause even more turbulence.  Digital Health 2019: Trends, Opportunities and Outlook acts as a primer to the digital health space, providing a detailed overview of the ecosystem and offering insights into the key trends, opportunities and outlooks for all aspects of digital health, including: </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN969790020190418</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX8-JNF1-J9XT-P1S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The recently updated report from IDTechEx Research, ' Digital Health 2019: Trends, Opportunities and Outlook ', acts as a primer to the digital health space.Digital health promises to change the face of healthcare.

It follows a global trend in the healthcare industry of decentralization to alleviate overburdened hospitals and clinics. Coupled with escalating healthcare costs, shrinking profit margins and ageing populations suffering with chronic conditions, digital health offers a solution to these problems for all players in the space including patients, providers and payers. In fact, it presents such an alluring and lucrative opportunity that companies not previously in the healthcare space are making significant investments and moves to do so. Big tech companies such as Amazon, Apple and Alphabet have made significant strides into the healthcare space since their announcements in January 2018.The time is ripe for digital health due to the combination of a number of factors. These include changing population demographics, such as ageing populations with increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as current and upcoming changes to regulations and reimbursements which mean that the route to market and take-up of digital health services and technologies is more likely in 2019 and beyond.By whichever name it comes under, whether that's digiceuticals, digital therapeutics or software-as-a-drug, this idea of software replacing drugs is a worry for large, established pharmaceutical companies. Coupled with the changing landscape of healthcare which is moving away from treating patients and towards a model of preventative care and a move from fee-based to value-based services, big pharma is being disrupted and digital health threatens to cause even more turbulence. Digital Health 2019: Trends, Opportunities and Outlook acts as a primer to the digital health space, providing a detailed overview of the ecosystem and offering insights into the key trends, opportunities and outlooks for all aspects of digital health, including:\u00b7 Telehealth and telemedicine\u00b7 Remote patient monitoring\u00b7 Digital therapeutics / digiceuticals / software-as-a-drug\u00b7 Consumer genetic testing\u00b7 Diabetes management\u00b7 Smart home as a carerTo find out more about this report contact or visit www.IDTechEx.com/digitalhealth .IDTechEx guides your strategic business decisions through its Research, Consultancy and Events services, helping you profit from emerging technologies.

The news putting global markets on edge, Nonetheless, take a look  at Asian markets overnight, declines across the board with the Nikkei  average down one and a quarter percent, the KOSPI in North Korea down  better than one percent.

And joining me to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former presidential candidate  and Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, and Rosecliff CEO managing partner,  Mike Murphy.  Good morning.  Great to see you everybody.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's been a great show so far.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Busy day, fun day.  Thank you.  .  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And we'll have to wait and  see if the markets can hold up under the increasing rhetoric with North  Korea coming out of North Korea.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's true.  Usually the markets do not focus on  foreign issues, on geopolitical events, and yet yesterday was a different  story, wasn't it?</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  A little bit of a different story but  I mean, we're still at historical highs, so I think a little bit of sell- off document to the mark.  We need a little volatility in the market, it's  fine but I think this sell-off is very small and not really -- no one is  panicking.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a -- we want to look at our top story  right now, that is North Korea's state-run media announcing it is carefully  examining plans for a missile strike.  The country says the strike would  create an enveloping fire around the western pacific island of Guam where  the U.S. is a critical air force base.  President Trump hitting North Korea  with his harshest words yet.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  North Korea best not make  any more threats to the United States.  They will be met with fire and fury  like the world has never seen.  He has been very threatening beyond a  normal state, and as I said they will be met with fire and fury, and  frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson now reassuring Americans as he  travels to Guam.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TILLERSON:  I think Americans should sleep well at night, I have no concern  about this particular rhetoric of the last few days.  I think the  president, again, as commander-in-chief, I think he felt (INAUDIBLE) very  strong statement directly to North Korea but I think what the president was  just reaffirming is the United States has the capability to fully defend  itself from any threats and defend our allies and we will do so.  So the  American people should sleep well at night.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president just tweeted on this matter this morning.  Here  is what he said, my first order, as president was to renovate and modernize  our nuclear arsenal, its now far stronger and more powerful than ever  before.  Hopefully we will never have to use this power but there will  never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world.   Says President Trump just a moments ago.  This is Fox News has confirmed  North Korea has successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could fit  inside one if its missiles.  Joining me right now Trump for President  Senior Adviser and the daughter-in-law of President Trump, Lara Trump.  And  Lara it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:  Thank you.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I've been watching you recently, you've been out a lot  more talking about the president.  What do you make of these rising  tensions this morning?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, listen, I think our president has inherited a terrible  situation in North Korea.  You've seen that the past administration  probably was not as strong on them as they could have been and I think that  what you heard from my father-in-law yesterday is exactly the man that  people wanted in the office.  This a strong leader who's going to take  decisive action and wants to make it very clear to North Korea that listen,  we are not playing around here.  You guys better get it together, if you  step over the line we are going to take action and again I'm not part of  the administration, but I think as an American, I do sleep well at night  knowing that Donald Trump is our president and he will do what is necessary  to protect this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He certainly came out strong, forceful, and adamant right  out of the gate.  Now, Lara, a new CVS poll finds the majority of  Americans, 72 percent said that they are uneasy about the conflict with  North Korea, as an insider to this administration, what's your take?   You're soon to be mother, congratulations. </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you concerned as well?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think every American should be concerned.  The reality  is there is not a stable leader of North Korea.  We've all seen that this  man is, you know, he's very unpredictable, it's a very scary prospect that  we could potentially have to deal with him in a very serious way.  But what  I'll say is that my father-in-law surrounds himself with incredibly smart  people, with leaders in military who have dealt with situations like this  for years, who really understand the way to deal with a situation like this  and I think he's going to go to them and he's going to say how should we  handle this and he's a great leader himself and a very smart guy.  So I  know they will come up with a best solution here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has he - have you seen changes in terms of the president in  this last six months?  You're part of the first family, you are seeing sort  of the ins and outs, the rest of us are watching, you know, the speculation  of White House intrigue and battles within the staff of the last couple  weeks.  How do you see it from an insider's perspective?  Is it more stable  than we see?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, you're hearing from the worst of worst  when it comes to the mainstream media that is reporting these things.   Listen, his implementation of General Kelly in the White House I think is  going to be great.  We've already seen (INAUDIBLE) for a little over week  and I think everybody there feels great about him being there but the  reality is that things are running very smoothly at the White House.  There  is so much that's been accomplished since my father-in-law took office.</p><p>Unfortunately, you're right, you don't hear about it all the time because  there are other focuses that the majority of mainstream media likes to  focus on but I think that if you talked to the average American, they will  say, I feel better about this country, not only has Donald Trump brought  respect back to this country but I'm sure people are telling their friends,  listen, my 401(k) is going up.  Maybe people have a job that haven't had a  job in years and you see unemployment numbers at an all-time low in 16  years, over a million jobs created.  Those are real things that matter to  the American people and that's why my father-in-law is in office.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what we're talking about here every morning,  frankly, the agenda, will we see the agenda get executed?  He's done a lot  in terms of rolling back regulations which has been incredibly successful  and has caused businesses to loosen their purse strings, that's where the  recession has been but will he be able to have a victory when it comes to  tax reform and health care?  These are the two big issues that there's a  lot of pushback from the dems, from the media, what do you think?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Listen, I think there are a couple republicans that need to get  in line and need to understand that the American people spoke out very  loudly on November 8th when they put Donald Trump in office, and they want  to see these things happen.  I do I think he will get it done, I say it all  the time but I've never seen anyone outwork my father-in-law.  He will work  to the bitter end for the American people.  He understands how important  health care, how important taxes are to the people in this country and I do  think that we'll see it happen.  You know, health care, we'll see what they  do going forward but I do think a great plan will come forward for the  American people and, you know, he's already keeping promises he made during  the campaign trail and he'll continue to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He came in with a big broad agenda.  He's talking about a  15 percent corporate tax rate, he's talking about three and four percent  economic growth.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that the  president has unrealistic expectations.  Listen to this.  Got to get your  reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  Part of the reason I think that the  storyline is that we haven't done much is because in part the president and  others have set these early term lines about things need to be done by  certain point, our new president has of course not been in this line of  work before and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things  happen in the democratic process.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting, Lara, to hear republicans basically  push back and say expectations are unrealistic.  I've been asking this  question the last couple of weeks.  Do you think that the Republican Party  really wants Donald Trump to succeed?  You wondered, you just said a moment  ago, you know, some republicans need to get in line but they won't.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  I think that the vast majority of republicans are onboard  with the president's agenda.  I do think that there are always holdouts,  there are people who don't want to see the president succeed for whatever  reason, will go against him no matter what but I don't think any of these  expectations are unrealistic.  I think  Donald Trump spoke to the American  people during the campaign and that's why he is in office because they are  sick and tired of this kind of stuff happening in Washington, D.C., people  saying we can't do it but why can't you do it?  This makes sense, people  want to see this happen, make it happen, they can do it if they want o to  do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see about the disagreements over tax reform.   They've got to get tax reform done.  I don't know what happens with this  health care bill in the senate but the democratic lawmakers are now forming  a group called The New Democracy.  They say that they're going to focus on  winning in republican dominated middle America.  Of course where your  father-in-law was incredibly successful.  Members include the following,  Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, former agriculture secretary, Tom  Vilsack, the group plans to organize action committees to endorse and raise  money for candidates.  The focus on your president's - on your father-in- law, the president's 20-20 campaign.  It sounds a lot like these democratic  lawmakers' new agenda sounds a lot like President Trump's agenda.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, what I'll say is the democrats, they might want to check  in with their own party before they think they're going to raise a lot of  money.  I will tell you that the republican national committee and the  campaign combined has raised over $70 million this year and I think if you  look at the other side, if you look at the DNC, you'll see that they are  almost broke.  They have a lot of big problems, they might want to focus on  that before they think they're going to raise a lot of money in republican  territory.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that was an incredible staggering amount of money that the  RNC was able to raise.  Has there been a change in terms of the broad party  that they're all-in?  I mean, I know that there are certain lawmakers that  are stubborn and they're not going with President Trump but - I mean, what  do you attribute this incredible amount of money raised?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  I just think it speaks to the fact that the American people are  so happy that they have a voice in Washington, D.C. now.  They want to see  the president there for eight years, they are thrilled with what he's done  so far and they really want him to know that they have his back and they  want to see him go forward and they want to see his campaign succeed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about 2020, what will be the president's message?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think that the president's message will start now and it  will go for the next three years.  I mean, what you will see is that my  father-in-law will continue to keep his promises to the American people, he  wants a wall on our southern border.  He's building up our military every  day.  You've have seen jobs coming back to this country, factories coming  back to this country.  We're just talking about Foxconn.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  I think the American people are going to see the Donald Trump  falls through on what he says he's going to do and I think they're going to  -- without a doubt put him back in there for four more years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who do you think he's going to be facing off in Democratic  Party?  Do they have anybody -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  I mean, that's another thing, you know.  They really seem to be  floundering with any true leader there, with any true message.  If you  know, please let me know.  I'd love to start preparing but I don't think -  I think it's a little early maybe to say that right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you before you go.  You mentioned General Kelly and  a lot of people are saying, well, he's really going to put new discipline  in this White House.  Have you been told that if you want a meeting with  your father-in-law you've got to go through the General Kelly?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  I have not been told that but I would respect the process and go  to him without a doubt.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Because that was the - that was the question, will his  children, Eric and Ivanka and Don and yourself and the others in the family  also be going through this new discipline. </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Why not?  Yes.  I'd be more than happy to ask him for a meeting  with my father-in-law. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lara, when are you due?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  About five weeks. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sending you our best wishes here.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Lara Trump joining us there.   Coming up.  A massive manhunt is underway right now in Paris after a driver  plowed into a group of French soldiers.  Why investigators believe it was a  deliberate attack.  And then healthy competition, CVS is moving in on your  doctor's office.  The company's ambitious plan to help people manage  disease like high blood pressure and asthma.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An intense search is under way this morning for  a car that struck a group of soldiers in a Paris suburb where an arrest has  now been made.  Cheryl Casone now with the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  OK.  So (INAUDIBLE) what we  know at this point.  Six French soldiers were injured, two seriously but as  you said, we just learned a few moments ago that an arrest has just taken  place though.  This attack happened in a suburb west of the city, police  say they arrested a man north of Paris, they're investigating a possible  link to that attack.  The Paris prosecutor saying the anti-terror unit is  investigating this.  France has been under state of emergency since about  November of 2015.  Again, officials say that attack this morning was  deliberate. </p><p>Well, CVS is looking to take on work that's traditionally done at the  doctor's office.  The company says it wants to expand a program using  pharmacists and the clinics to help patients manage chronic diseases like  asthma and high blood pressure.  The CVS launched a test program earlier  this year to help people with diabetes manage their glucose levels.  This  move is coming though as CVS faces slower sales at the stores and a loss of  some big insurance providers.  CVS shares down nearly half of one percent  so far for the year.  </p><p>Well, Facebook is closing down two standalone apps.  One of them is called  Lifestage.  It offered kind of - it was like Snapchat, it was for teenagers  basically but analysts said that Facebook no longer needs the standalone  app to counter Snapchat because it got a lot of same features on its main  app.  Facebook also shutting down the group app, it was designed to help  users better connect with their various Facebook groups but it just didn't  really catch on.  Plus, plus there is this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SER DAVOS SEAWORTH:  If we don't put aside our enmities and band together  we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron  Throne.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  OK.  So being hacked recently didn't hurt the Game of Thrones.  On  Sunday Night HBO set a new ratings record with the fourth episode of Game  of Thrones, seventh season, the Spoils of War do 10.2 million viewers.   That broke the record said just a few weeks ago by their premier because of  a recent hack the Sunday's episode had already been posted online before it  airs, so luckily for HBO and viewers, didn't matter.  They loved it anyway,  Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because it had been posted and yet the ratings  were still a record.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Some of this original content whether it's HBO  or Netflix or Amazon, they're coming out with some incredible, incredible  content.  </p><p>CASONE:  Right.  And you have to be careful when you go looking out illegal  content that's been leaked because you're liable to get hacked in the  process if you go to try to find it and watch it.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It seems like a lot of times these hackers just promote the  showing, it leads even more viewers tuning in to watch it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  HBO may have hacked themselves in order to promote show, we will  probably find that out one of t these days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We got to talk about Disney though and what they  announced last night.  We're going to talk about that when we come right  back.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, the house of a mouse  building its own how shows.  Disney announcing two new streaming services.   How the news is already hurting shares of Netflix three and a half percent  right now.  Then earnings the focus on Wall Street once again.  Office  Depot delivers a double miss this morning.  We break down those numbers and  tell you why the stock is trading down one percent.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Disney striking out with sports viewers again  this quarter sending shares of the company lower this morning Nicole  Petallides on floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Disney. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Absolutely, Maria.  And,  you know what, it's going to weight on the Dow Jones industrial average  this morning, looking down right now about five percent premarket for  Disney, looking about 33 negative Dow points as well, profit dropped nine  percent.  The major issue was ESPN, that was where they saw the weakness,  these higher programming costs, falling subscribers, you know, people are  cutting the cord overall and so Disney is making a big move here.</p><p>And what they are doing is cutting their cord with Netflix, so all the  Netflix viewers that are enjoying all things Disney, they're not going to  have that and through 2019 now what Disney is going to do is have their own  streaming service and also made a deal with Major League Baseball to buy a  stake and also the baseball, so that will help as well.  So that's the big  picture.  The parts that was the break - for the big miss on Disney.   Letterman by the way going back to Netflix, so watch for that.</p><p>He'll have six episodes, it started 2018, we know he was on for three  decades, left late show in 2015.  So Letterman and if you want to share in  his curiosity and humor, this is how you will be able to do so.  And last  but not least, I wanted to take a quick look at Office Depot down about  seven percent this morning.  Decelerating to the downside.  When Office  Depot and Office Max got together, there were high hopes but a real miss on  sales which dropped six percent.  They are trying to get with the times,  Maria, they are starting with same day delivery, they're going to launch it  in L.A., in Atlanta and Miami and then 10 other cities to follow because  they realize that is the only way to keep ahead.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  12 percent the stock is down right now.  Pretty  hefty move there.  Thank you so much, Nicole Petallides.  Mike Murphy is on  the panel this morning and I want to get your take on Disney, the streaming  announcement yesterday, the fact that for the longest time, ESPN and sports  was the jewel but now you got the Amazons of the world, and Netflix of the  world making it clear, they will bid on live sports. </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  It's amazing what happened with the quarter last night  because I think Disney is late to the party in announcing this streaming  service, that's why the stock is getting hit this morning.  But if you  think back about a year, Maria, if Disney announced a year ago that they  were pulling off Netflix, I think you'd see Netflix down 15 or 20 percent  on the news.  But Netflix has been able to build such a library of content  on their own, David Letterman and other programs that they have that it's  not hitting the stock that that hard, they can lose Disney and you're still  going to pay the $10 or $11 a month for Netflix.</p><p>But I think when you look at Disney, it sets up real interesting to me  right here around $100 a share, it's a stock that I would look to buy for  the long term.  There is a lot of different parts of Disney like the theme  parks, like the Star Wars franchise, like the superhero franchises.  So I  think they will figure it out. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the best thing about Bob Iger - I mean, his leadership  has been terrific but he - the acquisitions he's done, Lucas films, the two  of Marvel, the three major - Pixar, the three major acquisitions that  really brought him into animation, furthers into animation -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Credit to Bob Iger for saving the Star Wars franchise by getting  it away from Gorge Lucas who as on track to essentially destroy it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He is going to destroy it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So I think Disney sets up a stock you buy on this weakness.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think it's going to be interesting to see David Letterman in  the comeback, his show is going to be called Homeless Alone.  Does he not  look like a homeless guy, does he in a suit?  Seriously.  It's going to be  interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He looks different.  He definitely looks different. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's still the same jerk.  So, enjoy. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I agree. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well - yes, we'll see if that's a splash on Netflix, you know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you got to - you go to say Netflix, Amazon, really good  content. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Original content.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  You know why?  They're hiring writers, people that actually  write intelligent content. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they (INAUDIBLE) writing big check. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And the key to way people consume content has changed.  It's no  longer sit in front of your cable box and wait for the show you to start.   You watch it when you want them.  Sometimes on a mobile device but you  watch at your convenience. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  History Channel App, I've watched every season of Forge and  Fire.  It's a - it's a knife-making show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that good on Netflix?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, it's on the History Channel App.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, the History Channel. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just downloaded History Channel, Forge and Fire is like four  season of it. </p><p>MURPHY:  You sit around and watch a knife being made.  Somehow, Dagen, I  just don't see that.  OK.  Lovely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we'll take a break.  When we come back, could the North  Korea crisis have been prevented 20 years ago?  Why the mistakes of the  past presidents may have paved the way to a nuclear North Korea.  And then  McDonald's pop a with a lawsuit over soda tax, Cook County's new claims but  the fast food giant overcharged customers.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good  Wednesday morning everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, August 9th.  Your top stories right now 8:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  On the brink, President Trump promising fire and  fury against North Korea, if the hermit kingdom continues with its threat  against the United States.  The country is responding with state media  reporting it is now considering a missile strike around the Western Pacific  Island of Guam where the U.S. has a critical air force base.  Secretary of  State Rex Tillerson spoke out this morning about the situation while en  route to Guam.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX TILLERSON, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  I think the president -  what the president is doing is sending a strong message to North Korea in  language that Kim Jong-un would understand.  Because he doesn't seem to  understand diplomatic language. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The news putting global markets on edge.  In Asia overnight,  declines across the board with the worst performer Japan, Nikkei Average  one and quarter percent.  In Europe, markets are under pressure this  morning with the tune of two percent lower in Paris, the CAC quarante is  down 1.8 percent, the DAX Index in German down 1.5 percent.  In the U.S.  futures are indicating a lower opening for Wall Street.  Stocks are down,  remember Disney is a Dow component, that stock is down and that's taken the  Dow industrials down with it.</p><p>Earnings really the focus on Wall Street once again, among the names  reporting this morning, Mylan both earnings and revenue missed  expectations.  The company is also cutting its full year guidance, the  stock went from up before the numbers, to down, almost eight percent right  now.</p><p>The soda tax is turning out to be less than sweet for some companies, why  McDonald's and Walgreens in Chicago are under fire this morning.  And  calling all robots, why human intersection may soon be a thing of the past  for some major industries.  We're all over it this morning.  First though,  meetings threats with fire and fury.  President Trump warning North Korea  over the hermit kingdom's recent threat against the USA.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  North Korea best not make  any more threats to the United States.  They will be met with fire and fury  like the world has never seen.  He has been very threatening beyond a  normal state, and as I said they will be met with fire and fury, and  frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president's strength in his stance this morning tweeting  out this, \"My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our  nuclear arsenal.  It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever  before.  Hopefully, he goes on to say we will never have to use this power,  but they will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in  the world.\"  Joining us is retired U.S. Navy Captain Chuck Nash right now.   Captain Nash thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>CHUCK NASH, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY CAPTAIN:  My pleasure, Maria.  Good  morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to all of this. </p><p>NASH:  Well, I think the rhetoric is certainly heating up but the one thing  I think the president is trying to do is that message was not only for  North Korea, that message was clearly aimed at China which is the United  States will use every weapon and any weapon in its arsenal should the North  Koreans unleash theirs.  This is not going to be a static situation that  moves gradually, this is -- he is trying to remove the ambiguity and he's  telling the world exactly what he intends to do.  If the South - if the  North Koreans were to attack the South or Guam or any of our allies, we are  going to step in and we're going to use any and all about capability that  we have to rectify that situation bring it to a quick conclusion.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Captain, you're a Navy guy, so I want  to ask the Navy's role in this.  Clearly, there have been indications that  the fleets been moved in position, what's the Navy's capacity in trying to  contain or eliminate a nuclear threat for North Korea?  </p><p>NASH:  Well, there is of course the presence which you - which just talked  about which is positioning forces, then there's the defensive which is  Aegis System at sea which can take out nuclear weapons and missiles while  they're en route, not during the launch phase but during the midcourse  phase, and then, of course, there is the offensive which are the cruise  missiles and of course our navy carrier air wings that can deliver weapons  ashore.  So it is a - it is a presence, it's a prehostility, capability, it  is defensive capability while at the same time conflicts immediate into an  offensive capability far superior to anything that the North Koreans have.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Captain, it's Dagen McDowell.   Are jumping ahead though because there's been so much talk in the last 24  hours given what we know about the miniaturization of these warheads, the  missile capability of North Korea, we're talking about military conflict  essentially and we're -- we kind of lose the focus on increasing sanctions  not just on North Korea but particularly China which the Trump  administration has shown a willingness to do at least in a small way,  putting sanctions on the Bank of Dandong which I think happened just in the  end of June.</p><p>NASH:  There are sanctions, Dagen, that could have been in place that were  not put in place, but a lot of those things are more toward the holistic  side of things.  Sanctions take time to take effect.  And those effects  have to be in place for a while before they really become acute enough to  where it gets people's attention.  So we talk a lot about sanctions, those  -- there are things that should have been done probably 10, 15 years ago  but you don't react and we don't at least not just in the United States but  I think it's in western culture that we don't react until things get so bad  that then you really have to do something but to your point, are we ahead  of the game here?</p><p>I think we are ahead of the game, if you just take the rhetoric for what it  is and don't look for what's happening on the ground.  What's happening on  the ground is everybody's position forces, the adults in the room, the  Chinese and the Americans understand gravity of this situation.  Kim Jong- un is playing a game that is - it is dangerous in its rhetoric but will he  actually pull the trigger?  If he does, that's the last event in his life. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about back in 1994, President Clinton faced a growing  threat from North Korea, he reached a deal with Kim Jong-un's father, Kim  Jong-il, the deal promised aid to North Korea in exchange for country  freezing its nuclear weapons program.  I want you to listen to this and get  your reaction.  </p><p>NASH:  OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is a good deal  for the United States.  North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its  nuclear program.  South Korea and our other allies will be better  protected.  The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear  weapons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about that, Captain Nash?  President Clinton  should have used military force in the 90s instead of diplomacy and deals?  </p><p>NASH:  I think what he did was he cut that almost bilateral deal to get  there and how that worked out, look at where we are now.  The rhetoric  there sounds almost identical to what Barack Obama said about the nuclear  deal with Iran.  So, bad news does not get better with age, and we wait and  we wait and we wait until it becomes so painful that then we have to do  things that 15 years ago we never would have foreseen ourselves doing.</p><p>But at the end of the kick -- the can down the road routine or metaphor,  the road ends and then what do you do?  Somebody has to then, you know, put  on the big guy pants and do the job and that's where we are now and the  rhetoric is unsettling but we're at the end of the road with these guys.   They have miniaturized according to our intelligence community which has  not had a really good batting average, by the way, so maybe they are wrong  about this and it's a blessing but they are saying now that they have  perhaps miniaturized nuclear weapons as Dagen pointed out recently.</p><p>And now we're working on that capability to actually put it atop a - an  ICBM, an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile that could reach the United  States.  So the can is at the end of the road, now what are we going do?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Captain, it's Mike Murphy.</p><p>NASH:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I kind of put that question back to you a little bit.  Is there a  way to solve this North Korean crisis without the use of force?  Is there  is some sort of political way to work this out that would be satisfactory  for the U.S., for China, for North Korea?  Is that possible?  </p><p>NASH:  I don't think we can back away, Mike, from where we are now.  The  United States' position cannot be - cannot be softened at this point.   What's going to have to happen is I think it's actually going to get  tenser.  And by that, I mean, there are some longer term things that could  happen, not the least of which would be the Japanese walking away from  article nine of their constitution which then goes into an offensive  military capability.</p><p>The Chinese realizing that if this guy does start something, the president  just came out and removed all ambiguity about what we might do.  So now the  Chinese are looking at their partner right there and they are partners on  their border perhaps bringing about a remilitarized and possibly nuclear  Japan and when you look at history of that relationship with those  countries in the region, that should scare them but the other thing should  scare them is the potential for a nuclear conflict on the Korean peninsula  right on their border.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We just - we just don't know where this is going. We  don't know what this young leader in North Korea is going to do.  </p><p>NASH:  But the pressure - Maria, the pressure is there and the pressure  must remain there and not like typical politicians over the -- our last  past lifetime where they try to use, you know, this approach where we  ratchet up and then move back.  Look at that whole thing about gradual  escalation in Vietnam.  It was a disaster, it prolonged that war.  Look at  where we are now.  In October we'll 16 years into Afghanistan.  There is a  point - there is a point where we have to do things, we have to ratchet  them up and then not back down and I think anybody whether you are a Trump  supporter or not, realizes this guy does not back down.  So we are where we  are.  It's not going to go backwards, whereas it go forward and that's  where our adversaries -- potential adversaries, they have to make that  calculation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Captain, thanks for weighing in this morning.  We so appreciate  you're coming.</p><p>NASH:  My pleasure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chuck Nash joining us.  Coming up.  Rising tensions with the  North wing.  On stocks as well, Stuart Varney weighs in on where he thinks  markets will go from here.  And then another slice of automation in the  food -- fast food industry, Little Caesar's pizza portal is helping  customers cut the line.  Former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi will join us with  this new invention.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Rising tensions between the United States and  North Korea weighing on stocks this morning.  How will markets react if  threats between the two countries continue on this course?  Joining us now,  the host of \"VARNEY&amp;COMPANY\", Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Stu, good morning  to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, good morning, Maria.  It  occurs to me that both you and I were around and commenting on the market,  back when the first Gulf War -- I think it was in the very early 1990s, and  in the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  And on both occasions, stocks went up the  moment that the shooting started.  I think this situation today is  completely different.  Number one, we've got a rogue state, equipped with a  miniaturized nuclear bomb which can fit into an intercontinental ballistic  missile, which can reach the United States, and there has been an explicit  threat by that rogue state to attack the United States.  That's very  different from Gulf War I and Gulf War II.  </p><p>And I suspect that the end game, the end result if the shooting starts,  will be very different indeed.  That's where I'm coming from.  I think you  have to say -- I'm questioning whether or not this is a black swan event.   At this moment, it's not, but then again, a black swan event can become a  black swan event at any moment in time.  What we're going to do is we're  going to follow the headlines moment to moment, and let's see how this  market reacts.  It's not good. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You just -- you just don't know where this is going  because you don't know what this young leader who is obviously unstable is  going to do.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, it is really a unique thing in the entire you nuclear era.   Let's not forget, it was on this day in 1945 that atomic weapon was last  used on the battlefield, and that was in Nagasaki, a Japanese City, August  the 9th, 1945.  That was the last time a nuke was used in anger.  We've  never seen this situation before because the leader of North Korea, that's  a rogue state.  We've never had that kind of state equipped with this kind  of nuclear technology which can reach the United States, and as explicit  threat, let's attack Guam.  I mean, you've not seen this before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty extraordinary, Stu.  I know you have a lot more.  And  we'll see you in about 10 minutes.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour, right after \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\".  Join Stuart at 9:00 a.m. right  after the program </p><p>But first, McDonald's and Walgreens facing a new lawsuit over a Chicago  area soda tax.  Former McDonald's USA CEO, Ed Rensi, weighs in on whether  the suit will fizz out.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the lawsuits over soda bubbling up in  Illinois.  Some residents are reportedly suing Walgreens and suing  McDonald's over their rollout of the Cook County soda tax in their stores.   Walgreens is accused of taxing unsweetened drinks, and McDonald's allegedly  taxed the tax on customer orders.  Joining us right now is the former CEO  of McDonald's USA and the former CEO for Famous Dave, Ed Rensi.  Ed, it's  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining.</p><p>ED RENSI, FORMER CEO, MCDONALD'S:  Good morning.  Glad to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on this?  </p><p>RENSI:  Well, this is a classic socialist government, stick your hand in  the citizens' pocket while they're trying to find a refreshing drink, pull  the money out, and then condemn the citizen for drinking sugar and trying  to save their life by saving them from sugar.  It is so ill-conceived, so  twisted that Cook County President Preckwinkle ought to resign in shame.   In addition to that, she filed a retail -- filed a lawsuit against a retail  association for $17 million for objecting to this absurdity.  I don't  understand this.  </p><p>These lawsuits are nothing but a bunch of ambulance chasers.  These  computer systems are complex.  It takes a while to sort them out.  This  thing was delayed for a month.  People don't know what's going to happen.   And to punish retailers who are trying to do the right thing.  Look,  Walgreens and McDonald's are two outstanding companies.  They don't want to  cheat the citizens, they don't want to cheat people.  But the county  government puts them in a position they don't have any choices but to move  forward.  It's the most -- I'm really upset about it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I know.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Ed, Mike Huckabee here.  You know, I always thought that whole  soda tax idea was a little bit foolish and absurd and punitive to an  industry that really wasn't hurting anybody.  Soft drinks are a choice  people make, and it just seems like that this is one more government grab  and now they're trying to get a double handful out of the retailers and  ultimately out of consumers.</p><p>RENSI:  Governor, I wish I was articulate as you are.  You're absolutely  correct about this.  This is such government overreach, and this is why  Trump got elected.  He's not a member of the swamp.  He doesn't care about  Democrats or Republicans, he cares about the American people.  And this  government in Illinois is just raping the citizens.  And the City of  Chicago is nearly bankrupt, the unions control everything, down State  Illinois is suffering miserably, and Cook County is going to reach into the  cab driver's pocket when he buys a coke after he's been working all day  long.  It's absurd.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Ed -- it's Dagen McDowell.  But as government shoulders more  of people's health care costs, ultimately people need to realize the  government is going to try and crack down on those things that give rise to  health care in this country.  That's one of the reasons Mayor Mike  Bloomberg tried to impose a tax on sugary sodas is because we have  socialized medicine, socialized hospitals here in New York City.  And  that's the thing that individuals don't realize that if you don't take  personal responsibility for your own health and you're on Medicaid, for  example, you're welcoming the government into your home.</p><p>RENSI:  Well, this business about government and insurance and health care,  is not about good health care for the people, it's about who's going to  control how it gets paid for, and the lobbyists that are pounding  government constantly.  This health care business that resolves around  lifestyle and things of that nature, you know, let's get out there and cut  the grass, get off our butts and start washing the car, move around, eat  smarter and better, but it's a choice that you get to make.  And if you're  going to smoke cigarettes and do bad things, then your premiums ought to be  higher.  It's not the government's business to tell me how to live my life.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Ed, it's Mike Murphy, I completely agree with your take on this,  but I'm just wondering, do you think there is -- the move is for restaurant  chains like McDonald's or stores like Walgreens to reposition themselves  where they're not getting hit with these type of attacks?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, there's no way to do that.  And let's think about this for a  minute.  I'll take Starbucks as example.  If you buy one of their bottled  coffee in Cook County, it's taxed for the sugar content.  But if you walk  into a Starbucks and buy the exact same thing, it's not taxed for the same  sugar content.  It's the most ridiculous thing on the face of the earth.   So, all of these people that are spinning this, it's about health and we're  going to have to reposition.  B.S.  Get the government out of our lives!   We need a very, very small federal government and big state government, we  need people making decisions about the citizens that are closer to where  the citizens are, not in the D.C. swamp. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And well -- really well-said, Ed.  Let me ask you -- I  want to switch gears here because technology is really changing the retail  landscape, less human intersections than ever before.  We just had a real  estate company on bringing in robots to do their work instead of real  estate agents.  Here's what the CEO of REX Real Estate Exchange told us  earlier about how clients interact with technology.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JACK RYAN, CEO, REX REAL ESTATE EXCHANGE:  You look around, you have  questions, you ask REX the robot and answers all the questions you have.   Based on the 75 questions you have bought a home we found that out, and  there's a hundred different ways to ask those 75 questions.  We trained the  robots to answer all those questions so that it don't have to follow you  around and, you know, say, this home is 2500 square feet.  You just ask the  robot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The robots are taking over.  You got little Caesars introducing  the reserve and ready service.  It allows you to pay and pick up a pizza  without talking to anybody.  What do you think is going on in retail?</p><p>RENSI:  Well, it's going to happen.  Automation, call it robotics, or  whatever you want to call it, ever since the industrial revolution started,  it's going to be the future.  You look at the farming industry where there  used to be four percent of the population were onto farms, today, it's all  about giant-sized John Deere tractors combines, et cetera.  It happened in  the automobile industry.  It's now starting to happen in the service  industry, where people are being eliminated from the transaction because  like it or not human beings are very predictable.  You got 75 questions  about real estate, get it figured out.  Disruptive management is going to  be the way of the future.  And we're going to see fewer and fewer  interpersonal transactions, which in one case is really efficient but in  another case, really transforming of our society.  I'm not sure it's good  but it's going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting stuff what's taking place.  Ed, good to see  you.  Thanks for weighing in.</p><p>RENSI:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Ed Rensi there.  Stay with us, we'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Dagen McDowell, Governor Mike Huckabee,  and Mike Murphy, great show today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mow the lawn.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and  Stuart.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Nikkei average in Japan  down one and a quarter percent; the Kospi in Korea down better than 1  percent.</p><p>In Europe markets are also under pressure this morning.

Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on the table this morning to talk about.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Oh boy, I can't wait to talk about that Google  memo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Google memo -- we've got Judge Andrew Napolitano coming up.</p><p>We have a lot on deck coming up.  Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano is with us this morning.  The governor of Wisconsin,  Scott Walker will drop by.  And Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's  daughter-in-law Lara Trump is with us this morning.  Former McDonald's  U.S.A. CEO Ed Renzi will join us as well.</p><p>Stay with us -- big show ahead.  You don't want to miss a moment of it.</p><p>We kick it off this hour right now with the top story -- the escalating  tensions with North Korea.  The country now threatening Guam, a key U.S.  territory.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the very latest developments now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  A lot happening overnight --  Maria.</p><p>State-run media announced that it was, quote, \"carefully examining plans  for a missile strike that would create an enveloping fire around the  Western Pacific island of Guam where the U.S. does have a critical air  force base.</p><p>Now this is coming as Fox News has confirmed reports from U.S. intelligence  agencies that North Korea has successfully miniaturized missiles a nuclear  warhead that could fit inside one of its missiles.  </p><p>President Trump speaking from his golf resort in New Jersey put North Korea  on notice.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  North Korea best not make  any more threats to the United States.  They will be met with fire and fury  like the world has never seen.  He has been very threatening beyond a  normal statement.</p><p>And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the  likes of which this world has never seen before.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Ok.  There are reports that North Korea may have as many as 60  nuclear missiles, making the margin for policy error very small.</p><p>Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told our very own  Sean Hannity that the situation with North Korea could have been solved by  the Obama administration.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  We can blame  Barack Obama for the fix we're in today.  He gutted the Bush administration  plan for missile defense and we are very much at risk because of Obama's  policies.</p><p>In terms of the offensive side, Sean, I don't think we have the time.  As I  say, I think we've got months to decide whether we will allow North Korea  to have that capability to put nuclear warheads essentially anywhere they  want inside the United States.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Ok.  Well, China has told the international community that they  are going to follow through with the latest sanctions which would cut off  about a billion dollars in trade revenue to North Korea.</p><p>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that the U.S. is willing to talk  with North Korea, Maria, as long as they see real change in the regime.</p><p>That's the latest we have right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>Turning now to Silicon Valley and fresh controversy for Google -- more than  60 current and former female employees now say that they're considering  bringing a class action lawsuit against the company alleging sexism and pay  disparity against women.  </p><p>The news comes as a male Google engineer fired for circulating a memo,  criticized the company's diversity practices.  He says that he's exploring  all legal options as well.  He's already filed a labor complaint over his  treatment.</p><p>James Damore claimed in a ten-page memo that went viral that biological  causes are behind the gender gap in the technology industry.  Damore  getting support from WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange who denounced  Google's move and publicly offered Damore a job on Twitter adding,  \"censorship is for losers\".</p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Judge -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.   Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know about the memo.  Does this engineer have a case?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't think so.  If the memo had been published outside the  workplace where he's free to express any opinion he wants, he would be  protected.  But this memo hit Google like a bombshell, whether it's true or  not, I happen to think it's not true but that's just my opinion.  It  violated company policy to put something out to 40,000 employees that was  controversial and incendiary diverted the attention of those employees from  their work.</p><p>That's at least Google's theory and under basic principles of law Google  has the right to fire somebody for that.  So I don't blame him for suing  but I don't think he's going to prevail.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about all these 60 women that are saying yes -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, that's fact-sensitive.  I mean they would have to prove  their cases.  If there is a pay gap and if they can show a pattern of women  being paid less to do substantially similar jobs as men then they have a  cause of action under federal law and under California law.</p><p>The memo itself is filled with sex cycle -- did you read that memo?  Could  you understand -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I read every word.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I am a women and I was not offended by it.  I thought it was  like \"The Journal\" has an editorial about it today.  It's full of like pop  psychology nonsense -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the point is that he raises the central issue is that ideal  -- ideological freedom does not exist in these companies.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, these companies -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you do not -- basically, you have a tough -- they aren't  recruiting and employing people unless they believe with the ideology of  the company.</p><p>If you're conservative, you're evil.  If you have expressed a viewpoint  that the company doesn't believe in, then there's no place for you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Guess what, you work for somebody, you do what they pay you to  do.  And if you express an opinion the boss doesn't like, some of us have  learned this the hard way -- you spend a little time in the boss' dog  house. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the memo -- the memo and the reaction -- it goes to the  point of, and you see this on the left in particular.  You see it in  Silicon Valley that your speech is free, broadly speaking.</p><p>I understand within the work space the legality of that -- your speech is  free as long as you agree with me.  As long as you fit within the  ideological confines of that culture, then you can speak freely, otherwise  we shut you down.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, the issue -- the issue to me -- yes, the issue in a  court would not be is what he said accurate, is it based on science.  The  issue is was it appropriate for him to release something so incendiary  that's not a part of his job to 40,000 colleagues in the face of  regulations that prohibit it.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- Judge, you made was that if he had done this as a letter to  the editor or posted it on his personal Facebook -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  He's protected.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- then that's a different thing.  That's freedom of speech.  I  agree with you that if you work for somebody, you work for them.  And if  they say these are the confines of what you do, then, you know, you're kind  of at their mercy.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  California, New Jersey, New York have the most liberal  statutes in the country protecting freedom of speech outside the workplace,  protecting your boss from affecting your employment status because of  something you said outside the workplace. </p><p>But inside the workplace, basic common law principles are, you work for  someone, you follow their rules.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think what happened here, though, was he sent this memo to some  peers, not to all of Google, not to the 40,000 employees. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He didn't want it to go viral.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it went to some people that were at his same level and  they ended up sending it out there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but why put together a whole memo just to send it -- I  mean it was -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, the fact that we are talking about this one individual's  ideals or ideology or thoughts on women is kind of interesting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's beyond that.  Did anybody read the doggone thing  because I was listening to the mainstream media when I was driving to the  airport yesterday and it's clear nobody read it?</p><p>It goes to the point of how do you create diversity at a company rather  than just putting women into jobs that they aren't qualified for?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I agree with you completely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How do you structure these jobs to make them attractive to all  people and all people's ability?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Google may now be in a position where it is forced to justify  the decisions it made about which you are complain if 60 women filed a  lawsuit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now, to file a lawsuit and get to the trial stage to a point  where a fact-finder has to hear them, you to jump through -- you have to go  over a number of hurdles, which is a lot of evidence demonstrated in the  existence of these institutional biases.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was just going to say the left shutting down free speech on  college campuses as the \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial page points out has  now migrated to corporate culture and it's got to end.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sick of it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, it's not going to -- it's not going to end on private  property where the owner of the private property, Google, decides what  people can discuss there.  If Google tries to reach -- or any employer  tries to reach outside the workplace -- we have statutory protection.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You and the law.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You and the law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to turn to another big legal development.  The civil  suit brought by three victims of the CIA's torture program.  This is  against two psychologists who created it.  The case is now headed for court  next month.  A judge ruled this week that there's sufficient evidence to  support the plaintiff's claims.  Your thoughts.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Ok.  This is a very -- to me this is a very, very interesting  case.  Normally cases like this never see the light of day because the  government comes in and says, if this case is tried, state secrets will be  revealed.</p><p>The problem with this case for these two defendants, these psychologists,  they went all over the country and revealed the secrets including here on  Fox News.  They talked about what they did.  They talked about the torture  techniques or enhancement interrogation -- whatever you want to call the it  -- techniques that they prescribed.</p><p>So they lost the protection of state secrets and so they lost that defense  and now they have to answer to a lawsuit that accuses them of violating  federal law, state law and four treaties as to which the United States  government -- for which they were working as a party.</p><p>The torture in this case was pretty horrific and it's going to be displayed  in vivid detail to a jury and they are potentially, personally liable.   There is no indemnification by the U.S. government so these two people are  potentially bankrupt.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Why is there not indemnification?  Because seems unfair if they  are operating under the direction of the government and they're doing it  for the government and then the government abandons them and leaves them  out there twisting in the wind?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's exactly what happened.  In the Bush administration  indemnification was offered, and it wasn't fully offered or thoroughly  advanced in the -- to everybody.</p><p>Part of the indemnification was to corporations that worked with the  government like AT&amp;T.  You let the NSA plug you're your computer will  indemnify.  And the President promises you can't be prosecuted criminally.   These guys slipped through the cracks.</p><p>But Governor, part of it is their own fault.  They wanted to become  celebrities by telling everybody what they did and how they did it and they  lost certain defenses by doing that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Good story.  Judge -- good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>Coming up, states start your engines.  The race is officially on for the  new $1.5 billion ToyotaMazda factory.  Which states made the short list?   We will tell you.</p><p>And then a colossal discovery in Argentina -- scientists dig up a dinosaur  the size of a Boeing 737.  Take a look at the first looks at those fossil  pictures.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Now there's breaking news: a manhunt is underway near Paris after six  French soldiers were attacked.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria -- this happened earlier this morning.  It's being  called a deliberate attack -- Maria.  At least six soldiers mowed down by a  car in a Paris suburb.  Now there is a search on for that driver.  It's  currently underway in Paris.</p><p>Officials saying that this was an intentional act and that the car was  waiting for the soldiers to go on patrol just outside their barracks.  This  happened in northwest part of the city.  Local reports are saying that at  least two of the soldiers, part of an antiterrorist unit are seriously  injured.  We are trying to get more updates out of Paris for you this  morning.</p><p>We also have some good news here at home for you to share, U.S. job  openings jumping to record high in June that outpaced hiring.  It's the  latest indication companies are having trouble finding qualified workers.  Job openings increasing by 461,000 to (inaudible) adjusted 6.2 million job  openings at a one-year high.</p><p>And Toyota-Mazda trying to make a major decision on where to build their  $1.6 billion plan.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting  the short list  has 11 states on it.  Here they are -- Alabama, Florida, Kentucky,  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, South  Carolina and Texas.  The factory expected to create up to 4,000 jobs.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mazda is hailing a technology breakthrough for the engine.  The  Japanese auto maker says it has designed a vehicle that doesn't always need  spark plugs in a gasoline engine -- kind of interesting.  That increases  fuel efficiency by as much as 30 percent.</p><p>And then finally this, I find this interesting, we all know dinosaurs were  really, really big but the largest ever has now been found in Argentina.   This vegetarian dinosaur, 120-feet long and at the time it weighed 65 tons.   That's as heavy as a Boeing 737 and the scientists are saying that this  thing was actually still growing when it died.</p><p>It took 18 months to excavated, Maria, 150 bones.  Scientist say there  could be even bigger species that they could still discover.  They are  still digging -- Maria.  </p><p>Those are you headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, that's so interesting.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up flights gets less bumpy, the rate that airlines are bumping  passenger off planes has plummeted.  The possible reasons behind that  decline.</p><p>And then controversy over Foxconn -- a new report suggests the $10 billion  Wisconsin factory deal may not pay off for 25 years.  We are talking with  the governor of Wisconsin -- Scott Walker joins us.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer is pledging to build a  factory and a facility in Wisconsin but taxpayers may not see the benefits  until 2043, according to new analysis by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.</p><p>The State Assembly Committee is set to vote on the Foxconn bill later  today.  It would provide the company with $3 billion in incentives toward a  10 billion-dollar plan.</p><p>Joining me right now is Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.  And Governor --  it's good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.  </p><p>GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R), WISCONSIN:  Good morning, great to be with you.   Thanks for having me.  It's a great day in Wisconsin.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was it worth the $3 billion in incentives to get this factory  from Foxconn to come to Wisconsin?  </p><p>WALKER:  Absolutely.  Thirteen thousand jobs, paying on average more than  $53,000 per year plus benefits; $10 billion investment; on top of that  $10.5 billion payroll for the next 15 years alone; 10,000 construction jobs  to build this 20 million square foot facility -- well, series of facilities  really.  An ecosystem, a campus here in the state of Wisconsin and 22,000  indirect and induced jobs.</p><p>Absolutely it's worth it.  This is transformational. These LCD displays  will be made in America for the very first time right here in the state of  Wisconsin.  And we think it's transformational which is why we are calling  this region WisCon Valley because we think it will help not only Foxconn  and all the other business related to it.  It will help put Wisconsin on  the map all around the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But lawmakers are proposing 50 amendments to the bill.  Some  people are saying look, yes, it sounds great to have up to 13,000 jobs  potentially but we don't know that that's going to be the number.  And you  also had to pay up pretty big.</p><p>Do you agree that taxpayers are not going to break even on this until 2042?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, that's why, that's a good message for anybody listening.   Part of the reason for that is big or small alike, whether it's 13 jobs or  13,000 jobs in Wisconsin -- years ago we eliminated all but a fraction of  the state tax on manufacturing as well as on agriculture -- our two biggest  industries.  So if you're a business thinking about moving to Wisconsin  right now, you should know whether it's 13, 130, 1,300 or 13,000 jobs --  you're in one of the best places in the world to be at here in the state of  Wisconsin because we value manufacturing.</p><p>That's why it takes a little bit longer than a typical job up there --  typical project out there.  I should add, though, for any Packer fans here  in Wisconsin and across really around the globe, they know that one of the  biggest turnarounds for the Packers back in early 90s was signing Reggie  White who was then all pro for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Reggie White wasn't just the biggest Packers deal in the history of the  team at the time.  He was actually one of the top three deals of all time  at least back then in the NFL and it was worth it because Reggie White  wasn't just a player, he helped transform that team into the Super Bowl  winning team they were just a few years after he came.</p><p>We believe the same thing is true, parallel here in the state of Wisconsin.   It's not just those 13,000 jobs, it's not just the $10.5 billion payroll  plus the $10 billion capital investment.  It's the transformational impact  it will have here in the state of Wisconsin.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think that's a really important point that you make.   So can you give us a sense of what you think might be the indirect  opportunities as a result of this Foxconn facility or facilities -- </p><p>WALKER:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in Wisconsin because when you just look at the numbers and  you see that, ok, they're going to build this $10 billion facility but look  what you've got to give them, $3 billion in incentives.  Make the case that  there are perhaps jobs or opportunities we are not seeing that are indirect  like the analogy you just raised?  </p><p>WALKER:  Yes.  Just on the payroll alone for the next 15 years, which is  what we do to the payoff of $3 billion of incentives the state provides --  just on the direct jobs, the 13,000 direct jobs that will come from this  new ecosystem, a multitude of facilities, 20 million square feet just to  put tha in perspective that's enough to put 11 Lambeau Fields in.  So stick  with my Packers consistency there. </p><p>But those are just direct jobs -- $10.5 billion worth of payroll versus the  $3 billion of incentives.  On top of that, you've got $10 billion they  invested into the capital to build all these.  That's 10,000 construction  jobs.  There are going to be people working in this state from one end of  the state to the other to help construct this over the next several years.</p><p>And then we believe in the analysis you referenced, the nonpartisan  Legislative Fiscal Bureau acknowledged the analysis of about 22,000  indirect and induced jobs.  So all the other entities, all the other  suppliers, the supply chain issues, we have already seen Corning Glass say  that they are going to come because to build these LCD displays, they've  got to be close to where these facilities are at.</p><p>You're seeing other entities, other businesses.  We think it'll help us  attract talent from across the country and around the world and keep more  of our college and high school graduates here in the state of Wisconsin.</p><p>So there's a lot of benefits when you see all the things that Foxconn and  its -- and all the ripple effect brings to the table.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So you're expecting people to come from other places in  America to start up and live in Wisconsin just for the job opportunity.  It  was funny to hear the President the other day tell people in New York,  look, if you're living in upstate New York and you don't feel like there  are job opportunities, the taxes are too high, go to Wisconsin.</p><p>But what about the threat that the plant is not even built.  I mean Foxconn  previously made a pledge to build a plant in Pennsylvania.  That never  materialized.  So are you concerned that they may drop the plans?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, two things.  One, we have what we call pay as you growth so  they don't get a penny if the jobs don't materialize and they don't make  the capital investment.  So this is a real firm commitment for us.  </p><p>We even have claw back provisions that we do for all deals like this, big  and small alike.  So they get paid as they grow.  If they don't hit the  13,000 mark, for example, they don't get -- half of it is based on capital,  half of it is based on jobs.  So if they don't make the investments on jobs  and people are working there, if we don't make the jobs and the capital  investment, they don't get the full amount of the money.</p><p>But the other part specific to Pennsylvania, it's a good example,  Pennsylvania they backed away from because the governor changed.  They made  a change in the leadership of the state in terms of who the governor was.   That's a pretty compelling reason here in Wisconsin.  We shouldn't change  who the governor is for the next several years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is the legislation providing the company with just $3  billion in cash, Governor?  Or what kind of incentives were so important?   I recognized that there was a lot of competition for Foxconn.  The company  has even talked about Michigan, perhaps going to Michigan.  So it was  obviously they are playing states against one another.  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, they are.  There's a multitude of states, all sorts of  states have been talked about from Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois,  Texas -- even others out there.  They wanted to be in America because of  the President's leadership on this and because they wanted to secure their  market here in the United States.</p><p>We are just pleased that they picked Wisconsin.  As I understand it, there  were other states, at least one that, multiple states that probably offered  a little bit more than we did although clearly we were in the same  ballpark.  So there weren't huge differences in terms of the incentives on  the table.</p><p>What we are offered was a great workforce, access to water near the Great  Lakes, a combination of changes over the last few years in terms of taxes,  regulation, litigation -- all the things that should be attractive to your  viewers, not just if they're bringing 13,000 jobs but any number of jobs to  the state of Wisconsin.</p><p>Right to work all those things, not one thing alone was the reason for it  but they looked at the investments and the workforce.  They looked at the  fact that once the budget we're currently in, in Wisconsin for the next two  years is done, we'll have exceeded $8 billion worth of tax relief on income  tax and property taxes even on corporate taxes for manufacturers.</p><p>So this is really an attractive place to do business in.  And they saw that  as fitting and that's why we didn't have to offer the most but we had to be  in the same ballpark.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And you tweeted out that it adds over $10.5 billion in  payroll for the economy over the next 15 years with construction and  indirect jobs as you've been saying.</p><p>Governor -- we will be watching the developments.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  </p><p>WALKER:  Thank you.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you -- sir.  Governor Scott Walker there.</p><p>Coming up, waging war on the opioid crisis.  President Trump vows to crack  down on the growing problem of prescription drugs.

The opioid prices in America,  142 people die every day from drug overdoses.</p><p>With more than 33,000 opioid involved deaths in one year alone, according  to new government data.</p><p>President Trump addressed the deadly drug epidemic yesterday after being  briefed on ways to fight the public health crisis.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Nobody is safe from this epidemic that threatens young and old,  rich and poor, urban and rural communities.  Everybody's threat.</p><p>The best way to prevent drug addiction and overdose is to prevent people  from abusing drugs in the first place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski.  Better known  as D. Mike.  Dr. Mike, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>You've seen this and its impact firsthand.</p><p>Varshavski.  Absolutely.  I mean, I'm on the front lines of this thing.   I'm a primary care doctor.  I'm out of the emergency room, I'm working at  my office.  And you that patients that generally don't have addiction  problems with these medications.</p><p>They're incredibly addicting.  So even if a person doesn't have an  addictive personality, as some may label it.</p><p>They still have problems with these medications.  There's a lot of reasons  why this happepned.</p><p>A lot of it, was not enough information, from pharmaceutical Lawyer how  about vacations are.</p><p>Lawyers are actually to blame for some of this and that's not something  most people talk about or think about.  Because when doctors were  originally prescribing these medications, it was because the burden was  placed on them and it's a burden to make sure that no patient has pain.</p><p>Because if a patient had pain, it means doctor wasn't doing their job.  But  as we know, Pain is subjective.</p><p>So it's different to sometimes rule out who has real pain?  Was fainting  pain?  It put a tremendous burden on doctors to treat everybody with pain.</p><p>That's why we're stuck in this situation.  People are dying.  People are  getting and it's hitting communities that were never hurt by drug addiction  in the past.</p><p>MURPHY:  Is the issue that these drugs are just too strong and too  addictive?  We need to go to the drug company and dial back this  medication?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So as a drug, it is strong, but it needs to be strong.   Because there are some time severe pain where you need excellent pain  control.</p><p>But it's important that it's not used for chronic pain.  That's where  education comes in.  Not only education for the consumer, but education for  doctors.</p><p>Because what we did is we started thinking, well, how do we control this?   How can we change the medication to be less -- have less abuse potential?</p><p>And we said, let's use it in a long-term -- in a long dispense form.   Meaning, it takes longer to get release and it doesn't have that much of a  high in your brain.</p><p>What we found is people just started crushing and then abusing it anyway  getting the same result.</p><p>So it's important that doctors don't view that as a solution because it's  not.</p><p>Really what the solution is proper education of our patients for short-term  use of this medication.</p><p>On top of that, using alternate means of pain control.  You have  acupuncture, osteopathic therapy.  You have other medications or pain that  already as addictive.</p><p>It's really important that we focus on those methods before jumping to  opioids.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now raised a wildly unpopular idea though or part of the problem  that when you have this press conferences, when you have the governors of  many states complaining about this opioid addiction problem.</p><p>It also falls on personal responsibility.  But if you go in for a sprained  ankle, you should not be taken an opioid.  You have to be aware.</p><p>Toby Cosgrove spoke to this somewhat from the Cleveland clinic about you  need to educate people that you shouldn't -- there are very few instances  in your life.  Unless you say, stage four cancer that you need to be taking  some of these medications.  And you have to say no and you have to know  better.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  But the average person doesn't know that if a doctor  prescribes Percocet, that's an opioid medication.</p><p>It's hard to know because there's different brand names for this  medication.  So it's difficult to put all of that onto the patient  themselves.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't say all, but at least some.  Because the blame has been  spread around to everybody except to the person, the individual actually  taking the drug.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And buying heroin which is illegal.</p><p>MURPHY:  But it seems like these are so strong that it kind of -- once  people get them, the chance to become addicted to them -- the drug is  bigger than anybody out there.  That anyone could become addicted to this  after -- any sort of normal procedure where a -- pain medications did it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know plenty of people who've had take Viking and after  shoulder resurvey or some sort of orthopedic surgery and they're not  addicted to opioids.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  The addiction potential rises really when the medication is  not taken appropriately.  When it's given after surgery for period of time.</p><p>If you're having extreme pain before surgery.  And views potential is low.   And that's what our job as doctors is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  For example.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Sure.  You need to weigh the benefits and risk when  prescribing anything.  Or not prescribing anything.</p><p>So if I'm judging whether or not to an Opioid medication.  I have to see.   Is there abuse potential, sure?  But these patients in pain can't walk,  can't live because they're un-meeting.</p><p>I have to wait benefit versus.  So sometimes, when if there is a slight  abuse potential two guys.  I might have to give that medication, because  otherwise, what kind of quality of life is that?</p><p>It's a thin line but it's a line that doctors have to walk every single day  so it's difficult to just put all of the evidence on us to solve the  problem.</p><p>There is something we can do legislation-wise to help.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  One thing a person can go to you, get a pain medication.  Then  they go to another doctor and then yet another.</p><p>They're getting triple doses of medication.  There is no national database  that say, I prescribed this pain medication that shows up so another doctor  would say, well, then you just get a pain medication.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're gaining the system.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.  So that's not the majority of the problem.  I would put  that about 30 percent of the problem.  What's crazy is that when -- I went  out of New Jersey and New York and both states, I can go on the state  database to see if they're -- will be called Dr. Shopping.  Go into  multiple doctors getting this prescriptions filled.</p><p>But if they go to Florida, I have no idea about it.</p><p>As a young doctor, I can't believe that that's happening.  Because how can  we not unite a network of information?  That's all in the network of  information and because of states being territorial and legislation issues,  we can't find out if the patient is out there shopping.</p><p>That's horrible because ultimately, what I don't want happening is, number  one, the people are getting hurt, other ones addicted.  So I'm not doing  them a service by prescribing a medication.</p><p>But then patients that are actually in pain are also being affected because  I'm forcing them to jump through hoops.  Come back for more appointments  because I need to make sure they're taking it the right way.</p><p>They need to get only short course of emergency room and come see me when  they're in pain.  I'm making it more difficult for the person that has pain  to get the medication.</p><p>Unfortunately that's the consequence of the medication having such a strong  abuse potential.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Incredible.  Dr. Mike, good to see.  Thanks so much for  weighing in here. Dr. Mike joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, lady liberty gets a controversial new look.  A congressman  facing backlash this morning after refusing to take down a painting of the  statue of liberty wearing a hijab in his office.  The outrage, next.</p><p>Then most important rules of real estate.  Location, location and  automation?  How robots are getting into the whole buying business.  Back  in a moment.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Venezuela's new constitutional assembly now  assuming even more power.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Maria, the controversial assembly which we'll say declaring itself  as the superior body to all other governmental institutions after they took  control of the legislative chamber.</p><p>The delegates also put up pictures of the late president Hugo Chavez there.   The neighboring countries have decided not to recognize Venezuela's new  assembly.</p><p>Four ministers from 17 nations including Brazil and Mexico strongly condemn  the Venezuelan government in their gathering in Peru that was held  yesterday.</p><p>The assembly was installed after an election.  It was widely considered  fraudulent.</p><p>Well, here at home.  There's outrage over a painting that's hanging in the  office of democratic Representative J. Luis Correa in California.</p><p>The painting shows the statue of liberty wearing a hijab.  That's the head  scarf often worn by Muslim women.  Well, the painting was created by a high  school student as part of the congressional art competition.</p><p>Correa said he won't remove the painting.  It's calling an individual  artist's expression.</p><p>Well, McDonald's, Walgreens both being sued over the new soda tax that's  happened in the Chicago area.</p><p>One of the suits claims McDonald's is basically taxing the tax.  Walgreens  is being accused improperly charging at the tax on unsweetened sparkling  water.</p><p>The soda tax there took effect last week.  Walgreens says inadvertently  coded some products incorrectly.  There's the stock, no correlation.  It's  down about two percent, so far for the year, we should say.</p><p>Now McDonald's, they have no comment on the lawsuit against this.  Shares  of that company we should say soared 27 percent this year.  Think breakfast  all day for McDonald's.</p><p>Finally, I've got some good news for all you fliers.  The government says  that the U.S. airlines are bumping fewer passengers.  Get this.  Just one  in every 19,000 passengers was bumped from an overbooked flight in the  first six months of this year.</p><p>That is the lowest rate, Maria, since 1995.  And obviously follows major  backlash against the airlines, especially after Dr. David Dow was dragged  off that United Airlines flight back in April.</p><p>A lot of the airlines changing policy now, saying they're not going to  overbook the flights.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's good.  Rather than seeing as I'm being dragged off of  the flight, like they did.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think the new motto is if the passenger's attitudes don't  improve, the beatings will began.  Now, they're pumping fewer passengers.</p><p>MURPHY:  That definitely cost United.  I don't think they disclose the  amount, but that definitely hit them where it hurts.  So I think that's  what we're seeing this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Don't you think passengers are the problem though, as much as  you fly?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I fly a lot, 487,000 miles last year, so I'm on planes.  I'm six  days in a row this week alone.</p><p>But passengers are the problem, but sometimes they are provoked by the  hassle.  It's not just the airlines, it's the whole TSA, the airport  routine.  It's everything you though.  It's stressful to begin with.</p><p>And people who don't fly a lot are especially stressed and then it  escalates then you have a problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A shout-out to the ground crew working the Delta flight from  Riley.  JFK coming in last night.  I think it was a 6:10 flight.  Thanks  for taking more than half an hour to get my carryon.  Like you have to  curve check bags when you board the plane.  It was about 30 people waiting,  more than half an hour because they were dragging their feet.  So thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next.  With us, robots in real estates.  How one  industry leader is using automation to revolutionize the way people buying  sell homes?  This is one story you got to see.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The days of relying on a traditional real estate agent to buy  or sell a home could be coming to an end.  REX Real Estate Exchange using  robotics to change the way people buying and selling their homes.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO and co-founder of REX Real Estate Exchange,  former Goldman Sachs partner, jack Ryan.  Jack, great to see you.</p><p>JACK RYAN, CEO, REX REAL ESTATE EXCHANGE:  Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So you are really disrupting  the real estate business.  Tell us how the technology works.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, we've got robot in the home to make it easier to ask questions  about the home.  I'm sure about the experience, Maria, where you go up into  a home and someone says, here's the refrigerator.  Well, I know that's  refrigerator.  Thank you.  Here's the bathroom, I know it's a bathroom.</p><p>So in our -- in our -- you just walk in the home, you look around, you get  questions, you ask the robot and answers all the questions you have.</p><p>Basically, there's 75 questions you have about a home.  We found that out.   And there's hundred different ways to ask those 75 questions.  We trained  the robot to answer all those questions so that you don't have to follow  you around and say this home is 2,500 square feet.  You need to ask the  robot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does the robot know the background of the environment?  Can  they actually tell you things about the competitive landscape, the way the  real estate agent would?</p><p>RYAN:  So I do have people and I think with the buyers and the sellers, but  the robot not only works in the home but even to find buyers.  So we charge  two percent rather than six percent, because we don't use the MLS to find  the buyer.  We don't use humans to find the buyer.  We use robots to find  the buyer.</p><p>So back in my Goldman Sachs days, if we said, hey, we're going to sell the  division of 3M and we'll pay Morgan Stanley three percent to find a buyer,  that'd be crazy.  I said, no, we hired you to find the buyer not to pay  someone else to find the buyer for me.</p><p>So we identify buyers through big data.  Artificial intelligence.  We know  so much about you, governor or Dagen.  We can find out if you're a possible  buyer for this home.  Drive you to a website, if you like it.</p><p>We find people just like you.  Because we know people who have the same  purchase patterns as you, same lifestyle choices as you.  Find them too,  advertise them on Google, Facebook, and Snapchat, the rest and target them  too.</p><p>Once you come to that website, until we know what your behaviors were, as  we change the ad for you, because we know you care about polls.  Dagen, you  care about tools.  Maria, you care about neighborhood.  And so we had  changes for the things that you guys care most about.</p><p>MURPHY:  Are replacing or disrupting the standard real estate agent or is  there any part of the business that works alongside with the -- </p><p>RYAN:  No, we don't use the agents at all.  But we're not displacing them.   I mean, if you're not a very good agent, I think we're going to have  problems begin as the robot.  But if you're good, you'll still have a job.</p><p>But I think if we're charging two percent and they're charging six percent,  there's obviously a consolidation that has to occur.</p><p>MURPHY:  In funding, are you venture back or self-funded?</p><p>RYAN:  We're backed by some of the greatest CEOs and entrepreneurs like the  founder of Best Buy, the founder of Crate and Barrel and even some  politicians.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've already seen impact in California.  Tell us how the  models working there.</p><p>RYAN:  So we're listing and closing a home a day in California.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A home a day?</p><p>RYAN:  Yes.  We just launched in New York last week where I have free homes  vested in New York in a week.  So it's going really well.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That is a fascinating thing.  If you know that much about me,  why don't you just tell me which home I should have and then you can make  the payments because I think -- </p><p>RYAN:  Well, making payments, that's something that Mike will do for you.   With respect to us, we'll find the home for you.  We'll identify what home  you should like.</p><p>We're getting better and better.  It's kind of like if you give computer  some data, you can feed them for a day.  But if you teach them how to  search for data, you can feed them for a lifetime.</p><p>We can teach the computer to search for data about you and then start  feeding you information on the home that you should buy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So real quick, how does the market look like now?  Tell us  something that you know about the real estate market right now in terms of  supply and demand.</p><p>RYAN:  In the areas that we're in, which is our very lucrative markets like  Los Angeles and New York, it's lots of demand, tons of demand.  So it's  actually it's a good time to sell your home.</p><p>But this goes to the conversation yesterday on your show about the stock  market, things are very high right now.  So if you're seller of assets,  it's a good time to be selling your assets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Jack, great to see you.</p><p>RYAN:  Thanks for having me.  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank so much.  Jack Ryan, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, winter is coming and ratings are on fire.

Former Presidential Candidate  and Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  And Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner  Mike Murphy.  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FMR. ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And wow we came back --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I missed you when you're not here, when we're not together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But we come back to some big stuff.  Governor, what's  your take on this escalating situation with North Korea?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  A lot of people are trying to compare it to the Cuban Missile  Crisis but the difference is we were dealing with a regime in the Soviet  Union that was very different than North Korea.  They knew they had a lot  to lose.</p><p>Kim Jong-un has really nothing to lose.  I mean this is brinkmanship at its  worst and I think it's a very delicate situation for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is, it's so scary.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  From the outside looking in though it seems like because the  Hermit Kingdom is so isolated that it would -- that it would be possible to  isolate and cutoff all the flow of funds.  But those sanctions from the  United Nations do not go far enough according to many.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's kind of important to point out, this isn't a  President Trump issue though, this has been going on for years and years,  some that they've allowed to be built up this way.  So the fact that we're  dealing with it now I think is kind of something that has to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean what else is he supposed to do other than push  back with the creation and the implementation of these nuclear warheads  now?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And I think the key is China.  China is the one country that has  the leverage, that has the ability and also has the most really in terms of  the neighborhood to lose.  I think that's where we're going to have to see  the leverage supply.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk more about this this morning.  We got  a big program ahead.</p><p>Coming up this morning, \"FOX NEWS\" Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano is here.  The Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker is back with  us this morning.  Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law and  the Trump for President Senior Adviser, Lara Trump is with us this morning.   And Former McDonald's CEO of the U.S., Former Famous Dave CEO, Ed Rensi  joins us as well.</p><p>Big program ahead so don't miss a moment of it.  And we're following  breaking news out of the suburbs of Paris this morning where authority say  six soldiers were injured after a vehicle deliberately slammed into them  before driving off.</p><p>Authorities are now searching for that vehicle and its driver.  The  incident, the very latest of several attacks targeting security forces in  France.  Joining us right now Trump 2020 Advisory Board Member and Former  Navy Seal, Carl Higbie.  Carl, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  us this morning.</p><p>CARL HIGBIE, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Good  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what, the third or fourth attack in Paris or around  Paris in the last year.</p><p>HIGBIE:  They just keep coming.  And you know what, like my heart goes out  to the people of France but at the end of the day they've allowed this to  happen.  They've allowed this kind of loose societal grip and the expansion  of these extreme views.</p><p>I mean, I'm not saying that it was something that it's not but at the end  of the day that they've allowed this to expand and they've tolerated this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to find out exactly who's behind this and we  don't want to speculate.  We do want to talk about North Korea though Carl  with you because the country's state land media announced and it was,  \"Carefully examining plans for a missile strike that would create an  enveloping fire around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S.  has a critical Air Force base.\"</p><p>This threat is coming just a day after the U.S. flew a pair of B1 Bombers  that took off from Guam over the Korean Peninsula.  And then it was just  hours after President Trump used the harshest language we've heard yet in  his response to recent taunt by North Korea.  Listen to this Carl.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  North Korea best not make anymore threats to the United States.   They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.  </p><p>He has been very threatening beyond a normal statement.  And as I said,  they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power the likes of which  this world has never seen before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well those high level war of words coming as \"FOX NEWS\"  confirmed reports from U.S. Intelligence agencies that North Korea has in  fact successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could fit inside one  of its missiles.  </p><p>Carl Higbie, what do you make of this ratcheting up of the tensions here?</p><p>HIGBIE:  Well I mean, this is ratcheting up -- as Governor Huckabee had  said earlier, these ratcheting up has been happening over the last decade.   I mean we stepped off the world's -- the world is in safer place America is  strong and when America's in the front.</p><p>And this is something that we stepped out of the way and we've allowed this  to happen.  Much like France has allowed their population to run them up,  we've allowed this and we've -- China has allowed this, Russia has allowed  this.  </p><p>We need to step up now and say enough is enough.  I mean everyone's shocked  when President Trump comes out with strong rhetoric like this.  All he's  doing is saying, \"Stop threatening us.\"  It's not like he's going on the  offense here.</p><p>But sooner or later we're going to have to do something about it because  obviously sanctions haven't worked, we cut away a third of their imports  but at the end of the day, all he does is redirect the already limited  sources going to his people back to his military complex.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You know Carl, I think all of us would love to see a diplomatic  solution but it doesn't appear that North Koreans are prone to accepting  any diplomacy.</p><p>From a military perspective, what are the options that the U.S has?  I  think a lot of Americans are saying, what could we do militarily that would  stop this?</p><p>HIGBIE:  Yes.  Well our military is the population of some small countries  out there.  So it will -- what we can do is we can park three carrier  strike groups off the Coast.</p><p>And I wrote about this in an Op-Ed this morning and next time he shoots a  missile you shoot it down.  The next time he shoots another missile, you  shoot that down, you blow up the installation that it came from and you  continue to repeat this over and over again.</p><p>And I think that Kim Jong, part of the problem is is his military leaders  are probably telling him that he is the greatest military, he can't be  defeated because they're worried about being executed themselves.  So I  think part of it is perception internally that we need to combat also with  propaganda.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Are we dealing with something similar to the Emperor of Japan  where it took an atomic bomb?  I'm not saying we nuke the place, I'm just  saying that it takes something as dramatic so that his own military people  finally say, \"This isn't going to end well.\"</p><p>HIGBIE:  Unfortunately, I think it's going to come to a show force and it  may be at the hands of our military blowing up many of their military  installations.</p><p>I hope that we don't have to take it out on the people because the people  suffer so much and I wish we could avoid a conflict but at the end of the  day, if he's threatening the United States and Guam with nuclear weapons,  we need to do something.  Sanctions and talking is not going to make any  difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- but one, because we're talking about the sanctions Carl,  does sanctions out of the U.N. even though China did vote for them, they  only caught $1 billion of the $3 billion in exports, those could have gone  further.</p><p>And \"The Wall Street Journal\" certainly in the editorial page has raised  the issue of why did China sign on with these sanctions?  Is it because  it's worried legitimately so about the United States cracking down on  Chinese firms doing business with North Korea and elsewhere?  </p><p>So there's more to be done on sanctions.  This country theoretically would  be easy to starve, no pun intended.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Right.  Well that's the thing too.  China is kind of stuck in a  rock in a hard place.  China doesn't want America to go into South -- or  into North Korea because then it would have U.S. troops in their borders.</p><p>So that's one of the things they do not want.  And also they are worried  about us sanctioning them or working against their banks and their system  but at the end of the day, it's one of those things.  </p><p>Like China has kind of let this devolved into what it is.  China can crush  them if they wanted to, they're just not willing to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So should we give up on China?  I mean is there anything else  to do in terms of China and get engaging China further?</p><p>HIGBIE:  I think we're kind of stuck in a stalemate and I think Ambassador  Nikki Hailey did a great job negotiating these sanctions.  I saw her the  other morning speaking about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGBIE:  But I think this is -- I think what's -- the first thing that's  going to happen is China's going to come back to the table and say, \"Hey,  how can we help?\"  Once we take some sort of military action whether it be  shooting down a missile or something to that effect.</p><p>I don't advocate for preemptive strike on North Korea at this time but I  think we definitely need to start shooting down their missiles because  they've made the threat, we need to assume that they are coming at one of  our targets or one of our bases or allies so we need to get rid of it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Hey Carl, it's Mike Murphy.  If they do come at one of our bases  or one of our allies, doesn't that make President Trump's job that much  easier because I don't think there's anyone out there that would say we  shouldn't defend ourselves or defend our interest.</p><p>So while it's stable rattling back and forth, people can knock President  Trump.  But once they attack us, I think we have to at that point respond,  right?</p><p>HIGBIE:  Well like the Governor said, this is -- I mean this is indicative  of the world -- the Pre-World War II, Pre-Pearl Harbor Attack.  I mean like  we were just sitting there waiting trying to avoid getting into a conflict  with them and ultimately it cost us Pearl Harbor.</p><p>So are we willing to wait that much longer?  I mean look, if the left wing  media is going to spin this as Donald Trump is a warmonger no matter what.   Whether we're attacked or whether we do preemptive strikes.</p><p>So in the eyes of the media they're not going to be happy with them but I  think this is about keeping the American people safe.  And if we can't do  that because the left wing media is so amped up at making sure that Donald  Trump is the enemy and not actually North Korea itself, I mean we need to  start doing what's in the best interest of us and (INAUDIBLE) is scared  right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's not just the left wing media though.  I mean this  morning I saw soundbytes of Chuck Schumer, of other leading democrats  basically attacking the president and saying this was irresponsible.  </p><p>And you would think that those people who've been in congress for years  even before Donald Trump entered Washington knew the threat that is North  Korea and wouldn't pile on but try to help with solutions.  Meanwhile  there's this new \"CBS\" -- yes, go ahead Carl.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Yes.  Well Maria, what was irresponsible is people like Chuck  Schumer sitting idly by, why Barrack Obama allowed them to expand the  technology to get to where we are now.  That's their fault and that was  irresponsible for them.  President Trump is reacting. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Carl, I'm confident of the fact that Donald Trump is surrounded  by some military experts, Kelly, McMaster, Mattis.  These are people who  understand not only the full capacity of the U.S. and of North Korea but  they've studied this and game this at the table over and over again.</p><p>With all due respect to Chuck Schumer which is not a lot, he has no idea  what he's doing.  This is not a political issue, this is an issue of  extraordinary sensitivity and I'm glad that he's surrounded by military  people and not just by a bunch of whiny diplomats and politicians.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Couldn't agree more Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true, they're treating it like a political issue.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well they make it about Donald Trump's language and his words  and rhetoric, whatever you want to call it and not make it about the issue  at hand.  And that is North Korea from administration to administration.</p><p>We have stepped back and allowed the Hermit Kingdom to develop and  intercontinental ballistic missile and miniaturized warheads that could  deliver a nuclear vice potential to the United States, period.  And the  fact that that is still loss on many people and government and outside of  government is mindboggling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  And to treat it as a political issue is really  so unacceptable.  Carl, good to see you.  Thanks very much for weighing in  here.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Thanks folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments obviously.  Carl Higbie  there.  Coming up, a technical issue for Southwest Airlines causes major  delays.  What you need to know before you head to the airport, that's next.</p><p>And then remembering Glen Campbell, the legendary singer famous for  combining country and pop music has died at the age of 81.  We'll take a  look at his achievements straight ahead, back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news out of China this morning, Cheryl  Casone with the details of a devastating earthquake, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So Maria, this very strong  earthquake in Southwest China has killed at least 19 people, about 250  others also injured.  Forty of those injured in serious conditions as quake  knocking out power and phone networks which is right now complicating  search efforts.  </p><p>We're also following Tropical Storm Franklin which is moving into the sea  after hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.  Forecasters are saying that  Franklin is expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it makes its  second landfall on Mexico Central Gulf Coasts.</p><p>Meanwhile here in the U.S., heavy rains caused a major flooding down in  Houston, Texas.  There's been about two dozen water rescues in the area,  look at this.  The National Weather Service has issued a flashflood watch  for the region, that will go through until this morning. </p><p>Well a technology issue causing some problems on the West Coast for  travelers flying on Southwest Airlines.  Southwest says the problem delay  about 120 flights last night.  All but seven departed after experiencing an  average delay of at least 90 minutes.</p><p>Those delays reported at Reno Tahoe International Airport, at Sacramento  also as well.  So we're following that story and the stock shares at  Southwest up 10 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well finally this morning, the world is mourning.  The loss of country  legend Glen Campbell, he lost his battle with Alzheimer's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GLEN CAMPBELL:  Like a rhinestone cowboy, riding out on a horse in a star- spangled rodeo.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well Campbell became a staple in country music history.  His  career spend 50 years.  Friends and family are remembering Campbell at an  outpouring of messages.  His long-time friend Dolly Parton Twitted this:</p><p>TEXT:  Glen Campbell was one of the greatest voices of all time.  I will  always love you, Glen.</p><p>Fellow country music singer Tim McGraw said:</p><p>TEXT: Songs, songs, songs, man in a world of good stuff, his was great.  In  a world of great stuff, his was special.</p><p>And his daughter Ashley tweeted this picture which is just -- it's a sad  picture:</p><p>TEXT:  Heartbroken, I owe him everything I am and everything I ever will  be.  He will be remembered so well and with so much love.</p><p>Glen Campbell died in Nashville yesterday.  He was surrounded by his  family, he was 81 years old Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much Cheryl.  I like that picture.  I thought that  picture said a lot actually.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Beautiful picture.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it with his hand.  Good Arkansas boy?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  Came from --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like yourself.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- Billstown, Arkansas near Delight, a suburb of Delight which  I'm sure you've never heard off.  Not far from where I grew up in Hope,  Arkansas.  Southwest Arkansas guy, wonderful family.  He was like the fifth  of twelve kids.</p><p>But his agility on the guitar was something a lot of people never  understood.  He was a studio musician with a famed Wrecking Crew.  If you  haven't seen the documentary, the Wrecking Crew by Denny Tedesco, one of  the best music documentaries I've ever witnessed and it will explain why  the music of the '60s were so amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wish all of the obituaries and in remembrance of Glen Campbell  because we were talking about it in the break mentioned the Wrecking Crew  because it really goes to his musical chops and agility.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Unbelievable guitar player.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I know that the surviving members, the Wrecking Crew  recorded some of the most famous songs coming out of California and --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Basically all the songs coming out of California.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whether it's the Beach Boys or --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Sonny and Cher.  And I know Carol Kaye we're talking about  the famous --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, greatest bases player ever.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Female bassist with the Wrecking Crew.  She has sent her  remembrance there published online.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Glen Campbell, everything thinks of him as the voice and the  singing.  He was great at that.  He had a distinctive voice.</p><p>But, again, as a musician, he was a musician's musician at the top of the  game, unbelievable on the guitar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great to hear all of that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, great man.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, how safe is  your password?  The man who wrote the rule now says he regrets his original  advice.  The new guidelines on passwords, next.</p><p>And then one restaurant is dangerously cheesy, the whacky menu items at the  new Cheetos Cafe, straight ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Does your password contain at least one capital  letter, a number, and a symbol?  Why your strong password is not really  that strong at all.  Tracee Carrasco with all the details here, Tracee.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  Yes.  The man who wrote  the go-to guide for federal agencies, universities, and large companies  looking for password, setting rules to follow now says he was wrong.</p><p>Bill Burr now retired from the National Institute of Standards and  Technology says you don't need to make up funny words, use a letter,  number, uppercase, and lowercase letter, and a special character like an  exclamation point.</p><p>He also said your password doesn't need an expiration date because all of  these rules do very little for security and don't keep the hackers away.   The NIST revised the guidelines in June and now say to use long, easy to  remember phrases.  And user should only be forced to change passwords if  there's a sign they may have been stolen.  It makes sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you know if your password is stolen?</p><p>CARRASCO:  Well first of all obviously if it doesn't work.  If you start  getting random messages like antivirus messages, if you get unwanted  browser tools, all of these show that your password may have been  compromised.</p><p>MURPHY:  Bank account is empty.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Yes.  Identity stolen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, I got hacked but the thieves were spending less than I was  on my credit card.  So I never reported it.  So why bother.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you -- this is slightly different but I think that the  efforts by financial institutions and other institution to protect your  identity, they overstepped.  I went to take out a little bit of cash from  an ATM when I was in Virginia and it wouldn't let me take the cash out  because it automatically assumed that I was -- that the card had been  stolen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That you weren't there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the card had been stolen and that the pass code had been  compromised.  That -- and it wasn't much money either, there was a few  hundred dollars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Dagen, you just didn't have any money in your account.  That's  why they didn't let you have any money.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I immediately got a call from this bank that I increasingly  despise and, again, the -- if you make any mistake -- if you put the wrong  password in a couple times you get locked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thanks for losing a ton of money from this fraud because when  money's taken out of your account by a hacker, it's not your  responsibility.  Ultimately the bank eats it so they'd rather aggravate you  then lose money on the other side.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Aggravate me and I'll be walking across the street to the bank  next door.</p><p>MURPHY:  Good point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Tracee thank you.  Tracee Carrasco there.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, Disney saying goodbye to Netflix ending  its movie distribution deal with the streaming company.  What does it mean  for the future of TV and how will Disney create its own streaming service?</p><p>Plus, some coffee lovers are going nuts over a new drink at Starbucks.   Details on the new frapuccino inspired by Mexico, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Wednesday everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, August 9th.  Your top  stories right now 6:30a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>On the brink, President Trump promising fire and fury against North Korea  if the Hermit Kingdom continues with its threat against the United States.  </p><p>The country is now responding with state media reporting it is considering  a missile strike around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S.  has a critical air force base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We woke up to the media reports of North Korea's talk  of revenge on the United States and the so-called new found technology that  allows them to target Guam and attack or threat on Guam is a threat or  attack on the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The news putting global markets on edge.  In Asia overnight,  declines across the board as you can see, the Nikkei in Japan and the Kospi  in Korea, the worst performers.  In Europe this morning, markets are under  pressure there as well, taking a cue from Asia.  </p><p>The European indices are down between three-quarters of one percent and  almost two percent in Paris, and in the U.S. futures indicating a lower  opening for the broader averages as you can see.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average down a fraction with the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ down a round and a  half a percent of piece.  An arrest made in the shooting death of the  Missouri police officer.  </p><p>The very latest says the suspect has taken into custody, following a  manhunt that lasted several days.  And new details this morning, in Taylor  Swift's case, against the former radio DJ, why he's coming under fire for  changing his story.  Disney cuts the cord and its deal with Netflix, why  Mickey and Company are planning to launch their own streaming services and  not give any films to Netflix.  </p><p>Talk about perfectly cooked.  How you can now get your luxury meal covered  in Cheetos.  And next step, Super Bowl.  The details, as the New England  Patriots become the first NFL team with its own plane, all that coming up  this morning.  And our top story first this half an hour, earnings and  focus on Wall Street this morning.  </p><p>The parent company of the Fox Business Network 21st Century Fox set to  report after the bell tonight, while Kohl's, Macy's and Snap, among the  names due out tomorrow.  Disney beat earnings expectations last night while  missing on revenue.  The big story was the company's bombshell streaming  reveal to combat its cable woes.  </p><p>The company is one working on two new services, one for ESPN Sports  Programming and another for its movies and TV shows, which means Disney is  pulling its content from Netflix to start its own streaming service.  The  announcement a huge blow to the streaming giant which is down, Netflix this  morning, down almost four percent in the pre-market.  </p><p>The news quickly overshadowed Netflix a surprise deal for a talk show with  late night legend, David Letterman.  Joining us right now is, Alpine Funds  Portfolio Manager, Sarah Hunt.  And Sarah, the race to the stringing  supremacies certainly heating up, I know you own technology, do you also  own Netflix and some of the streaming in media or Disney?</p><p>SARAH HUNT, MANAGER, ALPINE FUNDS PORTFOLIO:  So, we're dividend players,  so a lot of those companies are not paying dividends right now.  So, we  would own something like an Apple, which says they (INAUDIBLE) Microsoft  but we wouldn't own something like a Netflix here.  </p><p>And I think that this just shows you also the tension between, is the  content -- who is going to be in charge of what's going to happen and I  think that this is a big -- when I saw these numbers last night, and when I  saw the announcement from Disney, I thought, this is going to be  interesting because Netflix is one of those companies that's held up very  well.  So let's see how that goes on the back of this, and whether or not  other people think about following suit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the broader markets?  What do you think?</p><p>HUNT:  I think, what it appears, where we've had some really nice earnings  for Q2, right?  The first half of this year has been really good relative  to the last couple of years where you had barely, stagnant earnings.  So, I  think, that's been very supportive.  </p><p>But I also think that the market is expecting a lot of things to happen on  the political front and the question of whether or not they are going to  happen, becomes one that becomes more and more important as we get through  the balance of this year.  </p><p>I also think as we enter into the second half of the year, let's see if we  -- what people start saying about next year.  And I think that there is  some concern that valuations are at pretty high level and so, therefore,  you have to see continued growth or some changes on the other economic  fronts.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  I agree with you on the  growth front, that we need growth to keep crisis where they are.  But, I  would kind of disagree on the political front.  I think where we are right  now the market is supported up here at these levels by the earnings growth  we have seen.  </p><p>I think if you get something out of Washington would actually be a next leg  higher in the market, because I don't really see it being priced in here.   I think the numbers can't support it.  But then when you see a company like  Disney that misses on numbers, the market is going to punish that stock and  that's what you're seeing this morning.</p><p>HUNT:  We have also seen -- there was an interesting report yesterday that  talked a lot about how companies are reacting to positive surprises and  that they're not reacting as well the positive surprises that they have in  the last couple of years.  And that might also tell you that there's a  little bit of push to what do I get to that next increment?  So maybe  that's that, but I also think that people started build in some numbers  into '18 on tax reform that may have to come out.  We will see how that  goes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  If you're looking now, if you  think this market is overvalued or a lot of the really popular stocks are  overvalued, and you're looking for ballast, you're looking for something to  offset the risk in your equity portfolio, can you really put money in  treasuries at this point, if you look at the yield on the 10-year treasury,  it's below 2.3 percent, those are also rich and theoretically, if you had  both markets go the wrong way on you, that's all she wrote.</p><p>HUNT:  Yes, and you probably have more risk in Treasuries if they go  against you because the change in interest rates because they're so -- the  rates are so low now.  It's probably more problematic on price.  I think  that a lot of the stocks underneath the big tech names and some of the big  stocks in the averages have actually gotten.  </p><p>You've seen a lot of stocks actually come down in the last six months on  the retail side, on energy, there have been places where there is room.   Now, there's also some threats there which is why those stocks have gotten  cheaper.  But I think there are places to look in the defense stocks while  they are expensive, if you look at what's going on right now, I think that  there's some places there that you can look.  </p><p>And it's the same problem that everyone has had for the last couple of  years.  Where do you put your money?  Where you've driven interest rates  low across not only the U.S., but international, it's even worse.  You get  negative rates across parts of Europe, so that's even harder for people  looking to put money to work.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Sarah, let me just ask this,  if Congress were to actually get tax reform done, does that super charge  the market in all the sectors?  Does that really make that kind of  difference?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think, for sure, it does, Governor, if I could weigh in on that,  because that gives all companies a tax break, it gives more companies  increased earnings, just balance sheets will look better from that.  Now,  you have seen in this market the reason why at all-time highs, is that  you're seeing rotations.  </p><p>When people sell energy or they sell retail, they are putting that money in  large cap tech, or they are putting that money in the financials, in the  banks.  So I think, money would come off the side lines, new money would  come into the market if that were to happen.  I'd think that would push the  market higher.</p><p>HUNT:  I think it would definitely help.  I mean, you're definitely --  there's a lot of companies that have a lot of sales overseas.  So the  companies that would benefit the most are the ones that are primarily U.S.- based because that's where their taxes are going to get better the most.   If you could bring some of the money back from overseas, I think there's a  lot of cash dropped over there.  </p><p>There's been a lot of discussions about that back and forth about whether  or not, how to bring that back and what do you do with it and do you put  parameters around what you do with it.  Because I think, that we're still  looking for capital spending and that still been a sub par version of the  kind of growth that we're looking for in the economic front that's absent  what the government can do.  </p><p>So, if you could bring some of that money back or free up more money from a  tax perspective, maybe that's something that starts to kick-start other  parts of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Businesses have been sitting on cash because of the regulatory  environment largely.  But, let me ask you about North Korea, how much of a  focus is this for the market?  Yesterday, it felt like the market did  react, was that what it was reacting to yesterday in your view?</p><p>HUNT:  It felt like it was reacting but it was still a fairly moderate  reaction.  Even the Kospi, which you would think of all the places where  you would see a bigger --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of a wild card does this represent for markets?</p><p>HUNT:  I think the market has seen so many different wild cards in the last  year or two that it's very -- it needs to see something that feels more  like, other than rhetoric for it to be more of an impact, but I also think  you're getting out of earning season.  </p><p>So from a catalyst standpoint, you've taken that off the table.  So maybe  August, which can be a tough month anyway from a volume perspective, is  trickier to react to things because you have less trading going on and so,  therefore, you might see a bigger reaction.  But so far, I wouldn't say  that this is a huge reaction thus far.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you want safety in your portfolio, erase the issue of 10-year  treasuries, want a little bit of security, less risk, what do you buy at  this point?  Because you have vast numbers of asset classes that look  expensive, not wildly overvalued.</p><p>HUNT:  So we're (INAUDIBLE) stock mutual funds that basically on dividends.   So we would look for higher dividend stocks in places where you may have  seen some corrections already.  You know, MBP, something like that, but I  agree with you, I think it's very difficult and I think that that's part of  the problem.  </p><p>And if you look at credit spreads, they have gotten incredibly tight, which  is telling you, you know, how yield has been chased down both in the U.S.  and in Europe, in Europe, it's even worse.  The high yields spread over  governments, because governments in some cases are almost nothing  negligible or negative.  </p><p>So I think that it is a really challenging period of time and to be putting  together a portfolio if you're an insurance company or somebody else who is  trying to then work out pensions later, is a very big challenge in this  environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you get a sense of the rest of the year from what you just  heard in the second-quarter earnings reports, second quarter profits up 11  percent or so, revenue up 6 percent or so.  What about the rest of the  year, did you get a sense of their guidance?</p><p>HUNT:  I would say that it was pretty positive, although what was  interesting is, a lot of people who had beats in the second quarter, didn't  want to raise full year guidance.  So that's telling you that maybe the  back half of the year isn't as strong or they would rather be cautious and  let themselves be in a position where they can beat earnings again, because  what also happens --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they want to see what's going to come out of Washington.</p><p>HUNT:  Right.  And what also happens is that the analysts take numbers down  in the middle of the quarter, for next quarter and they end up coming back  up in the -- there's a lot of gaming that goes on in that respect.  But I  would say that they are --I didn't hear a lot of very cautionary second- half statements.  I heard more, you know, we are doing pretty well and  we're pretty optimistic about the next few months.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the executives are talking less about President Trump on --  at least, early analysis of all the conference calls.  You just heard less  discussion about Washington and about President Trump, so they are sticking  to their knitting, so to speak.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Which is a good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Four billion dollars in assets under management, are you fully  invested?</p><p>HUNT:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Sarah, great to see you.</p><p>HUNT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Sarah Hunt, there.   Coming up, police arrest the suspect who allegedly reportedly shot and  killed the cop in Missouri.  The details on what lead to that capture,  next.  And then, Taylor Swift's going to court after she claims that  Colorado DJ groped her.  The opening statement for her lawyer made, coming  up, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, futures indicating a lower opening for the  broader averages, take a look, Dow Industrial set to open down about 30  points, NASDAQ also down 30 points, that's one-half of one percent.  We are  looking at a few names on the move, Priceline is one to watch.  The stock  is falling following the company's latest earnings release.  </p><p>Earnings of $15.14 a share, topped expectations but the stock has been  weighed down by weak guidance for the third quarter.  The shares are down  better than seven percent right now.  We're watching Office Depot this  morning, set to report its second quarter earnings before the bell this  morning.  Analysts are expecting earnings of $0.08 a share.  </p><p>Shares of Office Depot are up better than 70 percent in the last year,  good-looking chart there.  A manhunt in Missouri for a police officer is  over, police officer killer.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  So, Maria, a suspect  wanted in the fatal shooting of a Missouri police officer over the weekend  was arrested last night.  Ian McCarthy had been on the run for nearly two  days.  He was arrested for shooting Officer Gary Michael that happened  after a traffic stop, Sunday night.  McCarthy has been charged with first- degree murder.  </p><p>Well, a former DJ denies ever touching Taylor Swift's backside on the  opening day of, we call it the groping trial.  David Mueller testifying he  may have touched Swift's rib cage or a rib, she says otherwise.  He's  seeking at least $3 million.  He's accusing the singer of getting him  fired.  Courtroom sketches show the pop star sitting not far from Mueller  yesterday.  Swift's lawyers saying the evidence of the assault is  overwhelming.  </p><p>Well, Starbucks launching a drink that's (INAUDIBLE) it's rooted in Mexico.   It's called the Horchata, it's almond milk Frappuccino, that's basically  what it is.  It's a blend of Almond milk, cinnamon syrup, coffee, yes,  whipped cream, caramel, and then cinnamon and sugars on top.  I'll be  checking that out at participating locations here in New York.  Anyway, you  can get it in the U.S. and Canada for extra, folks.  Here is the stock.   It's under pressure in the premarket just slightly, 54.04.  </p><p>And then finally, let's proceed on the food thing, Cheetos fans are going  to be in heaven over the next week, three days to be specifically.  A  Cheetos-themed restaurant is going to open in New York City between August  15th and 17th.  The menu for the Cheetos pop-up restaurant designed Anne  Burrell from the Food Network.  There she is, her hair and all.  I love  Anne Burrell.  Cheetos tacos, Cheetos fried pickles, Maria, Cheetos  cheesecake.  I know you're interested, maybe not.  Anyway, random offerings  of Cheetos.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Good news.  Dagen, do you like that, Cheetos?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On occasion.  It's like one of those ribs and things.  You just  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On Occasion.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They would like you just, you know, sitting in the airport and  then all of a sudden, it's like, whoa!  You get hit with that wave of  needing some Cheetos.  Horchata is delicious.  If you go into authentic  Mexican restaurants here in the United States, they will serve it.  I think  it's usually made from rice milk rather than almond milk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like the almond milk idea.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's just one more thing to slow down things at Starbucks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're hyper sweet, by the way.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  For those of us who just want a stinking cup of coffee, we've  got to stand behind these people who are asking for things that are more  complicated than the formula for a nuclear weapon.</p><p>MURPHY:  And it's amazing.  As the country goes to healthier options,  Starbucks puts these drinks out that have thousands of calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A horchata is extremely, extremely sweet.  And I haven't tasted  this one, but the traditional horchata is.</p><p>MURPHY:  You don't need a doughnut to dunk in there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's exactly right.</p><p>MURPHY:  It was the doughnut inside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Drinking your doughnuts.  Now, get this -- I mean, seriously,  look at the calorie content, it's just as --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how do they keep turning out these products and people are  buying them even in this new era of --</p><p>MURPHY:  I will tell you.  Millennials, children, even teenagers, are going  to Starbucks.  They'll spend $4.00 or $5.00 for a Frappuccino and mixed  whipped thing.  And Starbucks has a secret menu that's not posted and kids  access that on their phones, and they love it.  I can speak to that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's elitism.  Elitism and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, their parents will say no, no, you're not going to  Starbucks.  You're going to drink water and like it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up, it is not a bird, it is the new Patriots  plane.  A behind-the-scenes look at the two, yes, two Boeing jets the  football team just purchased.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now this, you're out, Major League Baseball has suspended  one of the most experienced umpires.  Jared Max with the details here.   Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Joe  West has been a Major League ump since 1976.  He's not 64 year's old and  he's become a baseball celebrity of sorts, as we saw at the all-star game  last month.  Remember this when Nelson Cruz asked for a photo with West  just after he stepped to the plate.  Everyone loves country Joe West,  right?  Wrong.  </p><p>West has been suspended three games without pay by Major League Baseball  because when asked by USA Today last month, who's the biggest complainer in  the game?  Joe West said, it's got to be Adrian Beltre.  Every pitch you  call that's a strike, he says, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\"  I had a game with him  recently and the pitch was right down the middle.  He tells me, \"That ball  is outside.  I told him, \"You may be a great baseball player, but you're  the worst umpire in the league.  You stink.\"  Suspended three games without  pay.</p><p>Is there a way to make football a safer sport?  A Seattle-based sports  equipment company called VICIS has created a new helmet called \"Zero1\".   The helmet's outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, it yields when it's  hit and slows impact forces.  A second layer, reflex layer of columns that  bend and eventually buckle upon impact.  A third layer, a very thin hard  shell that protects against skull fractures.  And the fourth innermost  layer is the form layer which conforms to the player's head.  Now, the co- founder of the company, Dave Marver, says Zero1 makes a thump noise on  impact, not a crack.  He says the sound of the game is going to change.   Interestingly, I was told yesterday by forensic pathologists Dr. Bennett  Omalu who Will Smith portrayed in the movie, Concussion, \"Helmets prevent  only catastrophic injuries that could cause sudden and unexpected death on  the field.  </p><p>Off the field, August 23rd, on the streets of New York City, 5:00 p.m. at  the heart of rush hour, a protest rally has been planned to take place  outside the NFL League offices on Park Avenue in honor of Colin Kaepernick  because he's still unemployed.  While filmmaker Spike Lee tweeted this  poster for the event yesterday, Spike Lee later clarified on Twitter that  he is not the one in charge of this protest that will take place, again,  outside the NFL League offices of the 23rd.  Right --- again, right in 5:00  p.m.  That ought to be fun to stay on the east side at that point of the  day.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That would really (INAUDIBLE) and influence people, won't it?   Absolutely.</p><p>MAX:  Last night, I got to attend an event, former New York Giant, George  Martin, spent 14 years with the team, walked 3,000 miles across the country  to raise money for first responders for 9/11, spoke about his time going  across the country as an African-American from the deep south.  He was  concerned I might run into trouble somewhere along the way and he stressed  that what he saw is how much more that we are the same than divided.  And  that really rang true to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  And if you're going live in this country to not stand  for our national anthem, you know, I have a problem with it.  And if I  owned the team, I wouldn't want someone to express their views like that,  so I think a team owner has the right to not bring in Colin Kaepernick.   So, when he protest that, I will avoid at all cost.</p><p>MAX:  And like I still believe that I don't think he wants to play in the  NFL.  When you look at the comments that he has made, why would -- you  know, you're talking about calling owners, slave owners, does he really  want to work in this league for anything, and why did he opt out of his  contract with the 49ers.  He could be signed up right now playing and he's  not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Meanwhile, my favorite story of sports this  morning is about what the New England Patriots are doing.  They bought two  new huge planes, Boeing 767.  The team will be first in the NFL to have its  own planes rather than charter them.</p><p>MAX:  That's so cool.  It's great.  Well, it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Leave it to Bob Crest.</p><p>MAX:  A great reward for that Super Bowl 51 comeback.  It'll have all the  designs, the Super Bowl Trophies, the Lombardi Trophies.  Every seat on the  flight is a first-class seat, and some recline all the way and it will help  the players recover from the games.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  But there's one big problem, Jared.  You know, the reports  are that the plane will not be pressurized, they're going to keep the  planes deflated as they fly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAX:  I knew something was coming.  I knew it was coming.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, god.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  They have a soft landing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A very good one.  That's a very good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why don't more teams -- why don't they already own their  aircraft before now?</p><p>MAX:  Somebody -- that's like somebody said before the New York Yankees  started the YES Network, why don't more teams have their own networks, they  can control a lot more revenue and I get --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All the NASCAR drivers for the most part, at the top tour of the  series, they have their own private jets, and they fly -- they lease some  of them very often, but they fly to the racetracks on the weekend to these  -- in these small private aircrafts where there's a gulf stream.</p><p>MAX:  Right.  Golfers, too, get crazy like that.</p><p>MURPHY:  I would like to see a lot more of this now, Patriots did it, now,  I think you'll see more and more teams.</p><p>MAX:  It would have made sense if it'd be the Jets, but, you know, they're  the Jets.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared.  Thank you, Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports  reports in Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Still to come, researchers make a gigantic discovery.

European indices look like  it's sharply lower.  FT-100, down a one percent.  CAC Quarante down almost  two percent and the DAX Index down better than two percent.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have a deal, lawmakers avoided a government shutdown passing a massive  $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning.  We are breaking down those  numbers as it heads to the President's desk now.  McMaster is out, Bolton  is in, more changes coming to the White House as President Trump announces  he will replace National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to former U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not the only the change, the details as the President's top lawyer in the  Russia probe resigns.  </p><p>And tragedy in New York City to report, a firefighter killed after a fire  breaks out on the set of an Edward Norton movie in Harlem, more on the  devastating fire alarm blaze coming up.</p><p>And then a bump to the bank account, United Airlines delivering a massive  cheque to give one passenger to give up her seat, the first-class pay day,  coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to talk  all about it, FOX News Business Network, Dagen McDowell.  The King's  College Business and Economic, Professor Brian Brenberg and Kadina Groups  President, Gary B. Smith is here.  Good to see you, Gary.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUPS:  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On a day that we are expecting this market to completely roll  over.  Good morning Brian and Dagen.  </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning, good to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  My last thought yesterday at the end of this  program was markets look out below.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's what she said.  That was your final  comment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it was.  Because, again, it's not just the beginnings of a  trade war with China.  It is not the upset, but it's the fact that you have  Congress passing the spending bill, we're running up deficits, we're  running up our national debt, which gives us less power to fight.</p><p>SMITH:  You sound so bearish, Dagen.  Are you thinking the market's going  down?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the cost of our debt is going up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got the Fed -- the Fed raising rates, reducing its  balance sheet, you have a Congress that has no understanding of fiscal  responsibility at the same time we try to take on China, the largest owner,  foreign owner of our national debt, doesn't add up.</p><p>SMITH:  And yet, I will tell you one thing, I am optimistic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get down or up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the back cracking on the economy, what are you most bullish  on?</p><p>SMITH:  Bullish on -- bullish on the market, not right now, not today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  Bullish on the economy, I'm bullish, I think Trump is basically  getting it right and we we're going to talk more about this whole tariffs  thing.  I think, I am optimistic right now.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Well it's certainly not unexpected, right?  And he'd been  talking about this, and talking at this maybe came later than people  thought at but it was going to come.  </p><p>SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the uncertainty to all of this, the trade story is exactly  what people were worried about going into the election.  Remember when the  market was down 700 points on election night it was because of uncertainty  around NAFTA, what will Donald Trump do.  And this is what we're seeing  right here.  Coming up this morning joining the conversation, Florida  Congressman and House Freedom Caucus Member, Ron DeSantis is with us.  </p><p>Remember the (INAUDIBLE) -- Caucus was among the first to say, we're not in  on this bill, former FDIC Chairman and founder a Systemic Risk Council,  Sheila Bair is with us this morning.  Then the author of The Coming  Collapse Of China, Gordon Chang will weigh in along with the CEO of  Deloitte Cathy Engelbert is here.  Plus elevation partner, cofounder,  managing director and investor and Mark Zuckerberg's mentor, Roger McNamee,  one of the leader shareholders in Facebook for some time.  We're going to  talk with Roger about what took place on Facebook and this market this  week.  </p><p>But first, we want to kick it off right now, with the trade war hitting  global markets, stocks across Asia tumbled, following directions from Wall  Street.  Take a look at the numbers here, of course we know that all the  majors in Asia were down between three and 4.5 percent.  Japan being the  worst down 4.5 percent.  </p><p>Back in the U.S., the Dow closed down more than 700 points yesterday after  President Trump proposed tariffs of up to $60 billion on imports from China  along with tighter restrictions on the country's acquisition and technology  transfers, It was in response to what the administration is calling China's  unfair trading practices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing things for this  country that should've been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States and we don't want  that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  I t's probably one of  the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hours later the Chinese government fired back saying that it  plans to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on U.S.  goods in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum which go into effect  today.  The U.S. now says some allies including Canada, Mexico and the E.U.  among others will get a brief exemption from the tariffs.  Joining us right  now to talk more about that is Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York, a  former small business owner, congresswoman good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  And I know you're back on a lot to talk about small  business and about lending money get into that.  But first, let's talk  about these tariffs, good idea or are you against?</p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  I tend to be more on Gary's side.  Gary  B's got the idea.  I think, the terms on to something, I did a Pentagon  article last year 2016 about the problem we have with China.  That was the  tariffs hacking, what's happening overall in terms of currency.  All this  things affects small businesses.  I'm a small business owner in upstate New  York.  And put together with the -- all the things that China's doing, I  mean, we're trying to move in a direction that we're kind of correct,  trying to correct this, I think, that's what you're seeing in the market, I  hoping that's a correction, I hope Dagen's dire prediction here is not  true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say about the fact that China is coming back now  and saying, really, we're going to tariff you?  And so now we are looking  at a serious retaliatory story.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Yes, I think it's stupid, I mean, Kim Jong-un also reacted to  President Trump, to some strong language.  But think about what's happening  here tough, China actually has the biggest marketplace in the world that  you want to have access to, and that's the United States.  We are where the  consumers are and so, they want to get access to us too.  So, that's  something that they've got to weigh in to the negotiation.  They're  business model I think is flawed in the end.  We know that they've set up  these state-run businesses that -- and that's how they operate.  I mean,  much like what's done in New York State under our current governor, but we  know that that kind of cronie is in that kind of set up of state-run  businesses in the long run doesn't work which is why I tend to favor that  we've got to do something now, how long are we going wait?  How long are we  going to let China cheat?  How long are we going, you know, steeling our  intellectual property from our steel companies and others and I think  that's what Wilbur Ross and the President are recognizing and something has  to be done and maybe this is a very short-term pain that may end up being,  you know, long-term gain for us.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  What about the uncertainty this creates for small businesses?   You are small business owners, you understand they're trying to make plans,  now they're saying, you know, which of this 1300 products is going to be  hit by a tariff, how big is the tariff?  That's very hard for a small shop  to deal with, is that a big concern here or do you think that's very, very  temporary?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Prices will go up.</p><p>TENNEY:  Right, it is a concern especially for the smaller businesses.  We  have some of the small business in area.  We have a company called share  manufacturing which took over the older night limited which went under and  went to Asia where there's manufacturing, they're dependent on purchasing  steel as well, but I also have another number of companies in my district  that also are steel companies and they like to see a little bit of help.   And, they're use to buy older steel from American based companies and now  they're buying it from overseas.  I do think we need -- we're going to see  an adjustment in the market, but I think making tariffs in more targeted  way, using currency, looking at the tax reform is something that's going to  be helpful to us in the long run, especially, this past through businesses.   In my region which is the order of the day, we do know they produce most of  the jobs.  This is the only way you're going to bring the Rust Belt back, I  lived in the Rust Belt of New York.</p><p>SMITH:  Well Congresswoman you bring up a very interesting point and I  think some people ignore it.  We're a China's biggest buyer --</p><p>TENNEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>SMITH:  -- by almost 4-1.  How can you have a trade war, an active trade  war with your biggest buyer?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they already have a $375 billion surplus on us.  Where are  the 375 billion  deficit?  So, are they going to threaten that huge surplus  with these tariffs? </p><p>SMITH:  It'd be like 3M selling tape to Wal-Mart, having a trade war with  Wal-Mart.  You know, they buy a lot more tape than Wal-Mart buys from 3M,  so it would be silly, wouldn't it?</p><p>TENNEY:  I agree with you.  It's -- we are the market place.  Where are  they going to sell goods and services, they create this enormous state- owned businesses, this big plants and companies, fancy new equipment.  And  then they say, come in and we'll run these for you.  Remember, people that  move to China, they don't own their businesses, they're owned by the state.   And so people have to recognize that this isn't a situation where you have,  you know, you have this actual free market going on.  You have government  run the industries against a supposed free market enter the United States  that we something we're trying to get back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All true but they are still out this morning saying that  they're going to put this retaliatory tariffs in place.  Look, we've got to  talk about this $1.3 trillion spending bill, congresswoman.  You averted a  shutdown and of course, looking to a $1.3 trillion spending package,  deliver to the President's steps now.  It includes defense as well as  domestic spending, the measure is headed to the President's desk for  signature but a lot of pushback here, you voted yes.</p><p>TENNEY:  I did and it was a very hard vote.  I'm a fiscal conservative.  I  hate the fact that we're spending, I don't like the fact that we're  dependent in all of this deafen deficit.  We tried to get this done through  our American Health Care Act.  Remember, we had significant reforms to the  mandatory spending side.  We didn't get that done.  We got a thumbs down  vote from one person in the Senate, that prevented us from getting to that  mandatory spending side, which is so large with the eclipse is what we do  in the discretionary side.  But that being said, we have a short-term fix,  it's ugly, they called it the big ugly when I was in New York States,  somebody when a woman I would call it the big ugly now. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why can't you just say no -- why can't you just say no to the  Democrats that want all the spending?  </p><p>TENNEY:  To be honest, I would love to say no, the President actually  supported this.  My biggest concern and my son is an active duty Marine  Officer who's -- who has indicated to me and we have met with General  Mattis and numerous people on that side, we have seriously degraded our  military over the years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Agreed.</p><p>TENNEY:  And that is being held as a big club to us and when you see more  of our good servicemen and women are hardworking, honourably serving  people, die in training than in combat.  There is a problem with what we're  doing in our military side and General Mattis has said, the only thing more  dangerous than our most dangerous enemies is Congress.  And we need to act  and we needed to do something with our military.  Sadly it came at a price.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  80 billion in defense spending increase above the 2011 sequester  levels, 63 billion increase in domestic spending, the issue is because now  Congress, Republicans and Democrats have signed off on higher spending  levels, we now get into the trillion dollar annual budget deficits.  What  that ultimately will do given the $21 trillion that we have in debt  already.  We're going to be spending more on interest on our debt in less  than a decade in just a matter of years than we spend on our military.  So,  this might be a short-term fix for the spending in our military and those  who are serving this country.  However, we put that very spending and put  our safety in jeopardy because we can't rein in our spending.  That is the  catch --</p><p>TENNEY:  But I think we can reign on our spending.  Let me -- let me -- let  me understand, we do not have 51 reliable votes in the Senate.  OK, we  don't -- forget 60, we don't have 51 reliable votes.  We proved that in our  attempt to pass the American Health Care act through reconciliation.  A lot  of this things --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right and you got a big this --</p><p>TENNEY:  Right, a lot of the things we could fix, we could do on regulate  order if we had enough votes, even a simple majority I would advocate to  the Senate to go back to the simple majority.  We don't have 51 reliable  votes and think about this, in my district alone, we once had an Air Force  base that was closed.  We now have one of the most significant assets,  that's called Roam Labs, this asset is producing cutting-edge technology  for the future of our military conflicts.  Will create efficiencies, will  make us able to be deal with the ace of symmetrical enemies that we face  now.  So, it's really important that some of things happened.  </p><p>They also produced a lot of jobs in my region which have been lost.  I have  some of the largest at migration in the state of New York in the country.   And so, these are companies that are, you know, companies that are also  part of the former Air Force base, companies that are dependent, that our  military has depended on for many of our technologies.  So advocated for  those for me to turn around and say, I'm advocating for these in  appropriation side, and to say, by the way, I'm not going to vote for it  because I don't like what happened on the domestic side because we had to  meet the needs of what?  The Democrats.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The irony is though, the Republicans are now at even greater  risk of losing the majority in the House and the Senate because of the  tariffs and the retaliation from China.  If you look at hawk-producing  states and soy bean producers, those dairy farmers because of the  retaliation by China and the U.S. actions are going to get smacked on the  face and those are the very areas of this country that Trump won.  These  are the states like Iowa that sent him over the top in terms of Electoral  College.</p><p>TENNEY:  There were technical corrections though in the appropriation  process in some of this issues that were in the tax bill that would help us  some of the trade and somebody issues in there.  We still need to revisit  NAFTA, we still need to revisit all this trade deals and even I think I  knew on unilateral basis.  I don't think -- Trump what he say, (INAUDIBLE)  the word of the day reciprocal trade now, we've gone from free fair to  reciprocal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, China's calling it retaliatory.  Real quick on John  Bolton, H.R. out, Bolton in, your thoughts.</p><p>TENNEY:  Yes, you know, I like John Bolton, I think it's -- I just think  it's interesting that the President's choices and let's see how that works  out but I think John is very strong person, I think he's going to be an  interesting to see the strong personalities in the White House.  Although  we've had a number of them in the past, we'll see where they end up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Claudia, thanks very much, great to see you.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Thank you, great to see you too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Practical approach from Claudia Tenney joining us there.   Breaking news right now, the President is tweeting this morning, here's  what he says: House Intelligence Committee voting to release final report,  the finding: One: no evidence provided of collusion between Trump campaign  and Russia, number two: the Obama administrations post-election response  was insufficient and three: Clapper, inconsistent, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's going to be another tough day at the office as we've  been saying.  Look at the Dow Industrials down 150 points right now, on top  of the 700 plus selloff yesterday.  We are watching markets this morning,  NASDAQ down 60.  </p><p>Meanwhile a tragic night in New York, a city firefighter killed in a raging  five-alarm fire in a Harlem film set.  Lauren Simonetti, with the details  and headlines.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, fatal fire, Maria.  Flames broke  out last night in a, you know, in a movie set in the basement of closed  club, firefighter Michael Davidson, Engine Company first to arrive, rushed  to the basement of the club but officials say once they got down there, the  fire was too strong, it forced them to retreat, Davidson somehow got  separated from the other firefighters and when they found him, he was  unconscious and could not be revived.  He's 37 year's old and leaves behind  his wife and four young children.  </p><p>Well, liquidation sales at Toys \"R\" Us they are set to start today, the  company apologizing for what it calls unforeseen circumstances.  They were  expected to begin yesterday, push back to today.  Toys \"R\" Us it's lasting  prices as it prepares to close about 800 U.S. stores.  And a sad note, Toys  \"R\" Us founder, Charles Lazarus died yesterday, he was 94 year's old.</p><p>And this, a woman bumped from a United Airlines flight gets a $10,000  travel voucher.  This after she launched a pretty angry Tweet storm after  the airline oversold the flight and asked her specifically to get off the  plane because she paid the least for her ticket out of everyone else on  board.  One of her Tweets said, United tried to get me to sign a document  that says I volunteered my seat on this plane when I was involuntarily  denied boarding.  But now she says after that voucher, it was the best  place ever.  $10,000, you can go to a lot of places.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess yes, thank you Lauren.  Coming up thousands of students  from across the country will march in Washington against gun violence in  the wake of the Parkland massacre.  One of the shooting survivors will tell  us why he's not attending.</p><p>And then a bright spot amid the rough week, the technology stocks as  Dropbox debuts on the Nasdaq with a higher than expected share price.   We'll see what happens to the stock at the opening in a down market, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, investors' concerns over possible trade war  rocking Wall Street today and yesterday Futures currently indicating a  decline at the start of trading of 160 points.  That's two-thirds of one  percent.  Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 also down one percent and 1/2 of a percent.   It's coming after its sharp selloff yesterday, the Dow was down better than  700 points yesterday.  It was the biggest one-day percentage decline since  early February.  Joining us right now to weigh in, is a Chief Investor  Strategist for CFRA research, Sam Stovall.  Sam, good to see you.  Thanks  for joining us.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTOR STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, happy to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're talking about a backdrop which is pretty positive.   How do you see these markets here?</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, this is the correction that people that have been talking  about.  And actually, I believe it's more of the retest of the correction  that had bottomed in February 8th.  Maybe we go and we touch the rising 200  day moving average which is around 25-85, so there's probably further  downside to go but at the same time, I remind investors that we're down  less than eight percent from the January 26 high, and so, therefore, the  numbers look large but on a percentage basis, it's actually a run of the  mill kind of decline. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not as worried.  Gary B., you just said the same  thing?  (INAUDIBLE) optimistic.</p><p>SMITH: I'm optimistic, here's the only, not the only, maybe one of the  flies (INAUDIBLE) the fang stocks that pretty much been leading, carrying  the market on their shoulders.  We've seen a little bit of, you know,  correction -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or a lot, 10 percent down on Facebook.  Facebook down 10  percent --</p><p>SMITH:  What are the future -- yes, what's the future of those stocks, do  you think?</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, I still think that the future looks pretty good.  We  actually are technology set to group heads, Scott Kessler upgraded Facebook  to a strong buy, feeling that this is being overdone and that there is more  opportunity there.  If you look to those groups that are trading above  their ten week, 50 day moving averages, still, you do have the internet  stocks above that moving average, so Netflix looking at Amazon are still  doing relatively well.  </p><p>SMITH:  What's the next -- I think, everyone wants to know, what's the next  fang stock?  We got those, what's going to be the next one?  That's what we  want to buy, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The CISCO's of the world are not trading the way Facebook is in  terms of valuation, I'm just saying, it's a --</p><p>STOVALL:  Exactly.  And also the semiconductor, semiconductor equipment,  application software, those groups are trading above their 50 day --</p><p>SMITH:  No, no, what I want to know, I want to know what is going to be,  we're going to look five years from now, I wish I had bought that stock.   You can't say Amazon or Netflix.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, thanks for the opportunity to do this research ahead of  time. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We all want that answer.  On the near term, you're expecting  for the decline, for longer term you sound like you're still pretty bullish  on this market?</p><p>STOVALL:  Yes, I do.  I don't think Trump wants to go down as the next  Republican President to initiate a recession even though every single one  since Teddy Roosevelt had one occur in the first two years in office.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right. </p><p>STOVALL:  So, I don't think he wants to continue that tradition.</p><p>BRENBERG:  So, does the trade spat here and quickly? </p><p>STOVALL:  I think that similar to what we have seen with the tariffs on  aluminum and steel that were broad base to begin with, now we have special  exemptions for our favorable trading partners.  I think, that this still  looks like it's more of a negotiation ploy that could then be softened as  we move forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By coming from a businessman that's a wrench in to people who do  business in this country through used steel and aluminum.  Because they're  sitting around the last several weeks.  So, how much is my steel going to  cost?  I source it from these countries, are they going to be exempt,  calling people on the phone, going, can you give us some clarity on this  and it's still not that clear.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, you're going to see a real-life example in a couple of  minutes because I was chatting with your next guest in the green room and  he has challenges because of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you for that tease.  We really appreciate that.</p><p>STOVALL:  No charge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And coming up, Sir Sam Stovall, good to see you.  Thank you so  much, what a week it's been.  We've had a great show here following all the  ups and downs out of Washington, take a look at some of the top moments  from this program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that any of this growth story which obviously is a  big reason coming from the tax plan is going to get impacted by this  tariffs?</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA:  Yes, we are growing, we don't want to  harm or slow it down but I also think, we have to stand up to China what  they've been doing.  As the President stands up to China, China realizes  they've done something wrong and now they're finally standing up to North  Korea, they realize, there's a new sheriff in town and the world's going to  be a little different in this administration.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  All we want is  to defend ourselves against economic aggression and I see this as bullish  for corporate America.  China is doing a lot better with this trade  relationship than we are.  I don't see them wanting to jeopardize that.   They know -- they know what they've been doing and taking from us and  actually they're probably surprised that finally a President is willing to  stand up for the American people and for American companies.</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH:  I don't agree with Mr. Navarro.  I don't think  that he's living in the real world.  This other countries are not going to  put up with it.  It's -- I think it's ridiculous between you and me.  I  expect to push back from China.  I don't think there's any question about  that.  But the question is, are we in a position economically to really  fight them?</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, TALK RADIO HOST:  Everybody take a chill pill.  This is how  you get the Chinese to the table. When you impose a tariff which I agree  with others on your panel, it is a tax, this is how you get them to the  table, this is how you have serious talks about levelling the playing  field. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to read you, Governor, MiKE Huckabee's tweet.  He  (INAUDIBLE), I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for  collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending  bill.</p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R), ARKANSAS:  Look, Mike Huckabee is a great friend of  mine.  And that's easy to say from the outside looking in but as I said  before, I believe strongly that we have a mandate to provide for the  security of this country and in order to be able to get the gains that we  did for the Pentagon and for national -- the national security apparatus,  there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I love it.  He's a great Congressman,  but I'm going to just say this, tell the Democrats we're going to fund the  military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and you can  either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or you can  join us, and if you think that we are wrong, then you go get elected to the  majorities.  These guys are got to start learning to play some hardball. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the biggest headline is, now we know at least one person  who is not going to be running for the presidency ever, Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know that these companies have more power than they ever had  and more information about Americans than they ever had.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  We'll be holding hearings, there's no  two ways about it.  But the irony here is a lot of Americans are OK with  what we would call this edge providers, whether it's Google or Facebook or  Amazon knowing something about you so they can give you recommendations.  A  lot of Americans are fine with that and a lot are not.  The problem is  right now, is in many cases no one's asking your permission.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you say you wish you really would have known the importance  of having a budget. </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT:  The importance of having a budget is just  being in control.  You telling your money where to go instead of wondering  where it went. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's what I learn in my 20's, for your first marriage go to  the Courthouse and tell people send you cheques.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Forget all the China thing, you said you love and you think  you're going to use it.  You're not going to use the China.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Maria, what we need to do is all get together and collaborate and  make a book for these new millennials out there to help them to avoid some  of this traps.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The best thing about Washington, now, Marlon Bundo is making  big literary debut.  </p><p>KAREN PENCE, SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is my first book to  illustrate and we've had lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You must have fun just working together.</p><p>PENCE:  We really do.  And Marlon is great, he really -- he poses, he  knows, he thinks as, you know, this is my best side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How funny and adorable.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday.  It is Friday, March  23rd; your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  battered on Wall Street and the selling continues this morning, the major  indices selling off over growing fears of a trade war, President Trump,  signing his tariffs against China, yesterday, and that triggering even more  selling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have a trade deficit depending on the way you calculate of $504  billion.  Now, some people would say it's really $375 billion.  But any way  you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of  our world.  It's out of control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China is firing back this morning.  It is announcing its own  tariffs on U.S. goods going into China.  Global markets are following the  U.S. lower.  Take a look at the selloffs underway right now.  The FT-100,  down three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down one  and two-thirds percent, also one and two-thirds lower, on the DAX Index in  Germany.  In Asia overnight, sharp declines across-the-board, the Nikkei  Average, the worst performer, down 4-1/2 percent in Japan.  </p><p>Shanghai and Korea, both down better than three percent.  Looking ahead to  the open, more selling, Futures are indicating a lower opening.  Now, this  is off of the lows of the morning.  Nonetheless, we're expecting a decline  at the start of trading of 122 points, that's one half of one percent.  The  S&amp;P is down nine points and the NASDAQ is down 56, that's almost one  percent.  Then there's this, the House Judiciary Committee, making it  official.  </p><p>It issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for documents in the Clinton  e-mail investigation, as we told you, it would.  New questions in the Uber  self-driving car accident, the focus, now, turning to the test driver and  how the company selects those drivers, the woman behind the wheel was a  convicted felon.  One NFL player walking back his anthem protest, why he  helps the move, will have teams picking up the phone.  And Sister Jean and  Loyola Chicago, living on a prayer, and some great play on the court, with  the latest from Sweet 16, where Michigan dominated again.  </p><p>All that coming up, but first, students set to hold a march for our lives  rally in Washington D.C., another cities across the country, tomorrow, as  they push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the recent school shooting.   Joining us now is the -- a survivor of the Parkland School shooting,  Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior, Kyle Kashuv.  Kyle, good to see you,  thanks very much for joining us again.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS:  Thank you for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You will not be attending that march, why not?</p><p>KASHUV:  I'm going to be too busy meeting with legislators and pushing for  actual change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, do you not see it as important to be -- to be there with  your classmates and others?</p><p>KASHUV:  One thing, it's definitely amazing that they can march but if -- I  mean, I'm taking the fast track that's actually pushing a change, because I  really don't want to see Parkland ever happen again.  And, I could march,  but I think my time would be much better well spent meeting with  legislators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Kyle, how did your classmates respond to this?  I mean, you're  spending some time with them but you're not doing a lot of the important  things that they are doing.  Are they pushing back hard against this?  Did  they welcome the fact that you're taking an alternative view point?  How do  you respond?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, there he is in the White House with the President and  the First Lady.  This is what he's doing.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  It's amazing.  I'm just curious how they respond to that.  </p><p>KASHUV:  Well, a lot of them view what they're doing as more productive and  effective than meeting with legislators to (INAUDIBLE) I think that  meeting, first hand, with legislators and trying to explain to them your  point of view and to explain to them what's necessary and what needs to be  done, is more important than walking down on Washington D.C., and which is  fine, even if from point of opinion.  But I truly believe that if you want  change, you go to legislators.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kyle, quick question, what percentage of your  classmates are actually marching?</p><p>KASHUV:  I don't know the percentage, but I would give you most likely, 90  plus percent of all my peers will be marching whether in Parkland or  Washington D.C.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, you got a large percentage of your classmates,  marching.  Do you think there's certainly -- I mean, I remember my days  from high school, you think most of these are really just viewing the  marches up, just the way to goof off or do you think they're really  serious?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, I think there are definitely some people who are coming  seriously, but a lot of people saw that -- that you could get a free 40- trip to Washington D.C.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.</p><p>KASHUV:  then why not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you because we see this Time Magazine covers.   Several of your classmates are on the latest cover of Time, titled Enough.   You were not in this picture, on the cover of Time Magazine.  Did they ask  you to be on the shot?</p><p>KASHUV:  Well, they didn't ask me.  But honestly, I didn't know Time  Magazine was still a thing.  I know I wasn't asked.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think that is?</p><p>KASHUV:  I don't -- maybe -- I think maybe they're trying to represent only  one point of view, the Democrat point of view and the anti-gun -- the anti- gun.  A movement -- I honestly couldn't tell you because if they are really  trying to get the full perspective they would ask me and especially Patrick  Patty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm wondering if you are in fact, seeing pushback because  you take a different view, a more conservative view on this topic.  I know  that you had a recent incident with Spirit Airlines.  You tweeted about it.   We're going to show you tweet right here, Kyle.  You say, just landed in  Baltimore on Spirit Airlines and the steward is felt compelled to give us  all a speech about the March for Our Lives, which openly says on the  petition, are trying to categorically ban AR-15s and made everyone clap.  </p><p>Can anything just be non-political anymore?  Spirit tweeted an apology  after your tweet.  And Spirit Airlines said, while we appreciate that one  team members -- our Team Members are individuals, we don't believe politics  should be part of the Guest experience.  We're looking into the incident.  We apologize to any guests offended by these comments.  Is this apology  enough for you, Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, I want -- I wasn't offended to begin with.  I just thought  that what they're doing was stupid and unnecessary that they're giving a  speech for all the passengers, how much they support the March.  I just  thought it was unnecessary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But go back and talk to us about your views here, because this  is the whole crocs of the story.  I mean, the fact that you've taken a  different position, you're not looking for, you know, specific, you know,  an impact on the second amendment.  You say that there are rules in place  that should've been followed and there were missed signals.  Where are you  on this?  Tell us why you think you're seeing some pushback against your  views?</p><p>KASHUV:  Well, I think, I'm definitely getting some pushbacks because I'm  not taking, like, the mass majority opinion on this, so just everyone's  just following each other, inspiringly in a loop of talking points.  I  mean, I've taken a step back and I've looked at all the facts and I have  come to the conclusion that what I think I'm doing right now is what needs  to be done versus just marching and screaming about gun control.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, have you met with both Democrat and  Republican law makers?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And where do you see consensus among them in terms of tightening  gun regulations, we have gun regulations in this country or where do you  think that they can all come together and do something again?  FixNix was  kind of easy, closing some of the loopholes or trying to tighten up the  background check database.</p><p>KASHUV:  Well, I think first hand, every legislator I talk to, across the  board, they truly care and they don't want to see this happen -- they  really do --they don't want to see this ever happen to any of the  constituents, ever again.  What I think that every single lawmaker agreed  on, was that they want to see that people who are mentally disturbed, can  acquire weapon., and they want to make sure there are background check  systems is actually being implemented, and all the information is going  through.  They want to see the clear reporting and the full reporting of  information of disturbed individuals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, there are some changes happening to your school  right now, in terms of security.  Let's talk about that for a second, Kyle.</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The superintendent says that students are now going to be  required to use clear backpacks and metal detectors may be installed.  Do  you agree with these moves?  What about this clear backpack?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, I honestly think that it's going to protect our schools  and if this is what determined that it's absolutely necessary to make sure  this won't happen again, then, we shouldn't be opposed to -- we should be  in favor of it.  Yes, it'll be a little bit of discomfort, but look, that's  the price you pay for going to school safely.  I mean, I would prefer that  I could come to school safely, not have to fear if that man having a clear  backpack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  And the metal detectors you're also comfortable with.  I  mean, you have said in the past that what's wrong having an armed guard at  the school, right?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, I mean, let's do everything possible to make sure that school  is safe.  Yes, it might cause some discomfort for some kids.  We don't have  to wait a few minutes to get to the metal detectors, hopefully not three  hours, but that's what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle, thanks so much for weighing in this morning.  Good to see  you again.</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, getting answers,  House Judiciary Committee officially subpoenas the justice department over  the Hillary Clinton e-mail server probe.  We knew it was coming.  We've got  more on in this morning, and then another night at bracket-buster, as March  madness rolls toward the elite eight, the upsets and the triumphs, coming  up, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Markets are off of their lows, as you just saw  them.  Meanwhile, heavy rains in Southern California have residents on  alert this morning for possible flash flooding, mudslides.  Lauren  Simonetti with all the details and headlines now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi, Maria, this threat is just two months after deadly  mudslides struck killing 21 people.  Rainfall rate this time around could  be as high as an inch per hour and Santa Barbara County's 30,000 people  told to evacuate.  </p><p>We're also learning more about Sunday's fatal crash in Arizona, involving a  self-driving Uber vehicle.  According to Arizona state records, and we've  shown you this video, it is disturbing to watch.  The safety driver right  there, Rafael Vasquez, 44-years-old, was a convicted felon for attempted  armed robbery along with the number of traffic violations.  A police video  shows him looking down, as you can see right before the car struck and  killed a female pedestrian.  Uber says, Vasquez met standard background  check requirements and that he does still work for the company.  </p><p>Well, the House Judiciary Committee is slapping the Justice Department with  a subpoena for documents related to the Clinton e-mail server  investigation.  Chairman Bob Goodlatte saying he had no choice since they  have only received a fraction of the roughly 1.2 million documents that  they requested months ago.  Goodlatte spoke about this on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\", Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We  need to have those documents.  The department and the bureau have been  slow.  I would say, now, very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I  was on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those  documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later, still don't  have them.  So, this is coming to a hit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Here we are.  The Justice Department has two weeks to comply  with this subpoena.  </p><p>Well, it's the day for an IPO.  The cloud storage company, Dropbox, bumping  the price of its shares in its initial public offering to $21.00, that's  the second hike for Dropbox.  They had previously set a range of $16.00- $18.00 a pop.  The bump up shows strong demand among the investors.  Shares  start trading today on the NASDAQ, the symbol is DBX, the company is valued  at over $8 billion.  So, we're talking about the big tech company  struggling lately.  How are the unicorns going to do? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see how the deal does today even in the face of a  down market.  Lauren, thank you so much.  Dropbox -- I want to get your  take on that later.  Dagen, this subpoena, we knew this was coming.  Bob  Goodlatte told me on Sunday that it was coming.  I find it extraordinary  that they can request 1.2 million documents and only get 3000 back.  How is  it possible that the FBI just blows off the committee that has jurisdiction  over it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think some of the blame needs to be directed at Attorney  General Jeff Sessions, that I think that it's the entrenched old-school  lifelong government workers who are part of the problem here.  But again,  who's running the FBI?  Jeff Sessions, I know, he's recused himself in any  matters dealing with Russia, but what about Rod Rosenstein?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  I mean, somebody has got to enforce this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they've only received 3000 of the documents.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  The numbers look so ludicrous.  I mean, 3000 over -- it looks  like, forget about it, just told defiance.  I think Americans feel like,  there's a million document, let's give a big chunk of those and see what's  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, don't forget when our friend, Jason Chaffetz,  was running the Oversight Committee and he went into a hearing and said,  you are officially served.  He handed the subpoena to the FBI, months  before this subpoena, and they still didn't comply.  So, I don't know, but  you're right, it's up to Jeff Sessions.  Somebody has to enforce this to  get those documents within this investigation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm still -- I'm (INAUDIBLE) awaiting the inspector general's  report, particularly.  It's only been -- it's been less than a week since  Andrew McCabe got fired.  </p><p>SMITH:  You're right about one thing: you're fighting the real backbone,  which is the entrenched government employees, which typically lean to the  left.  And they're certainly as we've seen time and time after again,  they're anti-Trump.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They only sleep on their left side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to have Devin Nunes on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, your hair is thin on the one side.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, then your arm hurts you.  We're going to have Devin Nunes  on, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", Chairman of the Intel Committee, to take  more about that.  We'll take a quick break right here.  NFL Free Agent,  Eric Reid, walking away from kneeling.  We will tell you why a big  supporter of Colin Kaepernick is saying now, what he's saying now about the  pregame protest.  Plus, the sting of the Hornets -- Charlotte makes NBA  history with a massive blowout win.  Sports is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Here's our -- four games, three upsets in the NCAA  March Madness.  Jared Max with the highlights, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  March Madness indeed, Maria.  Out of  17.3 million brackets in ESPN's tournament challenge, you know how many  picked all four that won last night?  349, which is actually somewhat  remarkable considering the unlikelihood of these results -- a matchup of  Wildcats.  Kentucky favored to beat Kansas State, but K-state cats,  scratched this tie breaking layup for Barry Brown with 19 seconds left, K- state scores the upset 61-58.  One win for the first final four since 1964.  </p><p>The number nine seeded Wildcats play Saturday in the elite eight?  the 11- seated Ramblers from Loyola Chicago.  When it's time for leaving, I hope  you understand, I was born a rambling man in Rambler.  Its town says, it's  not time for leaving yet.  Loyola Chicago beats Nevada, 69-68.  They're in  the elite eight for the first time in 55 years since 98-year-old Team  Chaplan, Sister Jean.  Getting lots of brotherly love from the Ramblers  players.  So, we're number nine seed one -- a number 11 seed one. </p><p>And another number nine, football powerhouse, Florida State knocked out  last year's runner-up, Gonzaga.  Seminoles win 75 to 60 in the regional  finals for the third time.  The only game that went as expect, third seed,  Michigan, won its 12th straight.  The Wolverines eliminated Texas A&amp;M, 99- 72.  Michigan plays Florida State four more games tonight, including the  only number one seeds left, Kansas and Villanova in action.  </p><p>Record-setting night in the NBA: Charlotte Hornets became only the sixth  team ever to win a game by 60 points or more.  Wild night, Dwight Howard,  not part of the mix.  He served the one-game suspension; didn't matter.  As  the Hornets did something we haven't seen in 20 years with this type of  blowout.  Kemba Walker hit 10, three-pointers, a team record.  They win by  61 points.  Walker at 46 points and only 28 minutes -- nobody had ever  scored that many in so few minutes since the shot clock came to date.  </p><p>Hey, Johnny Manziel, making a comeback, former high spin trophy winner,  sober, looking healthy, full-faced, in football shape, attracted scouts  from 13 NFL teams yesterday at a pro-day work at San Diego.  Unemployed NFL  free safety, Eric Reid, one of the original national anthem kneelers with  former teammate, Colin Kaepernick, says he's not going to kneel anymore.   He says, the message was understood that they didn't kneel to protest the  national anthem.  Question: when you and your significant other do yoga, do  you ever try to re-create the scene in dirty dancing?  As Patriots  Quarterback, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen did.  They've had the time of their  lives and, Maria, they've never felt this way before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Look at that.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I don't want to know that, Jared.  I just -- I don't what to  know that last piece.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tom Brady is pretty and tolerable, but somehow he just managed  to become even more.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BRENBERG:  Come on!  Keep it to yourself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doing yoga.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Keep it to yourself.  </p><p>SMITH:  What you do in privacy of your yoga sessions.  Johnny Manziel, you  can't keep your eyes off of him.  Is he going to sign with them or  anything?</p><p>MAX:  I think so.  The 13 scouts there to watch throw.  He looks healthy.   He looks like he's ready to play football.  Because he looks so sick for a  while and not doing well.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I love the comeback stories.  I'd love to see it happen.  </p><p>MAX:  We love the comebacks.  You know, Tiger Woods, we're all rooting for  now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's not compare Johnny Manziel to Tiger Woods.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Johnny Manziel has proved that --</p><p>MAX:  Correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: -- he can't play professional football.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I want the comeback story here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  O wanted Tom Brady to fall on, still.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But he did it.  They are perfect.  You need to understand  they're perfect.  That's it, Dagen.  Jared, thank you.  Jared's sports  reports Fox News Headlines 24/7 and SiriusXM 115, catch him.  We'll be  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for  joining us this Friday.

Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Friday.</p><p>It is Friday, March 23rd.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>A sea of red and it continues -- the Dow tumbled more than 700 points  yesterday amid new fears of a possible trade war after President Trump  signed strict new tariffs on China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a tremendous  intellectual property theft situation going on, in particular with China.   We're going to be doing a section 301 trade action.  It could be about $60  billion.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Chinese government has fired back this morning.  It says it  plans to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs coming amid the tensions.</p><p>Futures are falling once again.  Although I want to point out, this is well  off of the lows of the morning.  We had been down close to 200 points  earlier.  Now we're looking at a decline on the Dow Industrials of 95  points, that's not even one-half of 1 percent.  The Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 are  also lower but here too, they're off of their lows.</p><p>Let's take a look at global markets this morning taking a cue from Wall  Street's selloff yesterday.</p><p>Asian markets getting hit hard.  Their worst performer was Japan, down 4.5  percent.  The Shanghai composite in China was down better than 3 percent as  well as the Kospi index in Korea.  Hang Seng and Hong Kong down 2.5  percent.</p><p>European indices, similar story -- although here too, we're off of the  lows.  The FT 100 is down two-thirds of a percent, the CAC 40 in Paris is  down 1.5 percent, as is the DAX index in Germany down 1.5 percent.</p><p>We have a deal.  Lawmakers avoid a government shutdown but they passed a  massive $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning.  We break down the  numbers as it heads now to the President's desk.</p><p>McMaster is out, Bolton is in.  More changes coming to the White House as  President Trump announced he will replace national security advisor H.R.   McMaster with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.</p><p>It's not the only change.  Details also this morning as the President's top  lawyer in the Russia probe has resigned.</p><p>The first big bank targets guns -- why Citigroup is setting restrictions on  firearm sales by its business partners.</p><p>Plus, with things pretty chilly between Republicans and Democrat these  days, Senators Jeff Flake and Corey Booker try to settle their differences  with a snow ball fight -- check this out.  The very latest on Capitol Hill,  coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, we have this breaking news that we want to get to right away.   There's a hostage situation under way right now in southern France.   Several people are being held at a supermarket, being held hostage.   Reuters is reporting this, that the man holding the hostages claims  allegiance to the Islamic state.  We will bring you any more information as  it becomes available.</p><p>But again, we do have a hostage situation right now in southwest France  with the person holding the hostages says he is working for ISIS.</p><p>Investors meanwhile, lawmakers back in the United States are eyeing  Facebook.  The stock had a tough week.</p><p>It is extending the losses this morning after Facebook officials were  grilled on Capitol Hill over the company's data mining controversy.  Now  lawmakers are calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress.</p><p>The House Energy and Commerce Committee released a statement yesterday,  reading in part, \"We felt that many questions were left unanswered.  We  believe as CEO of Facebook he is the right witness to provide answers to  the American people.\"</p><p>Joining us now is the managing director and co-founder of Elevation  Partners, former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook investor, Roger  McNamee.  Roger -- it's good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS:   Maria  -- it's always great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You have been a major supporter to Facebook over  the years.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First, let's put this in context.  Where do you stand on this  past week?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I just think this is a tragic situation.  Facebook operated the  company as though it was never going to have -- take any interference from  anybody.  It was just going to grow as rapidly as it could.  And in the  process, it made some mistakes.  And those mistakes have had unbelievable  repercussions in terms of loss of the user profiles, 50 million of them to  Cambridge Analytica; an untold number of them to other software vendors.</p><p>That invasion of privacy is something people are not going to be able to  get back.  Facebook has to come forward, accept responsibility for that and  for some of the other things that have gone on relative to the elections.</p><p>And you know, in my mind for Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, this is a  moment of truth.  This is a moment where their character is being tested  and where frankly, so far it's not going well.  This has been a disastrous  week for them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't like the way they're responding to this?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  No.  I think they have a horrible situation.  And the right  answer is you reach out to your critics.  You find out what the problem is  and then you sincerely make an effort to address it.</p><p>And what's going on instead is that they are pretending as though there's  no big deal going on.  So they're kind of saying nothing to see and they're  basically taking this notion that no one has a right to criticize them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, you know, it's interesting because this is not new,  right?  I mean, plenty of outside vendors have used the opportunity to get  and in a sense infiltrate into Facebook's network of users.  How come we're  just learning about this now and reacting now? </p><p>I mean, you go back to the election of Barack Obama and how, you know,  people used -- politicos used mining all of this data and people's, you  know, data to figure out how to get those voters.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Maria -- you're absolutely correct in that this idea of data  mining has been around for a very long time.  There are a couple things  about this one that are really different.</p><p>When Obama did it there was full disclosure, people understood what was  going on.  That is the correct way to do it.  And that has been the  tradition for marketers.  You provide complete disclosure.  People have to  give you informed consent.</p><p>What's gone on with Facebook is that they consciously deceived people.   They had an opportunity -- well, they signed a consent decree with the  Federal Trade Commission in 2011 that basically said they would require  informed consent before they shared people's data.</p><p>What happened in the case of Cambridge Analytica was that Cambridge  Analytica apparently sent a researcher in to pretend he was going to do  academic research when he was really going to gather data for political  use.  And so they didn't just take it from the 270,000 people who took the  survey, they took all their friends -- so 50 million people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And that's why people are afraid.  And the problem is now we  understand that wait a minute, there were literally tens of thousands of  other vendors doing exactly the same thing while the consent decree was  going on.  And it's alleged that Facebook had no compliance staff to  enforce the consent decree.  That is just irresponsible.</p><p>That's why people are so angry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, now -- go ahead finish your thought.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  I was going to say like the data's out there and there's no way  to get it back.  There's no way to undo the harm.  So that's why people  feel so bad about the communications this week.</p><p>This is a situation where you're supposed to go oh, my God, we've done some  something really horrible, how can we make it up to you.  It's not like we  can get the data back but there are a lot of things Facebook could be doing  today to show that it's going to earn people's trust back.  And that's what  they failed to do this week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Mark Zuckerberg did one interview, right?  He did  Anderson Cooper on CNN.  And Sheryl Sandberg did one interview.  So -- I  don't know.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  No.  Well, the problem was that Mark did several newspaper  interviews and one TV interview on CNN.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  The problem was he'd memorized the series of answers and he gave  the same answers, no matter what the question for it, to everybody.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It didn't seem sincere.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And they basically, the people who actually did the interviews  weren't the main line reporters.  They were actually entertainment people.</p><p>So I don't understand.  When Sheryl Sandberg went on CNBC, it's like why  didn't she come on this show?  Why didn't she come with somebody who would  give gravitas to the interview where obviously she was talking to somebody  who was as well-studied in business and is well-studied in technology as  she?</p><p>I mean the person she interviewed with on CNBC was a fine reporter but this  is not her field.  This is not what she does every day.  And, you know, I  look at this as from Sheryl's point of view, she wants to get out there and  have people understand that she sincerely wants to solve the problem and  that's not what she's doing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, by the way, just to be clear, we did reach out to  Facebook.  And I sent an e-mail and they didn't get back to us.  So they  didn't want to talk in that context obviously.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  It's their loss.  It's their loss.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you.</p><p>But let me ask you this because Facebook has also been now roped into the  special council investigation, Robert Mueller's probe.  Investigators are  looking at the connection between President Trump's 2016 campaign and the  Cambridge Analytica story.</p><p>Now Roger -- you just explained it and the difference.  Zuckerberg should  hand over the data not just from Facebook but also from Instagram, right?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean he's got a lot of data here that is now going to be  analyzed by the special counsel.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Facebook's problem here is that when they discovered that  Cambridge Analytica had the material incorrectly, they said to them you  have to destroy the stuff but they didn't go in and validate that it had  been done.  And then six months later, Facebook had employees working with  Cambridge Analytica on the Trump campaign, working with the very stuff that  was supposed to have been destroyed.</p><p>That's where the problem is with the special prosecutor, because Facebook  knew, the management knew that they were working with ill-gotten data and  you're just not allowed to do that.  The problem with Cambridge Analytica  is they're not an American company.  You're not -- as a non-American person  without a green card you're not allowed to work on a presidential campaign.   And so that is the -- that's where the issue is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what -- then what would be the motivation?  I mean if they  knew, did they just not want to deal with it?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I just don't think they think about that kind of stuff.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think they basically the view the world as we're  going to grow as big as we can.  They have two billion members and I think  their view is we're going to four billion members and we're not letting  anything get in the way and you know, regulations -- not their problem,  right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well look, it looks like the regulatory environment's  going to get a lot tougher now for Facebook and others, right.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And it's a tragedy.  It's a tragedy.  I mean when you grow big  you're supposed to grow up.  And, you know, I know these people.  They are  better than what's going on right now.</p><p>And I would just love to have them sit down, just go guys, get this right.   This is not that hard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  From a stock perspective, what are we talking about now -- 10  percent decline this week?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I've got to be honest with you -- Maria.  This scares the heck  out of me because this is a business based on trust and how can you trust  them with the way they're behaving right now?  And I think users are  absolutely within their rights to change their behavior.</p><p>In fact everybody needs to understand, anything you put onto Facebook could  disappear.  It could go to bad people and there's no way to get back.  So  you have to be smarter.</p><p>Facebook was a place we all trusted.  And I don't know how we get back to  that.  As an investor, that really worries me.  I'm not worried about the  earnings.  I'm worried about the PE multiple people pay because they're not  going to trust them as much.  And it's going to be really hard to earn that  trust back because this window, the first time they came out to talk, they  blew it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So the growth story has changed.  Putting earnings aside,  the growth story and -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  The stock story has changed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the stock.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  I look at this.  I still own the stock but I had to trim, you  know, I don't do the trades myself.  I had somebody else now manage it  because I'm involved in this thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  And they sold some stock this week because they went \"this is  terrible\".  And I'm going \"well, it's been terrible for ages, why did you  pick this week?\"  And they said \"because this is the week they lost trust\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And it has everything to do with the way the leadership  behaved -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- what they did in terms of phishing off on a nation -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  How many times have we seen this?  We both remember how Johnson &amp;  Johnson handled Tylenol.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  That guy went in and poisoned a few bottles of Tylenol.  And  Johnson &amp; Johnson didn't put that in there but they said these are our  customers.  We have to take care of them.</p><p>And I look at Facebook.  And Facebook -- their customers are the  advertisers.  The users for Facebook are the product.  But the truth is  there are times when you have to treat the user as your customers, as your  partners, as family.  And they blew that.</p><p>This was a chance they could have been -- they could have been a hero in  this movie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  And I don't know what they do now.  I think this is really  difficult.  But I hope they get it together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know that Zuckerberg is going to go testify.  What  kind of -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I hope he goes to testify.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I hope so to.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  He's going to fight it like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean you said -- you're right because even when he was  talking in that TV interview on CNN he basically said maybe if I'm the best  guy, if not, not.  So he wasn't really -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  No, they're going to fight it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he wasn't really committing to it.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And it was terrible.  Because he said something like I don't  understand how anybody who would sign a certification that they destroyed  the data wouldn't do that.  I'm going dude, you signed a consent decree  with the FTC.  As far as I can tell, you didn't actually have any  compliance for it.</p><p>I mean you've got to be kidding me.  He says I don't think -- we think that  we don't affect elections.  I'm going give me a break.  You put out white  papers talking about how you influence elections.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  Yes.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  I mean I look at this and I go guys, you need a new PR firm.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this.  From 30,000 feet up, Roger, on a day that  we just come off with a 700*-point selloff in the Dow yesterday.   Facebook's looking down again.  We're expecting perhaps more regulation in  the entire sector.  What do you want to do here as an investor?</p><p>Is this just a Facebook story for you or do you want to step away on a  whole bunch of tech companies in the face of all of this?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Actually, I don't think it's just tech companies.  I think tech  remains a leader in our economy.  I worry that we're almost 10 years into a  bull market, Maria.  And when I was last on here we talked about this issue  that we were coming towards the end of a bull market cycle.</p><p>And once you get into a situation of tariffs and trade wars, you have to  look at lower growth and higher inflation.  That's not -- I mean I don't  know whether the market's going to bounce back from this in the short run.</p><p>But when you look at a bit at longer term, the outlook just isn't that  good.  I mean, we haven't had a serious correction, a long-term correction  in 10 years.  I mean it could happen any time.  And I can't predict whether  it's this week, or this month, whenever.  But I'm personally defensively- *postured and have been for frankly for more than a year because I worry  that we're going to have higher inflation and lower growth.  And you and I  have been around long enough to remember what stagflation is like.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCNAMEE: It's a really bad thing.  And I don't know that that's what's  going to happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  But if you think it's even a possibility, you have to factor that  in to your valuation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, this on the week that the Federal Reserve raises interest  rates for the first time this year.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Hey, seen this movie before, right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Exactly.</p><p>Roger -- it's great to get your insights.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:   Maria -- it's always fun to be on here with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Roger McNamee there,  Elevation partners.</p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back -- national security advisor H.R.  McMaster is out.  We break down the latest White House shakeup and the main  stream media's reaction to his replacement -- John Bolton.</p><p>And then Citigroup taking a stance on gun control -- the Wall Street bank's  new restrictions for its business partners, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We have breaking news.  A police officer has been shot and now there is a  hostage situation in southern France.  Lauren Simonetti with the headlines  now -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  We're monitoring this story, Maria.</p><p>A person pledging support to ISIS now holding hostages at a supermarket in  southwestern France.  Police have surrounded that supermarket.  They're  treating this as a terrorist attack.</p><p>One police officer was shot about 15 minutes away from the scene.  We're  not sure how or if these incidents are related.  The last time a jihadi  gunman shot four people in a French supermarket was back in 2015.</p><p>Also, Citigroup they say will no longer do business with clients who don't  follow their new policies on selling firearms -- the first Wall Street bank  to enter the gun control debate.  Citi will require clients to stop selling  guns to anyone under age 21 or who has not passed a background check.  The  policy also bans the sale of bump stocks and high capacity magazines.</p><p>Citi is following major retailers, including Wal-Mart, who are distancing  themselves from the NRA, the National Rifle Association.  Let's take a look  at shares of Citigroup, slightly lower, although it's down 26 cents in the  premarket.</p><p>Take a look at this.  Two people in that intense snowball fight right there  dressed down are Republican Senator Jeff Flake and Democratic Senator Corey  Booker.  They decided to have a snowball fight after the storm dumped heavy  snow in the nation's capital yesterday.</p><p>Senator Flake tweeting \"With so many fights on Capitol Hill, Corey and I  are going literal.  Snowball duel, East lawn Capitol Hill in five minutes.   Loser buys other staff pizza.\"</p><p>So who bought the pizza?  Who do you guys think won?  </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  I think Flake won.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Bingo.  You got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Snow flake.</p><p>BRENBERG:  It looks like they had to get on, I don't know.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  There you go.  I don't know if Booker actually bought the pizza  but he was supposed to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool stuff.  Thank you -- Lauren.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: There are your tax dollars at work.  </p><p>GARY B. SMITH, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Right yes.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Get to work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, we will speak with Florida Congressman, House  Freedom Caucus member Ron DeSantis.  He's weighing in on trade war  concerns, the spending bill and a lot more as we watch markets come off of  the lows, down 85 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  down 38 on the Nasdaq.</p><p>Plus, Atlanta falling victim to the latest cyber attack.  How hackers are  holding the city's computer system hostage.  Back in a moment</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The word is reciprocal.  That's the word I want everyone to  remember.  We want reciprocal, mirror.  Some people call it a mirror tariff  or a mirror tax.  Just use the word \"reciprocal\".</p><p>If they charge us, we charge them the same thing.  That's the way it's got  to be.  That's not the way it is for many, many years; for many decades, it  has not been that way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump yesterday reaffirming up to $60  billion on tariffs on China as a step towards reciprocal global trade.</p><p>China fought back.  It announced that plans to roll out its own tariffs,  retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on its products, U.S. products  including pork and fruit going into China.</p><p>Markets in the U.S. and globally reacted strongly to the news with sharp  declines.  This morning futures are well off of the lows.  We're looking at  a decline at the start of trading on top of that 700-point selloff  yesterday but just down about 76 points this morning.  We had been down 200  earlier.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about all of that House Freedom Caucus member,  House Foreign Relations Committee member, and Florida Republican  Congressman Ron DeSantis.  Congressman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  We have a lot to talk about.   You did not vote for the spending bill.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But first let's talk about this trade situation.  Is President  Trump right to do this or are you worried about this -- this trade story?</p><p>DESANTIS:  I think he's right to identify the problems with China.  People  have been talking about that for years.  Their behavior, in many ways, has  gotten worse. </p><p>I think the issue is how are you going to confront China on these things?   And when you're using, relying primarily on tariffs, I just think the fear  is that the retaliation against U.S., our farmers and other industries that  we need to do well, could bear the brunt of that.  And so I think that's  the concern.</p><p>But the focus on China rather than a broad-based action I think is a much  better way to go than we had been talking about two weeks ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean nobody is surprised by the retaliation, right.  We were  expecting China to come back with something.  Does this impact the growth  story -- of the economic growth story of the U.S. in your view?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  I hope not.  But I think it is true that the stock market  responded negatively to this and it also responded negatively to the steel  and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>DESANTIS:  And we had really been doing well on the Trump presidency, on  the tax reform.  So I think we're on a great course based on what we've  done in the Congress with taxes and regulations.  And my fear is that this  could potentially throw some sand in the gears on some of this stuff.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  China came back with only $3 billion in retaliatory tariffs.   They didn't come back with $50 billion or $60 billion, just $3 billion.   Does that suggest to you -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So far.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.  So far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Give them a few days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have a $375 billion surplus with the U.S.  What are they - - are they going to really -- how much are they going to do here to  threaten that surplus?  </p><p>BRENBERG:  But that is what I'm saying.  This looks like they want to make  a deal pretty quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Is that possible here that they really don't want a trade war?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, it's more possible with Donald Trump as president because  they know that he means business on this stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DESANTIS:  It's something he's been talking about for a long time.  But I  mean look at China's behavior -- intellectual property.  I mean they are  constantly doing things that are really corrosive to a free trade order,  global order.  </p><p>So I hope so.  I think Trump's the guy that maybe is going to deliver.</p><p>SMITH:  I get -- when you say trying to be doing worse in the whole trade  thing over the years -- are you talking the steel or intellectual property?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Of course.  </p><p>SMITH:  Well, how are -- I get the focus on that -- how are tariffs going  to fix that?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, they may not.  I mean that's the thing, you know.  When  you're doing tariffs, you do harm the target but you also harm yourself to  a certain extent because of the way -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why they're also putting restrictions on investments  because they acquire things and then transfer technology to China.</p><p>Look, we've got to get to the spending bill.  You're here.  We've got to  get your take on this.  Pushed through by the House earlier Thursday, the  senate passed a $1.3 trillion spending package, narrowly avoiding a  government shutdown.  The bill will increase military funding and domestic  spending.  You did not vote for it.  Freedom Caucus was against this.</p><p>What do you want to happen now?  You want the President to veto it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DESANTIS:  I'd like to see the President to veto it.  And then I think the  reason is, just think about what happened.  This bill was negotiated behind  closed doors.  You have a handful of members.  The average person elected  the House and Senate had zero input on it.  It's unveiled at 8:00 p.m. on  Wednesday and put on the house floor at 2:30 in the afternoon the next.</p><p>So 2,300 pages, you have less than 24 hours -- no member read the bill, no  member knows everything that's in that bill.  And here's the thing.   There's a lot of bad things in there.  I mean, for example, they fund  Schumer's project here in New York but they don't provide money for Trump's  border wall.  It was for bollard fencing which isn't going to -- going to  work.</p><p>So you're going to hear a lot of fiscal complaints about it which I think  everybody -- but what does it say about representative government if that's  the way we do business?</p><p>That's not the way this thing is supposed to operate were five members on  each side do this, they log roll and then they just jam it through.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The irony is this is actually one of the reasons that we have a  trade deficit with all these other nations.  We are spenders and not  savers.  We are running up our debt, handing power to China, the largest  holder of foreign U.S. treasury debt.  We can't take power away from them.</p><p>We're at odds.  It's like, ok, we're going to now run $1 trillion annual  budget deficit as far as the eye can see.  We're $21 trillion in debt.  The  Federal Reserve is stepping away from buying some of that very debt.</p><p>So now we need China to step up and keep buying it.  God forbid they ever  talk about selling it.  But we're not fixing the problem at its root.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what were they supposed to do?  What would have been the  alternative?</p><p>DESANTIS:  They're exacerbating the problem.  If you look at the past --  when Obama was president, the omnibuses were less egregious than this, I  think.  I mean I think it just -- the numbers I think speak for themselves.  </p><p>What we should have done is, you know, we have certain ideas that we want - - Defense, the President wants a border wall.  You know, you have to engage  in some give and take in the legislative process but to just open up the  flood gates and say we're going to increase Department of Agriculture by 10  percent, we're going to increase HUD by 10 percent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Planned Parenthood.</p><p>DESANTIS:  -- we're going to do $200 million for democracy promotion in  Europe.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Federal arts funding went up.  Federal arts funding went up.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Of course it did.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Let me ask you a pointed question because Paul Rand has identified  a number of these pork products in here like $10 million for disadvantaged  Egyptian students.  Is there any of that in your district?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  No.  </p><p>SMITH:  There's none of this.  Because I know this is how -- this is this  whole pork barrel back -- </p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes, yes.  No, no, no.</p><p>SMITH:  It's how it operates.</p><p>DESANTIS:  No.  So here's what would happen.  If you actually did a normal  legislative process, there'd be a single appropriations bill for whatever  department that is.</p><p>SMITH:  OK.</p><p>DESANTIS:  And guys like me would be able to script it out.  We'd be able  to offer an amendment.</p><p>SMITH:  And why haven't -- why haven't we done that?</p><p>DESANTIS:  Because when you do the omnibus, they packed everything and it's  a must-pass bill and just shove it through.  There was not a single  amendment that was offered to any of this stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, would you have - would you have wanted less defense spending  in order to not have some of this other stuff?  What were they going to do,  say no to Schumer, let the government shut down?</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, here's the thing, if you had a good defense bill and you  had reasonable on everything else but not of blowing off the doors, then it  would be (inaudible) on Schumer to actually be the one standing up and  (inaudible) in to a shut down.  He's never been forced to do that, and  he'll make the point he doesn't fill it - he really doesn't.</p><p>He threatens to fill a buster, and then Republicans cave.  And I think if  the president would - imagine if the president vetoed this bill, get all  these Senators and Congressmen on vacation-</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For two weeks--</p><p>DESANTIS:  Or anything like that, vetoes it, everyone's got to go back.   And he's like I'm sorry, this is just not what the American people want.  I  think the public would rally behind him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think Marcus would rally?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think Marcus would rally because it would show some fiscal  restraint.</p><p>SMITH:  Were in agreement on it, I think the market would go up even more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does anybody - wait, does anybody here think that the  president's going to veto this?</p><p>DESANTIS:  No.</p><p>SMITH:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think so?</p><p>DESANTIS:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, because it's all at the end of the day, I do believe  President Trump likes spending money.</p><p>DESANTIS:  But there's the thing though, about the fiscal, here's his - he  campaigned on the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DESANTIS:  I think this is maybe the last opportunity he has to get it, and  he didn't get it in this bill.  He got $1.6 billion for see through  balloted fencing, not the wall he promised.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick before you go, are you ever going to get documents  from the FBI?  I mean (inaudible), your colleague?</p><p>DESANTIS:  He's going to send a subpoena, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, he sent the subpoena now.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes - yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I mean, 1.2 million documents, he's only gotten 30,000.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Exactly, so - well, that's one of the reason s why you need a  special counsel.  I'm sorry, there's no reason to stone wall like this  unless you're trying to protect the bureaucracy, and that's what they're  trying to do.  And it's been a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got to jump, thanks so much congressman.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you congressman Ron DeSantis, stay with us, back in  a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back this Friday morning everybody, thanks so much  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, March 23rd.  Your top  stories right now, 7:30 am on the east coast.</p><p>Stocks battered on Wall Street, and the selling continues this morning.   The major idiocy (inaudible) off of a growing fears of a trade war.   President Trump signed his tariffs against China yesterday, that triggered  more selling.</p><p>TRUMP:  We're doing things for this country that should have been done.   For many many years, we've had this abuse by many other countries and  groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of  the United Stets, and we don't want that to happen.  We're not going to let  that happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, China is firing back announcing its own tariffs on  U.S. goods.  Global markets are following the US lower this morning.   European indices right now are down across the board, the FC100 down 2/3 of  a percent.  The (CAC in Paris, down 80 points, that's 1.5 percent.  The DAX  index in Germany down 207 points right now, that's one and 3/4 percent.</p><p>In Asia, declines across the board sharply in Japan and China.  Reports say  that the Chinese state backed funds bought large cap stocks (inaudible) to  sell off.  Nikkei average, none the less down 4.5 percent in Japan.</p><p>Looking ahead to the open here in the US, more selling but we are well off  in the lows,  Futures indicating a decline of the start of trading, that 80  points that is down from down to 100 earlier.</p><p>Breaking news right now, there is a hostage situation happening in France  as we speak.  The attackers have pledged support for ISIS.  Right now, all  hostages expect for a police officer have been freed.  We have the very  latest developments happening in the south of France.</p><p>Atlanta is on edge, meanwhile the city threaten by a cyber attack with  hackers sending a ransom note, those details coming up.</p><p>But all of that ahead, first this top story just half an hour, tariff  turmoil.  China is squaring off with the United States, slapping tariffs of  it's own on US products, including pork and fruit.  President Trump spoke  out on his decision to implement the tariffs, calling the China defecate  out of control.</p><p>TRUMP:  We have a trade defecate depending on the way you calculate of $504  billion.  Now some people would say it's really $375 billion, but anyway  you look at it, it is the largest defecate of any country in the history of  our world.  It's out of control.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets in the US and across the world sold off on that.  Take  a look, now industrials yesterday at the close, down 724 points, that was  almost three percent.</p><p>Features this morning indicating another decline of about a third of a  percent on the Dow, and a half of a percent on the Nasdaq.  36 points lower  on Nasdaq.</p><p>Joining us now is former FDIC chairman, and chairman of systemic risk  council, Shelia Bair.  Shelia, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  us this morning.</p><p>SHEILA BAIR, CHAIRMAN, SYSTEMIC RISK COUNCIL:  Thanks for having me Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction on all of this.</p><p>BAIR:  Well, world markets don't like trade wars.  And so I think we've got  some rocky times ahead of us.  There's clearly a problem with intellectual  property, whether tariffs are the best way to deal with that's another  question.</p><p>I hope everybody can sit down and get this resolved.  And get a good path  forward fairly quickly, because the market's don't like this uncertainty.</p><p>I do think that longer terms, China's interest in ours are aligned.  I  think China wants to grow it's middleclass, it's wants to grow it's  domestic demand, it wants to reduce those trade surpluses and stimulate  more demand within it's own economy.</p><p>So, and they want access to our markets, we want access to their markets.   So I think there's some common ground and areas of leverage to get this  worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BAIR:  So clearly there's a problem intellectual property.  It's good, he's  tackling it.  But I just hope they can sit down and get it resolved  quickly, because it's not good for the world economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shelia, it's good to see you but again, it seems lie and this is  the Wall Street Journal speaking as well in the editorial page.</p><p>BAIR:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That a very half hazard, willy-nilly disorganized erratic  approach, because if we need our allies to come together and lock arms with  us and take on China.  And there's theft or intellectual property.  And  them taking technology from companies that want to do business there.</p><p>BAIR:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need those allies.</p><p>BAIR:  We do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whether it's Japan, South Korea, and Europe.  But instead, we  slap on these steel and aluminum tariffs and then have to back track.</p><p>BAIR:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And again, it kind of throws these vary trading partners in to a  tizzy if you will.  So where's the logic in this approach?</p><p>BAIR:  Well, I don't disagree with you.  I think tariffs are very blunt  instruments.  They're having a back track now with a lot of exceptions.   There doesn't seem to be a lot of consultation with our allies.</p><p>So, this and on intellectual property, which is a worldwide problem, it's  not just United States problem in term s of how China deals with  intellectual properties.</p><p>So, clearly some more coordination could be - would be very helpful.  But  this is a very impatient administration, a very impatient president.  He  doesn't like to go through all of those processes first, so it is what it  is.</p><p>But he certainly got everyone's attention so let's hope people can sit down  and have those kinds of discussions.  And reach some kind of agreement to  get us on an orderly path.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Shelia, China came back with only three billion dollars in  tariffs.  This was -t hey did load the guns and fired.  This was a very  small responses relative to what we expected.  Do they just want to cut a  deal, they want to get this down quickly, and that's why they're signaling  this way?</p><p>BAIR:  That could be.  As I say, I think longer term of our interest,  there's a lot of alignment with our interest.  And I've seen some -- I take  a little reckless rhetoric from some of the administration about we're  going to end our economic partnership with China.  Which is really  (inaudible) policy since the Nixon's era.</p><p>So, longer term, I think we -- you know, our economies can benefit from  each other.  I think China recognizes that.  I hope we do in the U.S., too.   We've got to deal with this intellectual property problem, but I -- I did  take it as a positive signal as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to point out something, though, that this -- a few  billion dollars and in -- from China, and tariff -- they're targeted.  If  you target...  </p><p>BAIR:  Yes they are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: -- pork, they targeted the very areas that voted for President  Trump.  They targeted farmers, against soybeans, pork, hogs, and fruit are  -- that's -- those are the very areas.  So they're trying to make it hurt,  politically.  </p><p>BAIR:  That -- that's very true.  That's a very core constituency for the  President, so it's a calculated move.  But not -- in quantitative terms,  it's not overly provocative, which I still view as a good sign.  </p><p>SMITH:  Hey Sheila, this is Gary Smith in New York.  I want to ask you a  more macro question...  </p><p>BAIR:  OK.  </p><p>SMITH:  -- because it gets to the whole tariffs things and your former job  as Chairman of the FDIC.  We think -- I'm more of a -- I'm a free market  guy, I mean, that's my perspective.  We seem to think that we get a bunch  of smart people in D.C. and they can control, somehow, like the Wizard of  Oz, major economic policies with, you know, the banking regulation, this  whole trade -- the targeted trade tariffs.  </p><p>Wouldn't we be better off, do you think, in the long term just letting the  free market work this out instead of relying on arguably smart people like  you to try to maneuver the economy?  </p><p>BAIR:  Well I -- yes, I like markets.  I like markets allocating resources.   I think, you know, this is one of the reasons why I've been such a  passionate opponent of \"too big to fail.\"  I think that definitely skews  markets towards very large, inefficient financial institutions.  So, I do  think that we need to let markets work, but it also means that we shouldn't  subsidize certain types of activity.  </p><p>SMITH:  Yes, agreed.  </p><p>BAIR:  And the industry doesn't always like that, and there's a difference  between being pro-industry and pro-market, and I think that's really the  kind of dynamic you're seeing in D.C. now, where both Republicans and  Democrats really -- you know, you saw it in the tax bill -- not much  loophole closing on a lot of benefits to essential (ph) industries that  also skew resources towards those favored classes.  </p><p>SMITH:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Sheila, it's great to get your insights.  Thank you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>BAIR:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sheila Bair, joining us there in Washington.

We'll talk with the CEO of American Keg Company about the  potential implications for his business, back in a moment, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Boozers could be losers as President Trump's  steel tariffs go into effect.  The new trade policy is aimed at bolstering  domestic industries.  But America's last keg maker is expecting to get  tapped out.  Joining us right now is the CEO of the American Keg Company,  Paul Czachor is with us.  Paul, it's great to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us.</p><p>PAUL CZACHOR, CEO, AMERICAN KEG COMPANY:  Great, thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're seeing a direct impact from these steel tariffs  affecting your business.  Tell us what that impact is.</p><p>CZACHOR:  Well, the tariffs had some unintended consequences.  So, today,  we manufacture all of our stainless steel kegs with domestic steel, all  steel from the United States.  As the tariffs were being discussed and  implemented, the cost of domestic steel has continued to come up -- rise  since the fourth quarter of -- of last year.</p><p>But unfortunately, the imports that are coming in finished good products,  mainly, say, Chinese kegs, there is no price differential on it.  So our  price differential between an import keg and a domestically made keg is  continuing to increase, which is something I don't -- I don't where the  customers -- where their breaking point is at that point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why, Brian Brenberg, we like to look at this story  from the consumer standpoint.  They're going to see higher prices.</p><p>BRENBERG:  And -- and they're already paying a little bit more for your  kegs anyway because it's American made, right?  You're not the low cost keg  maker.  But, you're right.  At some point, these businesses say, \"I just  can't make a profit if I have to pay more for your kegs.\"  How does that  affect your workforce, Paul?  I mean, what does this do to employees on the  ground who are at your plant trying to make a living here?</p><p>CZACHOR:  Yes, correct.  We have a lot of patriotic customers that want to  buy American made kegs.  But, you know, unfortunately as the costs have  been going up here in the last few months, we have to raise our sale price  and we're starting to lose some business.  So just recently, we had to lay  off about a third of our workforce.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Really?</p><p>CZACHOR:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much have you raised prices?</p><p>CZACHOR:  Our prices have probably gone up about $5 to $8 per keg.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, all right.  So the -- the U.S. Trade Representative Robert  Lighthizer testified before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday.  He  confirmed that certain countries will be exempt from the steel and aluminum  tariffs.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  What he has decided to do is  to pause the imposition of the tariffs, with respect to those countries.   We have the two NAFTA countries which we know where they are.  We have  Europe, we have Australia, we have Argentina, we have Brazil -- oh -- oh  and obviously Korea, where we're negotiating the course.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, isn't this one helpful thing for you?  I mean, does not  -- is this not -- not affect things?</p><p>CZACHOR:  No.  I -- I think what we would explain is that there's some  unfinished business with tariffs.  We need the administration to look at  what we would call a holistic view.  So if our raw material, our input  costs are going up and countries are still able to import kegs with their  low-cost steel, we need the administration to look for downstream --  downstream, at businesses such as us that use a high content of steel, and  look at some sort of tariff.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Paul, one of the things we talk about a lot with these tariffs,  even with the exemptions is that it creates a lot of uncertainty for small  businesses.  You don't know where prices are going.  You don't know who's  going to get an exemption.  Maybe, in some cases, you don't even know how  to petition for the exemption.  How does that uncertainty affect a smaller  business like yours?</p><p>CZACHOR:  Oh, it's very difficult, to -- to your point, we don't know what  the future holds.  And it's unclear where the tariffs are going.  So we're  very concerned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about this keg right here, your company's keg and the - - and the one that we have on set.</p><p>CZACHOR:  It's all stainless steel.  It's domestic steel, all produced here  in the United States.  We market to about 6,000 to 7,000 customers out  there, mainly craft brewers but there are some cideries (ph) and wineries  that will buy kegs.  And as you can see, we can do some marketing.  We do a  lot of screen printings ...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that, Fox Business.  That's nice.</p><p>CZACHOR:  -- So, we did that just for you.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, for that.  And -- and what does this go for?</p><p>CZACHOR:  That -- that sells for approximately $80.  It's a one-sixth keg  or a sixtel, it's commonly referred to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect that you'll have to lay off more people if we see  these tariffs stick?</p><p>CZACHOR:  If these tariffs stick and there's no help for -- for us, like as  a downstream business with import or low-cost kegs coming in, yes, we'll be  in some deep trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's too bad.  Paul, we're going to be watching this  situation.  Thanks very much, for sharing it with us.</p><p>CZACHOR:  All right, thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much, Paul Czachor, joining us there.   Still ahead, Toys\"R\"Us, gearing up for its liquidation sale after  postponing it by a day, details on the closeout sale right here, next hour  Mornings with Maria.

Good Friday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Friday to you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Friday, March 23rd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 A.M. on the  East Coast.  Stocks plunging, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled  better than 700 points yesterday amid new fierce of a possible trade war  after President Trump signed strict new tariffs on China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have right now an $800  billion trade deficit with the world.  Let's say we have 500 with China,  but we have 800 total with the world.  That would mean that China is more  than half.  So we're going to get it taken care of.  It's going to make us  a much stronger, much richer nation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Chinese government is firing back.  They say they will plan  to roll out their own retaliatory tariffs amid the tensions.  Futures are  in red once again but take a look at what has taken place this morning.  We  were down 200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  We've had a  complete reversal of fortunate this market.  It's about to go into positive  territory.  The Dow Industrials are now down to 6 points.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is up one and a quarter point.  NASDAQ also well off the lows  down just a quarter point.  We're seeing a big move in markets this morning  to the upside.  Global markets look like this morning and here too.  Asian  markets obviously closed sharply lower.  Nikkei Average was down four and  half percent over night, steep declines there.  Steep declines in China as  well.  Shanghai down three and a third percent.  </p><p>Hang Seng down two and a half percent.  But in Europe, we are well off of  the lows this morning.  Take a look at this situation where you see the FT- 100 down two-thirds of a percent.  The CAC Quarante down one and a third  percent and the DAX Index in Germany down one and two-thirds percent.  We  have a deal.  Lawmakers avoid a government shutdown passing a massive $1.3  trillion spending bill early this morning.  We break down the numbers as  the heads to the president's desk.  </p><p>We heard from Ron DeSantis.  He wants the president to veto it.  McMaster  is out and Bolton is in.  More changes coming to the White House as  President Trump announces he will replace National Security Advisory H. R.  McMaster with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.</p><p>It is not the only change.  The details as the president's top lawyer in  the Russia probe resigns.  Breaking news, a hostage situation in France is  happening as we speak.  The attackers have pledged support for ISIS.  Right  now, all hostages except for one police officer have been freed.  Counsel  to the President Kellyanne Conway says that the White House will address  the situation this afternoon.  We have the very latest developments coming  out of this hostage situation in France.  </p><p>And here comes the deal, Toys \"R\" Us is cutting prices as it prepares to  close 800 U.S. stores.  The very latest as it begins the liquidation this  morning.  All those stories coming up right and joining me to talk all  about it Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The King's College Business  and Economics professor Brian Brenberg, and the Cadena Group's President  Gary B. Smith.  Great to see everybody.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, CADENA GROUP PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big reversal of fortunate in markets.  </p><p>SMITH:  You know, let me point out something, yes.  It may be it's just me,  Maria.  When we came on at 6:00 A.M., I said I was optimistic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Now, look what's happened.  I -- maybe it's -- one of us has to be  right, Dagen, I'm sorry.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said it's kind of a show yesterday.  I said look out below.   That's what I said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was my final thought.  I think that there's a lot that you  do have an administration that is fomenting uncertainty when it doesn't  need to and I'm not talking about getting tough on China but it's the way  that you're doing it.  It's fomenting uncertainty through these steel and  aluminum tariffs.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SMITH:  Isn't Trump a -- I -- it does a lot of things right.  It does a lot  of things wrong, but he is affecting change though.  Don't you think that's  good?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's affecting a down decline in the stock market --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're still up 30 percent from the election -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one just really quickly though, President Trump used the  stock market as a barometer for his success repeatedly on Twitter over and  over and over and over again.  I'm curious what he thinks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, obviously these markets are talking.  They do not like  this trade situation.  You mentioned early they don't like the $1.3  trillion spending bill, either.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But they want to get over it quickly.  I mean look at what  happened this morning.  They want to get over this news quickly and they've  done it time and time again and it looks likes that might be the case today  as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a buying opportunity?</p><p>SMITH:  I think it is.  I think -- I think with Trump it's always a fire  first, ask questions later.  He always puts the biggest move.  He moves his  queen first and then later on all his rooks and stuff and then you really  see what happens.  Not as bad as people think.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And John Dowd, one of the president's personal attorneys leaving  yesterday.  I think that adds -- that that's something that hard to  quantify during this.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I agree with you.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uncertainty about his legal situation, the Special Counsel  Robert Mueller investigation.  I think that it's -- that it's on the margin  that adds more uncertainty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The markets don't like uncertainty but again this market has  come all the way back.  We are expecting perhaps a higher opening for the  broader averages this morning.  We'll see.  We'll begin right to the top  story right now, the trade war fears hitting global markets.  Stocks across  Asia tumbling following the direction of Wall Street yesterday.  The Dow  Jones Industrial Average was down more than 700 points after President  Trump proposed tariffs of up to $60 billion on imports from China along  with tighter restrictions on the country's acquisitions and technology  transfers.  It's all in response to what the administration is calling  China's unfair trading practices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're doing things for this country that should have been done for  many, many years.  We've had this abuse by many other countries and groups  of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the  United States and we don't want that to happen.  We're not going to let  that happen.  It's probably one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of  the main reasons. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, hours later the Chinese government fired back saying  that it plans to roll out retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on U.S.  goods in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum.  Those tariffs go  into effect today.  The U.S. now says that some allies including Canada,  Mexico, the E.U. among others will get a brief exemption from those  tariffs.  Joining us right now to talk more about that is the author of The  Coming Collapse of China, Gordon Chang.  Gordon, very good to have you on  the program this morning.  Thanks very much for time.  China is already  retaliating I guess.  What's your take on all of this?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AMERICAN COLUMNIST:  Well, it was a very small retaliation,  you know, it's $3 billion, 128 products.  And we got to remember, you know,  the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. says look, well, look, you know, if  we're going to have this tit-for-tat action, let's see who lasts longer.   Well, I know who lasts longer, that's the United States because we're the  trade deficit country.  China needs us much more than we need them, you  know last year, 88.8 percent of their overall merchandise trade surplus  related to sales to us, you know, we hold all the high cards in a trade  war.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they need us more than we need them?  We're talking about  $375 billion deficit, are they going to threaten that surplus that they  have by ramping this up or do you see this $3 billion in tariffs as a sort  of soft move?  Not -- you're talking about $60 billion in U.S., $3 billion  in China, how should we read that?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  And I actually think that what we're seeing right now is the  Chinese are trying to say, look, we will hurt you but we're not going to  hurt too much because we don't want you to really get angry, you know, I  think that President Trump has a lot of political will and that's really  what's important in a situation like this because, you know, fundamentally,  we, you know, a lot of people criticize the president about what he's done  on tariffs steel, aluminum, and now the 301.  But the point is we've got a  trade outlaw at the center of the system of global commerce.  </p><p>That's China.  We have tried to entice the Chinese into accepting norms and  rules in International Congress.  They won't do that and as a matter of  fact they're getting worst.  They're becoming more predatory, more about as  a matter of fact getting worse more predatory, more mercantilist.  They're  closing their economy.  Somebody has got to do something because if they  don't, this trading system that we've had since the end of World War II is  just not going to survive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I just want to point out markets here because we had been  down earlier in the program, Gordon, by 200 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial Average.  When we were first navigating through this news from  China and these retaliatory moves, the market has completely reversed  course.  Now, we're looking at a gain at the start of trading of 57 points  on the Dow Industrials and 7 points higher on the S&amp;P 500, do you think  this is a negotiating move by this president?  I mean he's also putting  restrictions on what China can acquire and how much.  But by the way,  that's what China does right?  I mean American companies can't go to China  and own more than 49 percent of anything and, by the way, they can't even  own directly a company that have to do with through and J.V., joint  venture.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  And that J.V. point is crucial, Maria, because that is at the  heart of that $60 billion in loss of U.S. intellectual property, you know,  we look at the numbers annually.  They're staggering.  They're somewhere  between $225 to $600 billion annual loss of U.S. intellectual property.   Most of that is related to China and this is something that comes from the  bipartisan Blair and Huntsman's commission in their 2017 update to their  2013 report.  </p><p>So, you know, this last -- losses here are staggering and people who don't  like what the president is doing have got to come up with a better way, you  know, it's fine to say, look, we should align our interests with China.  We  should have consultations, but we've been doing that in the trade area  intensively since the end of the 1990s and it hasn't worked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president -- I am told that the president wants to cut the  deficit, the trade deficit down by $50 billion with China.  I'm told --  right now it's 375 billion.  I 'm told he wants to get it down to 325 or  even 300 billion, will he be successful before we turn on another subject  here Gordon?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  I think that we will overtime largely because we hold those  high cards, you know, I think people in the United States have gotten  really tired of just talking to the Chinese and now want to impose cost and  that's absolutely the right way of dealing with this situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, there's more turnover at the White House, markets of  course reacted yesterday when president announced he's replacing National  Security Advisory H. R. McMaster with former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton.   He will be the third person to fill that role, Gordon, that appointment  both and potentially, what could that mean for American foreign policy as  it relates to Asia in your view?</p><p>CHANG:  I think U.S. foreign policy will become much more resolute because  Ambassador Bolton understands that the primary problem that the world has  in Asia and, of course, the U.S. as well is China and Bolton has views  about China which I think aligned very closely with President Trump's.   That's going to be good because the problem that H. R. McMaster had was  that on certain critical issues, he just didn't see the world in the same  way that the president did and every president deserves a National Security  Advisory who shares his views.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What's your take in terms of coming up a potential  meeting with the leader of North Korea, Gordon?  Do you think this happens  in May?</p><p>CHANG:  I don't know if it happens in May.  But it certainly happens and  the reason is that Kim Jong-understand, the leader of North Korea needs  sanctions relief and I actually think President Trump made instinctively  the right decision.  In 45 minutes, he came up with the right decision to  meet with Kim and the reason is that Kim Jong-un in addition to the  sanctions relief wants to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington  because Moon Jae-in, the south Korean President wanted this Trump-Kim  summit.  It's going to happen and that was the right thing because if we  stay strong with South Korea, we'll always get acceptable outcomes and  maybe even good ones.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I guess China is watching as well of who the president puts  into which role.  You say John Bolton will be more resolute, what does that  mean in terms of how the U.S. changes strategy in Asia?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think that what we're going to see is a much more  confrontational posture with regard to the Chinese because China is trying  to close off international -- the global comments trying to grab territory  from its neighbors challenging the U.S. across the board even attacking out  system of government.  I don't think John Bolton will put up with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean and a lot of these things have been known for a  long time, right?  I mean everybody gets it when you say, yes, China steals  all of our stuff or they're stealing our intellectual property.  Businesses  have been taking this for decades.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  I mean individual businesses can't stand up to Beijing.  I  mean we shouldn't expect them to but we should expect the President of the  United States to protect American workers, American businesses and  unfortunately, you know, we've had this view of, oh, let's just talk to the  Chinese.  Let's try to get them to see their better interests.  </p><p>Well, yes, they should see their better interests but they don't and so,  you now, you now have a president in President Trump who look and says,  look, we've got to try something different.  It might not work but if we do  the old things, we know we're going to fail.  So I think that we should all  be applauding what President Trump is doing in this regard trying something  new.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We'll be watching that.   Gordon, it's great to hear from you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gordon Chang on China there.  Coming up, Congress averts a  shutdown funding the government through September.  But what's in that $1.3  trillion spending bill.  Anyway, we're going to take a look.  Then the end  of Toys \"R\" Us as we knew it.  Details on the retailers liquidation sell  right here.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have more information right now that the  hostage situation in Southern France, Lauren Simonetti with the headlines,  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  A developing story, Maria, a person  reportedly pledging allegiance to ISIS is holding a lone police officer  hostage at a supermarket in Southern France.  That's according to the  Trebes' mayor.  \"The Associated Press\" is reporting that one person has  been shot dead by the suspect, another person seriously wounded, all  hostages except the police officer have been freed.  Police have the  supermarket surrounded.  </p><p>They're treating this as a terrorist situation and official with the police  union says the suspect fired at police officers about 15 minutes away from  the supermarket scene hitting one of them in the shoulder before they ended  up at the supermarket.  That officer's injury is not life-threatening but  as you know, France has seen a number of terrorist attacks in recent years  and counselor to the president President Trump, Kellyanne Conway told Fox  News this morning that the White House is monitoring the situation.</p><p>A tragic night in New York as a firefighter is killed battling a five alarm  blaze in Harlem.  Flames broke out last night on a movie set in the  basement of a close club.  Firefighter Michael Davidson's engine company  was the first to arrive.  They rush to the basement but officials say once  they got down there, the fire became too much forcing them to retreat out  of the building.  Davidson somehow got separated from his group when the  firefighters did find him.  He was unconscious and could not be revived.   He's 37-year-old and he leaves behind his wife and four young children.   Well, on Capitol Hill, shutdown averted.  The Senate approving a $1.3  trillion budget deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The yeas are 65.  The nays are 32.  The motion to  concur is agreed to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Four Republicans voted against the legislation led by Senator  Rand Paul as expected who said earlier, \"There's just too little time to  read the bill.  It is more than 2,200 pages long.\"  The legislation will  lift military spending by $80 billion this year and domestic programs by 63  billion.  It also includes a $ 1.6 billion funding for the border wall that  the president wants.  Now, this bill goes to President Trump's desk for his  signature.  </p><p>It's a sad day in Toyland, liquidation sales at bankrupt Toys \"R\" Us.  They  begin today.  Customers were expecting the discounts yesterday but the  company says, it saw some unforeseen circumstances, so they push them back.   If you want a good deal, you got to act fast because they don't have too  much inventory especially on the new stuff.  And on a sad note, the founder  of Toys \"R\" Us Charles Lazarus, he died yesterday.  He was 94 years old.   Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, an incredible legacy of his.  We want to bring you this  breaking news, Lauren, as you were speaking.  We put it on the screen and  that is Fast Company Magazine is reporting that Target and Kroger are in  discussions for a merger.  We don't have any more information than that but  look at the stock prices right here, Gary, Target is up two and two-thirds  percent, Kroger up six and almost seven percent here.  Obviously, the  retail sector is incredibly bifurcated in an Amazon world.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Absolutely.  And, you know, you talked about amazon, I was going  to bring up players a good time now.  There was a headline in \"The  Washington Post\" grocery super -- grocery wars because Amazon is coming in  there a lot us like Winn-Dixie stores are closing, Amazon's impact across  the retail sector is exciting right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Target and Kroger merge --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And this is also specific to Target struggling in grocery  because Target has failed to really keep up with Wal-Mart as Wal-Mart has  moved deeper and deeper into grocery, and it has become a criticality  important part of Wal-Mart's business.  This is a way for Target to really  step up its game.</p><p>SMITH:  I was surprised because, you know, Kroger in my experienced in the  supermarket industry, they were one smart cookie.  I mean they fought off  people like FoodLine and a number of others.  I mean if they can -- if they  can go, anyone can.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot changed after Amazon acquired Whole Foods.  Let's not  forget that.</p><p>BRENBERG:  And Amazon is bringing Whole Foods prices down big time.  It's  causing some turmoil at Whole Foods but that's the problem for Kroger and  Target.  Whole Foods is becoming viable for your average middle class  buyers.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And look what it's doing?  The issue now talking about  a merger.  According to Fast Company, they try to get that official coming  up.  We will take a break.  Stay with is.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, global markets are selling off this morning.  Asian and  European markets following the U.S. sharply lower over night as worries  over China tariffs weigh on investors.  We are about an hour away from the  opening of trading this morning and we had seen a complete reversal of  fortune in Futures this morning, Dow Industrials earlier had been down  almost 200 points.  We're at a gain now at the opening of trading, 13  points on the Dow, and a gain of three points on the S&amp;P 500.  Joining us  right now is Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO and CIO Mark Yusko.  And  Mark, you've been hedged for about a year now.</p><p>MARK YUSKO, CEO AND CIO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Yes.  I mean we  started getting hedged at the end of last summer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you were expecting this market to trade down?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  I mean you never expect it to trade like yesterday.   Yesterday was a pretty tough sell-off, but we looked at the beginning of  the year pretty skeptically a big move last year, you know, up 20 plus  percent and the end of January was a big turn in momentum really.  We're  kind of made a top that last day of January and there's been a top that we  call -- we talked about as distribution.  People buy early in the morning  and then the big money comes in and sells in the afternoon.  That's been  happening most days over the last six weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But why?  Why are you negative on this market?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Well, a couple of things.  So one, valuations are very high but  they've been very high and they got higher last year and say, well, why  can't they keep going up?  High valuations have to have higher earnings and  earnings growth I think have peaked.  I think we had the big euphoria  around the tax bill and I think what's happening now is companies are  realizing, wait a minute, I still have to compete and there's a lot of  deflationary forces like technology, the aging demographics.  They're  putting pressure on earns.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  It's interesting.  So you -- we've been talking about trade all  morning and how that's affecting markets, you know, yesterday the big sell- off, now, today it's coming back.  I think that's because markets look at  what -- how China responded and said, this is not as big of a response as  we were thinking we're going to have and the U.S. tariffs don't go into  effect for 45 days.  That's a lot of time to cut a deal.  There's a lot of  negotiating going on here but it's not going to be the trade war we  thought, are you in agreement with that?</p><p>YUSKO:  Look, wars have no winners, so I'm hoping that you're exactly  right.  I'm hoping this is all just, you know, bluster and that there  really isn't the desire to go through.  Look, I've been tweeting a lot  about, you know, two words, Smoot-Hawley, right?  Trade wars are bad.   Tariffs are horrible idea.  They never work.  So why do we think they're  going to work this time?  And I just think that China thinks differently  than everybody else.  They think in decades.  They plan long term and what  -- it's interesting to me about all of this is it used to be about made in  China.  </p><p>Everything was made in China, export every place else.  The next two  decades saw about made for China.  Their consumer market is going to be the  biggest consumer market on the planet.  Our companies need to sell stuff.   In fact, my guess is that when the president went to Boeing I guess last  week or something, they had a few choice words about the idea of, hey, we  need China to buy our airplanes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  </p><p>YUSKO:  So -- </p><p>SMITH:  I want to get back to -- I want to get back to your market outlook.   You said, right, you've been hedged for a while now expecting the market to  go down.  That's fine and that's been accurate.  When do you become  unhedged?  What are you looking for as a downside and some clear sailing? </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  So there are a couple of things.  It's really important  point.  So in terms of just short term stuff, I actually look at this thing  called The World's Greatest Indicator and it's basically the number of  stocks in the S&amp;P 100 that are above their 200 day moving average.  When  that false below 65, it's 60 today, that's just the time to get kind of  half hedged.  If it falls below 50 where it was heading yesterday  afternoon, then you get fully hedged.  Now, when that comes back up and  goes back up the other way through 65, then you can start reentering.   That's one way in terms of a short term indicator.  But for the long term,  what we find is that markets tend to lead the economy.</p><p>SMITH:  OK. </p><p>YUSKO:  So the markets getting weak here are starting to make noise.   They're not like tomorrow but there could be a recession.  Recessions tend  to have meaningful market corrections related to, so we're going to stay  hedged for a while.  If, you know, economic growth started to pick up,  here, look, I think in January, the Atlanta fed was saying, we're going to  have 5.4 percent GDP growth.  Now, they're saying 1.8.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that was just wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they were changing that estimate -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Any time a data point --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YUSKO:  And to me, it's just -- look, we've been in sub two percent growth  for seven years and I don't think we're going to get higher than that.  But  people forget it's not necessarily percentage -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- couple of times.  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes.  But the average -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YUSKO:  But the whole year is only 2.3 and the thing is it's not about the  number, right?  Because it's the law of those numbers.  We're in a huge  number.  It's hard to grow huge economy at a huge percent, so we should be  looking more at the economic growth it has created.  So, look, as long as  that that stops going down, that's when I would get more bullish.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, earning is still going to be up eighteen and a half  percent, right?</p><p>YUSKO:  That's what they say. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  So you're questioning --</p><p>YUSKO:  Every year in January, earnings estimates are really high.  By the  end of the year -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've been -- they've been at 18 plus percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's going to be 16 percent for the first quarter.</p><p>YUSKO:  I'll come back in December and if they hit 18, I'll buy you dinner.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got to come back before December.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You still own Bitcoin?</p><p>YUSKO:  I do.  I love Bitcoin.  I love Blockchain.  I think Blockchain  technology is going to change the world as we know it and my plan over the  next couple decades is tokenize the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tokenized the world?  All right.  Well, you sound like Jack  Dorsey.  Good to see you.  </p><p>YUSKO:  All right.  Thanks.  Well, it's high praise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Mark Yusko there.  We have  this breaking news from the president.  The president is tweeting this  right now.  \"DACA was abandoned by the Democrats, very unfair to them.   Would have been tied to desperately needed wall.\"  DACA legislation is not  happening, I guess, right now.  All right.  We will take a break.  When we  come back Deloitte CEO, Cathy Engelbert, is with us.  She will weigh in on  the President's tariff planned taxes and a lot more.  Then the House  Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed the Justice Department for records tied  to Hillary Clinton's e-mail server.  The very latest details on that  investigation, right here.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, March 23rd.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  A reversal of fortune  on Wall Street.  Take a look, Futures indicating the market will open  higher today, up 60 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  That is a  complete reversal from earlier when we saw the Dow down 262 point at the  lows.  The NASDAQ right now up 7-1/2 points as S&amp;P 500 also gains.  </p><p>February durable goods orders coming in up 3.1 percent.  That was well  above of the estimate which calls for a gain of 1-1/2 percent, durable  goods orders helping this market as well after a tough day yesterday.  Take  a look at the sell-off, growing fierce of a trade war weighing on investors  yesterday with a 724-point sell-off in the Dow, and 178-point sell-off on  the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Today, China is firing back, announcing its own tariffs on U.S. goods.   Global markets followed the U.S. lower overnight.  And this morning in  Europe, the FT-100 is down a half a percent, the CAC Quarante and the DAX  Index are down each better than one percent.  And in Asia overnight, sharp  declines across the board, worst performer was Japan, Nikkei Average down  4-1/2 percent.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee makes it official, it has issued a subpoena  to the Justice Departments for documents in the Clinton e-mail  investigation.  Amazon's drone dream, the company is filing for a patent  that will understand hand signals and giving workers the right to  disconnect.  Details on a new bill that says companies would be banned from  requiring their workers to respond to text and e-mails after work hours.   Plus, Sister Jean in Loyola Chicago living on its prayer and some great  play on the court.  We have the very latest from the sweet 16 where  Michigan dominated once again.</p><p>First though, our top story this half an hour.  A shake-up at the White  House also weighing on markets yesterday.  President Trump announced he is  replacing National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster with former U.N.  Ambassador John Bolton.  Adam Shapiro covering the story, live right now a  the White House with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria, and Mr. Bolton will begin  his duties on April 9th.  Let me read you the tweet the President sent to  the nation last night.  He said, \"I am pleased to announce that effective  April 9th, Ambassador John Bolton will be my new national security adviser.   I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done  outstanding job and will always remain my friend.  There will be an  official contact handover on April 9th.\"  </p><p>Now, Ambassador Bolton was on the Fox Business Network yesterday as well as  the Fox News Channel, and he is very much in line with the president who  during the campaign to become president promised that he would either hold  Iran to the deal that have been struck during the Obama administration, or  tear it up.  And Mr. Bolton is in favor.  He's written in the past about  regime change in Iran, and here is what he said last night about the  President's agenda with the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOHN BOLTON, INCOMING NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  I think that the rest of  the bureaucracy needs to understand as well when the guy who got elected  makes a decision, that's what the constitution provides.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  And it is no surprise to anybody that Ambassador Bolton is  hawkish when it comes to Iran.  Here is what Hogan Gidley, one of the press  people here at the White House had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Bolton is more hawkish  than the President.  The President relishes and people around him don't  agree because he likes to bring the best minds together, have the  conversation, but at the end of the day, it's the president who sets the  policy and the president who makes the decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  But on Capitol Hill, there is reaction.  Senator Chris Coons had  this to say, \"In the midst of international challenges from North Korea and  Iran to China and Russia, I'm concerned that President Trump has chosen to  abruptly dismiss the well-regarded H.R. McMaster and hire his third  National Security Adviser in just 15 months.\" The senator from Delaware,  Chris Coons.  Then, of course, there were the other issues about shake-up  here.  Mr. Tillerson yesterday leaving the State Department, telling people  that this is a Mean Spirited City, Washington, D.C., imagine.  Then there  of course was the President who meeting with millennials kind of joked when  asked what advice would you give to your 25-year-old self.  The president  said, don't run for president.  Back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, he did.  Adam, thank you.  Adam Shapiro at the White  House.  The corporate tax code overhaul has been a big windfall for  American business and a big win for the President, certainly.  But the  tariff plan has thrown CEOs and investors for a loop a bit, rocky markets.   Although, things are in positive territory this morning.  Futures  indicating a gain of about 50 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  complete reversal to earlier where the low was down 262 down on the Dow  earlier.  Joining us right now to talk markets and trade is the CEO of  Deloitte, Cathy Engelbert.  Cathy, it's good to see you.</p><p>CATHY ENGELBERT, CEO, DELOITTE:  Great to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  What do you see when you speak  with corporate executives today in terms of these policies out of  Washington?</p><p>ENGELBERT:  Well, number one, they're all looking for sustained economic  growth, and tax reform, regulatory reform helps them, infrastructure will  probably help a little bit.  And you saw wage increases, one-time bonuses,  investments in facilities.  So, are they looking for a little more  certainty and stability?  Absolutely.  But obviously, trade is complicating  things for them.  I think, you know, we have 36 million of our jobs here in  America are very important export driven.  Trade is 27 percent of our GDP,  so a little stability around this topic would really help.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  Well, Gary B., I haven't been able to find one  person to say, yes, this trade tension is probably going to take a cut from  economic growth expectations.  I'm just -- people are not going there, even  though there's all of this worry.</p><p>SMITH:  I mean, look, I think any kind of trade tariffs are going to be  bad.  I mean, it's a tax.  I mean, as simple as that.  It's going to cut  into the economy, but I think what we've seen and maybe you've seen this,  too, Cathy.  We talked about this before, Trump puts his big chess piece  forward initially and then kind of ramps down.  Do you think this is all  going to be watered-down, you know, in the long run?</p><p>ENGELBERT:  I think in any trade agreement, negotiation is key.  I think  one of the important things will be is as we look at American companies'  fair access to 95 percent of the consumers White House are outside the U.S.   So, this is a chess game but it also is a big balance on negotiating.</p><p>SMITH:  A question from your perspective as CEO of Deloitte.  For your  company, is all this change and uncertainty good for you, or would you  rather have a more stable -- I know how it impacts business, because they  can't plan.  I'm curious for -- is it good or bad for your business?</p><p>ENGELBERT:  I think company confidence is very important for our business,  that companies are confident, they're all transforming.  There's so much  technology emerging.  That's why the intellectual property argument is so  important to get right because every company is becoming a technology  company, digital transformation.  So, all of that is good, but that's all  happening not standing policy.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Cathy, you've talked about the importance of sustained economic  growth, but we're now seeing this $1.3-trillion spending bill, which is not  good for sustained long economic -- I mean, it's -- this is long-term  deficits, debt, red ink, very bad news for the long term.  How does that  affect how companies feel today?  I mean, is that too far in the future, or  do you see that having an impact on how companies are thinking about  investment and where they're going to invest.</p><p>ENGELBERT:  I think companies worry macro about the debt and the deficits,  but as they're looking at the execution of their strategy over the next  three to five years, they have to invest heavily and that's why tax and  regulatory reform is helping them with confidence to do that.  That capital  sitting on the sidelines deployed -- the repatriation of foreign earnings  deployed.  So, they're -- macro, they're worried about debt and deficits,  but kind of as they look at execution of their strategy, they kind of like  what they see around confidence and the ability to bring back those  earnings, invest them in U.S. businesses, U.S. workers, U.S. facilities.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of policy, what do they want to see next?  Excluding  trade potential tariffs, what comes out of the White House, but something  that Congress can do?  Because Brian asked about spending, but what I'll --</p><p>ENGELBERT:  Well, number one is infrastructure, which as we know is a  bipartisan issue but obviously very challenging on where do you find the  money.  Again, get -- back to Brian's point about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were some infrastructure money in that spending plan,  right, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a few billion in that -- in the omnibus spending bill.</p><p>ENGELBERT:  Right.  And, obviously, comprehensive immigration reform as we  look at the future of jobs and the future of work, very important to get  immigration reform skills, funding into education, the business roundtable  is doing some interesting things around workforce development and  education.  So, really, as we see shifts in the American worker, very  important to look at that as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there is the phase two of the tax reform plan that  we're expecting.  The President says that he wants to make the individual  cuts permanent.  Here's what he told a group of millennials yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  The millennials starting out tremendous.  You have a tremendous  advantage over what you had, you're going to pay less taxes, you have far  more incentive, you're going to have a lot more money left in your paycheck  to spend.  We were at about 1.2 percent GDP.  We've now hit 3, and another  3, and a 3.2, and we'll see what this next quarter is, that could be a good  quarter.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phase two reportedly will include individual cuts being  permanent.  What companies are looking for in terms of the tax side of this  story?  Did they get what they needed in that last tax plan to actually  hire more people?</p><p>ENGELBERT:  So, I think they got what they needed.  There was -- not  everybody is happy.  So, there was some negotiation obviously here in New  York City with the SALT, you know, deduction, et cetera.  But I would say  that the one question that CEOs are asking yesterday is how long term is  this?  Will there be a reversal of this kind of policy in 2020 or 2024, or  however you look out the 10 years and make them permanent?  So, they are  looking at the future because they're doing long-term plans right now and  that's where their uncertainty lies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, what about this New York City councilman, Bill, that they  want to make it illegal for companies to require employees to answer work  e-mails or calls after hours.  I don't know how I would do with that.  I'm  always e-mailing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ENGELBERT:  I'm fascinated with that because what are work hours, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what are work hours?</p><p>ENGELBERT:  And we're promoting flexibility and predictability in our 62  percent millennial workforce.  And so, work hours are not 9:00 to 5:00 or  8:00 to 6:00 or 8:00 to 7:00.  We actually pride ourselves on our people  work at different times that are flexible for them and how they're --  whether they have family issues and things like that, so I wouldn't even  know how you implement that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The lefties always float this idea.  It comes up every now and  then. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, we're not 9:00 to 5:00, people. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank God. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Cathy, good to see you.</p><p>ENGELBERT:  Great to see you.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Cathy Engelbert.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Complete reversal in stocks.  We're looking for  a higher opening this morning.  Meanwhile, there's Nike, the stock is up on  one of the handful of Dow components gaining ground before the bell after  topping analysts' expectations with third-quarter earnings.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, watching markets.   Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Friday  morning, we've had a turnaround in Futures.  Nike was the one name that we  saw after the bell yesterday.  We did after the bell, we saw it to the  upside, continues that trend, it's looking up about 4.3 percent.  In fact,  North America was not a bright spot.  They said that will be going forward.   It was the international markets that helped Nike in China and Europe.   Those were some of the areas that actually saw strength in sales on the  rise.  They have a lot of competition here in the States with Adidas, but  the stock, a Dow component is likely to be to the upside today.  This year,  it's about three percent and it will be up this morning as well.  They have  direct selling.  They're using Amazon and selling direct to consumer and  that's been helping them.  </p><p>Let's take a look because I mentioned Amazon, this is a whole another  concept.  You know, Amazon has worked on so many businesses and patents,  one of which is the drone-type patent.  And this one delivers packages but  it will have sensors and cameras to see you waving or shooing it off or  calling to your drone that will be delivering your package.  I'm not sure  how they're going to handle this one, Maria.  What if someone is freaking  out, waving their arms wildly.  The drone won't know what to do.  We'll see  whether or not it comes to fruition.  Back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  The world is changing.  Nicole, thank you.  Nicole  Petallides.</p><p>Meanwhile, a retail deal could be in the works, Kroger and Target  reportedly discussing a merger.  Joining me now, the host of VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Another sign of the Amazon economy.   Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes, I think it is a sign  of the Amazon effect.  But I think this is really all about the delivery  battle, the battle to deliver groceries and other items same day.  We also  have the development today apart from Target maybe getting together with  Kroger, there's another development here, where Whole Foods is looking for  much bigger stores with a warehouse attached.  </p><p>What Amazon wants to do here is, yes, deliver groceries from Whole Foods,  same day, and from the warehouse next door, other Amazon products, next  day.  I see all of these as a development where we're moving towards same- day delivery not of groceries but of all kinds of things.  That's where  we're going, and this Target-Kroger deal may be a deal.  I think that's  part of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you have to do that with same day because you're  talking about fresh items, groceries.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  You know, I've recently discovered Amazon Prime.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good move?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, I mean, it's 2018.  I just got hold of this thing.  I don't  have an account of my own.  I have somebody do it for me, but nonetheless,  it's fantastic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.</p><p>VARNEY:  It is absolutely fantastic.  You want a bar of soap, it's there  next morning.  Unbelievable stuff. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is unbelievable, Stuart, you're right.  All right.   Stu, I know --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, I order --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen has a comment here. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I ordered some succulents the other day, plants, Stuart, from  Amazon Prime, and it -- they were all dead.  It was awful.  I'll never  order --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll never order plants from them again.  But again, my bad that  I'm ordering live living things rather than -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's what -- we're talking about with groceries that same  day, got to be fresh.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Succulents don't do same-day deliver or next-day delivery.   Is that the message here, Dagen?  Watch out for your succulents.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY:  I've been there.  I've been there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You say it so beautifully.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have a lot more.  We'll see you in 10  minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart in 10 minutes' time.</p><p>First, though, a seal of approval for Mr. Rogers.  A sneak peek of the new  stamp honoring the Kids T.V host.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Police say two people are now dead in that  hostage situation we are following in France.  Lauren Simonetti with the  details now.  Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK, Maria.  There are about two -- one dozen people wounded.  A  person who is reportedly pledging allegiance to ISIS is holding a police  officer hostage at a supermarket in Southern France according to the mayor  of that town, Trebes.  Police have the area surrounded.  They're talking to  the hostage taker, all hostages except that police officer have reportedly  been freed.  Police say the suspect fired at police officers about 15  minutes away from the scene, hitting one in a shoulder before they ended up  at the supermarket.  That officer's injury is nonlife-threatening.  </p><p>French television reporting that the attacker asked for the release of a  terrorist that took part in the November 2015 attack in Paris that left 130  people dead.  That happened at many venues, the concert hall being one of  them.  He is the sole survivor in the organized attack.  President Trump  hasn't briefed on this matter and he will continue to be updated.  </p><p>Well, the House Judiciary Committee slapping the Justice Department with a  subpoena for documents related to the Clinton e-mail investigation.   Chairman Bob Goodlatte saying he had no choice since they have only  received a fraction of the roughly 1.2 million documents they requested  months ago.  Goodlatte spoke about this with you, Maria, on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We need to  have those documents, the department and the bureau have been slow.  I  would say, now, very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I was on  your program, I expressed confidence that we would have those documents  forthcoming.  Here, we are several weeks later, still don't have them.  So  this is coming to a head.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So the Department of Justice has two weeks to comply with that  subpoena.</p><p>And the U.S. Postal Service's new forever stamp is honoring Mr. Rogers.  It  goes on sale today.  It shows Rogers in his famous red cardigan along with  one of the puppets in the shows \"Neighborhood of Make-Believe.\"  The stamp  is part of the celebrations that mark the 50th anniversary of the start of  Mr. Rogers' \"Neighborhood.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>FRED ROGERS, AMERICAN TELEVISION SHOW HOST:  Would you be mine?  Could you  be mine?  Won't you be my neighbor?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  His show ran for 33 years from 1968 to 2001 and Fred Rogers  died back in 2003 at the age of 74.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that takes me back, Lauren. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Yes, it does.  </p><p>All right.  We got to get this breaking news.  President Trump is tweeting  about the spending bill.  Look at this, \"I am considering a veto of the  Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA  recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats not even mentioned  in the bill and border wall, which is desperately needed for our National  Defense.  It is not fully funded.\"  We are looking at this, we we're  talking about this earlier, and that's what Congressman DeSantis said right  in this interview.  That he wanted the President to veto this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now, we named three other reasons why it ought to be  vetoed as well beyond what the President is saying here.  So this is a very  interesting development.  Could be an exciting weekend if he decides to do  this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Congress is on their way out for two-week vacation.  We'll  be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can't wait to come back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Friday, everybody.  Here's VARNEY &amp; COMPANY, and Stuart,  take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

European indices look like it's sharply lower. FT-100, down a one percent. CAC Quarante down almost two percent and the DAX Index down better than two percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have a deal, lawmakers avoided a government shutdown passing a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning. We are breaking down those numbers as it heads to the President's desk now. McMaster is out, Bolton is in, more changes coming to the White House as President Trump announces he will replace National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not the only the change, the details as the President's top lawyer in the Russia probe resigns.</p><p>And tragedy in New York City to report, a firefighter killed after a fire breaks out on the set of an Edward Norton movie in Harlem, more on the devastating fire alarm blaze coming up.</p><p>And then a bump to the bank account, United Airlines delivering a massive cheque to give one passenger to give up her seat, the first-class pay day, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to talk all about it, FOX News Business Network, Dagen McDowell. The King's College Business and Economic, Professor Brian Brenberg and Kadina Groups President, Gary B. Smith is here. Good to see you, Gary.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUPS: Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: On a day that we are expecting this market to completely roll over. Good morning Brian and Dagen.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE: Good morning, good to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: My last thought yesterday at the end of this program was markets look out below.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. That's what she said. That was your final comment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it was. Because, again, it's not just the beginnings of a trade war with China. It is not the upset, but it's the fact that you have Congress passing the spending bill, we're running up deficits, we're running up our national debt, which gives us less power to fight.</p><p>SMITH: You sound so bearish, Dagen. Are you thinking the market's going down?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the cost of our debt is going up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You've got the Fed -- the Fed raising rates, reducing its balance sheet, you have a Congress that has no understanding of fiscal responsibility at the same time we try to take on China, the largest owner, foreign owner of our national debt, doesn't add up.</p><p>SMITH: And yet, I will tell you one thing, I am optimistic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get down or up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: On the back cracking on the economy, what are you most bullish on?</p><p>SMITH: Bullish on -- bullish on the market, not right now, not today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SMITH: Bullish on the economy, I'm bullish, I think Trump is basically getting it right and we we're going to talk more about this whole tariffs thing. I think, I am optimistic right now.</p><p>BRENBERG: Well it's certainly not unexpected, right? And he'd been talking about this, and talking at this maybe came later than people thought at but it was going to come.</p><p>SMITH: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the uncertainty to all of this, the trade story is exactly what people were worried about going into the election. Remember when the market was down 700 points on election night it was because of uncertainty around NAFTA, what will Donald Trump do. And this is what we're seeing right here. Coming up this morning joining the conversation, Florida Congressman and House Freedom Caucus Member, Ron DeSantis is with us.</p><p>Remember the (INAUDIBLE) -- Caucus was among the first to say, we're not in on this bill, former FDIC Chairman and founder a Systemic Risk Council, Sheila Bair is with us this morning. Then the author of The Coming Collapse Of China, Gordon Chang will weigh in along with the CEO of Deloitte Cathy Engelbert is here. Plus elevation partner, cofounder, managing director and investor and Mark Zuckerberg's mentor, Roger McNamee, one of the leader shareholders in Facebook for some time. We're going to talk with Roger about what took place on Facebook and this market this week.</p><p>But first, we want to kick it off right now, with the trade war hitting global markets, stocks across Asia tumbled, following directions from Wall Street. Take a look at the numbers here, of course we know that all the majors in Asia were down between three and 4.5 percent. Japan being the worst down 4.5 percent.</p><p>Back in the U.S., the Dow closed down more than 700 points yesterday after President Trump proposed tariffs of up to $60 billion on imports from China along with tighter restrictions on the country's acquisition and technology transfers, It was in response to what the administration is calling China's unfair trading practices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're doing things for this country that should've been done for many, many years. We've had this abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put together in order to take advantage of the United States and we don't want that to happen. We're not going to let that happen. I t's probably one of the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hours later the Chinese government fired back saying that it plans to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on U.S. goods in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum which go into effect today. The U.S. now says some allies including Canada, Mexico and the E.U. among others will get a brief exemption from the tariffs. Joining us right now to talk more about that is Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York, a former small business owner, congresswoman good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. And I know you're back on a lot to talk about small business and about lending money get into that. But first, let's talk about these tariffs, good idea or are you against?</p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK: I tend to be more on Gary's side. Gary B's got the idea. I think, the terms on to something, I did a Pentagon article last year 2016 about the problem we have with China. That was the tariffs hacking, what's happening overall in terms of currency. All this things affects small businesses. I'm a small business owner in upstate New York. And put together with the -- all the things that China's doing, I mean, we're trying to move in a direction that we're kind of correct, trying to correct this, I think, that's what you're seeing in the market, I hoping that's a correction, I hope Dagen's dire prediction here is not true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you say about the fact that China is coming back now and saying, really, we're going to tariff you? And so now we are looking at a serious retaliatory story.</p><p>TENNEY: Yes, I think it's stupid, I mean, Kim Jong-un also reacted to President Trump, to some strong language. But think about what's happening here tough, China actually has the biggest marketplace in the world that you want to have access to, and that's the United States. We are where the consumers are and so, they want to get access to us too. So, that's something that they've got to weigh in to the negotiation. They're business model I think is flawed in the end. We know that they've set up these state-run businesses that -- and that's how they operate. I mean, much like what's done in New York State under our current governor, but we know that that kind of cronie is in that kind of set up of state-run businesses in the long run doesn't work which is why I tend to favor that we've got to do something now, how long are we going wait? How long are we going to let China cheat? How long are we going, you know, steeling our intellectual property from our steel companies and others and I think that's what Wilbur Ross and the President are recognizing and something has to be done and maybe this is a very short-term pain that may end up being, you know, long-term gain for us.</p><p>BRENBERG: What about the uncertainty this creates for small businesses? You are small business owners, you understand they're trying to make plans, now they're saying, you know, which of this 1300 products is going to be hit by a tariff, how big is the tariff? That's very hard for a small shop to deal with, is that a big concern here or do you think that's very, very temporary?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Prices will go up.</p><p>TENNEY: Right, it is a concern especially for the smaller businesses. We have some of the small business in area. We have a company called share manufacturing which took over the older night limited which went under and went to Asia where there's manufacturing, they're dependent on purchasing steel as well, but I also have another number of companies in my district that also are steel companies and they like to see a little bit of help. And, they're use to buy older steel from American based companies and now they're buying it from overseas. I do think we need -- we're going to see an adjustment in the market, but I think making tariffs in more targeted way, using currency, looking at the tax reform is something that's going to be helpful to us in the long run, especially, this past through businesses. In my region which is the order of the day, we do know they produce most of the jobs. This is the only way you're going to bring the Rust Belt back, I lived in the Rust Belt of New York.</p><p>SMITH: Well Congresswoman you bring up a very interesting point and I think some people ignore it. We're a China's biggest buyer --</p><p>TENNEY: Absolutely.</p><p>SMITH: -- by almost 4-1. How can you have a trade war, an active trade war with your biggest buyer?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they already have a $375 billion surplus on us. Where are the 375 billion deficit? So, are they going to threaten that huge surplus with these tariffs?</p><p>SMITH: It'd be like 3M selling tape to Wal-Mart, having a trade war with Wal-Mart. You know, they buy a lot more tape than Wal-Mart buys from 3M, so it would be silly, wouldn't it?</p><p>TENNEY: I agree with you. It's -- we are the market place. Where are they going to sell goods and services, they create this enormous state- owned businesses, this big plants and companies, fancy new equipment. And then they say, come in and we'll run these for you. Remember, people that move to China, they don't own their businesses, they're owned by the state. And so people have to recognize that this isn't a situation where you have, you know, you have this actual free market going on. You have government run the industries against a supposed free market enter the United States that we something we're trying to get back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All true but they are still out this morning saying that they're going to put this retaliatory tariffs in place. Look, we've got to talk about this $1.3 trillion spending bill, congresswoman. You averted a shutdown and of course, looking to a $1.3 trillion spending package, deliver to the President's steps now. It includes defense as well as domestic spending, the measure is headed to the President's desk for signature but a lot of pushback here, you voted yes.</p><p>TENNEY: I did and it was a very hard vote. I'm a fiscal conservative. I hate the fact that we're spending, I don't like the fact that we're dependent in all of this deafen deficit. We tried to get this done through our American Health Care Act. Remember, we had significant reforms to the mandatory spending side. We didn't get that done. We got a thumbs down vote from one person in the Senate, that prevented us from getting to that mandatory spending side, which is so large with the eclipse is what we do in the discretionary side. But that being said, we have a short-term fix, it's ugly, they called it the big ugly when I was in New York States, somebody when a woman I would call it the big ugly now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why can't you just say no -- why can't you just say no to the Democrats that want all the spending?</p><p>TENNEY: To be honest, I would love to say no, the President actually supported this. My biggest concern and my son is an active duty Marine Officer who's -- who has indicated to me and we have met with General Mattis and numerous people on that side, we have seriously degraded our military over the years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Agreed.</p><p>TENNEY: And that is being held as a big club to us and when you see more of our good servicemen and women are hardworking, honourably serving people, die in training than in combat. There is a problem with what we're doing in our military side and General Mattis has said, the only thing more dangerous than our most dangerous enemies is Congress. And we need to act and we needed to do something with our military. Sadly it came at a price.</p><p>MCDOWELL: 80 billion in defense spending increase above the 2011 sequester levels, 63 billion increase in domestic spending, the issue is because now Congress, Republicans and Democrats have signed off on higher spending levels, we now get into the trillion dollar annual budget deficits. What that ultimately will do given the $21 trillion that we have in debt already. We're going to be spending more on interest on our debt in less than a decade in just a matter of years than we spend on our military. So, this might be a short-term fix for the spending in our military and those who are serving this country. However, we put that very spending and put our safety in jeopardy because we can't rein in our spending. That is the catch --</p><p>TENNEY: But I think we can reign on our spending. Let me -- let me -- let me understand, we do not have 51 reliable votes in the Senate. OK, we don't -- forget 60, we don't have 51 reliable votes. We proved that in our attempt to pass the American Health Care act through reconciliation. A lot of this things --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right and you got a big this --</p><p>TENNEY: Right, a lot of the things we could fix, we could do on regulate order if we had enough votes, even a simple majority I would advocate to the Senate to go back to the simple majority. We don't have 51 reliable votes and think about this, in my district alone, we once had an Air Force base that was closed. We now have one of the most significant assets, that's called Roam Labs, this asset is producing cutting-edge technology for the future of our military conflicts. Will create efficiencies, will make us able to be deal with the ace of symmetrical enemies that we face now. So, it's really important that some of things happened.</p><p>They also produced a lot of jobs in my region which have been lost. I have some of the largest at migration in the state of New York in the country. And so, these are companies that are, you know, companies that are also part of the former Air Force base, companies that are dependent, that our military has depended on for many of our technologies. So advocated for those for me to turn around and say, I'm advocating for these in appropriation side, and to say, by the way, I'm not going to vote for it because I don't like what happened on the domestic side because we had to meet the needs of what? The Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The irony is though, the Republicans are now at even greater risk of losing the majority in the House and the Senate because of the tariffs and the retaliation from China. If you look at hawk-producing states and soy bean producers, those dairy farmers because of the retaliation by China and the U.S. actions are going to get smacked on the face and those are the very areas of this country that Trump won. These are the states like Iowa that sent him over the top in terms of Electoral College.</p><p>TENNEY: There were technical corrections though in the appropriation process in some of this issues that were in the tax bill that would help us some of the trade and somebody issues in there. We still need to revisit NAFTA, we still need to revisit all this trade deals and even I think I knew on unilateral basis. I don't think -- Trump what he say, (INAUDIBLE) the word of the day reciprocal trade now, we've gone from free fair to reciprocal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, China's calling it retaliatory. Real quick on John Bolton, H.R. out, Bolton in, your thoughts.</p><p>TENNEY: Yes, you know, I like John Bolton, I think it's -- I just think it's interesting that the President's choices and let's see how that works out but I think John is very strong person, I think he's going to be an interesting to see the strong personalities in the White House. Although we've had a number of them in the past, we'll see where they end up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks, Claudia, thanks very much, great to see you.</p><p>TENNEY: Thank you, great to see you too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Practical approach from Claudia Tenney joining us there. Breaking news right now, the President is tweeting this morning, here's what he says: House Intelligence Committee voting to release final report, the finding: One: no evidence provided of collusion between Trump campaign and Russia, number two: the Obama administrations post-election response was insufficient and three: Clapper, inconsistent, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's going to be another tough day at the office as we've been saying. Look at the Dow Industrials down 150 points right now, on top of the 700 plus selloff yesterday. We are watching markets this morning, NASDAQ down 60.</p><p>Meanwhile a tragic night in New York, a city firefighter killed in a raging five-alarm fire in a Harlem film set. Lauren Simonetti, with the details and headlines. Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, fatal fire, Maria. Flames broke out last night in a, you know, in a movie set in the basement of closed club, firefighter Michael Davidson, Engine Company first to arrive, rushed to the basement of the club but officials say once they got down there, the fire was too strong, it forced them to retreat, Davidson somehow got separated from the other firefighters and when they found him, he was unconscious and could not be revived. He's 37 year's old and leaves behind his wife and four young children.</p><p>Well, liquidation sales at Toys \"R\" Us they are set to start today, the company apologizing for what it calls unforeseen circumstances. They were expected to begin yesterday, push back to today. Toys \"R\" Us it's lasting prices as it prepares to close about 800 U.S. stores. And a sad note, Toys \"R\" Us founder, Charles Lazarus died yesterday, he was 94 year's old.</p><p>And this, a woman bumped from a United Airlines flight gets a $10,000 travel voucher. This after she launched a pretty angry Tweet storm after the airline oversold the flight and asked her specifically to get off the plane because she paid the least for her ticket out of everyone else on board. One of her Tweets said, United tried to get me to sign a document that says I volunteered my seat on this plane when I was involuntarily denied boarding. But now she says after that voucher, it was the best place ever. $10,000, you can go to a lot of places.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess yes, thank you Lauren. Coming up thousands of students from across the country will march in Washington against gun violence in the wake of the Parkland massacre. One of the shooting survivors will tell us why he's not attending.</p><p>And then a bright spot amid the rough week, the technology stocks as Dropbox debuts on the Nasdaq with a higher than expected share price. We'll see what happens to the stock at the opening in a down market, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, investors' concerns over possible trade war rocking Wall Street today and yesterday Futures currently indicating a decline at the start of trading of 160 points. That's two-thirds of one percent. Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 also down one percent and 1/2 of a percent. It's coming after its sharp selloff yesterday, the Dow was down better than 700 points yesterday. It was the biggest one-day percentage decline since early February. Joining us right now to weigh in, is a Chief Investor Strategist for CFRA research, Sam Stovall. Sam, good to see you. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTOR STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, happy to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you're talking about a backdrop which is pretty positive. How do you see these markets here?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, this is the correction that people that have been talking about. And actually, I believe it's more of the retest of the correction that had bottomed in February 8th. Maybe we go and we touch the rising 200 day moving average which is around 25-85, so there's probably further downside to go but at the same time, I remind investors that we're down less than eight percent from the January 26 high, and so, therefore, the numbers look large but on a percentage basis, it's actually a run of the mill kind of decline.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you're not as worried. Gary B., you just said the same thing? (INAUDIBLE) optimistic.</p><p>SMITH: I'm optimistic, here's the only, not the only, maybe one of the flies (INAUDIBLE) the fang stocks that pretty much been leading, carrying the market on their shoulders. We've seen a little bit of, you know, correction --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or a lot, 10 percent down on Facebook. Facebook down 10 percent --</p><p>SMITH: What are the future -- yes, what's the future of those stocks, do you think?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, I still think that the future looks pretty good. We actually are technology set to group heads, Scott Kessler upgraded Facebook to a strong buy, feeling that this is being overdone and that there is more opportunity there. If you look to those groups that are trading above their ten week, 50 day moving averages, still, you do have the internet stocks above that moving average, so Netflix looking at Amazon are still doing relatively well.</p><p>SMITH: What's the next -- I think, everyone wants to know, what's the next fang stock? We got those, what's going to be the next one? That's what we want to buy, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: The CISCO's of the world are not trading the way Facebook is in terms of valuation, I'm just saying, it's a --</p><p>STOVALL: Exactly. And also the semiconductor, semiconductor equipment, application software, those groups are trading above their 50 day --</p><p>SMITH: No, no, what I want to know, I want to know what is going to be, we're going to look five years from now, I wish I had bought that stock. You can't say Amazon or Netflix.</p><p>STOVALL: Well, thanks for the opportunity to do this research ahead of time. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We all want that answer. On the near term, you're expecting for the decline, for longer term you sound like you're still pretty bullish on this market?</p><p>STOVALL: Yes, I do. I don't think Trump wants to go down as the next Republican President to initiate a recession even though every single one since Teddy Roosevelt had one occur in the first two years in office.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>STOVALL: So, I don't think he wants to continue that tradition.</p><p>BRENBERG: So, does the trade spat here and quickly?</p><p>STOVALL: I think that similar to what we have seen with the tariffs on aluminum and steel that were broad base to begin with, now we have special exemptions for our favorable trading partners. I think, that this still looks like it's more of a negotiation ploy that could then be softened as we move forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By coming from a businessman that's a wrench in to people who do business in this country through used steel and aluminum. Because they're sitting around the last several weeks. So, how much is my steel going to cost? I source it from these countries, are they going to be exempt, calling people on the phone, going, can you give us some clarity on this and it's still not that clear.</p><p>STOVALL: Well, you're going to see a real-life example in a couple of minutes because I was chatting with your next guest in the green room and he has challenges because of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, thank you for that tease. We really appreciate that.</p><p>STOVALL: No charge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And coming up, Sir Sam Stovall, good to see you. Thank you so much, what a week it's been. We've had a great show here following all the ups and downs out of Washington, take a look at some of the top moments from this program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you worry that any of this growth story which obviously is a big reason coming from the tax plan is going to get impacted by this tariffs?</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA: Yes, we are growing, we don't want to harm or slow it down but I also think, we have to stand up to China what they've been doing. As the President stands up to China, China realizes they've done something wrong and now they're finally standing up to North Korea, they realize, there's a new sheriff in town and the world's going to be a little different in this administration.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR: All we want is to defend ourselves against economic aggression and I see this as bullish for corporate America. China is doing a lot better with this trade relationship than we are. I don't see them wanting to jeopardize that. They know -- they know what they've been doing and taking from us and actually they're probably surprised that finally a President is willing to stand up for the American people and for American companies.</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH: I don't agree with Mr. Navarro. I don't think that he's living in the real world. This other countries are not going to put up with it. It's -- I think it's ridiculous between you and me. I expect to push back from China. I don't think there's any question about that. But the question is, are we in a position economically to really fight them?</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, TALK RADIO HOST: Everybody take a chill pill. This is how you get the Chinese to the table. When you impose a tariff which I agree with others on your panel, it is a tax, this is how you get them to the table, this is how you have serious talks about levelling the playing field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to read you, Governor, MiKE Huckabee's tweet. He (INAUDIBLE), I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending bill.</p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R), ARKANSAS: Look, Mike Huckabee is a great friend of mine. And that's easy to say from the outside looking in but as I said before, I believe strongly that we have a mandate to provide for the security of this country and in order to be able to get the gains that we did for the Pentagon and for national -- the national security apparatus, there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I love it. He's a great Congressman, but I'm going to just say this, tell the Democrats we're going to fund the military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and you can either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or you can join us, and if you think that we are wrong, then you go get elected to the majorities. These guys are got to start learning to play some hardball.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think the biggest headline is, now we know at least one person who is not going to be running for the presidency ever, Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that these companies have more power than they ever had and more information about Americans than they ever had.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: We'll be holding hearings, there's no two ways about it. But the irony here is a lot of Americans are OK with what we would call this edge providers, whether it's Google or Facebook or Amazon knowing something about you so they can give you recommendations. A lot of Americans are fine with that and a lot are not. The problem is right now, is in many cases no one's asking your permission.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you say you wish you really would have known the importance of having a budget.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT: The importance of having a budget is just being in control. You telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's what I learn in my 20's, for your first marriage go to the Courthouse and tell people send you cheques.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Forget all the China thing, you said you love and you think you're going to use it. You're not going to use the China.</p><p>HOGAN: Maria, what we need to do is all get together and collaborate and make a book for these new millennials out there to help them to avoid some of this traps.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The best thing about Washington, now, Marlon Bundo is making big literary debut.</p><p>KAREN PENCE, SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: This is my first book to illustrate and we've had lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You must have fun just working together.</p><p>PENCE: We really do. And Marlon is great, he really -- he poses, he knows, he thinks as, you know, this is my best side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How funny and adorable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday. It is Friday, March 23rd; your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Stocks battered on Wall Street and the selling continues this morning, the major indices selling off over growing fears of a trade war, President Trump, signing his tariffs against China, yesterday, and that triggering even more selling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have a trade deficit depending on the way you calculate of $504 billion. Now, some people would say it's really $375 billion. But any way you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It's out of control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: China is firing back this morning. It is announcing its own tariffs on U.S. goods going into China. Global markets are following the U.S. lower. Take a look at the selloffs underway right now. The FT-100, down three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down one and two-thirds percent, also one and two-thirds lower, on the DAX Index in Germany. In Asia overnight, sharp declines across-the-board, the Nikkei Average, the worst performer, down 4-1/2 percent in Japan.</p><p>Shanghai and Korea, both down better than three percent. Looking ahead to the open, more selling, Futures are indicating a lower opening. Now, this is off of the lows of the morning. Nonetheless, we're expecting a decline at the start of trading of 122 points, that's one half of one percent. The S&amp;P is down nine points and the NASDAQ is down 56, that's almost one percent. Then there's this, the House Judiciary Committee, making it official.</p><p>It issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for documents in the Clinton e-mail investigation, as we told you, it would. New questions in the Uber self-driving car accident, the focus, now, turning to the test driver and how the company selects those drivers, the woman behind the wheel was a convicted felon. One NFL player walking back his anthem protest, why he helps the move, will have teams picking up the phone. And Sister Jean and Loyola Chicago, living on a prayer, and some great play on the court, with the latest from Sweet 16, where Michigan dominated again.</p><p>All that coming up, but first, students set to hold a march for our lives rally in Washington D.C., another cities across the country, tomorrow, as they push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the recent school shooting. Joining us now is the -- a survivor of the Parkland School shooting, Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior, Kyle Kashuv. Kyle, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us again.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS: Thank you for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You will not be attending that march, why not?</p><p>KASHUV: I'm going to be too busy meeting with legislators and pushing for actual change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, do you not see it as important to be -- to be there with your classmates and others?</p><p>KASHUV: One thing, it's definitely amazing that they can march but if -- I mean, I'm taking the fast track that's actually pushing a change, because I really don't want to see Parkland ever happen again. And, I could march, but I think my time would be much better well spent meeting with legislators.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good for you.</p><p>BRENBERG: Kyle, how did your classmates respond to this? I mean, you're spending some time with them but you're not doing a lot of the important things that they are doing. Are they pushing back hard against this? Did they welcome the fact that you're taking an alternative view point? How do you respond?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, there he is in the White House with the President and the First Lady. This is what he's doing.</p><p>BRENBERG: It's amazing. I'm just curious how they respond to that.</p><p>KASHUV: Well, a lot of them view what they're doing as more productive and effective than meeting with legislators to (INAUDIBLE) I think that meeting, first hand, with legislators and trying to explain to them your point of view and to explain to them what's necessary and what needs to be done, is more important than walking down on Washington D.C., and which is fine, even if from point of opinion. But I truly believe that if you want change, you go to legislators.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kyle, quick question, what percentage of your classmates are actually marching?</p><p>KASHUV: I don't know the percentage, but I would give you most likely, 90 plus percent of all my peers will be marching whether in Parkland or Washington D.C.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, you got a large percentage of your classmates, marching. Do you think there's certainly -- I mean, I remember my days from high school, you think most of these are really just viewing the marches up, just the way to goof off or do you think they're really serious?</p><p>KASHUV: I mean, I think there are definitely some people who are coming seriously, but a lot of people saw that -- that you could get a free 40- trip to Washington D.C.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.</p><p>KASHUV: then why not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let me ask you because we see this Time Magazine covers. Several of your classmates are on the latest cover of Time, titled Enough. You were not in this picture, on the cover of Time Magazine. Did they ask you to be on the shot?</p><p>KASHUV: Well, they didn't ask me. But honestly, I didn't know Time Magazine was still a thing. I know I wasn't asked. No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you think that is?</p><p>KASHUV: I don't -- maybe -- I think maybe they're trying to represent only one point of view, the Democrat point of view and the anti-gun -- the anti- gun. A movement -- I honestly couldn't tell you because if they are really trying to get the full perspective they would ask me and especially Patrick Patty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm wondering if you are in fact, seeing pushback because you take a different view, a more conservative view on this topic. I know that you had a recent incident with Spirit Airlines. You tweeted about it. We're going to show you tweet right here, Kyle. You say, just landed in Baltimore on Spirit Airlines and the steward is felt compelled to give us all a speech about the March for Our Lives, which openly says on the petition, are trying to categorically ban AR-15s and made everyone clap.</p><p>Can anything just be non-political anymore? Spirit tweeted an apology after your tweet. And Spirit Airlines said, while we appreciate that one team members -- our Team Members are individuals, we don't believe politics should be part of the Guest experience. We're looking into the incident. We apologize to any guests offended by these comments. Is this apology enough for you, Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV: I mean, I want -- I wasn't offended to begin with. I just thought that what they're doing was stupid and unnecessary that they're giving a speech for all the passengers, how much they support the March. I just thought it was unnecessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But go back and talk to us about your views here, because this is the whole crocs of the story. I mean, the fact that you've taken a different position, you're not looking for, you know, specific, you know, an impact on the second amendment. You say that there are rules in place that should've been followed and there were missed signals. Where are you on this? Tell us why you think you're seeing some pushback against your views?</p><p>KASHUV: Well, I think, I'm definitely getting some pushbacks because I'm not taking, like, the mass majority opinion on this, so just everyone's just following each other, inspiringly in a loop of talking points. I mean, I've taken a step back and I've looked at all the facts and I have come to the conclusion that what I think I'm doing right now is what needs to be done versus just marching and screaming about gun control.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, have you met with both Democrat and Republican law makers?</p><p>KASHUV: Yes, across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And where do you see consensus among them in terms of tightening gun regulations, we have gun regulations in this country or where do you think that they can all come together and do something again? FixNix was kind of easy, closing some of the loopholes or trying to tighten up the background check database.</p><p>KASHUV: Well, I think first hand, every legislator I talk to, across the board, they truly care and they don't want to see this happen -- they really do --they don't want to see this ever happen to any of the constituents, ever again. What I think that every single lawmaker agreed on, was that they want to see that people who are mentally disturbed, can acquire weapon., and they want to make sure there are background check systems is actually being implemented, and all the information is going through. They want to see the clear reporting and the full reporting of information of disturbed individuals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, there are some changes happening to your school right now, in terms of security. Let's talk about that for a second, Kyle.</p><p>KASHUV: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The superintendent says that students are now going to be required to use clear backpacks and metal detectors may be installed. Do you agree with these moves? What about this clear backpack?</p><p>KASHUV: I mean, I honestly think that it's going to protect our schools and if this is what determined that it's absolutely necessary to make sure this won't happen again, then, we shouldn't be opposed to -- we should be in favor of it. Yes, it'll be a little bit of discomfort, but look, that's the price you pay for going to school safely. I mean, I would prefer that I could come to school safely, not have to fear if that man having a clear backpack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. And the metal detectors you're also comfortable with. I mean, you have said in the past that what's wrong having an armed guard at the school, right?</p><p>KASHUV: Yes, I mean, let's do everything possible to make sure that school is safe. Yes, it might cause some discomfort for some kids. We don't have to wait a few minutes to get to the metal detectors, hopefully not three hours, but that's what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kyle, thanks so much for weighing in this morning. Good to see you again.</p><p>KASHUV: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kyle Kashuv, joining us there. Coming up, getting answers, House Judiciary Committee officially subpoenas the justice department over the Hillary Clinton e-mail server probe. We knew it was coming. We've got more on in this morning, and then another night at bracket-buster, as March madness rolls toward the elite eight, the upsets and the triumphs, coming up, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Markets are off of their lows, as you just saw them. Meanwhile, heavy rains in Southern California have residents on alert this morning for possible flash flooding, mudslides. Lauren Simonetti with all the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hi, Maria, this threat is just two months after deadly mudslides struck killing 21 people. Rainfall rate this time around could be as high as an inch per hour and Santa Barbara County's 30,000 people told to evacuate.</p><p>We're also learning more about Sunday's fatal crash in Arizona, involving a self-driving Uber vehicle. According to Arizona state records, and we've shown you this video, it is disturbing to watch. The safety driver right there, Rafael Vasquez, 44-years-old, was a convicted felon for attempted armed robbery along with the number of traffic violations. A police video shows him looking down, as you can see right before the car struck and killed a female pedestrian. Uber says, Vasquez met standard background check requirements and that he does still work for the company.</p><p>Well, the House Judiciary Committee is slapping the Justice Department with a subpoena for documents related to the Clinton e-mail server investigation. Chairman Bob Goodlatte saying he had no choice since they have only received a fraction of the roughly 1.2 million documents that they requested months ago. Goodlatte spoke about this on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", Maria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We need to have those documents. The department and the bureau have been slow. I would say, now, very slow in getting them to us. The last time I was on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later, still don't have them. So, this is coming to a hit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Here we are. The Justice Department has two weeks to comply with this subpoena.</p><p>Well, it's the day for an IPO. The cloud storage company, Dropbox, bumping the price of its shares in its initial public offering to $21.00, that's the second hike for Dropbox. They had previously set a range of $16.00- $18.00 a pop. The bump up shows strong demand among the investors. Shares start trading today on the NASDAQ, the symbol is DBX, the company is valued at over $8 billion. So, we're talking about the big tech company struggling lately. How are the unicorns going to do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see how the deal does today even in the face of a down market. Lauren, thank you so much. Dropbox -- I want to get your take on that later. Dagen, this subpoena, we knew this was coming. Bob Goodlatte told me on Sunday that it was coming. I find it extraordinary that they can request 1.2 million documents and only get 3000 back. How is it possible that the FBI just blows off the committee that has jurisdiction over it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think some of the blame needs to be directed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that I think that it's the entrenched old-school lifelong government workers who are part of the problem here. But again, who's running the FBI? Jeff Sessions, I know, he's recused himself in any matters dealing with Russia, but what about Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you're right. I mean, somebody has got to enforce this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they've only received 3000 of the documents.</p><p>BRENBERG: The numbers look so ludicrous. I mean, 3000 over -- it looks like, forget about it, just told defiance. I think Americans feel like, there's a million document, let's give a big chunk of those and see what's there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And by the way, don't forget when our friend, Jason Chaffetz, was running the Oversight Committee and he went into a hearing and said, you are officially served. He handed the subpoena to the FBI, months before this subpoena, and they still didn't comply. So, I don't know, but you're right, it's up to Jeff Sessions. Somebody has to enforce this to get those documents within this investigation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm still -- I'm (INAUDIBLE) awaiting the inspector general's report, particularly. It's only been -- it's been less than a week since Andrew McCabe got fired.</p><p>SMITH: You're right about one thing: you're fighting the real backbone, which is the entrenched government employees, which typically lean to the left. And they're certainly as we've seen time and time after again, they're anti-Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They only sleep on their left side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to have Devin Nunes on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, your hair is thin on the one side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, then your arm hurts you. We're going to have Devin Nunes on, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", Chairman of the Intel Committee, to take more about that. We'll take a quick break right here. NFL Free Agent, Eric Reid, walking away from kneeling. We will tell you why a big supporter of Colin Kaepernick is saying now, what he's saying now about the pregame protest. Plus, the sting of the Hornets -- Charlotte makes NBA history with a massive blowout win. Sports is next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Here's our -- four games, three upsets in the NCAA March Madness. Jared Max with the highlights, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER: March Madness indeed, Maria. Out of 17.3 million brackets in ESPN's tournament challenge, you know how many picked all four that won last night? 349, which is actually somewhat remarkable considering the unlikelihood of these results -- a matchup of Wildcats. Kentucky favored to beat Kansas State, but K-state cats, scratched this tie breaking layup for Barry Brown with 19 seconds left, K- state scores the upset 61-58. One win for the first final four since 1964.</p><p>The number nine seeded Wildcats play Saturday in the elite eight? the 11- seated Ramblers from Loyola Chicago. When it's time for leaving, I hope you understand, I was born a rambling man in Rambler. Its town says, it's not time for leaving yet. Loyola Chicago beats Nevada, 69-68. They're in the elite eight for the first time in 55 years since 98-year-old Team Chaplan, Sister Jean. Getting lots of brotherly love from the Ramblers players. So, we're number nine seed one -- a number 11 seed one.</p><p>And another number nine, football powerhouse, Florida State knocked out last year's runner-up, Gonzaga. Seminoles win 75 to 60 in the regional finals for the third time. The only game that went as expect, third seed, Michigan, won its 12th straight. The Wolverines eliminated Texas A&amp;M, 99- 72. Michigan plays Florida State four more games tonight, including the only number one seeds left, Kansas and Villanova in action.</p><p>Record-setting night in the NBA: Charlotte Hornets became only the sixth team ever to win a game by 60 points or more. Wild night, Dwight Howard, not part of the mix. He served the one-game suspension; didn't matter. As the Hornets did something we haven't seen in 20 years with this type of blowout. Kemba Walker hit 10, three-pointers, a team record. They win by 61 points. Walker at 46 points and only 28 minutes -- nobody had ever scored that many in so few minutes since the shot clock came to date.</p><p>Hey, Johnny Manziel, making a comeback, former high spin trophy winner, sober, looking healthy, full-faced, in football shape, attracted scouts from 13 NFL teams yesterday at a pro-day work at San Diego. Unemployed NFL free safety, Eric Reid, one of the original national anthem kneelers with former teammate, Colin Kaepernick, says he's not going to kneel anymore. He says, the message was understood that they didn't kneel to protest the national anthem. Question: when you and your significant other do yoga, do you ever try to re-create the scene in dirty dancing? As Patriots Quarterback, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen did. They've had the time of their lives and, Maria, they've never felt this way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow! Look at that.</p><p>BRENBERG: I don't want to know that, Jared. I just -- I don't what to know that last piece.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tom Brady is pretty and tolerable, but somehow he just managed to become even more.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BRENBERG: Come on! Keep it to yourself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's doing yoga.</p><p>BRENBERG: Keep it to yourself.</p><p>SMITH: What you do in privacy of your yoga sessions. Johnny Manziel, you can't keep your eyes off of him. Is he going to sign with them or anything?</p><p>MAX: I think so. The 13 scouts there to watch throw. He looks healthy. He looks like he's ready to play football. Because he looks so sick for a while and not doing well.</p><p>BRENBERG: I love the comeback stories. I'd love to see it happen.</p><p>MAX: We love the comebacks. You know, Tiger Woods, we're all rooting for now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's not compare Johnny Manziel to Tiger Woods.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Johnny Manziel has proved that --</p><p>MAX: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- he can't play professional football.</p><p>BRENBERG: I want the comeback story here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: O wanted Tom Brady to fall on, still.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But he did it. They are perfect. You need to understand they're perfect. That's it, Dagen. Jared, thank you. Jared's sports reports Fox News Headlines 24/7 and SiriusXM 115, catch him. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us this Friday. It is Friday, March 23rd, your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018032301cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXY-RPJ1-JB20-G15M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00022SO</classCode><className>UNITED AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI0M0I0QjVFQjkwNDdCMzgwQUIyNTU4RUE4NTkyQUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjRFNjIwMDZBQ0FBNDdBRkFGRTMxMkE0RUNGMEVEMkQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Overbooking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEI0REIwQTdCREFFNEFEM0E2MjFBQzgyMzE0MkZDRjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DECC</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp;

European indices look like  it's sharply lower.  FT-100, down a one percent.  CAC Quarante down almost  two percent and the DAX Index down better than two percent.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We have a deal, lawmakers avoided a government shutdown passing a massive  $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning.  We are breaking down those  numbers as it heads to the President's desk now.  McMaster is out, Bolton  is in, more changes coming to the White House as President Trump announces  he will replace National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to former U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Not the only the change, the details as the President's top lawyer in the  Russia probe resigns.  </p><p> And tragedy in New York City to report, a firefighter killed after a fire  breaks out on the set of an Edward Norton movie in Harlem, more on the  devastating fire alarm blaze coming up.</p><p> And then a bump to the bank account, United Airlines delivering a massive  cheque to give one passenger to give up her seat, the first-class pay day,  coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to talk  all about it, FOX News Business Network, Dagen McDowell.  The King's  College Business and Economic, Professor Brian Brenberg and Kadina Groups  President, Gary B. Smith is here.  Good to see you, Gary.</p><p> GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUPS:  Nice to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On a day that we are expecting this market to completely roll  over.  Good morning Brian and Dagen.  </p><p> BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning, good to see you.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  My last thought yesterday at the end of this  program was markets look out below.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's what she said.  That was your final  comment.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it was.  Because, again, it's not just the beginnings of a  trade war with China.  It is not the upset, but it's the fact that you have  Congress passing the spending bill, we're running up deficits, we're  running up our national debt, which gives us less power to fight.</p><p> SMITH:  You sound so bearish, Dagen.  Are you thinking the market's going  down?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did yesterday.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the cost of our debt is going up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You've got the Fed -- the Fed raising rates, reducing its  balance sheet, you have a Congress that has no understanding of fiscal  responsibility at the same time we try to take on China, the largest owner,  foreign owner of our national debt, doesn't add up.</p><p> SMITH:  And yet, I will tell you one thing, I am optimistic.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Get down or up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On the back cracking on the economy, what are you most bullish  on?</p><p> SMITH:  Bullish on -- bullish on the market, not right now, not today.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SMITH:  Bullish on the economy, I'm bullish, I think Trump is basically  getting it right and we we're going to talk more about this whole tariffs  thing.  I think, I am optimistic right now.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Well it's certainly not unexpected, right?  And he'd been  talking about this, and talking at this maybe came later than people  thought at but it was going to come.  </p><p> SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the uncertainty to all of this, the trade story is exactly  what people were worried about going into the election.  Remember when the  market was down 700 points on election night it was because of uncertainty  around NAFTA, what will Donald Trump do.  And this is what we're seeing  right here.  Coming up this morning joining the conversation, Florida  Congressman and House Freedom Caucus Member, Ron DeSantis is with us.  </p><p> Remember the (INAUDIBLE) -- Caucus was among the first to say, we're not in  on this bill, former FDIC Chairman and founder a Systemic Risk Council,  Sheila Bair is with us this morning.  Then the author of The Coming  Collapse Of China, Gordon Chang will weigh in along with the CEO of  Deloitte Cathy Engelbert is here.  Plus elevation partner, cofounder,  managing director and investor and Mark Zuckerberg's mentor, Roger McNamee,  one of the leader shareholders in Facebook for some time.  We're going to  talk with Roger about what took place on Facebook and this market this  week.  </p><p> But first, we want to kick it off right now, with the trade war hitting  global markets, stocks across Asia tumbled, following directions from Wall  Street.  Take a look at the numbers here, of course we know that all the  majors in Asia were down between three and 4.5 percent.  Japan being the  worst down 4.5 percent.  </p><p> Back in the U.S., the Dow closed down more than 700 points yesterday after  President Trump proposed tariffs of up to $60 billion on imports from China  along with tighter restrictions on the country's acquisition and technology  transfers, It was in response to what the administration is calling China's  unfair trading practices.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing things for this  country that should've been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States and we don't want  that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  I t's probably one of  the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hours later the Chinese government fired back saying that it  plans to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on U.S.  goods in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum which go into effect  today.  The U.S. now says some allies including Canada, Mexico and the E.U.  among others will get a brief exemption from the tariffs.  Joining us right  now to talk more about that is Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York, a  former small business owner, congresswoman good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  And I know you're back on a lot to talk about small  business and about lending money get into that.  But first, let's talk  about these tariffs, good idea or are you against?</p><p> REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  I tend to be more on Gary's side.  Gary  B's got the idea.  I think, the terms on to something, I did a Pentagon  article last year 2016 about the problem we have with China.  That was the  tariffs hacking, what's happening overall in terms of currency.  All this  things affects small businesses.  I'm a small business owner in upstate New  York.  And put together with the -- all the things that China's doing, I  mean, we're trying to move in a direction that we're kind of correct,  trying to correct this, I think, that's what you're seeing in the market, I  hoping that's a correction, I hope Dagen's dire prediction here is not  true.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you say about the fact that China is coming back now  and saying, really, we're going to tariff you?  And so now we are looking  at a serious retaliatory story.  </p><p> TENNEY:  Yes, I think it's stupid, I mean, Kim Jong-un also reacted to  President Trump, to some strong language.  But think about what's happening  here tough, China actually has the biggest marketplace in the world that  you want to have access to, and that's the United States.  We are where the  consumers are and so, they want to get access to us too.  So, that's  something that they've got to weigh in to the negotiation.  They're  business model I think is flawed in the end.  We know that they've set up  these state-run businesses that -- and that's how they operate.  I mean,  much like what's done in New York State under our current governor, but we  know that that kind of cronie is in that kind of set up of state-run  businesses in the long run doesn't work which is why I tend to favor that  we've got to do something now, how long are we going wait?  How long are we  going to let China cheat?  How long are we going, you know, steeling our  intellectual property from our steel companies and others and I think  that's what Wilbur Ross and the President are recognizing and something has  to be done and maybe this is a very short-term pain that may end up being,  you know, long-term gain for us.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  What about the uncertainty this creates for small businesses?   You are small business owners, you understand they're trying to make plans,  now they're saying, you know, which of this 1300 products is going to be  hit by a tariff, how big is the tariff?  That's very hard for a small shop  to deal with, is that a big concern here or do you think that's very, very  temporary?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Prices will go up.</p><p> TENNEY:  Right, it is a concern especially for the smaller businesses.  We  have some of the small business in area.  We have a company called share  manufacturing which took over the older night limited which went under and  went to Asia where there's manufacturing, they're dependent on purchasing  steel as well, but I also have another number of companies in my district  that also are steel companies and they like to see a little bit of help.   And, they're use to buy older steel from American based companies and now  they're buying it from overseas.  I do think we need -- we're going to see  an adjustment in the market, but I think making tariffs in more targeted  way, using currency, looking at the tax reform is something that's going to  be helpful to us in the long run, especially, this past through businesses.   In my region which is the order of the day, we do know they produce most of  the jobs.  This is the only way you're going to bring the Rust Belt back, I  lived in the Rust Belt of New York.</p><p> SMITH:  Well Congresswoman you bring up a very interesting point and I  think some people ignore it.  We're a China's biggest buyer --</p><p> TENNEY:  Absolutely.</p><p> SMITH:  -- by almost 4-1.  How can you have a trade war, an active trade  war with your biggest buyer?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they already have a $375 billion surplus on us.  Where are  the 375 billion  deficit?  So, are they going to threaten that huge surplus  with these tariffs? </p><p> SMITH:  It'd be like 3M selling tape to Wal-Mart, having a trade war with  Wal-Mart.  You know, they buy a lot more tape than Wal-Mart buys from 3M,  so it would be silly, wouldn't it?</p><p> TENNEY:  I agree with you.  It's -- we are the market place.  Where are  they going to sell goods and services, they create this enormous state- owned businesses, this big plants and companies, fancy new equipment.  And  then they say, come in and we'll run these for you.  Remember, people that  move to China, they don't own their businesses, they're owned by the state.   And so people have to recognize that this isn't a situation where you have,  you know, you have this actual free market going on.  You have government  run the industries against a supposed free market enter the United States  that we something we're trying to get back.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All true but they are still out this morning saying that  they're going to put this retaliatory tariffs in place.  Look, we've got to  talk about this $1.3 trillion spending bill, congresswoman.  You averted a  shutdown and of course, looking to a $1.3 trillion spending package,  deliver to the President's steps now.  It includes defense as well as  domestic spending, the measure is headed to the President's desk for  signature but a lot of pushback here, you voted yes.</p><p> TENNEY:  I did and it was a very hard vote.  I'm a fiscal conservative.  I  hate the fact that we're spending, I don't like the fact that we're  dependent in all of this deafen deficit.  We tried to get this done through  our American Health Care Act.  Remember, we had significant reforms to the  mandatory spending side.  We didn't get that done.  We got a thumbs down  vote from one person in the Senate, that prevented us from getting to that  mandatory spending side, which is so large with the eclipse is what we do  in the discretionary side.  But that being said, we have a short-term fix,  it's ugly, they called it the big ugly when I was in New York States,  somebody when a woman I would call it the big ugly now. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why can't you just say no -- why can't you just say no to the  Democrats that want all the spending?  </p><p> TENNEY:  To be honest, I would love to say no, the President actually  supported this.  My biggest concern and my son is an active duty Marine  Officer who's -- who has indicated to me and we have met with General  Mattis and numerous people on that side, we have seriously degraded our  military over the years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Agreed.</p><p> TENNEY:  And that is being held as a big club to us and when you see more  of our good servicemen and women are hardworking, honourably serving  people, die in training than in combat.  There is a problem with what we're  doing in our military side and General Mattis has said, the only thing more  dangerous than our most dangerous enemies is Congress.  And we need to act  and we needed to do something with our military.  Sadly it came at a price.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  80 billion in defense spending increase above the 2011 sequester  levels, 63 billion increase in domestic spending, the issue is because now  Congress, Republicans and Democrats have signed off on higher spending  levels, we now get into the trillion dollar annual budget deficits.  What  that ultimately will do given the $21 trillion that we have in debt  already.  We're going to be spending more on interest on our debt in less  than a decade in just a matter of years than we spend on our military.  So,  this might be a short-term fix for the spending in our military and those  who are serving this country.  However, we put that very spending and put  our safety in jeopardy because we can't rein in our spending.  That is the  catch --</p><p> TENNEY:  But I think we can reign on our spending.  Let me -- let me -- let  me understand, we do not have 51 reliable votes in the Senate.  OK, we  don't -- forget 60, we don't have 51 reliable votes.  We proved that in our  attempt to pass the American Health Care act through reconciliation.  A lot  of this things --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right and you got a big this --</p><p> TENNEY:  Right, a lot of the things we could fix, we could do on regulate  order if we had enough votes, even a simple majority I would advocate to  the Senate to go back to the simple majority.  We don't have 51 reliable  votes and think about this, in my district alone, we once had an Air Force  base that was closed.  We now have one of the most significant assets,  that's called Roam Labs, this asset is producing cutting-edge technology  for the future of our military conflicts.  Will create efficiencies, will  make us able to be deal with the ace of symmetrical enemies that we face  now.  So, it's really important that some of things happened.  </p><p> They also produced a lot of jobs in my region which have been lost.  I have  some of the largest at migration in the state of New York in the country.   And so, these are companies that are, you know, companies that are also  part of the former Air Force base, companies that are dependent, that our  military has depended on for many of our technologies.  So advocated for  those for me to turn around and say, I'm advocating for these in  appropriation side, and to say, by the way, I'm not going to vote for it  because I don't like what happened on the domestic side because we had to  meet the needs of what?  The Democrats.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The irony is though, the Republicans are now at even greater  risk of losing the majority in the House and the Senate because of the  tariffs and the retaliation from China.  If you look at hawk-producing  states and soy bean producers, those dairy farmers because of the  retaliation by China and the U.S. actions are going to get smacked on the  face and those are the very areas of this country that Trump won.  These  are the states like Iowa that sent him over the top in terms of Electoral  College.</p><p> TENNEY:  There were technical corrections though in the appropriation  process in some of this issues that were in the tax bill that would help us  some of the trade and somebody issues in there.  We still need to revisit  NAFTA, we still need to revisit all this trade deals and even I think I  knew on unilateral basis.  I don't think -- Trump what he say, (INAUDIBLE)  the word of the day reciprocal trade now, we've gone from free fair to  reciprocal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, China's calling it retaliatory.  Real quick on John  Bolton, H.R. out, Bolton in, your thoughts.</p><p> TENNEY:  Yes, you know, I like John Bolton, I think it's -- I just think  it's interesting that the President's choices and let's see how that works  out but I think John is very strong person, I think he's going to be an  interesting to see the strong personalities in the White House.  Although  we've had a number of them in the past, we'll see where they end up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Claudia, thanks very much, great to see you.  </p><p> TENNEY:  Thank you, great to see you too.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Practical approach from Claudia Tenney joining us there.   Breaking news right now, the President is tweeting this morning, here's  what he says: House Intelligence Committee voting to release final report,  the finding: One: no evidence provided of collusion between Trump campaign  and Russia, number two: the Obama administrations post-election response  was insufficient and three: Clapper, inconsistent, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's going to be another tough day at the office as we've  been saying.  Look at the Dow Industrials down 150 points right now, on top  of the 700 plus selloff yesterday.  We are watching markets this morning,  NASDAQ down 60.  </p><p> Meanwhile a tragic night in New York, a city firefighter killed in a raging  five-alarm fire in a Harlem film set.  Lauren Simonetti, with the details  and headlines.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, fatal fire, Maria.  Flames broke  out last night in a, you know, in a movie set in the basement of closed  club, firefighter Michael Davidson, Engine Company first to arrive, rushed  to the basement of the club but officials say once they got down there, the  fire was too strong, it forced them to retreat, Davidson somehow got  separated from the other firefighters and when they found him, he was  unconscious and could not be revived.  He's 37 year's old and leaves behind  his wife and four young children.  </p><p> Well, liquidation sales at Toys \"R\" Us they are set to start today, the  company apologizing for what it calls unforeseen circumstances.  They were  expected to begin yesterday, push back to today.  Toys \"R\" Us it's lasting  prices as it prepares to close about 800 U.S. stores.  And a sad note, Toys  \"R\" Us founder, Charles Lazarus died yesterday, he was 94 year's old.</p><p> And this, a woman bumped from a United Airlines flight gets a $10,000  travel voucher.  This after she launched a pretty angry Tweet storm after  the airline oversold the flight and asked her specifically to get off the  plane because she paid the least for her ticket out of everyone else on  board.  One of her Tweets said, United tried to get me to sign a document  that says I volunteered my seat on this plane when I was involuntarily  denied boarding.  But now she says after that voucher, it was the best  place ever.  $10,000, you can go to a lot of places.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I guess yes, thank you Lauren.  Coming up thousands of students  from across the country will march in Washington against gun violence in  the wake of the Parkland massacre.  One of the shooting survivors will tell  us why he's not attending.</p><p> And then a bright spot amid the rough week, the technology stocks as  Dropbox debuts on the Nasdaq with a higher than expected share price.   We'll see what happens to the stock at the opening in a down market, back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, investors' concerns over possible trade war  rocking Wall Street today and yesterday Futures currently indicating a  decline at the start of trading of 160 points.  That's two-thirds of one  percent.  Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 also down one percent and 1/2 of a percent.   It's coming after its sharp selloff yesterday, the Dow was down better than  700 points yesterday.  It was the biggest one-day percentage decline since  early February.  Joining us right now to weigh in, is a Chief Investor  Strategist for CFRA research, Sam Stovall.  Sam, good to see you.  Thanks  for joining us.</p><p> SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTOR STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, happy to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you're talking about a backdrop which is pretty positive.   How do you see these markets here?</p><p> STOVALL:  Well, this is the correction that people that have been talking  about.  And actually, I believe it's more of the retest of the correction  that had bottomed in February 8th.  Maybe we go and we touch the rising 200  day moving average which is around 25-85, so there's probably further  downside to go but at the same time, I remind investors that we're down  less than eight percent from the January 26 high, and so, therefore, the  numbers look large but on a percentage basis, it's actually a run of the  mill kind of decline. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you're not as worried.  Gary B., you just said the same  thing?  (INAUDIBLE) optimistic.</p><p> SMITH: I'm optimistic, here's the only, not the only, maybe one of the  flies (INAUDIBLE) the fang stocks that pretty much been leading, carrying  the market on their shoulders.  We've seen a little bit of, you know,  correction -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Or a lot, 10 percent down on Facebook.  Facebook down 10  percent --</p><p> SMITH:  What are the future -- yes, what's the future of those stocks, do  you think?</p><p> STOVALL:  Well, I still think that the future looks pretty good.  We  actually are technology set to group heads, Scott Kessler upgraded Facebook  to a strong buy, feeling that this is being overdone and that there is more  opportunity there.  If you look to those groups that are trading above  their ten week, 50 day moving averages, still, you do have the internet  stocks above that moving average, so Netflix looking at Amazon are still  doing relatively well.  </p><p> SMITH:  What's the next -- I think, everyone wants to know, what's the next  fang stock?  We got those, what's going to be the next one?  That's what we  want to buy, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The CISCO's of the world are not trading the way Facebook is in  terms of valuation, I'm just saying, it's a --</p><p> STOVALL:  Exactly.  And also the semiconductor, semiconductor equipment,  application software, those groups are trading above their 50 day --</p><p> SMITH:  No, no, what I want to know, I want to know what is going to be,  we're going to look five years from now, I wish I had bought that stock.   You can't say Amazon or Netflix.</p><p> STOVALL:  Well, thanks for the opportunity to do this research ahead of  time. (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We all want that answer.  On the near term, you're expecting  for the decline, for longer term you sound like you're still pretty bullish  on this market?</p><p> STOVALL:  Yes, I do.  I don't think Trump wants to go down as the next  Republican President to initiate a recession even though every single one  since Teddy Roosevelt had one occur in the first two years in office.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right. </p><p> STOVALL:  So, I don't think he wants to continue that tradition.</p><p> BRENBERG:  So, does the trade spat here and quickly? </p><p> STOVALL:  I think that similar to what we have seen with the tariffs on  aluminum and steel that were broad base to begin with, now we have special  exemptions for our favorable trading partners.  I think, that this still  looks like it's more of a negotiation ploy that could then be softened as  we move forward.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  By coming from a businessman that's a wrench in to people who do  business in this country through used steel and aluminum.  Because they're  sitting around the last several weeks.  So, how much is my steel going to  cost?  I source it from these countries, are they going to be exempt,  calling people on the phone, going, can you give us some clarity on this  and it's still not that clear.</p><p> STOVALL:  Well, you're going to see a real-life example in a couple of  minutes because I was chatting with your next guest in the green room and  he has challenges because of that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you for that tease.  We really appreciate that.</p><p> STOVALL:  No charge.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And coming up, Sir Sam Stovall, good to see you.  Thank you so  much, what a week it's been.  We've had a great show here following all the  ups and downs out of Washington, take a look at some of the top moments  from this program.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that any of this growth story which obviously is a  big reason coming from the tax plan is going to get impacted by this  tariffs?</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA:  Yes, we are growing, we don't want to  harm or slow it down but I also think, we have to stand up to China what  they've been doing.  As the President stands up to China, China realizes  they've done something wrong and now they're finally standing up to North  Korea, they realize, there's a new sheriff in town and the world's going to  be a little different in this administration.</p><p> PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  All we want is  to defend ourselves against economic aggression and I see this as bullish  for corporate America.  China is doing a lot better with this trade  relationship than we are.  I don't see them wanting to jeopardize that.   They know -- they know what they've been doing and taking from us and  actually they're probably surprised that finally a President is willing to  stand up for the American people and for American companies.</p><p> SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH:  I don't agree with Mr. Navarro.  I don't think  that he's living in the real world.  This other countries are not going to  put up with it.  It's -- I think it's ridiculous between you and me.  I  expect to push back from China.  I don't think there's any question about  that.  But the question is, are we in a position economically to really  fight them?</p><p> HERMAN CAIN, TALK RADIO HOST:  Everybody take a chill pill.  This is how  you get the Chinese to the table. When you impose a tariff which I agree  with others on your panel, it is a tax, this is how you get them to the  table, this is how you have serious talks about levelling the playing  field. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want to read you, Governor, MiKE Huckabee's tweet.  He  (INAUDIBLE), I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for  collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending  bill.</p><p> REP. STEVE WOMACK (R), ARKANSAS:  Look, Mike Huckabee is a great friend of  mine.  And that's easy to say from the outside looking in but as I said  before, I believe strongly that we have a mandate to provide for the  security of this country and in order to be able to get the gains that we  did for the Pentagon and for national -- the national security apparatus,  there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I love it.  He's a great Congressman,  but I'm going to just say this, tell the Democrats we're going to fund the  military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and you can  either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or you can  join us, and if you think that we are wrong, then you go get elected to the  majorities.  These guys are got to start learning to play some hardball. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think the biggest headline is, now we know at least one person  who is not going to be running for the presidency ever, Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We know that these companies have more power than they ever had  and more information about Americans than they ever had.</p><p> REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  We'll be holding hearings, there's no  two ways about it.  But the irony here is a lot of Americans are OK with  what we would call this edge providers, whether it's Google or Facebook or  Amazon knowing something about you so they can give you recommendations.  A  lot of Americans are fine with that and a lot are not.  The problem is  right now, is in many cases no one's asking your permission.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you say you wish you really would have known the importance  of having a budget. </p><p> CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT:  The importance of having a budget is just  being in control.  You telling your money where to go instead of wondering  where it went. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here's what I learn in my 20's, for your first marriage go to  the Courthouse and tell people send you cheques.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Forget all the China thing, you said you love and you think  you're going to use it.  You're not going to use the China.  </p><p> HOGAN:  Maria, what we need to do is all get together and collaborate and  make a book for these new millennials out there to help them to avoid some  of this traps.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The best thing about Washington, now, Marlon Bundo is making  big literary debut.  </p><p> KAREN PENCE, SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is my first book to  illustrate and we've had lot of fun.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You must have fun just working together.</p><p> PENCE:  We really do.  And Marlon is great, he really -- he poses, he  knows, he thinks as, you know, this is my best side.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How funny and adorable.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday.  It is Friday, March  23rd; your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  battered on Wall Street and the selling continues this morning, the major  indices selling off over growing fears of a trade war, President Trump,  signing his tariffs against China, yesterday, and that triggering even more  selling.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have a trade deficit depending on the way you calculate of $504  billion.  Now, some people would say it's really $375 billion.  But any way  you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of  our world.  It's out of control.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  China is firing back this morning.  It is announcing its own  tariffs on U.S. goods going into China.  Global markets are following the  U.S. lower.  Take a look at the selloffs underway right now.  The FT-100,  down three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down one  and two-thirds percent, also one and two-thirds lower, on the DAX Index in  Germany.  In Asia overnight, sharp declines across-the-board, the Nikkei  Average, the worst performer, down 4-1/2 percent in Japan.  </p><p> Shanghai and Korea, both down better than three percent.  Looking ahead to  the open, more selling, Futures are indicating a lower opening.  Now, this  is off of the lows of the morning.  Nonetheless, we're expecting a decline  at the start of trading of 122 points, that's one half of one percent.  The  S&amp;P is down nine points and the NASDAQ is down 56, that's almost one  percent.  Then there's this, the House Judiciary Committee, making it  official.  </p><p> It issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for documents in the Clinton  e-mail investigation, as we told you, it would.  New questions in the Uber  self-driving car accident, the focus, now, turning to the test driver and  how the company selects those drivers, the woman behind the wheel was a  convicted felon.  One NFL player walking back his anthem protest, why he  helps the move, will have teams picking up the phone.  And Sister Jean and  Loyola Chicago, living on a prayer, and some great play on the court, with  the latest from Sweet 16, where Michigan dominated again.  </p><p> All that coming up, but first, students set to hold a march for our lives  rally in Washington D.C., another cities across the country, tomorrow, as  they push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the recent school shooting.   Joining us now is the -- a survivor of the Parkland School shooting,  Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior, Kyle Kashuv.  Kyle, good to see you,  thanks very much for joining us again.</p><p> KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS:  Thank you for having me on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You will not be attending that march, why not?</p><p> KASHUV:  I'm going to be too busy meeting with legislators and pushing for  actual change.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, do you not see it as important to be -- to be there with  your classmates and others?</p><p> KASHUV:  One thing, it's definitely amazing that they can march but if -- I  mean, I'm taking the fast track that's actually pushing a change, because I  really don't want to see Parkland ever happen again.  And, I could march,  but I think my time would be much better well spent meeting with  legislators.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good for you.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Kyle, how did your classmates respond to this?  I mean, you're  spending some time with them but you're not doing a lot of the important  things that they are doing.  Are they pushing back hard against this?  Did  they welcome the fact that you're taking an alternative view point?  How do  you respond?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, there he is in the White House with the President and  the First Lady.  This is what he's doing.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  It's amazing.  I'm just curious how they respond to that.  </p><p> KASHUV:  Well, a lot of them view what they're doing as more productive and  effective than meeting with legislators to (INAUDIBLE) I think that  meeting, first hand, with legislators and trying to explain to them your  point of view and to explain to them what's necessary and what needs to be  done, is more important than walking down on Washington D.C., and which is  fine, even if from point of opinion.  But I truly believe that if you want  change, you go to legislators.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kyle, quick question, what percentage of your  classmates are actually marching?</p><p> KASHUV:  I don't know the percentage, but I would give you most likely, 90  plus percent of all my peers will be marching whether in Parkland or  Washington D.C.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, you got a large percentage of your classmates,  marching.  Do you think there's certainly -- I mean, I remember my days  from high school, you think most of these are really just viewing the  marches up, just the way to goof off or do you think they're really  serious?</p><p> KASHUV:  I mean, I think there are definitely some people who are coming  seriously, but a lot of people saw that -- that you could get a free 40- trip to Washington D.C. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.</p><p> KASHUV:  then why not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you because we see this Time Magazine covers.   Several of your classmates are on the latest cover of Time, titled Enough.   You were not in this picture, on the cover of Time Magazine.  Did they ask  you to be on the shot?</p><p> KASHUV:  Well, they didn't ask me.  But honestly, I didn't know Time  Magazine was still a thing.  I know I wasn't asked.  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why do you think that is?</p><p> KASHUV:  I don't -- maybe -- I think maybe they're trying to represent only  one point of view, the Democrat point of view and the anti-gun -- the anti- gun.  A movement -- I honestly couldn't tell you because if they are really  trying to get the full perspective they would ask me and especially Patrick  Patty.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm wondering if you are in fact, seeing pushback because  you take a different view, a more conservative view on this topic.  I know  that you had a recent incident with Spirit Airlines.  You tweeted about it.   We're going to show you tweet right here, Kyle.  You say, just landed in  Baltimore on Spirit Airlines and the steward is felt compelled to give us  all a speech about the March for Our Lives, which openly says on the  petition, are trying to categorically ban AR-15s and made everyone clap.  </p><p> Can anything just be non-political anymore?  Spirit tweeted an apology  after your tweet.  And Spirit Airlines said, while we appreciate that one  team members -- our Team Members are individuals, we don't believe politics  should be part of the Guest experience.  We're looking into the incident.  We apologize to any guests offended by these comments.  Is this apology  enough for you, Kyle?</p><p> KASHUV:  I mean, I want -- I wasn't offended to begin with.  I just thought  that what they're doing was stupid and unnecessary that they're giving a  speech for all the passengers, how much they support the March.  I just  thought it was unnecessary.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But go back and talk to us about your views here, because this  is the whole crocs of the story.  I mean, the fact that you've taken a  different position, you're not looking for, you know, specific, you know,  an impact on the second amendment.  You say that there are rules in place  that should've been followed and there were missed signals.  Where are you  on this?  Tell us why you think you're seeing some pushback against your  views?</p><p> KASHUV:  Well, I think, I'm definitely getting some pushbacks because I'm  not taking, like, the mass majority opinion on this, so just everyone's  just following each other, inspiringly in a loop of talking points.  I  mean, I've taken a step back and I've looked at all the facts and I have  come to the conclusion that what I think I'm doing right now is what needs  to be done versus just marching and screaming about gun control.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, have you met with both Democrat and  Republican law makers?</p><p> KASHUV:  Yes, across the board.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And where do you see consensus among them in terms of tightening  gun regulations, we have gun regulations in this country or where do you  think that they can all come together and do something again?  FixNix was  kind of easy, closing some of the loopholes or trying to tighten up the  background check database.</p><p> KASHUV:  Well, I think first hand, every legislator I talk to, across the  board, they truly care and they don't want to see this happen -- they  really do --they don't want to see this ever happen to any of the  constituents, ever again.  What I think that every single lawmaker agreed  on, was that they want to see that people who are mentally disturbed, can  acquire weapon., and they want to make sure there are background check  systems is actually being implemented, and all the information is going  through.  They want to see the clear reporting and the full reporting of  information of disturbed individuals.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, there are some changes happening to your school  right now, in terms of security.  Let's talk about that for a second, Kyle.</p><p> KASHUV:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The superintendent says that students are now going to be  required to use clear backpacks and metal detectors may be installed.  Do  you agree with these moves?  What about this clear backpack?</p><p> KASHUV:  I mean, I honestly think that it's going to protect our schools  and if this is what determined that it's absolutely necessary to make sure  this won't happen again, then, we shouldn't be opposed to -- we should be  in favor of it.  Yes, it'll be a little bit of discomfort, but look, that's  the price you pay for going to school safely.  I mean, I would prefer that  I could come to school safely, not have to fear if that man having a clear  backpack.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  And the metal detectors you're also comfortable with.  I  mean, you have said in the past that what's wrong having an armed guard at  the school, right?</p><p> KASHUV:  Yes, I mean, let's do everything possible to make sure that school  is safe.  Yes, it might cause some discomfort for some kids.  We don't have  to wait a few minutes to get to the metal detectors, hopefully not three  hours, but that's what it is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kyle, thanks so much for weighing in this morning.  Good to see  you again.</p><p> KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, getting answers,  House Judiciary Committee officially subpoenas the justice department over  the Hillary Clinton e-mail server probe.  We knew it was coming.  We've got  more on in this morning, and then another night at bracket-buster, as March  madness rolls toward the elite eight, the upsets and the triumphs, coming  up, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Markets are off of their lows, as you just saw  them.  Meanwhile, heavy rains in Southern California have residents on  alert this morning for possible flash flooding, mudslides.  Lauren  Simonetti with all the details and headlines now, Lauren.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hi, Maria, this threat is just two months after deadly  mudslides struck killing 21 people.  Rainfall rate this time around could  be as high as an inch per hour and Santa Barbara County's 30,000 people  told to evacuate.  </p><p> We're also learning more about Sunday's fatal crash in Arizona, involving a  self-driving Uber vehicle.  According to Arizona state records, and we've  shown you this video, it is disturbing to watch.  The safety driver right  there, Rafael Vasquez, 44-years-old, was a convicted felon for attempted  armed robbery along with the number of traffic violations.  A police video  shows him looking down, as you can see right before the car struck and  killed a female pedestrian.  Uber says, Vasquez met standard background  check requirements and that he does still work for the company.  </p><p> Well, the House Judiciary Committee is slapping the Justice Department with  a subpoena for documents related to the Clinton e-mail server  investigation.  Chairman Bob Goodlatte saying he had no choice since they  have only received a fraction of the roughly 1.2 million documents that  they requested months ago.  Goodlatte spoke about this on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\", Maria.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We  need to have those documents.  The department and the bureau have been  slow.  I would say, now, very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I  was on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those  documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later, still don't  have them.  So, this is coming to a hit.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Here we are.  The Justice Department has two weeks to comply  with this subpoena.  </p><p> Well, it's the day for an IPO.  The cloud storage company, Dropbox, bumping  the price of its shares in its initial public offering to $21.00, that's  the second hike for Dropbox.  They had previously set a range of $16.00- $18.00 a pop.  The bump up shows strong demand among the investors.  Shares  start trading today on the NASDAQ, the symbol is DBX, the company is valued  at over $8 billion.  So, we're talking about the big tech company  struggling lately.  How are the unicorns going to do? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see how the deal does today even in the face of a  down market.  Lauren, thank you so much.  Dropbox -- I want to get your  take on that later.  Dagen, this subpoena, we knew this was coming.  Bob  Goodlatte told me on Sunday that it was coming.  I find it extraordinary  that they can request 1.2 million documents and only get 3000 back.  How is  it possible that the FBI just blows off the committee that has jurisdiction  over it?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I think some of the blame needs to be directed at Attorney  General Jeff Sessions, that I think that it's the entrenched old-school  lifelong government workers who are part of the problem here.  But again,  who's running the FBI?  Jeff Sessions, I know, he's recused himself in any  matters dealing with Russia, but what about Rod Rosenstein?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  I mean, somebody has got to enforce this.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they've only received 3000 of the documents.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  The numbers look so ludicrous.  I mean, 3000 over -- it looks  like, forget about it, just told defiance.  I think Americans feel like,  there's a million document, let's give a big chunk of those and see what's  there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And by the way, don't forget when our friend, Jason Chaffetz,  was running the Oversight Committee and he went into a hearing and said,  you are officially served.  He handed the subpoena to the FBI, months  before this subpoena, and they still didn't comply.  So, I don't know, but  you're right, it's up to Jeff Sessions.  Somebody has to enforce this to  get those documents within this investigation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm still -- I'm (INAUDIBLE) awaiting the inspector general's  report, particularly.  It's only been -- it's been less than a week since  Andrew McCabe got fired.  </p><p> SMITH:  You're right about one thing: you're fighting the real backbone,  which is the entrenched government employees, which typically lean to the  left.  And they're certainly as we've seen time and time after again,  they're anti-Trump.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They only sleep on their left side.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're going to have Devin Nunes on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, your hair is thin on the one side.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, then your arm hurts you.  We're going to have Devin Nunes  on, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", Chairman of the Intel Committee, to take  more about that.  We'll take a quick break right here.  NFL Free Agent,  Eric Reid, walking away from kneeling.  We will tell you why a big  supporter of Colin Kaepernick is saying now, what he's saying now about the  pregame protest.  Plus, the sting of the Hornets -- Charlotte makes NBA  history with a massive blowout win.  Sports is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Here's our -- four games, three upsets in the NCAA  March Madness.  Jared Max with the highlights, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  March Madness indeed, Maria.  Out of  17.3 million brackets in ESPN's tournament challenge, you know how many  picked all four that won last night?  349, which is actually somewhat  remarkable considering the unlikelihood of these results -- a matchup of  Wildcats.  Kentucky favored to beat Kansas State, but K-state cats,  scratched this tie breaking layup for Barry Brown with 19 seconds left, K- state scores the upset 61-58.  One win for the first final four since 1964.  </p><p> The number nine seeded Wildcats play Saturday in the elite eight?  the 11- seated Ramblers from Loyola Chicago.  When it's time for leaving, I hope  you understand, I was born a rambling man in Rambler.  Its town says, it's  not time for leaving yet.  Loyola Chicago beats Nevada, 69-68.  They're in  the elite eight for the first time in 55 years since 98-year-old Team  Chaplan, Sister Jean.  Getting lots of brotherly love from the Ramblers  players.  So, we're number nine seed one -- a number 11 seed one. </p><p> And another number nine, football powerhouse, Florida State knocked out  last year's runner-up, Gonzaga.  Seminoles win 75 to 60 in the regional  finals for the third time.  The only game that went as expect, third seed,  Michigan, won its 12th straight.  The Wolverines eliminated Texas A&amp;M, 99- 72.  Michigan plays Florida State four more games tonight, including the  only number one seeds left, Kansas and Villanova in action.  </p><p> Record-setting night in the NBA: Charlotte Hornets became only the sixth  team ever to win a game by 60 points or more.  Wild night, Dwight Howard,  not part of the mix.  He served the one-game suspension; didn't matter.  As  the Hornets did something we haven't seen in 20 years with this type of  blowout.  Kemba Walker hit 10, three-pointers, a team record.  They win by  61 points.  Walker at 46 points and only 28 minutes -- nobody had ever  scored that many in so few minutes since the shot clock came to date.  </p><p> Hey, Johnny Manziel, making a comeback, former high spin trophy winner,  sober, looking healthy, full-faced, in football shape, attracted scouts  from 13 NFL teams yesterday at a pro-day work at San Diego.  Unemployed NFL  free safety, Eric Reid, one of the original national anthem kneelers with  former teammate, Colin Kaepernick, says he's not going to kneel anymore.   He says, the message was understood that they didn't kneel to protest the  national anthem.  Question: when you and your significant other do yoga, do  you ever try to re-create the scene in dirty dancing?  As Patriots  Quarterback, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen did.  They've had the time of their  lives and, Maria, they've never felt this way before.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Look at that.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  I don't want to know that, Jared.  I just -- I don't what to  know that last piece.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tom Brady is pretty and tolerable, but somehow he just managed  to become even more.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BRENBERG:  Come on!  Keep it to yourself.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's doing yoga.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Keep it to yourself.  </p><p> SMITH:  What you do in privacy of your yoga sessions.  Johnny Manziel, you  can't keep your eyes off of him.  Is he going to sign with them or  anything?</p><p> MAX:  I think so.  The 13 scouts there to watch throw.  He looks healthy.   He looks like he's ready to play football.  Because he looks so sick for a  while and not doing well.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  I love the comeback stories.  I'd love to see it happen.  </p><p> MAX:  We love the comebacks.  You know, Tiger Woods, we're all rooting for  now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's not compare Johnny Manziel to Tiger Woods.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Johnny Manziel has proved that --</p><p> MAX:  Correct.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: -- he can't play professional football.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  I want the comeback story here.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  O wanted Tom Brady to fall on, still.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But he did it.  They are perfect.  You need to understand  they're perfect.  That's it, Dagen.  Jared, thank you.  Jared's sports  reports Fox News Headlines 24/7 and SiriusXM 115, catch him.  We'll be  right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for  joining us this Friday.  It is Friday, March 23rd, your top stories right  now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

European indices look like  it's sharply lower.  FT-100, down a one percent.  CAC Quarante down almost  two percent and the DAX Index down better than two percent.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have a deal, lawmakers avoided a government shutdown passing a massive  $1.3 trillion spending bill early this morning.  We are breaking down those  numbers as it heads to the President's desk now.  McMaster is out, Bolton  is in, more changes coming to the White House as President Trump announces  he will replace National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to former U.S.  Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not the only the change, the details as the President's top lawyer in the  Russia probe resigns.  </p><p>And tragedy in New York City to report, a firefighter killed after a fire  breaks out on the set of an Edward Norton movie in Harlem, more on the  devastating fire alarm blaze coming up.</p><p>And then a bump to the bank account, United Airlines delivering a massive  cheque to give one passenger to give up her seat, the first-class pay day,  coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to talk  all about it, FOX News Business Network, Dagen McDowell.  The King's  College Business and Economic, Professor Brian Brenberg and Kadina Groups  President, Gary B. Smith is here.  Good to see you, Gary.</p><p>GARY B. SMITH, PRESIDENT, KADINA GROUPS:  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On a day that we are expecting this market to completely roll  over.  Good morning Brian and Dagen.  </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC PROFESSOR, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning, good to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  My last thought yesterday at the end of this  program was markets look out below.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  That's what she said.  That was your final  comment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it was.  Because, again, it's not just the beginnings of a  trade war with China.  It is not the upset, but it's the fact that you have  Congress passing the spending bill, we're running up deficits, we're  running up our national debt, which gives us less power to fight.</p><p>SMITH:  You sound so bearish, Dagen.  Are you thinking the market's going  down?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the cost of our debt is going up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You've got the Fed -- the Fed raising rates, reducing its  balance sheet, you have a Congress that has no understanding of fiscal  responsibility at the same time we try to take on China, the largest owner,  foreign owner of our national debt, doesn't add up.</p><p>SMITH:  And yet, I will tell you one thing, I am optimistic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get down or up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the back cracking on the economy, what are you most bullish  on?</p><p>SMITH:  Bullish on -- bullish on the market, not right now, not today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SMITH:  Bullish on the economy, I'm bullish, I think Trump is basically  getting it right and we we're going to talk more about this whole tariffs  thing.  I think, I am optimistic right now.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Well it's certainly not unexpected, right?  And he'd been  talking about this, and talking at this maybe came later than people  thought at but it was going to come.  </p><p>SMITH:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the uncertainty to all of this, the trade story is exactly  what people were worried about going into the election.  Remember when the  market was down 700 points on election night it was because of uncertainty  around NAFTA, what will Donald Trump do.  And this is what we're seeing  right here.  Coming up this morning joining the conversation, Florida  Congressman and House Freedom Caucus Member, Ron DeSantis is with us.  </p><p>Remember the (INAUDIBLE) -- Caucus was among the first to say, we're not in  on this bill, former FDIC Chairman and founder a Systemic Risk Council,  Sheila Bair is with us this morning.  Then the author of The Coming  Collapse Of China, Gordon Chang will weigh in along with the CEO of  Deloitte Cathy Engelbert is here.  Plus elevation partner, cofounder,  managing director and investor and Mark Zuckerberg's mentor, Roger McNamee,  one of the leader shareholders in Facebook for some time.  We're going to  talk with Roger about what took place on Facebook and this market this  week.  </p><p>But first, we want to kick it off right now, with the trade war hitting  global markets, stocks across Asia tumbled, following directions from Wall  Street.  Take a look at the numbers here, of course we know that all the  majors in Asia were down between three and 4.5 percent.  Japan being the  worst down 4.5 percent.  </p><p>Back in the U.S., the Dow closed down more than 700 points yesterday after  President Trump proposed tariffs of up to $60 billion on imports from China  along with tighter restrictions on the country's acquisition and technology  transfers, It was in response to what the administration is calling China's  unfair trading practices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing things for this  country that should've been done for many, many years.  We've had this  abuse by many other countries and groups of countries that were put  together in order to take advantage of the United States and we don't want  that to happen.  We're not going to let that happen.  I t's probably one of  the reasons I was elected, maybe one of the main reasons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hours later the Chinese government fired back saying that it  plans to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs of up to $3 billion on U.S.  goods in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum which go into effect  today.  The U.S. now says some allies including Canada, Mexico and the E.U.  among others will get a brief exemption from the tariffs.  Joining us right  now to talk more about that is Congresswoman Claudia Tenney of New York, a  former small business owner, congresswoman good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  And I know you're back on a lot to talk about small  business and about lending money get into that.  But first, let's talk  about these tariffs, good idea or are you against?</p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  I tend to be more on Gary's side.  Gary  B's got the idea.  I think, the terms on to something, I did a Pentagon  article last year 2016 about the problem we have with China.  That was the  tariffs hacking, what's happening overall in terms of currency.  All this  things affects small businesses.  I'm a small business owner in upstate New  York.  And put together with the -- all the things that China's doing, I  mean, we're trying to move in a direction that we're kind of correct,  trying to correct this, I think, that's what you're seeing in the market, I  hoping that's a correction, I hope Dagen's dire prediction here is not  true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say about the fact that China is coming back now  and saying, really, we're going to tariff you?  And so now we are looking  at a serious retaliatory story.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Yes, I think it's stupid, I mean, Kim Jong-un also reacted to  President Trump, to some strong language.  But think about what's happening  here tough, China actually has the biggest marketplace in the world that  you want to have access to, and that's the United States.  We are where the  consumers are and so, they want to get access to us too.  So, that's  something that they've got to weigh in to the negotiation.  They're  business model I think is flawed in the end.  We know that they've set up  these state-run businesses that -- and that's how they operate.  I mean,  much like what's done in New York State under our current governor, but we  know that that kind of cronie is in that kind of set up of state-run  businesses in the long run doesn't work which is why I tend to favor that  we've got to do something now, how long are we going wait?  How long are we  going to let China cheat?  How long are we going, you know, steeling our  intellectual property from our steel companies and others and I think  that's what Wilbur Ross and the President are recognizing and something has  to be done and maybe this is a very short-term pain that may end up being,  you know, long-term gain for us.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  What about the uncertainty this creates for small businesses?   You are small business owners, you understand they're trying to make plans,  now they're saying, you know, which of this 1300 products is going to be  hit by a tariff, how big is the tariff?  That's very hard for a small shop  to deal with, is that a big concern here or do you think that's very, very  temporary?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Prices will go up.</p><p>TENNEY:  Right, it is a concern especially for the smaller businesses.  We  have some of the small business in area.  We have a company called share  manufacturing which took over the older night limited which went under and  went to Asia where there's manufacturing, they're dependent on purchasing  steel as well, but I also have another number of companies in my district  that also are steel companies and they like to see a little bit of help.   And, they're use to buy older steel from American based companies and now  they're buying it from overseas.  I do think we need -- we're going to see  an adjustment in the market, but I think making tariffs in more targeted  way, using currency, looking at the tax reform is something that's going to  be helpful to us in the long run, especially, this past through businesses.   In my region which is the order of the day, we do know they produce most of  the jobs.  This is the only way you're going to bring the Rust Belt back, I  lived in the Rust Belt of New York.</p><p>SMITH:  Well Congresswoman you bring up a very interesting point and I  think some people ignore it.  We're a China's biggest buyer --</p><p>TENNEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>SMITH:  -- by almost 4-1.  How can you have a trade war, an active trade  war with your biggest buyer?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they already have a $375 billion surplus on us.  Where are  the 375 billion  deficit?  So, are they going to threaten that huge surplus  with these tariffs? </p><p>SMITH:  It'd be like 3M selling tape to Wal-Mart, having a trade war with  Wal-Mart.  You know, they buy a lot more tape than Wal-Mart buys from 3M,  so it would be silly, wouldn't it?</p><p>TENNEY:  I agree with you.  It's -- we are the market place.  Where are  they going to sell goods and services, they create this enormous state- owned businesses, this big plants and companies, fancy new equipment.  And  then they say, come in and we'll run these for you.  Remember, people that  move to China, they don't own their businesses, they're owned by the state.   And so people have to recognize that this isn't a situation where you have,  you know, you have this actual free market going on.  You have government  run the industries against a supposed free market enter the United States  that we something we're trying to get back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All true but they are still out this morning saying that  they're going to put this retaliatory tariffs in place.  Look, we've got to  talk about this $1.3 trillion spending bill, congresswoman.  You averted a  shutdown and of course, looking to a $1.3 trillion spending package,  deliver to the President's steps now.  It includes defense as well as  domestic spending, the measure is headed to the President's desk for  signature but a lot of pushback here, you voted yes.</p><p>TENNEY:  I did and it was a very hard vote.  I'm a fiscal conservative.  I  hate the fact that we're spending, I don't like the fact that we're  dependent in all of this deafen deficit.  We tried to get this done through  our American Health Care Act.  Remember, we had significant reforms to the  mandatory spending side.  We didn't get that done.  We got a thumbs down  vote from one person in the Senate, that prevented us from getting to that  mandatory spending side, which is so large with the eclipse is what we do  in the discretionary side.  But that being said, we have a short-term fix,  it's ugly, they called it the big ugly when I was in New York States,  somebody when a woman I would call it the big ugly now. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why can't you just say no -- why can't you just say no to the  Democrats that want all the spending?  </p><p>TENNEY:  To be honest, I would love to say no, the President actually  supported this.  My biggest concern and my son is an active duty Marine  Officer who's -- who has indicated to me and we have met with General  Mattis and numerous people on that side, we have seriously degraded our  military over the years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Agreed.</p><p>TENNEY:  And that is being held as a big club to us and when you see more  of our good servicemen and women are hardworking, honourably serving  people, die in training than in combat.  There is a problem with what we're  doing in our military side and General Mattis has said, the only thing more  dangerous than our most dangerous enemies is Congress.  And we need to act  and we needed to do something with our military.  Sadly it came at a price.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  80 billion in defense spending increase above the 2011 sequester  levels, 63 billion increase in domestic spending, the issue is because now  Congress, Republicans and Democrats have signed off on higher spending  levels, we now get into the trillion dollar annual budget deficits.  What  that ultimately will do given the $21 trillion that we have in debt  already.  We're going to be spending more on interest on our debt in less  than a decade in just a matter of years than we spend on our military.  So,  this might be a short-term fix for the spending in our military and those  who are serving this country.  However, we put that very spending and put  our safety in jeopardy because we can't rein in our spending.  That is the  catch --</p><p>TENNEY:  But I think we can reign on our spending.  Let me -- let me -- let  me understand, we do not have 51 reliable votes in the Senate.  OK, we  don't -- forget 60, we don't have 51 reliable votes.  We proved that in our  attempt to pass the American Health Care act through reconciliation.  A lot  of this things --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right and you got a big this --</p><p>TENNEY:  Right, a lot of the things we could fix, we could do on regulate  order if we had enough votes, even a simple majority I would advocate to  the Senate to go back to the simple majority.  We don't have 51 reliable  votes and think about this, in my district alone, we once had an Air Force  base that was closed.  We now have one of the most significant assets,  that's called Roam Labs, this asset is producing cutting-edge technology  for the future of our military conflicts.  Will create efficiencies, will  make us able to be deal with the ace of symmetrical enemies that we face  now.  So, it's really important that some of things happened.  </p><p>They also produced a lot of jobs in my region which have been lost.  I have  some of the largest at migration in the state of New York in the country.   And so, these are companies that are, you know, companies that are also  part of the former Air Force base, companies that are dependent, that our  military has depended on for many of our technologies.  So advocated for  those for me to turn around and say, I'm advocating for these in  appropriation side, and to say, by the way, I'm not going to vote for it  because I don't like what happened on the domestic side because we had to  meet the needs of what?  The Democrats.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The irony is though, the Republicans are now at even greater  risk of losing the majority in the House and the Senate because of the  tariffs and the retaliation from China.  If you look at hawk-producing  states and soy bean producers, those dairy farmers because of the  retaliation by China and the U.S. actions are going to get smacked on the  face and those are the very areas of this country that Trump won.  These  are the states like Iowa that sent him over the top in terms of Electoral  College.</p><p>TENNEY:  There were technical corrections though in the appropriation  process in some of this issues that were in the tax bill that would help us  some of the trade and somebody issues in there.  We still need to revisit  NAFTA, we still need to revisit all this trade deals and even I think I  knew on unilateral basis.  I don't think -- Trump what he say, (INAUDIBLE)  the word of the day reciprocal trade now, we've gone from free fair to  reciprocal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, China's calling it retaliatory.  Real quick on John  Bolton, H.R. out, Bolton in, your thoughts.</p><p>TENNEY:  Yes, you know, I like John Bolton, I think it's -- I just think  it's interesting that the President's choices and let's see how that works  out but I think John is very strong person, I think he's going to be an  interesting to see the strong personalities in the White House.  Although  we've had a number of them in the past, we'll see where they end up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Claudia, thanks very much, great to see you.  </p><p>TENNEY:  Thank you, great to see you too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Practical approach from Claudia Tenney joining us there.   Breaking news right now, the President is tweeting this morning, here's  what he says: House Intelligence Committee voting to release final report,  the finding: One: no evidence provided of collusion between Trump campaign  and Russia, number two: the Obama administrations post-election response  was insufficient and three: Clapper, inconsistent, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's going to be another tough day at the office as we've  been saying.  Look at the Dow Industrials down 150 points right now, on top  of the 700 plus selloff yesterday.  We are watching markets this morning,  NASDAQ down 60.  </p><p>Meanwhile a tragic night in New York, a city firefighter killed in a raging  five-alarm fire in a Harlem film set.  Lauren Simonetti, with the details  and headlines.  Lauren, good morning to you.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, fatal fire, Maria.  Flames broke  out last night in a, you know, in a movie set in the basement of closed  club, firefighter Michael Davidson, Engine Company first to arrive, rushed  to the basement of the club but officials say once they got down there, the  fire was too strong, it forced them to retreat, Davidson somehow got  separated from the other firefighters and when they found him, he was  unconscious and could not be revived.  He's 37 year's old and leaves behind  his wife and four young children.  </p><p>Well, liquidation sales at Toys \"R\" Us they are set to start today, the  company apologizing for what it calls unforeseen circumstances.  They were  expected to begin yesterday, push back to today.  Toys \"R\" Us it's lasting  prices as it prepares to close about 800 U.S. stores.  And a sad note, Toys  \"R\" Us founder, Charles Lazarus died yesterday, he was 94 year's old.</p><p>And this, a woman bumped from a United Airlines flight gets a $10,000  travel voucher.  This after she launched a pretty angry Tweet storm after  the airline oversold the flight and asked her specifically to get off the  plane because she paid the least for her ticket out of everyone else on  board.  One of her Tweets said, United tried to get me to sign a document  that says I volunteered my seat on this plane when I was involuntarily  denied boarding.  But now she says after that voucher, it was the best  place ever.  $10,000, you can go to a lot of places.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess yes, thank you Lauren.  Coming up thousands of students  from across the country will march in Washington against gun violence in  the wake of the Parkland massacre.  One of the shooting survivors will tell  us why he's not attending.</p><p>And then a bright spot amid the rough week, the technology stocks as  Dropbox debuts on the Nasdaq with a higher than expected share price.   We'll see what happens to the stock at the opening in a down market, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, investors' concerns over possible trade war  rocking Wall Street today and yesterday Futures currently indicating a  decline at the start of trading of 160 points.  That's two-thirds of one  percent.  Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 also down one percent and 1/2 of a percent.   It's coming after its sharp selloff yesterday, the Dow was down better than  700 points yesterday.  It was the biggest one-day percentage decline since  early February.  Joining us right now to weigh in, is a Chief Investor  Strategist for CFRA research, Sam Stovall.  Sam, good to see you.  Thanks  for joining us.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTOR STRATEGIST, CFRA: Well, happy to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're talking about a backdrop which is pretty positive.   How do you see these markets here?</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, this is the correction that people that have been talking  about.  And actually, I believe it's more of the retest of the correction  that had bottomed in February 8th.  Maybe we go and we touch the rising 200  day moving average which is around 25-85, so there's probably further  downside to go but at the same time, I remind investors that we're down  less than eight percent from the January 26 high, and so, therefore, the  numbers look large but on a percentage basis, it's actually a run of the  mill kind of decline. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not as worried.  Gary B., you just said the same  thing?  (INAUDIBLE) optimistic.</p><p>SMITH: I'm optimistic, here's the only, not the only, maybe one of the  flies (INAUDIBLE) the fang stocks that pretty much been leading, carrying  the market on their shoulders.  We've seen a little bit of, you know,  correction -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or a lot, 10 percent down on Facebook.  Facebook down 10  percent --</p><p>SMITH:  What are the future -- yes, what's the future of those stocks, do  you think?</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, I still think that the future looks pretty good.  We  actually are technology set to group heads, Scott Kessler upgraded Facebook  to a strong buy, feeling that this is being overdone and that there is more  opportunity there.  If you look to those groups that are trading above  their ten week, 50 day moving averages, still, you do have the internet  stocks above that moving average, so Netflix looking at Amazon are still  doing relatively well.  </p><p>SMITH:  What's the next -- I think, everyone wants to know, what's the next  fang stock?  We got those, what's going to be the next one?  That's what we  want to buy, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The CISCO's of the world are not trading the way Facebook is in  terms of valuation, I'm just saying, it's a --</p><p>STOVALL:  Exactly.  And also the semiconductor, semiconductor equipment,  application software, those groups are trading above their 50 day --</p><p>SMITH:  No, no, what I want to know, I want to know what is going to be,  we're going to look five years from now, I wish I had bought that stock.   You can't say Amazon or Netflix.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, thanks for the opportunity to do this research ahead of  time. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We all want that answer.  On the near term, you're expecting  for the decline, for longer term you sound like you're still pretty bullish  on this market?</p><p>STOVALL:  Yes, I do.  I don't think Trump wants to go down as the next  Republican President to initiate a recession even though every single one  since Teddy Roosevelt had one occur in the first two years in office.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right. </p><p>STOVALL:  So, I don't think he wants to continue that tradition.</p><p>BRENBERG:  So, does the trade spat here and quickly? </p><p>STOVALL:  I think that similar to what we have seen with the tariffs on  aluminum and steel that were broad base to begin with, now we have special  exemptions for our favorable trading partners.  I think, that this still  looks like it's more of a negotiation ploy that could then be softened as  we move forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  By coming from a businessman that's a wrench in to people who do  business in this country through used steel and aluminum.  Because they're  sitting around the last several weeks.  So, how much is my steel going to  cost?  I source it from these countries, are they going to be exempt,  calling people on the phone, going, can you give us some clarity on this  and it's still not that clear.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well, you're going to see a real-life example in a couple of  minutes because I was chatting with your next guest in the green room and  he has challenges because of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you for that tease.  We really appreciate that.</p><p>STOVALL:  No charge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And coming up, Sir Sam Stovall, good to see you.  Thank you so  much, what a week it's been.  We've had a great show here following all the  ups and downs out of Washington, take a look at some of the top moments  from this program.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that any of this growth story which obviously is a  big reason coming from the tax plan is going to get impacted by this  tariffs?</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA:  Yes, we are growing, we don't want to  harm or slow it down but I also think, we have to stand up to China what  they've been doing.  As the President stands up to China, China realizes  they've done something wrong and now they're finally standing up to North  Korea, they realize, there's a new sheriff in town and the world's going to  be a little different in this administration.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  All we want is  to defend ourselves against economic aggression and I see this as bullish  for corporate America.  China is doing a lot better with this trade  relationship than we are.  I don't see them wanting to jeopardize that.   They know -- they know what they've been doing and taking from us and  actually they're probably surprised that finally a President is willing to  stand up for the American people and for American companies.</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH:  I don't agree with Mr. Navarro.  I don't think  that he's living in the real world.  This other countries are not going to  put up with it.  It's -- I think it's ridiculous between you and me.  I  expect to push back from China.  I don't think there's any question about  that.  But the question is, are we in a position economically to really  fight them?</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, TALK RADIO HOST:  Everybody take a chill pill.  This is how  you get the Chinese to the table. When you impose a tariff which I agree  with others on your panel, it is a tax, this is how you get them to the  table, this is how you have serious talks about levelling the playing  field. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to read you, Governor, MiKE Huckabee's tweet.  He  (INAUDIBLE), I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for  collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending  bill.</p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R), ARKANSAS:  Look, Mike Huckabee is a great friend of  mine.  And that's easy to say from the outside looking in but as I said  before, I believe strongly that we have a mandate to provide for the  security of this country and in order to be able to get the gains that we  did for the Pentagon and for national -- the national security apparatus,  there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I love it.  He's a great Congressman,  but I'm going to just say this, tell the Democrats we're going to fund the  military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and you can  either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or you can  join us, and if you think that we are wrong, then you go get elected to the  majorities.  These guys are got to start learning to play some hardball. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the biggest headline is, now we know at least one person  who is not going to be running for the presidency ever, Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know that these companies have more power than they ever had  and more information about Americans than they ever had.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  We'll be holding hearings, there's no  two ways about it.  But the irony here is a lot of Americans are OK with  what we would call this edge providers, whether it's Google or Facebook or  Amazon knowing something about you so they can give you recommendations.  A  lot of Americans are fine with that and a lot are not.  The problem is  right now, is in many cases no one's asking your permission.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you say you wish you really would have known the importance  of having a budget. </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT:  The importance of having a budget is just  being in control.  You telling your money where to go instead of wondering  where it went. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's what I learn in my 20's, for your first marriage go to  the Courthouse and tell people send you cheques.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Forget all the China thing, you said you love and you think  you're going to use it.  You're not going to use the China.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Maria, what we need to do is all get together and collaborate and  make a book for these new millennials out there to help them to avoid some  of this traps.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The best thing about Washington, now, Marlon Bundo is making  big literary debut.  </p><p>KAREN PENCE, SECOND LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is my first book to  illustrate and we've had lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You must have fun just working together.</p><p>PENCE:  We really do.  And Marlon is great, he really -- he poses, he  knows, he thinks as, you know, this is my best side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How funny and adorable.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Friday.  It is Friday, March  23rd; your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks  battered on Wall Street and the selling continues this morning, the major  indices selling off over growing fears of a trade war, President Trump,  signing his tariffs against China, yesterday, and that triggering even more  selling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have a trade deficit depending on the way you calculate of $504  billion.  Now, some people would say it's really $375 billion.  But any way  you look at it, it is the largest deficit of any country in the history of  our world.  It's out of control.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China is firing back this morning.  It is announcing its own  tariffs on U.S. goods going into China.  Global markets are following the  U.S. lower.  Take a look at the selloffs underway right now.  The FT-100,  down three quarters of one percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down one  and two-thirds percent, also one and two-thirds lower, on the DAX Index in  Germany.  In Asia overnight, sharp declines across-the-board, the Nikkei  Average, the worst performer, down 4-1/2 percent in Japan.  </p><p>Shanghai and Korea, both down better than three percent.  Looking ahead to  the open, more selling, Futures are indicating a lower opening.  Now, this  is off of the lows of the morning.  Nonetheless, we're expecting a decline  at the start of trading of 122 points, that's one half of one percent.  The  S&amp;P is down nine points and the NASDAQ is down 56, that's almost one  percent.  Then there's this, the House Judiciary Committee, making it  official.  </p><p>It issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for documents in the Clinton  e-mail investigation, as we told you, it would.  New questions in the Uber  self-driving car accident, the focus, now, turning to the test driver and  how the company selects those drivers, the woman behind the wheel was a  convicted felon.  One NFL player walking back his anthem protest, why he  helps the move, will have teams picking up the phone.  And Sister Jean and  Loyola Chicago, living on a prayer, and some great play on the court, with  the latest from Sweet 16, where Michigan dominated again.  </p><p>All that coming up, but first, students set to hold a march for our lives  rally in Washington D.C., another cities across the country, tomorrow, as  they push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the recent school shooting.   Joining us now is the -- a survivor of the Parkland School shooting,  Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior, Kyle Kashuv.  Kyle, good to see you,  thanks very much for joining us again.</p><p>KYLE KASHUV, JUNIOR, MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS:  Thank you for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You will not be attending that march, why not?</p><p>KASHUV:  I'm going to be too busy meeting with legislators and pushing for  actual change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, do you not see it as important to be -- to be there with  your classmates and others?</p><p>KASHUV:  One thing, it's definitely amazing that they can march but if -- I  mean, I'm taking the fast track that's actually pushing a change, because I  really don't want to see Parkland ever happen again.  And, I could march,  but I think my time would be much better well spent meeting with  legislators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Kyle, how did your classmates respond to this?  I mean, you're  spending some time with them but you're not doing a lot of the important  things that they are doing.  Are they pushing back hard against this?  Did  they welcome the fact that you're taking an alternative view point?  How do  you respond?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, there he is in the White House with the President and  the First Lady.  This is what he's doing.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  It's amazing.  I'm just curious how they respond to that.  </p><p>KASHUV:  Well, a lot of them view what they're doing as more productive and  effective than meeting with legislators to (INAUDIBLE) I think that  meeting, first hand, with legislators and trying to explain to them your  point of view and to explain to them what's necessary and what needs to be  done, is more important than walking down on Washington D.C., and which is  fine, even if from point of opinion.  But I truly believe that if you want  change, you go to legislators.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kyle, quick question, what percentage of your  classmates are actually marching?</p><p>KASHUV:  I don't know the percentage, but I would give you most likely, 90  plus percent of all my peers will be marching whether in Parkland or  Washington D.C.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, you got a large percentage of your classmates,  marching.  Do you think there's certainly -- I mean, I remember my days  from high school, you think most of these are really just viewing the  marches up, just the way to goof off or do you think they're really  serious?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, I think there are definitely some people who are coming  seriously, but a lot of people saw that -- that you could get a free 40- trip to Washington D.C.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.</p><p>KASHUV:  then why not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let me ask you because we see this Time Magazine covers.   Several of your classmates are on the latest cover of Time, titled Enough.   You were not in this picture, on the cover of Time Magazine.  Did they ask  you to be on the shot?</p><p>KASHUV:  Well, they didn't ask me.  But honestly, I didn't know Time  Magazine was still a thing.  I know I wasn't asked.  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do you think that is?</p><p>KASHUV:  I don't -- maybe -- I think maybe they're trying to represent only  one point of view, the Democrat point of view and the anti-gun -- the anti- gun.  A movement -- I honestly couldn't tell you because if they are really  trying to get the full perspective they would ask me and especially Patrick  Patty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm wondering if you are in fact, seeing pushback because  you take a different view, a more conservative view on this topic.  I know  that you had a recent incident with Spirit Airlines.  You tweeted about it.   We're going to show you tweet right here, Kyle.  You say, just landed in  Baltimore on Spirit Airlines and the steward is felt compelled to give us  all a speech about the March for Our Lives, which openly says on the  petition, are trying to categorically ban AR-15s and made everyone clap.  </p><p>Can anything just be non-political anymore?  Spirit tweeted an apology  after your tweet.  And Spirit Airlines said, while we appreciate that one  team members -- our Team Members are individuals, we don't believe politics  should be part of the Guest experience.  We're looking into the incident.  We apologize to any guests offended by these comments.  Is this apology  enough for you, Kyle?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, I want -- I wasn't offended to begin with.  I just thought  that what they're doing was stupid and unnecessary that they're giving a  speech for all the passengers, how much they support the March.  I just  thought it was unnecessary.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But go back and talk to us about your views here, because this  is the whole crocs of the story.  I mean, the fact that you've taken a  different position, you're not looking for, you know, specific, you know,  an impact on the second amendment.  You say that there are rules in place  that should've been followed and there were missed signals.  Where are you  on this?  Tell us why you think you're seeing some pushback against your  views?</p><p>KASHUV:  Well, I think, I'm definitely getting some pushbacks because I'm  not taking, like, the mass majority opinion on this, so just everyone's  just following each other, inspiringly in a loop of talking points.  I  mean, I've taken a step back and I've looked at all the facts and I have  come to the conclusion that what I think I'm doing right now is what needs  to be done versus just marching and screaming about gun control.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kyle, it's Dagen McDowell, have you met with both Democrat and  Republican law makers?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And where do you see consensus among them in terms of tightening  gun regulations, we have gun regulations in this country or where do you  think that they can all come together and do something again?  FixNix was  kind of easy, closing some of the loopholes or trying to tighten up the  background check database.</p><p>KASHUV:  Well, I think first hand, every legislator I talk to, across the  board, they truly care and they don't want to see this happen -- they  really do --they don't want to see this ever happen to any of the  constituents, ever again.  What I think that every single lawmaker agreed  on, was that they want to see that people who are mentally disturbed, can  acquire weapon., and they want to make sure there are background check  systems is actually being implemented, and all the information is going  through.  They want to see the clear reporting and the full reporting of  information of disturbed individuals.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, there are some changes happening to your school  right now, in terms of security.  Let's talk about that for a second, Kyle.</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The superintendent says that students are now going to be  required to use clear backpacks and metal detectors may be installed.  Do  you agree with these moves?  What about this clear backpack?</p><p>KASHUV:  I mean, I honestly think that it's going to protect our schools  and if this is what determined that it's absolutely necessary to make sure  this won't happen again, then, we shouldn't be opposed to -- we should be  in favor of it.  Yes, it'll be a little bit of discomfort, but look, that's  the price you pay for going to school safely.  I mean, I would prefer that  I could come to school safely, not have to fear if that man having a clear  backpack.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  And the metal detectors you're also comfortable with.  I  mean, you have said in the past that what's wrong having an armed guard at  the school, right?</p><p>KASHUV:  Yes, I mean, let's do everything possible to make sure that school  is safe.  Yes, it might cause some discomfort for some kids.  We don't have  to wait a few minutes to get to the metal detectors, hopefully not three  hours, but that's what it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle, thanks so much for weighing in this morning.  Good to see  you again.</p><p>KASHUV:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kyle Kashuv, joining us there.  Coming up, getting answers,  House Judiciary Committee officially subpoenas the justice department over  the Hillary Clinton e-mail server probe.  We knew it was coming.  We've got  more on in this morning, and then another night at bracket-buster, as March  madness rolls toward the elite eight, the upsets and the triumphs, coming  up, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Markets are off of their lows, as you just saw  them.  Meanwhile, heavy rains in Southern California have residents on  alert this morning for possible flash flooding, mudslides.  Lauren  Simonetti with all the details and headlines now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi, Maria, this threat is just two months after deadly  mudslides struck killing 21 people.  Rainfall rate this time around could  be as high as an inch per hour and Santa Barbara County's 30,000 people  told to evacuate.  </p><p>We're also learning more about Sunday's fatal crash in Arizona, involving a  self-driving Uber vehicle.  According to Arizona state records, and we've  shown you this video, it is disturbing to watch.  The safety driver right  there, Rafael Vasquez, 44-years-old, was a convicted felon for attempted  armed robbery along with the number of traffic violations.  A police video  shows him looking down, as you can see right before the car struck and  killed a female pedestrian.  Uber says, Vasquez met standard background  check requirements and that he does still work for the company.  </p><p>Well, the House Judiciary Committee is slapping the Justice Department with  a subpoena for documents related to the Clinton e-mail server  investigation.  Chairman Bob Goodlatte saying he had no choice since they  have only received a fraction of the roughly 1.2 million documents that  they requested months ago.  Goodlatte spoke about this on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\", Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We  need to have those documents.  The department and the bureau have been  slow.  I would say, now, very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I  was on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those  documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later, still don't  have them.  So, this is coming to a hit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Here we are.  The Justice Department has two weeks to comply  with this subpoena.  </p><p>Well, it's the day for an IPO.  The cloud storage company, Dropbox, bumping  the price of its shares in its initial public offering to $21.00, that's  the second hike for Dropbox.  They had previously set a range of $16.00- $18.00 a pop.  The bump up shows strong demand among the investors.  Shares  start trading today on the NASDAQ, the symbol is DBX, the company is valued  at over $8 billion.  So, we're talking about the big tech company  struggling lately.  How are the unicorns going to do? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see how the deal does today even in the face of a  down market.  Lauren, thank you so much.  Dropbox -- I want to get your  take on that later.  Dagen, this subpoena, we knew this was coming.  Bob  Goodlatte told me on Sunday that it was coming.  I find it extraordinary  that they can request 1.2 million documents and only get 3000 back.  How is  it possible that the FBI just blows off the committee that has jurisdiction  over it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think some of the blame needs to be directed at Attorney  General Jeff Sessions, that I think that it's the entrenched old-school  lifelong government workers who are part of the problem here.  But again,  who's running the FBI?  Jeff Sessions, I know, he's recused himself in any  matters dealing with Russia, but what about Rod Rosenstein?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  I mean, somebody has got to enforce this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they've only received 3000 of the documents.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  The numbers look so ludicrous.  I mean, 3000 over -- it looks  like, forget about it, just told defiance.  I think Americans feel like,  there's a million document, let's give a big chunk of those and see what's  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, don't forget when our friend, Jason Chaffetz,  was running the Oversight Committee and he went into a hearing and said,  you are officially served.  He handed the subpoena to the FBI, months  before this subpoena, and they still didn't comply.  So, I don't know, but  you're right, it's up to Jeff Sessions.  Somebody has to enforce this to  get those documents within this investigation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm still -- I'm (INAUDIBLE) awaiting the inspector general's  report, particularly.  It's only been -- it's been less than a week since  Andrew McCabe got fired.  </p><p>SMITH:  You're right about one thing: you're fighting the real backbone,  which is the entrenched government employees, which typically lean to the  left.  And they're certainly as we've seen time and time after again,  they're anti-Trump.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They only sleep on their left side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to have Devin Nunes on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, your hair is thin on the one side.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, then your arm hurts you.  We're going to have Devin Nunes  on, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", Chairman of the Intel Committee, to take  more about that.  We'll take a quick break right here.  NFL Free Agent,  Eric Reid, walking away from kneeling.  We will tell you why a big  supporter of Colin Kaepernick is saying now, what he's saying now about the  pregame protest.  Plus, the sting of the Hornets -- Charlotte makes NBA  history with a massive blowout win.  Sports is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Here's our -- four games, three upsets in the NCAA  March Madness.  Jared Max with the highlights, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  March Madness indeed, Maria.  Out of  17.3 million brackets in ESPN's tournament challenge, you know how many  picked all four that won last night?  349, which is actually somewhat  remarkable considering the unlikelihood of these results -- a matchup of  Wildcats.  Kentucky favored to beat Kansas State, but K-state cats,  scratched this tie breaking layup for Barry Brown with 19 seconds left, K- state scores the upset 61-58.  One win for the first final four since 1964.  </p><p>The number nine seeded Wildcats play Saturday in the elite eight?  the 11- seated Ramblers from Loyola Chicago.  When it's time for leaving, I hope  you understand, I was born a rambling man in Rambler.  Its town says, it's  not time for leaving yet.  Loyola Chicago beats Nevada, 69-68.  They're in  the elite eight for the first time in 55 years since 98-year-old Team  Chaplan, Sister Jean.  Getting lots of brotherly love from the Ramblers  players.  So, we're number nine seed one -- a number 11 seed one. </p><p>And another number nine, football powerhouse, Florida State knocked out  last year's runner-up, Gonzaga.  Seminoles win 75 to 60 in the regional  finals for the third time.  The only game that went as expect, third seed,  Michigan, won its 12th straight.  The Wolverines eliminated Texas A&amp;M, 99- 72.  Michigan plays Florida State four more games tonight, including the  only number one seeds left, Kansas and Villanova in action.  </p><p>Record-setting night in the NBA: Charlotte Hornets became only the sixth  team ever to win a game by 60 points or more.  Wild night, Dwight Howard,  not part of the mix.  He served the one-game suspension; didn't matter.  As  the Hornets did something we haven't seen in 20 years with this type of  blowout.  Kemba Walker hit 10, three-pointers, a team record.  They win by  61 points.  Walker at 46 points and only 28 minutes -- nobody had ever  scored that many in so few minutes since the shot clock came to date.  </p><p>Hey, Johnny Manziel, making a comeback, former high spin trophy winner,  sober, looking healthy, full-faced, in football shape, attracted scouts  from 13 NFL teams yesterday at a pro-day work at San Diego.  Unemployed NFL  free safety, Eric Reid, one of the original national anthem kneelers with  former teammate, Colin Kaepernick, says he's not going to kneel anymore.   He says, the message was understood that they didn't kneel to protest the  national anthem.  Question: when you and your significant other do yoga, do  you ever try to re-create the scene in dirty dancing?  As Patriots  Quarterback, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen did.  They've had the time of their  lives and, Maria, they've never felt this way before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Look at that.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I don't want to know that, Jared.  I just -- I don't what to  know that last piece.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tom Brady is pretty and tolerable, but somehow he just managed  to become even more.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BRENBERG:  Come on!  Keep it to yourself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's doing yoga.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Keep it to yourself.  </p><p>SMITH:  What you do in privacy of your yoga sessions.  Johnny Manziel, you  can't keep your eyes off of him.  Is he going to sign with them or  anything?</p><p>MAX:  I think so.  The 13 scouts there to watch throw.  He looks healthy.   He looks like he's ready to play football.  Because he looks so sick for a  while and not doing well.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I love the comeback stories.  I'd love to see it happen.  </p><p>MAX:  We love the comebacks.  You know, Tiger Woods, we're all rooting for  now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's not compare Johnny Manziel to Tiger Woods.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Johnny Manziel has proved that --</p><p>MAX:  Correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: -- he can't play professional football.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I want the comeback story here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  O wanted Tom Brady to fall on, still.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But he did it.  They are perfect.  You need to understand  they're perfect.  That's it, Dagen.  Jared, thank you.  Jared's sports  reports Fox News Headlines 24/7 and SiriusXM 115, catch him.  We'll be  right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for  joining us this Friday.  It is Friday, March 23rd, your top stories right  now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

But, over the long run, strategists are optimistic about Amazon, Facebook, and Google as well as the broader tech and communications sectors. Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren proposed breaking up Amazon, Google and Facebook, and said Apple should have to split off its App Store. Few expect that to take place. </p><p>But even if much more tech regulation is on the way, experts see big positives for those companies and for the sector in general. As Senator Elizabeth Warren proposes busting up four of the world's largest tech companies, Wall Street strategists aren't quaking in fear. Warren wants to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook[1], and also says Apple should be forced to split off the App Store.[2] While investors don't want any of that to happen, they're also not that worried about what Warren's call means for tech. \"[Breakups] would not be, over the longer term, a terrible thing for the tech sector,\" Kristina Hooper, the chief global market strategist for $946 billion Invesco, told Business Insider by phone. \"Regulations are not what capitalists embrace, and with good reason, but it doesn't spell the end of the world for any sector.\" She added that the tech sector would eventually overcome those breakups much like the steel and telecom industries survived the splitting of US Steel and AT...respectively. Even if stock prices in the mega-cap tech space take an immediate hit, the longer-term impact is likely to be muted[3], according to Sameer Samana, the global equity and technical strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That's because traders still bullish on tech fundamentals can use selling as an excuse to boost exposure at a discount. \"If regulation was to create buying opportunities, that would probably only make us more favorable on the sector,\" Samana said. Carl Szabo, vice president of the e-commerce group NetChoice, said he's worried about rising hostility toward business and an increase in all sorts of regulation. But he's still optimistic about the companies' prospects in the longer term. \"These businesses are generating incredible revenues and incredible profits,\" he said. \"Even if regulation chips into some of that, they're still going to be significant engines of economic success.\" It's worth emphasizing that few on Wall Street think that Warren's proposals will be enacted as they face political and legal hurdles in the event she's elected. But even if a tech breakup does occur, or if regulatory oversight is expanded, there's still plenty to be optimistic about. Here are the five main reasons gleaned by Business Insider in conversations with a handful of Wall Street experts:1) Everything is going onlineThe changes in modern life that have helped these four companies soar in value in recent decades, like tremendous growth in online shopping and entertainment, are so powerful that new regulations won't diminish them. That leaves the strategists very optimistic about tech's future. \"Tech is either at the forefront of, or it forms a backbone of, all those different big picture trends,\" Samana said.2) More efficient stocks winHooper says huge companies that spread into numerous businesses generally trade at a discount compared to more focused ones. That's because investors feel the larger companies are less nimble and efficient than pure plays \u2014 and it means investors might jump at the chance to invest in specific parts of Amazon, Google, or Facebook if they were split up. \"Most companies that are conglomerates trade at a conglomerate discount,\" she says.

Szabo said that the costs of some of Warren's regulations will be \"incredible,\" but the tech giants have more than enough cash to handle them. But smaller companies that don't make as much money will have a very hard time doing the same.4) The benefits of regulationSamana and Hooper both argue that new regulations might solve real problems in the technology industry by improving data privacy and making it easier for users to trust these companies after a slew of high-profile scandals[5]. While Hooper says most critics are focused on the idea that new rules could threaten growth or profits, she said continuing controversies over privacy and fake news might be just as damaging for the companies and their stocks. \"Rising mistrust from consumers would also be a possible headwind,\" she said. Samana said consumers might feel better about their relationship with big tech if they had more chances to decide how they want their data to be used, and the companies could gain a new revenue stream if they give users an opportunity to pay them not to collect or sell some personal information. \"It maybe ends up being a more fulfilling relationship for both sides,\" he said.5) Tech's other winnersSamana says that if new regulations are implemented, smaller tech companies might briefly rally on the expectation they will benefit. Over the longer term, he said new rules will create business opportunities for some companies. If the tech giants have to follow new data protection or privacy rules, Samana said, they may have to spend a lot of money on new security software and upgrades. \"We are at a watershed moment for tech and data privacy,\" he said. \"The technology almost hasn't kept pace with how consumers' preferences have shifted.\"NOW WATCH: Here's how North Korea's Kim Jong Un became one of the world's scariest dictators[6]See Also: The CEO of the world's largest miner details where he's investing as the world shifts away from fossil fuels \u2014and he says it could lock in 100 years of profits[7]Bank of America has a simple solution for companies looking to boost their stocks: Put more women in charge.

Mid-single-digit market growth that is slightly below the historic average reflects a global economy being buffeted by various political and economic forces, and well as healthcare funding challenges in both developed and emerging markets. Diverging macroeconomic prospects across the different regions, in addition to the UK's separation from the EU and uncertainty under the Trump administration, makes a slight downgrade to our global medical device market a likely scenario. With well-developed healthcare systems and an evolving regulatory landscape, Western Europe remains the most attractive region in the world in which to commercialise a medical device, as reflected in our Medical Devices Risk/Reward Index. Asia, led by well-established markets such as Japan and rapidly growing emerging markets such as China, and the Americas, led by the weight of the US and Canada, have above average scores. Eastern Europe, MENA and SSA have below average scores, hit by political, economic and operational risks. In FY17, R&amp;D expenditure of orthopaedic device companies remained flat with only a few companies reporting significant increases, unlike FY16, when the majority of orthopaedic companies increased their R&amp;D expenditure in line with revenue growth. More specifically, Stryker led the way by far with a 10.1% increase in its R&amp;D expenditure, followed by NuVasive, which increased its R&amp;D expenses by 5.1%. Zimmer Biomet, Globus Medical, Medtronic and Wright Medical Group reported very small changes (less or equal to 1%) compared to their FY16 R&amp;D expenses. Smith &amp; Nephew reported a relatively higher decline, around 3% y-o-y.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1448183</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-5H51-JD33-J1R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Monitor International Ltd.

At first blush, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. </p><p>CEO confidence is through the roof, companies are flush with stock thanks to buybacks, and private equity is sitting on Everest-like piles of dry powder. Three theories for the early 2020 lethargy:1. Regulatory pressures. All sorts of deals are being blocked, or at least put under very tough scrutiny, by a variety of governments in a variety of industries. It's not just about U.S. regulators and big tech (which, truth be told, has largely skated so far). The FTC this morning announced it will sue to block Edgewell, the maker of Schick razors, from buying Harry's for $1.3 billion in cash and stock.Harry's says it is \"disappointed\" and is \"evaluating the best path forward.\" 2. Coronavirus. This won't permanently stop mergers that make strategic and financial sense, but it could slow announcements until both parties can get a better handle on what the spreading illnesses mean for their businesses (including for their supply chains). Axios' Dion Rabouin and Joann Muller go deeper on the growing global economic threat of coronavirus[1]. 3. Political uncertainty: It's mostly a CEO excuse for not pulling the trigger, but it's still being discussed. Particularly in a presidential election year in which two of the leading Democratic candidates are pledging to fundamentally restructure a healthcare industry that played host to many of last year's largest deals (including BMS buying Celgene for $74 billion).The bottom line: January may prove to have been an anomaly, and 2020 M&amp;A volume could end up more closely resembling 2019 than 2013. But so far it's been all systems stop.Go deeper: Guitar-maker Fender gets new majority owner[2] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-global-economic-threat-c7eeac4a-c2a4-4be2-9815-45ae7af117e5.html\">https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-global-economic-threat-c7eeac4a-c2a4-4be2-9815-45ae7af117e5.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/servco-pacific-fender-tpg-growth-d53db6b7-3dc1-4dad-bffe-0203834f1f15.html\">https://www.axios.com/servco-pacific-fender-tpg-growth-d53db6b7-3dc1-4dad-bffe-0203834f1f15.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544158074414517775776100123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4C-P0H1-F03R-N234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"389\"/><timeReceived>3:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>top</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>business</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A0EC</classCode><className>MERGERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkZCODBEQTBEMjdDNDA1Njk5NDIxQjQ3MThGQ0MyMUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjRDRTUzQzBCMEIyNDU5QkE4QjFDMEE2Qjg2MUZDOTk</classCode><className>Mergers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001118</classCode><className>MERGERS &amp;

Australia has to find ways to avoid becoming a digital colony of either, writes Sandy Plunkett.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When we hear Australian business and political leaders say the world is more connected than ever, despite the current climate of Donald Trump's America First and the UK's Brexit, we know they're right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But ask them to extrapolate on the socio-economic implications of that hyper-connectedness for their businesses and for Australians, the response is typically platitudes about inclusiveness, opportunity, jobs and growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What they won't talk about is the downside.</p><p>There are only two types of people in the world: those that own and control networks; and those that use them. And like crack addicts are to dealers, the users make the owners multibillionaires. Five of the eight richest people in the world are owners of networks. None are Australian.</p><p>The outsized wealth of network owners is why many Australian leaders - from bank CEOs to start-up founders - are all wanting to emulate a fraction of the success of the network platform giants.</p><p>\"People love to criticise the tech giants, and there may be plenty to criticise, but every business leader would kill to have a piece of what Google, Facebook and Amazon have,\" says Richard White, CEO of ASX-listed logistics software darling WiseTech Global.</p><p>White's network savvy, particularly as it applies to understanding the physical to digital network dividend and leveraging Australian engineering talent to scale globally in the logistics space, has earned him an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion.</p><p>This winners-take-all \"network effect\" is as true for countries as it is for individuals and businesses.</p><p>In a regional and global context, Australia is a network user. The US and China are today's unrivalled network owners. Both are in an arms race for supremacy of a blitz-scaled world driven by big data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Yet after more than two decades, most Australian leaders have been watching this unprecedented shift from the sidelines. The generalities they proffer are a clear tell their understanding of network science and the properties that cause networks to scale or wither, remains paper thin.</p><p>\"It's a critical knowledge gap Australia needs to close. We've missed the first phase of the digital network revolution,\" says Adrian Turner, the CEO of Data61, the CSIRO's data science agency.</p><p>\"Most people are late to understanding 21st-century network scale because they don't have a good grasp of history and they have far less of a grasp of network science,\" says celebrated economic historian Niall Ferguson, a Senior Fellow of Stanford's Hoover Institution, a geopolitical think tank.</p><p>\"If you think that Lehman Bros failed because Dick Fuld [Lehman's last chairman] was an asshole, which was basically the thinking adopted at the time, you fail to see that Lehman was a hugely critical node in a highly complex network,\" says Ferguson with typical candour.</p><p>We need to study-up on network science and quickly, because in the digital age, no country is an island, networks never sleep and they are highly calibrated engines for profit for the few and tribalism for the many, he says.</p><p>\"All these studies about inequality ... Thomas Picketty [author of the best-selling book Capital in the 21st Century] missed the point entirely. The story of today's massive inequality is a story about network structure. It has far less to do with the rate of profit being higher than the rate of growth.\"</p><p>If we don't understand network structures and theory, \"egalitarian\" Australia may be doomed to be a low-value player in a cut-throat networked global economy.</p><p>Since the revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and numerous privacy breaches and censorship snafus, Facebook CEO and chairman Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to placate users and regulators for the unintended negative consequences of networked social media.</p><p>\"Duh,\" says Ferguson. \"From the birth of the internet, the tech titans have uttered versions of this utopian cyber babble: 'We're all going to be Netizens, and everything will be awesome'. But networks - digital or otherwise - have always been instruments for great inequality and tribalism.\"</p><p>In his book The Square and the Tower, Ferguson looks at the world through the lens of successive network revolutions, not just industrial ones.</p><p>\"In the 15th century the chief disruptor was Martin Luther. He used the printing press to disrupt a corrupted Roman Catholic hierarchy in Europe.</p><p>\"What happened was a Pandora's box had been opened and Europe was plunged into more than a hundred years of religious conflict, much of it staggeringly violent.\"</p><p>It was only the first of a succession of network propelled revolutions that followed, from the Enlightenment to the French and American revolutions to today's Silicon Valley-led digital version.</p><p>The 21st-century technocrats didn't invent networks, but they did automate and scale them. And despite calls for greater regulatory scrutiny and the break-up of big tech, they continue to do so at an alarmingly accelerated pace. They achieve this by harnessing a deep knowledge of network science and behavioural science.</p><p>Network scientists see people as nodes. We, the nodes, have edges in terms of our relationships, and those edges connect us to other nodes. Some people have more edges than others. When you look at network structure, the thing to note is which nodes have hub-like properties and hierarchies.</p><p>Network and data scientists see the complex interactions and dynamics of nodes, hubs and edges in every human endeavour.</p><p>So, if you want to understand inequality, look to the winners-take-all network properties; if you want to understand financial markets, Islamic extremism or the innovation of Silicon Valley, look into their networks and at their hubs, spokes and edges.</p><p>Networks are everywhere, all around us and inside us. The prevalence of networks is probably why we throw the word around so casually but so often miss the important stuff, like pollsters missing the rise of Trumpism; or predicting a Labor victory in the last Australian federal election.</p><p>Our brains are neural networks and while neuroscientists understand more of how the brain works, we still don't know how we arrive at an idea or an \"Aha!\" moment. Like \"innovation\", the output of many \"Aha!\" moments, the word \"network\" is overused and misunderstood.</p><p>The technocrats also know things don't go viral because they are good ideas, which is the common and dangerous assumption. Things go viral because of the properties of the network they enter.</p><p>It's also true of diseases and it turns out that ideas, good and bad, behave a lot like infectious diseases. Outrage, the inflamed language of fake news and hate speech spreads like wildfire and it is the structure of the networks that determines the speed of contagion.</p><p>As was clear in the spread of video from the Christchurch massacre, it is impossible to control without also negatively impacting far more benign and educationally important expressions of free speech.</p><p>Australia's domestic economy is a sub-network of a super global network. But economists obsessed with macro models generally don't think about the economy as a network.</p><p>One striking visualisation of the global networked economy is Harvard's Atlas of Economic Complexity.</p><p>Since 2011, a team at Harvard has been developing and refining this data visualisation tool that maps the dynamics of global trade and ranks countries according to industrial capabilities and knowhow.</p><p>It includes data from 250 countries and territories, classified into 20 categories of goods and five categories of services. Combined, this results in coverage of over 6000 products worldwide, with coloured dots representing exports of $100 million.</p><p>Some products, like medical imaging or Swiss watches, are far more complex than others, like iron ore. The world's most complex economies are Japan, Switzerland and Germany. How good is Australia? In terms of economic complexity, not very. It ranks 93 out of 140 countries assessed. More disturbing is that its ranking has dropped 23 places in a decade.</p><p>In a world of increasing product and market complexity the countries that show the fastest declines in the past decade have become increasingly dependent on commodities (like Australia), or were affected by political instability or civil war.</p><p>Our relatively low economic complexity and low penetration of international markets makes us vulnerable.</p><p>Seek Founder and venture capitalist Paul Bassett recently tweeted: \"Most of our largest companies are focused mainly on the Australia and New Zealand market [banking and retail]. But in today's world many markets are won globally not locally. As a result, our national winners and our economy are vulnerable to disruption.\"</p><p>This has been true for some time and it's starting to bite. Australia is in per capita recession with low innovation output, low internationalisation, stagnant wages and high household debt crushing consumer confidence. We need to up our game with 21st-century skills, products that can scale globally.</p><p>There are pockets of network science expertise in Australian research and business, though this knowledge is not nearly diffused enough.</p><p>Many of the CSIRO's Data61 400-plus PhDs and researchers are experts in network science, machine learning and AI. Data61 even goes so far as to call itself a network and not an institution.</p><p>But on how wide and deep the agency's interactions are with business leaders about the properties of networks and how to apply them, CEO Adrian Turner admits it does not happen nearly as often, nor as structured as he would like. But not, he says, through lack of trying.</p><p>\"To leap ahead in the next generation of the networked economy, we need to disrupt today's vertically integrated platforms with more open, federated, global data co-operatives. They allow for more participants in a value chain to share in the new value created from their data, and to train AI systems to remove the scale advantages of today's platform companies.\"</p><p>Turner says this \"federated\" model will allow access to larger-scale datasets.</p><p>This is important. Big data is critical to training artificial intelligence systems and countries with large populations and low privacy protections, like China have unassailable advantages.</p><p>A federated approach could help Australia to compete and to avoid becoming a mere colonial digital outpost of either China or the US. But it also presents enormous new complexities, not just in harnessing scarce skills and enterprise to pursue such a strategy, but also as it relates to myriad surveillance and privacy issues.</p><p>Last month, Data61's parent organisation, CSIRO, produced its four-yearly research treatise, the Australian National Outlook 2019 report. The 172-page CSIRO/NAB ANO models alternative futures for Australia to 2060. The ANO offers a binary choice: a business-as-usual path of slow decline, or a collective effort toward something called the Outlook Vision.</p><p>No prizes for guessing which future the CSIRO, NAB and its 21 additional partner companies want us to embrace.</p><p>But how we get there is unclear. The report has no policy recommendations or specific milestones and action items to pursue or monitor.</p><p>The two primary phases of network disruption between the first phase in the 15th-century printing press era and the second 1970s phase with the birth of the personal computer were separated by a return to hierarchy in the late 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p>Why? Because the technology of the period - steamship lines, railroads, the telegraph and telephone favoured centralised control.</p><p>The rise of Silicon Valley in the 1970s happened not just because of the technology but because the existing hierarchy was weak. The commercial internet flourished because the US government had little interest in innovating it beyond its research origins, allowing the venture capital and private tech sector to have at it.</p><p>\"There was also a Soviet internet at the same time, but it failed because of Soviet hierarchy,\" says Ferguson.</p><p>China's 21st-century communist hierarchy is hell-bent on not repeating that mistake. Its aggressive digital and AI-driven global expansion ambitions have deeply unsettled the US.</p><p>It should unsettle Australians too. Although the rhetoric of today's big tech titans speaks of a flat world full of opportunity for all, the fact is that the global network platforms originating in both the US and China are highly centralised.</p><p>Australia is wedged between a tech war between these network superpowers. The intractable issues in the current trade war are about intellectual property rights and theft and technology transfer restrictions and obligations. We confront a choice between two worlds, says Ferguson. Neither very appealing.</p><p>\"Silicon Valley's world in which data are available indirectly to the highest bidder because everything is about is essentially about advertising revenue; and a Chinese model in which everything is about maintaining the power of the Communist Party and your data are available on-demand to Xi Jinping. That's not a great choice.\"</p><p>History shows us that creating mass interconnectedness is not going to bring universal harmony to the world. It all comes down to friction between squares and towers and the relationships between networks and hierarchies.</p><p>How it turns out for Australia, a culture that has long believed in a social contract based on egalitarianism and the fair go is ours to answer.</p><p>The CSIRO ANO report was right to say a future prosperous Australia requires a cultural and intellectual shift. But just how do we maintain our democratic roots and values in a winners-take-all networked economy that we have had little role in designing and scaling is the key question of our time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76exuqyczrqsb6psbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNV-1FV1-F0J6-J3R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Google parent company Alphabet announced plans to purchase smartwatch maker Fitbit for $2.1 billion.                     AFPBELGIUM - An international group of consumer advocates and NGOs denounced Google s bid for sports smartwatch-maker Fitbit Thursday, saying it would threaten privacy and grant Google unfair access to a new market.  Google s $2.1 billion acquisition of the maker of smartwatches and fitness trackers was unveiled in November and rang alarms among global regulators over antitrust and privacy worries.  Fitbit is a pioneer in the market for connected watches and other physical activity sensors that measure the number of daily steps taken, calories burned or hours of sleep missed.   READ: Zoom vows to address privacy, safety issues after complaints   A group of 20 NGOs  have significant concerns  that the takeover  would be a game-changer not only for how people interact with the online world but also for digital and related health markets,  a statement said.   Regulators around the world... must therefore give it their utmost attention,  they said, calling it a  test case  on facing down big tech firms.  The groups included BEUC, which unites EU consumer advocates, as well as the Consumer Federation of America in the US and digital rights groups in Mexico, Brazil and Australia.  EU regulators, who are to decide on the case by July 20, are especially concerned with Silicon Valley giants buying their way into new areas and then stifling competition.   READ: Court approves record $5 bn fine of Facebook over privacy    Wearable devices could replace smartphones as the main gateway to the internet, just as smartphones replaced personal computers,  said a statement by 20 NGOs from around the globe.   Google\u2019s expansion into this market, edging out other competitors would thus be significant,  it said.  In February, the European Data Protection Board urged Google to make major assurances on privacy and data before it approved the buyout.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42555645036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609V-2X01-JCSC-J01K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>South Africa News Shafaqna</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The preliminary report contains 11 recommendations include giving a new or existing regulatory body far-reaching powers to investigate and monitor how tech companies display advertising and news stories.</p><p>Wheeler, now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said the report could \"absolutely\" influence the policy debate in the US, where Democratic and Republican politicians have been reluctant to crack down on the tech industry.</p><p>Wheeler headed the powerful Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017 and is best known for establishing \"net neutrality\" laws to ensure internet service providers treat all data equally. \"I have personally felt the lobbying power of the big tech companies - they have controlled the debate in the US,\" Wheeler said. \"When new ideas are put forward by relevant and respected nation states you would be crazy not to pay attention and I hope our policymakers will.\" He said he was particularly impressed by the ACCC's call for data collection settings on services from the likes of Facebook and Google to be switched to \"off\" by default.</p><p>Ghosh, who served as a technology policy advisor during the Obama administration before moving to Facebook, said the proposed opt-in laws could \"deflate their business model overnight\".</p><p>\"The suggestions in the ACCC report are very rigorous and robust,\" he said.</p><p>Justin Hendrix, who teaches a course in technology, media and democracy at New York University, said: \"This is a significant document that contains a lot of very sensible and straightforward suggestions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc735a47nm9jp1g6ajtgm6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY2-6DY1-JD34-V40S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Twitter, for instance, hid one tweet from President Trump Hage one tweet from President Trump that it said was a bit that it said was a bit misleading not one that was a bit misleading and one which is and one which was a bit provocative, a bit provocative and he said You know When the and he said, you know, lootings starts shooting starts since on say they \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" and so on. So, they are, themselves, taking some responsibility. are themselves taking some responsibility so can governments and So can governments and the Googles and the Facebooks, the at Google and Facebook's you know, step up to this step up to this challenge themselves challenge themselves? I'm sceptical I can agree with us and has more on I'm sceptical, and I couldn't agree with Rasmus more on this issue. this issue I am I'm a huge advocate of free freedom I'm a huge advocate of freedom of expression of expression and freedom of speech and freedom of speech, and the big tech companies are doing their best to and the big tech companies are doing their best to show show that they can do this regulation of doing more that they can do this regulation so doing colder than they ever have and they're doing more so during Covid than they ever have, and I commend and, you know, I commend some of their efforts. some of their efforts there are certain things we should certainly remove child pornography for There are certain things we should certainly remove - example or suicide videos are all sorts of things child pornography, for example, or suicide videos. There's all sorts of things that we should take it down I think those are all that we should take down. I think those are a lot easier on a lot easier than when it gets to expressions of than when it gets to expressions of a policy policy or other forms that you can even go through or other forms that, you know, you can't even go all the different variations through all the different but I think there's going to be a lot of variations. But I think there's going to be a lot of discussions discussions in countries over the next year in countries over the next year, especially around things especially around like Section 230, which is a particular law in the United States that grants immunity to these platforms, and whether that holds or doesn't hold, that will really kind of give us direction on where we're going. But my overall opinion about this is that we have to be very careful about having governments control this, because it's a slippery slope. Once you start giving them that kind of control, then it can lead to some of the things that Rasmus said. And I think this is something that we all need to engage in right now because the platforms, because of things like GDPR that happened in Europe and some of these other laws that are now taking place, or at least discussions in United States are happening, we need all of society to engage in this particular topic. You're referring there to the data protection laws in Europe. Thanks very much indeed. Anastasia, do you want to come back quickly to what you've just heard? Yeah. Thank you very much for your answer. I also think that this line is too narrow between free speech and the control of the government. So, yeah, it is rather a complicated question. All right. Thank you very much indeed. Well, gentlemen, thank you very much indeed to my two panellists and to my questioners, also.

What can you do about governments when they are involved in misinformation? I won't go into the examples but we all kind of know on the accusations fly all over the place. There will be three words, invest in journalism. </p><p>It's not always possible in some environments, but investing in journalism and investing in education of that information consumer. There is a lot of discussion right now about throwing legal infrastructure at the problem, throwing technical infrastructure of the problem, but to me it's making the information consumer as savvy as possible, and that has to start really young but it also has to be thrown and provided for the older generations that are not digital natives. I am a huge advocate of education and investing in journalism. But there's not a lot to do with the government decides it will deny people access to various sites. There's not a lot you can do and that is where the wild wild west of the internet helps. It's a double-edged sword in ways. It is a big problem but the more we provide access to that information across the world as we mentioned in a previous question so far in this discussion that's one of the ways we can get at some of these things. So access to information despite its problems is what we should be after as well. Has the your question? Yes, I want to thank the panel. I was thinking that this misinformation, there are issues about our democracy. Thank you, Joey, from Shanghai in China. Let us go to our last question now and it is Anastasia from Ukraine. My question is, can misinformation be regulated at governmental level without the breaking of basic human rights? I'm very sceptical of that personally. We have a balance to strike between free expression and other human rights that most countries have signed up to, and I think there are good reasons to have legal limits on Hicks Beach and other forms of criminal speech but when it comes to misinformation I think very often misinformation is information that is to stir me an offensive and shocking and not necessarily true. -- hate speech. But this is traditionally covered by freedom of expression rules and we really need to be careful as several of you have pointed out your questions because a lot of misinformation concerns politics and governments and there will always be a temptation if we criminalise things that could be misleading, that they will be used by powerful people and institutions to silence the critics, as of course historically has happened, even in democracies, such rules are being used by powerful people. So we need to be very careful and I'm glad to see courts in free societies around the world express great scepticism towards attempts to regulate misinformation in the last couple of days. Before you answer that, Jeff a related issue about regulation. Some of the platforms themselves are trying to do things, Twitter for instance hid one tweet from President Trump that it said was a bit misleading and one which was a bit provocative when he said the looting starts, the shooting starts and so on, so they themselves are taking some responsibilities, so can governments and Googles and Facebooks step up to this challenge themselves? Imes optical. -- I am sceptical. I'm a huge advocate of freedom of expression and freedom of speech and big tech companies are doing their best to show that they can to this regulation and they are doing more so now than they ever have. I commend some of their efforts. There are certain things we should remove, child pornography for example or suicide videos, all sorts of things we should take down. Those are a lot easier than when it gets to expressions of a policy or other</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-38dadee25deb449894cc1b743c8208f9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6078-9W31-JBH6-C182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Good morning, great to see you as always.  And great to see all of you.   I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, April 9th.  Your  top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Crisis in Syria, yet another suspected chemical weapons attack leaving  dozens dead, the international community on high alert.  As the world waits  for a U.S. response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TOM BOSSERT, WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR:  I wouldn't take  anything off the table, these are horrible photos, we're looking into the  attack at this point.  I think the president's got a point that's been very  clear and I'm going to reiterate that point.  The pendulum has swung in the  wrong direction for too long and the United States of America has been  taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the  entire world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Despite the tension, stocks are pointing to a bounce back as  concerns over a trade war with China eased a little bit, maybe it was the  Sunday morning talk show's rhetoric being thrown out by the White House.</p><p>Futures are showing this, 172 point gain on the DOW Futures right now, it's  losing week for the Blue Chips last week.  This comes after that massive  selloff on Friday with the DOW, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P all falling more than two  percent.</p><p>In Europe, you have some buying to report, the England, France, and  Germany, we have gains across the board.  In Asia overnight, stocks also  moving higher.  The biggest winner there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Zuckerberg taking the Hill, Facebook CEO set to meet with lawmakers in  Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate  tomorrow.  The latest as the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says more  people's data could have been exposed.</p><p>And a change at the top, Deutsche Bank naming a new CEO, the details as  shares jumped on the news.</p><p>And terrifying moments on a New York highway, a tour bus slamming into an  overpass leaving six people seriously injured, more on their condition  ahead.</p><p>And the DOJ stonewalling, why Congress Trey Gowdy is calling out the  Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses. </p><p>And orange going to love this, Bud Light going citrus for the summer, the  new flavor hitting store shelves coming up.  I think that's called a summer  shandy.  </p><p>All of that and so much more this morning, Pollster Maslansky and Partners  President, Lee Carter.  Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.   And the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  </p><p>I start with you, markets this week, we get bank earnings, worries about a  trade war but, again, now geopolitical concerns that the focusing shifted  to that.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR:  Yes.   Yes, it has.  Although it's interesting to watch these back and forth with  the trade wars.  You get some rhetoric out of the White House, we -- the  talk on Thursday night, Friday morning stocks (INAUDIBLE) over the weekend,  everybody's out there talking about how this is not a big deal, we don't  want a trade war, you come back Monday morning, stocks up again.</p><p>We're seeing this pattern repeat again and again.  It seems to take a day  or two for markets to digest that you've got rhetoric and you've got  reality on trade and the reality probably isn't going to be as bad or as  harsh as a rhetoric sounds.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, what are you watching this week?</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO, MANAGING PARTNER:  Absolutely.  So watching the  volatility in the market, that's really spurn -- spurred by this trade war  talk.  And I think just a few months ago we were talking about there's no  volatility in the market.</p><p>We haven't had a one percent move in so many months.  Well now you're  getting two percent move almost on a daily basis.  I think the main thing  for investors to do here is to try to block out the headlines and stick  with their long-term plans.  So we're going to get the down 500s, the  bounces above 200s.  Overall, there's not going to be a major trade war  with China in my opinion, it will back to focus on the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of the White House officials needs some messaging  help because you've got Secretary MNuchin on Friday talking about the  potential of a trade war and then trying to walk back those comments  yesterday saying, \"I don't expect it at all in terms of a trade war.\"   Don't have your Treasury Secretary utter the words trade war ever.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  That would be a  good first step.  But I think it's fascinating to see how the markets are  reacting so much to the rhetoric rather than just the policy.</p><p>It's unbelievable, a tweet, one announcement can send the markets in a  tailspin.  And what's happened traditionally is that we've looked at the  experts and say, \"What are we really supposed to be looking at?\"  One  tweet, one message, one interview can totally change the course of the  markets and we're seeing that this week and certainly the White House  rhetoric tone way back saying this has always been -- there's nothing new  here, nothing's developed here, not a trade war and look, things are  softening again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm looking forward to Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill.   Again, Facebook will reveal today to Facebook users whose data was accessed  by Cambridge Analytica, it's about 70 million people.  Estimates are in the  United States alone.</p><p>And watch Mark Zuckerberg because back in 2010, he broke out into a  Nixonian flop sweat when Walt Mossberg was interviewing him.  And I mean  sweat was dripping off of his face.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if you do that on Capitol Hill, watch your stock tank.</p><p>BRENBERG:  His appearances are always so staged managed.  This one  absolutely cannot be.  And so it's going to be interesting to see what he  does under that kind of pressure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're trying to get the video but he had sweat dripping off his  nose and his chin.  I'm not kidding.  It's --</p><p>CARTER:  This is not where he's comfortable.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  That was -- that was back in the days of the hoodie  sweatshirt.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So you're saying he was hot.</p><p>MURPHY:  So he's come a long way.</p><p>CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) t-shirt.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was -- he was just hot.  OK.  We're going to talk about that  all morning.  Also coming up, New York Congressman Chris Collins, South  Dakota Senator Mike Rounds.  Host of Michelle Malkin Investigates on  CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And Legendary Soulman, my friend, Sam Moore.  You don't want  to miss any of them.  </p><p>Our top story this morning, crossing the red line, the world awaiting the  U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed  dozens of citizens.  Yesterday, warplanes bombing an airbase near the City  of Homs.  Russia and Syria have accused Israel of that strike.  Meantime,  President Trump sending a strong warning to the Assad Regime he tweeted  this, \"Many dead including women and children, in mindless chemical attack  in Syria.  Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army,  making it completely inaccessible to the outside world.  President Putin,  Russia, and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad, big price to  pay.  Open area immediately for medical help and verification.  Another  humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever, sick.\"</p><p>Joining us now is -- this morning is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk  Lippold.  Commander, how do you -- what should the U.S. do to respond?  And  I should point out that we used that phrase red line that was famously a  phrase used by President Obama back in 2010.  Assad and Syria crossed that  red line and we didn't do anything or we didn't attack.  What should we do  now?</p><p>COMMANDER KIRK S. LIPPOLD (RET), FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER:  Good morning  Dagen.  I think the first thing we need to do is verify through  intelligence channels that in fact took place who carried it out, where it  was launched from, what was used to do it? </p><p>And then at that point, we take a step back, put together the military  forces, and then decide whether we're going to react in a manner that is  going to take away that capability not like we did last time with the  Tomahawk missiles.  But this time, on a more permanent basis and with the  backing of the Security Council hopefully at the U.N.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Commander, you brought that up, so there was one -- it was  a sarin gas attack last year, a one-time strike by the United States on a  Syrian airbase.  Why haven't we done more since then?  There was a chlorine  gas attack this past January which was the State Department and Rex  Tillerson, then the Secretary of State basically attacked in a statement.   But why haven't we done more to maybe take out all of Assad's air force,  the entire air force?  </p><p>LIPPOLD:  Well, I think Dagen you have to look at it, what is going to be  our engagement?  What is the end state we want to have there?  Assad is  going to continue to exist as the president of Syria because the Russians  are backing him, they now have the Iranians that are also providing  technical knowledge and an ability to also establish their own basis there  which Israel is not going to tolerate, which probably drove the attack into  the T4 or Tiyas Airbase last night.</p><p>But we have to take a look and say, \"OK, do we want to be the world's  leader in this case where a low level attacks have occurred using chemical  weapons?\"  This was absolutely a much larger scale one, it shows that  they're taking out one of the last strongholds of the Syrians rebels.  At  this point, we need to say, \"No, you either go for it conventionally or we  will take out that capability.\"  And if it does mean that we take out the  Syrian air force, then we better be prepared for a little bit longer  investment in time being in Syria with our forces despite what the  president has said.</p><p>MURPHY:  Commander, it's Mike Murphy.  I love your opinion on the timing of  this of attack because do you think it has to do with the fact that  President Trump is fighting on many different fronts?  We have North Korea,  we have the issues here in the U.S., Russia.  You think Syria and Putin got  together and said, \"Maybe this is a good time to test the president's  medal?\"</p><p>LIPPOLD:  I don't think it was timing for that.  I think that the president  is going to react to it and how he reacts.  I think once again,  internationally bent will drive the decision-making process for the U.S.  government as it always should especially where military force is involved.</p><p>I don't think this is going to be a tail-wagging, dog-type scenario, I  think in fact we need to look at it and say what are our national security  interest there?  What is the end state we want to achieve?  And if taking  out the Syrian air force to send a signal to do that turns out to be the  best option for us, then we execute it efficiently, ruthlessly, and with  overwhelming force.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Brian, and I'll let you get in here but the timing, it does beg  the question of this attack comes at -- right after President Trump says  that we can't wait to get out of Syria, that we -- that -- but, again, he  focus on ISIS and we see the threat to the Syrian people and children in  the Assad Regime.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes, absolutely.  And the other timing issue that I'd like to  ask you about Commander is you have the entrance this week now of John  Bolton into the National Security Advisor role, that has to change things a  little bit.</p><p>He's been critical of these one-off strikes, do we see the tide shift to a  more permanent comprehensive approach here with Ambassador Bolton moving  into that role?</p><p>LIPPOLD:  Professor, that's a great question.  And I think what you're  going to see is Ambassador Bolton is now the National Security Advisor, not  the executer but the advisor is going to say we need a much more  comprehensive plan.  We need a long range view.  We need goals that we want  to achieve for our national security objectives.</p><p>And he is going to take a more holistic approach into the execution of  national security policy across the board.  So I think that you're going to  see a little bit more robust policy, I think you will see one with more  defined objectives in there, and I think you will see one that will be  executed in fairly short order because he is a decisive individual and he's  going to recommend that to the president who obviously brought him in  because he was a little frustrated that he was being held back in some of  the execution of our policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The president did tweet because I mentioned the red line at the  beginning, \"If President Obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand,  the Syrian disaster would have ended a long -- long ago.  Animal Assad  would have been history.\"</p><p>Maria spoke with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Michael McCaul  yesterday and he agrees with the president.  Listen to this Commander.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX) HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  There  has to be a consequence to this.  And I think the president's absolutely  right is that President Obama drew the red line, the red line was crossed,  he did nothing.</p><p>And then he negotiate through John Kerry the settlement, this weapons  convention.  I remember John Kerry saying, \"We took all their chemical  weapons away.\"  Obviously not.  They still have this.  And I also blame  Russia and Iran, I think they're complicit with this as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Commander, I want to get your response to that.  But as I  mentioned earlier, we had that one-time airstrike last April but since  then, there has been a chlorine gas attack that killed 20, mostly children,  that happened in January, there was a statement from the State Department  then but no enforcement.  And Assad certainly knows that he would pay no  price and now this, final thought.</p><p>LIPPOLD:  I think you're absolutely right.  There has to be consequences  for this action.  While there was a red line drawn and unfortunately we did  not react to the red line when Syria crossed it.  We did in fact have one  positive development and that was getting rid of the vast majority of  chemical weapons in there.</p><p>Had we attacked immediately, I doubt we would have ever gotten to that  point with an agreement working with the Russians to make that happen.   That is a positive thing to look at it.  But nonetheless, if you draw a  line as a state actor especially the United States, you have to hold it,  enforce it, and do not waiver on it.  And in doing that, it embolden  people, the one-off strike, that's clearly going to be a test now whether  we react to this in a manner that is much stronger, much more overwhelming  and sends a signal, we will not tolerate this.  </p><p>By the same token, going to Russia and Iran and saying, you're complicit in  this, you have contributed to it, you have created the conditions that  allowed it to happen, you must not do that anymore and there will be  consequences and if your folks happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong  time, that is not our responsibility, it's your decision to put them there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kirk, thank you so much.  Kirk Lippold.  Commander, be well.   Thank you for being here.</p><p>LIPPOLD:  Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting, \"When a car is  sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12  percent.  When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a  tariff to be paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.   No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p>Coming up, on the hot seat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in Washington  today ahead of two intense days of questioning on Capitol Hill.  This comes  as the company had set to alert millions of users if their data was shared.  </p><p>And tired of being patient?  Congress Trey Gowdy calling out the Justice  Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  New week, new energy for Wall Street, DOW Futures right now are  showing gains across the board, 167 point gain on the DOW Futures right now  after what was a bruising week.  Again, cooler heads prevailing I suppose  when it comes to trade war talk.  We'll see what comes out of the  administration in the coming days.  We're also watching the beginning of  earning season this week.</p><p>Meantime, at least six teenagers from New York severely injured after a  charter bus crashed.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that's right Dagen.  The bus packed with high school students  returning from a spring break trip to Europe hit an overpass on Long Island  last night.  The impact was so strong, it tore the roof off the bus.  This  happened on the southern state parkway which restricts travel by commercial  vehicles.  Police say the driver did not seem to be familiar with that  restriction.</p><p>Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joining thousands at a vigil  honoring the junior hockey team involved in a tragic bus accident on  Friday.  The team president speaking to the crowd packed into the humble  Broncos Arena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN GARINGER, HUMBOLDT BRONCOS PRESIDENT:  We will find strength in one  another.  Today and for every day forward, we are all Humboldt Broncos and  we will be forever Humboldt Broncos strong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Fifteen people are now dead after that team's bus collided with a  tractor trailer.  Among those killed were the team's head coach, the driver  of the bus, and several players.  While the community in Saskatchewan tries  to cope, support has been overwhelming.  A victims fund for the Broncos has  already exceeded $4.5 million.</p><p>Well Deutsche Bank is replacing its CEO.  John Cryan is out and Christian  Sewing is taking over.  Sewing is a 47-year-old executive who's worked for  Deutsche Bank for nearly three decades.  Germany's biggest bank has been  struggling since the 2008 financial crisis.  Analysts say the change could  signal a potential merger with another European bank.  Shares of Deutsche  Bank much higher in the premarket, up over three and a half percent right  now.  </p><p>And then finally there's this, Anheuser-Busch unveiling a new flavor of  beer, Bud Light Orange.  It is a light lagger that is brewed usually actual  peels from oranges.  The company says that you will, \"taste the citrusy  goodness.\"  Bud Light Orange available for a limited time for, yes, the  summer.  Shares of Anheuser-Busch are down about three percent so far this  year.</p><p>Dagen, if you ever put an orange in a beer like an orange slice, makes  sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What you do with a Hefeweizen, wheat beer. </p><p>CASONE:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have a question, is this a shandy?</p><p>BRENBERG:  It sounds like it.  I don't like any of these kinds of beer.  It  sounds like a shandy, so I'm negative on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shandy is tip -- do you know shandies?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know shandy but I know this is like Budweiser and Fanta  mixed together, I don't like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That actually sounds delicious.</p><p>CARTER:  I know, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People tweet us, I think a shandy is the -- defined by, it is  like a juice or some fruit flavor or like soda in a beer.  Like, again, the  Leinenkugel's summer shandy is quite delicious on a hot day on the golf  course.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I think beer goes well with beer and nothing else.  So I  wouldn't put any of those stuff, no peels, no nothing.</p><p>CARTER:  My guess is you're not the target audience.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRENBERG:  I don't think I am.  I don't think I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Novartis as closed at $8.7 billion deal for a gene  therapy company in the Midwest.

White House officials helping camp down those fears on  the Sunday shows yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Just technically, we  have taken no action.  It's a long process, there's several months here, so  far no tariffs and no action has been enacted.</p><p>STEPHEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I don't expect there will be a  trade war, it could be but I don't expect it at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting this morning, \" When a car is sent to  the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent.   When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be  paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No, it  sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p>Joining me now is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee.  Mike,  what's going to keep these trade concerns in the background for investors,  the start of earnings potentially?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP PRINCIPAL:  I think this is going to  be one of the best earning seasons we've ever had, right?  Not only from  the actually result but we got to remember that earnings are a forward- looking tool and that's what matters -- I'm sorry, stocks are forward- looking tool.</p><p>So what earnings are going to look like for the rest of the year and then  going out to 2019 when we start talking about 2019, I think a lot of people  are going to sit back and say, \"Well you know what, stocks are actually  really cheap, they're not expensive.\"  We're looking at one of the kind of  the greatest growth periods we're going to see in our lifetimes, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But what if we do get into a back and forth, a tit-for-tat with  China.  Again, you heard from Larry Kudlow and Secretary of the Treasury,  Steve MNuchin, they're trying to like wipe away some of the fears.</p><p>Like, \"Oh, this might not happen.\"  But, again, I just wish some of those  guys would call people I grew up with, hog farmers, and people who grow  soybeans that that impacts the real American economy, that's what the  market is reflecting that the economy might not be growing as fast and  earnings might not be growing as fast.  And it's Boeing and Caterpillar  last week.</p><p>LEE:  So a couple of things, right?  If you run a small business and your  cost are going to go up 20 or 25 or 30 percent based on some tariff like  this, this could be terrifying for you.  However, on a larger scale, what  can China really do to us if that they're not already doing?</p><p>What, are they going to steal our intellectual property?  I mean, the trade  imbalance from China or trade deficit, we're annualizing at just under $400  billion a share, OK?  That is a much larger portion of their GDP than the  $150 billion to $170 billion that we export to them every year.  Again,  problems for people whose (INAUDIBLE) cost are going to go up.</p><p>Our economy as a whole can withstand a trade war much easier than they can.   The standard of living in China is no one near as high as they make it out  to be.  So if China were to -- if China gets into a trade war with us,  chances are they'll go into recession.  If they go into recession, there's  a good probability of a popular uprising.  So that could -- the only way  that the Chinese government could go out of power is by a recession.</p><p>So the government props up their economy, it's held together with duct tape  and elbow grease.  So it's -- look, I -- it's -- I'm saying this but people  much smarter than me and much more powerful than me know this.  So what  we're seeing is a lot of posturing.  So I don't -- any selloff because of  trade war fears I think is a good buying opportunity.</p><p>MURPHY:  Totally agree completely on that because I think what you're  seeing in the market though is you get these headlines and you're getting  this big whip sauce back and forth and I think that's fine for the  professional traders.  But for the people at home, they could really get  hurt in trading this type of market.</p><p>I believe a lot of those whip sauce have to do with computerize trading,  with the algorithm of trading.  So they're pulling headlines and then  you're seeing these big drops in the market or these big rallies in the  market.  And I think it's important for -- and I love your take on that, a  huge portion of the volume out there in a day-to-day basis is computerized.   So individual people at home can really get hurt trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>LEE:  I would say for people over the last couple of years of markets is  too high, the market is too high.  Well you know what, every time you see  an ugly tweet or an ugly headline or Stormy Daniels or something, the  market's going to selloff.  Here's your opportunity to take some of that  cash and buy some stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The market, do I have hope it doesn't selloff on Stormy Daniels.   But go ahead.  I hope investors are smarter than that or the computer.</p><p>LEE:  If you start drilling down and looking at the U.S. economy, a durable  goods are up year-over-year, almost nine percent, that's the highest number  since the early 2000.  You look at manufacturing is doing the best since  the early 2000s.  </p><p>Non-ISM manufacturing is the highest level it's been in 20 years.  You look  at the job market, weekly javas claims have been below 300,000 for almost  three years.  Longest period in almost the history of the entire United  States.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, earnings.  Earnings season starts this week, J.P.  Morgan kind of the big one coming out on Friday, what do you expect overall  growth for the quarter 17 percent but J.P. Morgan expected to put up even  better numbers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LEE: You know, what I'm going to be looking for is the forward guidance.   What's dragged a lot of these banks back particularly is sales of trading.   And now with the return of volatility, I think sales and trading has kind  of been the (INAUDIBLE) as you look at all the different business units in  all these banks.</p><p>It's going to start to get better and then with the banks, as rates are  going higher, their net interest margins are going to expand.  As net  interest margins are going to expand, banks are going to make a lot more  money in their wallets.  And let's face it, 10 years ago when the banks  were in their hay days they were trading shops, now they get back to being  traditional lenders.  </p><p>So when you were -- when you have a $1 trillion of loans out there, you  make an extra 25 basis points on each loan, it's a lot of money, right?  So  -- I mean, the forward guidance is what I'm looking at and as the  conversation switches from 2018 earnings to 2019 earnings I think people  are going to say, \"Wow, stocks are really, really cheap.  Something's going  on here, like the market's going much higher.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Michael Lee, thank you sir.  Good to see you.  Come back soon.</p><p>LEE:  Thanks very much guys.

It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.

What to expect from the congressional hearings, ahead.  Calling  for action, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Trey Gowdy, says the  justice department is stonewalling when it comes to handing over documents  tied to the FISA and Hillary Clinton investigations.  Here's what he told  Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  I want to be  able to support the FBI and the DOJ, but the world's premier law- enforcement agency can't seem to operate a damn copying machine.  That is  inexplicable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the very latest, a strong message for Iran, hackers  attacking the country's network, leaving an image of the American flag.   Warning, don't mess with our elections.  A little bit of a merger Monday on  Wall Street, Novartis is getting big on gene therapy with its latest  acquisition.  </p><p>And a not so quite start for the box office for A Quiet Place, the horror  film soaring passed expectations.  We have the full box office recap,  ahead, plus, a whole new tune for Dr. Seuss' Wocket in my Pocket, a rap of  the childhood classic, going viral.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, the clock, ticking on the DOJ, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, now, asking  Federal Prosecutor John Lausch to help speed up the response to GOP demands  for documents related to the surveillance of former Trump Campaign Advisor,  Carter Page.  The firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI and the  investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, the request,  coming after President Trump took to Twitter this weekend, to slam the DOJ  and FBI, writing, what does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?  </p><p>Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents, unredacted, to the  House Judiciary Committee?  Stalling, but for what reason?  Not looking  good.  House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who has been leading  the charge, sounded off, yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOWDY:  I have not seen a clean version and I need to know what's behind  those black lines because it's really important how this investigation  began, when it began and what is the -- what is the weight, what is the  credibility of the evidence upon which this investigation was launched?   And the Department of Justice and the FBI have that document, they won't  let us see the clean version, and I'm struggling to understand why.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This all comes as the DOJ promises to turn over an additional  3600 pages from the FBI today, to the House panel.  Joining us now is  Editor-in-Chief of Axios, Nick Johnston, Nick, your reaction to these new  developments and where do we go from here?</p><p>NICHOLAS JOHNSTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AXIOS:  Yes, I think it's really  important to hear the frustration in Chairman Gowdy's voice what he told  Maria, sort of, how angry he was about how they can't find the copy machine  that could underscores the tension here and how these are Republicans on  the Hill are still very much focused on getting this kind of information.  </p><p>And this is a Republican justice department that they'd say hasn't been  doing it fast enough, even the President, as you showed, has been tweeting  that the document turnover hasn't happened fast enough.  I think, the  appointment of this new attorney, to facilitate that, will probably help.   It might make some of these folks on the Hill, a little happier, but this  is still a very important investigatory focus for them, and they're not  going to give up until they get what they want.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nick, how do the midterm elections factor into this, though,  because even though we have a Republican president in the White House, and  Republican leading the justice department as the Attorney General, you look  at Trey Gowdy and the other heads, Devin Nunes, head of the House  Intelligence Committee, really there, the time window is closing on them  just, potentially, if the Democrats retake the House.  How critical is that  timing?</p><p>JOHNSTON:  I think it's a really great point.  A lot of what Republicans  want to accomplish in the House today is set under the guise of what will  happen in the midterms and Republicans are coming from a -- from a place of  the underdogs, I think, in this election, and if they lose the gavels on  these committees, these investigations go away.  So I think, certainly, in  the coming months, if they don't get the documents, this pressure will only  increase because they know they have to finish this by the end of the year.</p><p>CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No, Nick, I think, it's a really  interesting conversation that's been have about whether or not the  Republican hold strategy, is to undermine -- is undermine the DOJ and say  that there's not going to be trust in these institutions that are so  important.  Do you think that's fair for them to criticize or do you think  the Republicans have a fair, you know, have a real beef here?</p><p>JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a really interesting point.  We've done some  pulling on this, in fact, quickly, after the President went after the  (INAUDIBLE) investigation recently, and we saw favorability for the FBI  plunge among Republicans which is something we haven't seen, essentially,  ever, as long as the department had existed.  </p><p>I think it's a very, sort of, dicey area to be, sort of, attacking these  law enforcement agencies the way they ever remember, you know, these are  members of congress.  They have clear investigatory ability to get these  kinds of documents, and you know what?  If they subpoena them, you need to  provide them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to Facebook (INAUDIBLE) send out notifications  today to millions of affected users in this data mining scandal.  This  comes as congressional aides are confirming that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will  hold meetings today on Capitol Hill, with several lawmakers ahead of this  week's hearings.  Take a listen to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  and Senate Judiciary Committee, John Kennedy, both suggesting that things  are about to change at the tech giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  Mark's happy to go to congress because  Mark wants to answer every question people have about the service we  office.  We weren't focused enough and being proactive enough and Mark is  happy to say here's what we weren't doing and here's what we are doing now.</p><p>REP. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  I don't want  to hurt Facebook.  I don't want to regulate them half to death.  But, we  have a problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, our problem.  Meantime, a whistleblower, now warning that  the millions of affected users' data could be stored in Russia, I think  that it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's performance because he's sending  out Sheryl Sandberg in his stead, who clearly loves to tell women how to  lean in, in this country, but when -- this is a very serious issue and I  would argue that her performance, last week, in terms of giving interviews,  was a little light, in terms of really grappling with the seriousness of  it.  </p><p>I point to a New York Post, the front page -- the front page of the post,  on Saturday, we own you, pay us for your privacy, shocking, and then Mark  Zuckerberg, famously, in 2010, was sweating like Richard Nixon, breaking  out on a flop sweat-like none other.  Again, it's just going to be  Zuckerberg sitting there, whether the stocks sold off or not.  </p><p>JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a -- this is the main event here.  All the pre- interviews last week with Sheryl Sandberg (INAUDIBLE) were opening acts.   The real thing here, Zuckerberg is on the Hill -- on the Hill, today,  preparing, tomorrow, 2:30, must-see TV.  Zuckerberg, appearing before this  committee, this is something he's never done before in this kind of  hearing, and he doesn't have any natural allies on his committee.  These  senators on both sides of the aisle are gunning for big tech.  And so, this  hearing is a start of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they really gunning for big tech, though, Nick?  I mean, big  tech is -- you know, when you talk about Silicon Valley and technology, it  is one of the most divided areas, politically, that all of the CEOs have  historically been big givers to Democratic candidates.  Their policies lean  very far left.  There's really not room, you saw with the firing of that  Google employee, not room for conservative thought or speech.  And so, I  just wonder what kind of treatments he gets.  </p><p>JOHNSTON:  I would separate it from that.  What this is, is the final --  the first time congress is really going to ask the questions, are these  tech companies too big and if they know so much about their users and have  they done a good job of explaining to users how much they know.  For a lot  of members of the Hill, this is a mystery to them.  There are no natural  allies for Facebook or rather these big technology companies.  I want to  look to see any friendly questions for Mark, tomorrow, when he's in  congress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We've known, Mike Murphy, that this was going on for years, in  terms of Facebook not protecting user information, whether you're talking  about RapLeaf or Cloud and their way of enforcement was to call up the  company telling them, don't do that anymore.  </p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's only because this was somehow related to the Trump  campaign that people are now furious and up in arms.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think what Mark Zuckerberg's going to talk about a lot, this  week, is what Facebook used to do, and what they are doing now, to talk  about how the company has shifted, how they're protecting your data, but  you'll know when go on there, Dagen.  You're giving up a lot of your  information.  If you don't want to give that up, you shouldn't be on  Facebook.  They may have a responsibility to not sell it but they -- once  you're on there, that data is there, and they own it, they do, as the cover  said.  </p><p>BRENBERG,:  Do they know what they're doing now?  That's -- you said  they're going to talk about what they're doing.  Now, I think a lot of  people look at this and say, do they know what they're doing now or are  they really just, like, we actually have no idea what's going on and every  single day now, we're seeing new revelations of more, you know,  inappropriate data sharing, customers having their data used in ways that  they didn't know.  I don't think Facebook has a good handle on where they  are.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this is years ago this is years ago when -- I think it was  2014, the Cambridge Analytica information ended up being given to the  improper parties.  So, I think, Facebook today, 2018, versus four years  ago, is a vastly different company, it has run differently.  So, I think  that's what they want to underline, is how they are now doing their best to  potentially protect their data the best possible.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I think they're going to have you lift, kind of, show that, I  really do.  I don't think people think it's changed that much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They knew that data, back in 2015, had been improperly accessed  and they basically said, don't, you know, do away.  Get rid of it, Nick,  final word, real quick.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  I think the key thing here is a lot of people who are, sort of,  really into this issue know about how much Facebook has.  This is the first  time members of congress will learn how big that is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And let's hope that they bone up in advance of this, because we  know how this can go, if they're really not sure of the questions they are  asking.  But, again, WilmerHale, the law firm given Mark Zuckerberg some  prep in advance to that, the Wall Street Journal reported that today.   Nick, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  Always.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Nick Johnston of Axios.  </p><p>JOHNSTON:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, hackers hit Iran with the cryptic warning, including  an image of the American Flag and a message, don't mess with our elections,  details on that.  An intergalactic debut, the new Solo, a Star Wars story  trailer, finally out.  We'll give you a peek.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Iran hit hard by a global cyberattack with a strong message.   Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, they did, Dagen.  Hackers targeting networks on a number of  countries including data centers in Iran.  The hackers let the image of an  American flag on screen, saying \"don't mess with our elections\".  The  Iranian government says, about 3500 -- across that country.  </p><p>Well, a deal in the pharmaceutical industry to tell you about -- Novartis  is buying the AveXis, the price tag, nearly $9 billion.  The deal is a bet  that at least one promising drug that AveXis is developing to treat spinal  muscular atrophy will turn into a blockbuster drug.  Shares of Novartis are  higher in the premarket, up more than one and quarter percent; AveXis  shares are sharply higher as well. </p><p>Well, this is interesting -- one rapper on YouTube, drew some inspiration  from a kind of unusual place while rhyming to the tune of Migos song \"Walk  it, Talk it\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of them are dreaming like that (INAUDIBLE), but  that (INAUDIBLE) when the bottle some are fairly some are not.  Let them  (INAUDIBLE) on the table when they get under the chair.  But that bump on  the sofa when I wish she wasn't there.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  So, you get it when you start watching it, right?  This went  viral.  And instead of \"Walk it, Talk it\", the YouTuber was rapper \"walk it  in my pocket\" but in the Migos style of rapping.  It racks up over a  million views on YouTube.  So, I guess -- I don't know what's next, cat in  the hat?  Cinderella?  Green eggs and ham?  Bring it on!  </p><p>MURPHY:  I've had enough for 15 years.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you've been doing -- did you rap Dr. Seuss, Theodore Geisel,  for your kids?  </p><p>MURPHY:  For 15 years, straight, for every one of mine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give me some green eggs and ham.  I want to hear it now.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's on my YouTube channel.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You give us some green eggs and ham?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.</p><p>CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) like, when we first heard about this, is this the  children that, you know -- like, no, this is a wrapper.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Wrapper, Migos.  Yes!  </p><p>CARTER:  You're all in.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  This is how dads keep their kids engaged.  I mean, you're  reading your book, you've got do something like that.  You can't just read  the book; you got to rap, you got to sing it.  </p><p>CARTER:  You rap your books?</p><p>BRENBERG:  I do something, maybe like an accent.  You know, you got to do  something to make it, and your kids are just to get bored and whatever.   It's a hard job, right?  </p><p>MURPHY:  This is iconic, and you kind of bring it to 2018, I think it needs  a little hip-hop in there, totally.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will not eat green eggs and ham?</p><p>MURPHY:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give me the next one.</p><p>MURPHY:  Sam, I am.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, \"A Quiet Place\" making a big noise.  The thriller is  a big win by actors turned director, Emily Blunt and John Krisinski.  A box  office recap, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Another record-breaking weekend at the box office.  Lauren  Simonetti has more details.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Good morning, happy Monday.  This is the time we  talk about what was a hit over the weekend.  So, let's give you the list.   In first place, \"A Quiet Place\".  A surprise $50 million opening for this  horror film -- and we're going to talk more about it in a second; let's get  through the rest of the list.  Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", 25  million in the second week; \"Blockers\", 21 million; \"Black Panther\", took  the fourth-place spot, only $8 million this weekend but if you look at what  \"Black Panther\" has done to date, it has unseated \"Titanic\".  So, if you  look at total domestic growth, for this movie, $665 million.  There it is,  number three of all time.  \"The Force Awakens\", number one; \"Avatar\",  number two; and \"Titanic\", now number four.  </p><p>Let's go back to \"A Quiet Place\".  This is a movie that cost $17 million to  make; $50 million in its opening weekend.  So, it was written and directed  by -- of office fame, John Krisinki and his wife Emily Blunt starred, but  it's basically a \"A Quiet Place\" -- there's no dialogue in the movie, and  it's a huge win for Paramount who needed a big hit after about two years of  not having a hit.  So, there you have it.  We're liking horror at the box  office.  And they got the trailer for the new \"Star Wars\".</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you got, Lauren?  Show me.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let's watch it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard about a job.  A big shot gangster putting  together a crew.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a driver.  I'm a flyer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've waited a long time for a shot like this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is he saying?  No, what do you know?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got a line on a ship?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It hit theaters on the 25th of May.  See, it's the young Han  Solo.  Do we want to see the --</p><p>BRENBERG:  That's a lot of -- it's a lot of pressure to play the young Han  Solo.  He's such a great character.  I think the chances of failing are  really high here.  I'm excited to see.  It looks good in the trailer, but  that's a tough role, right?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Agreed.  </p><p>CARTER:  I like the original \"Star Wars\", I'm not into it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's disconnected.  It's another one of the -- I think this one  takes place before the first one, in 1977.  </p><p>MURHPY:  That tease makes -- while they're getting 600 and 700 million at  the box office, you can count and see more and more \"Star Wars\" prequel,  sequels, whatever.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  You're going to see Han Solo as a 5-year-old at some point --</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes --</p><p>BRENBERG:  I'm not looking forward to that one.</p><p>CARTER:  If I like something or not, it's pretty much a not a good  indicator about whether or not it's going to perform well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called monetizing the franchise, just like Disney bought it  in the first place.  And so, they've done a pretty good job.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's almost like one a year, right?  There's been like one  \"Star Wars\".</p><p>BRENBERG:  One from the regular series, one of the, kind of the, in between  --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In between.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes, every single year for the next 20 years, at least, right? </p><p>SIMONETTI:  They get some new characters in this one.  And we'll see what  the appetite is for a young Han Solo.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You only need to know one word -- Chewbacca.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Makes an appearance in one of trailers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And his age?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  190 -- in the film.</p><p>MURHPY:  (INAUDIBLE) like a long time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  They sure do.</p><p>CARTER:  I hope that's a good indicator.  My dog just looks like him.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I wish our dogs are the same.  Kevin -- someone who looks like  him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Her dog is named Kevin, just to clear that up.  She has two  dogs.  Lauren, thank you so much.  And Lauren is having a baby.  Can you  reveal the name while we're staying here?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.  And we're not sharing  names only because I don't care what anybody has to say about them anymore.   Not a name.  Not talking anymore suggestion,</p><p>BRENBERG:  You don't need it, but yes, forget about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Don't want your input.  Thank you very much.  But you can still  guess if it's boy or girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can segue from Han Solo to Lauren and her impending delivery.   Still ahead, gas prices said to hit their higher level in years this  summer.  We have all the details for you, next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Crisis in Syria;  yet another suspected chemical weapon attacked, leaving dozens dead.  The  international community on high alert.  As the world waits for U.S.  response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.  Despite the  tensions, stocks reporting to a higher open, bouncing back 160-point on the  Dow Futures right now after concerns over a trade war with China, seem to  ease a bit -- you see the gains there.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning Dagen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SIMONETTI:  Hey Dagen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, ANCHOR:  Ladies, I'll see you later.   Good morning, great to see you as always.  And great to see all of you.   I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, April 9th.  Your  top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Crisis in Syria, yet another suspected chemical weapons attack leaving  dozens dead, the international community on high alert.  As the world waits  for a U.S. response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TOM BOSSERT, WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR:  I wouldn't take  anything off the table, these are horrible photos, we're looking into the  attack at this point.  I think the president's got a point that's been very  clear and I'm going to reiterate that point.  The pendulum has swung in the  wrong direction for too long and the United States of America has been  taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the  entire world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Despite the tension, stocks are pointing to a bounce back as  concerns over a trade war with China eased a little bit, maybe it was the  Sunday morning talk show's rhetoric being thrown out by the White House.</p><p> Futures are showing this, 172 point gain on the DOW Futures right now, it's  losing week for the Blue Chips last week.  This comes after that massive  selloff on Friday with the DOW, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P all falling more than two  percent.</p><p> In Europe, you have some buying to report, the England, France, and  Germany, we have gains across the board.  In Asia overnight, stocks also  moving higher.  The biggest winner there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p> Zuckerberg taking the Hill, Facebook CEO set to meet with lawmakers in  Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate  tomorrow.  The latest as the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says more  people's data could have been exposed.</p><p> And a change at the top, Deutsche Bank naming a new CEO, the details as  shares jumped on the news.</p><p> And terrifying moments on a New York highway, a tour bus slamming into an  overpass leaving six people seriously injured, more on their condition  ahead.</p><p> And the DOJ stonewalling, why Congress Trey Gowdy is calling out the  Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses. </p><p> And orange going to love this, Bud Light going citrus for the summer, the  new flavor hitting store shelves coming up.  I think that's called a summer  shandy.  </p><p> All of that and so much more this morning, Pollster Maslansky and Partners  President, Lee Carter.  Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.   And the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  </p><p> I start with you, markets this week, we get bank earnings, worries about a  trade war but, again, now geopolitical concerns that the focusing shifted  to that.</p><p> BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR:  Yes.   Yes, it has.  Although it's interesting to watch these back and forth with  the trade wars.  You get some rhetoric out of the White House, we -- the  talk on Thursday night, Friday morning stocks (INAUDIBLE) over the weekend,  everybody's out there talking about how this is not a big deal, we don't  want a trade war, you come back Monday morning, stocks up again.</p><p> We're seeing this pattern repeat again and again.  It seems to take a day  or two for markets to digest that you've got rhetoric and you've got  reality on trade and the reality probably isn't going to be as bad or as  harsh as a rhetoric sounds.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike, what are you watching this week?</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO, MANAGING PARTNER:  Absolutely.  So watching the  volatility in the market, that's really spurn -- spurred by this trade war  talk.  And I think just a few months ago we were talking about there's no  volatility in the market.</p><p> We haven't had a one percent move in so many months.  Well now you're  getting two percent move almost on a daily basis.  I think the main thing  for investors to do here is to try to block out the headlines and stick  with their long-term plans.  So we're going to get the down 500s, the  bounces above 200s.  Overall, there's not going to be a major trade war  with China in my opinion, it will back to focus on the U.S. economy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of the White House officials needs some messaging  help because you've got Secretary MNuchin on Friday talking about the  potential of a trade war and then trying to walk back those comments  yesterday saying, \"I don't expect it at all in terms of a trade war.\"   Don't have your Treasury Secretary utter the words trade war ever.</p><p> LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  That would be a  good first step.  But I think it's fascinating to see how the markets are  reacting so much to the rhetoric rather than just the policy.</p><p> It's unbelievable, a tweet, one announcement can send the markets in a  tailspin.  And what's happened traditionally is that we've looked at the  experts and say, \"What are we really supposed to be looking at?\"  One  tweet, one message, one interview can totally change the course of the  markets and we're seeing that this week and certainly the White House  rhetoric tone way back saying this has always been -- there's nothing new  here, nothing's developed here, not a trade war and look, things are  softening again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I'm looking forward to Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill.   Again, Facebook will reveal today to Facebook users whose data was accessed  by Cambridge Analytica, it's about 70 million people.  Estimates are in the  United States alone.</p><p> And watch Mark Zuckerberg because back in 2010, he broke out into a  Nixonian flop sweat when Walt Mossberg was interviewing him.  And I mean  sweat was dripping off of his face.  </p><p> CARTER:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So if you do that on Capitol Hill, watch your stock tank.</p><p> BRENBERG:  His appearances are always so staged managed.  This one  absolutely cannot be.  And so it's going to be interesting to see what he  does under that kind of pressure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're trying to get the video but he had sweat dripping off his  nose and his chin.  I'm not kidding.  It's --</p><p> CARTER:  This is not where he's comfortable.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  That was -- that was back in the days of the hoodie  sweatshirt.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So you're saying he was hot.</p><p> MURPHY:  So he's come a long way.</p><p> CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) t-shirt.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He was -- he was just hot.  OK.  We're going to talk about that  all morning.  Also coming up, New York Congressman Chris Collins, South  Dakota Senator Mike Rounds.  Host of Michelle Malkin Investigates on  CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And Legendary Soulman, my friend, Sam Moore.  You don't want  to miss any of them.  </p><p> Our top story this morning, crossing the red line, the world awaiting the  U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed  dozens of citizens.  Yesterday, warplanes bombing an airbase near the City  of Homs.  Russia and Syria have accused Israel of that strike.  Meantime,  President Trump sending a strong warning to the Assad Regime he tweeted  this, \"Many dead including women and children, in mindless chemical attack  in Syria.  Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army,  making it completely inaccessible to the outside world.  President Putin,  Russia, and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad, big price to  pay.  Open area immediately for medical help and verification.  Another  humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever, sick.\"</p><p> Joining us now is -- this morning is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk  Lippold.  Commander, how do you -- what should the U.S. do to respond?  And  I should point out that we used that phrase red line that was famously a  phrase used by President Obama back in 2010.  Assad and Syria crossed that  red line and we didn't do anything or we didn't attack.  What should we do  now?</p><p> COMMANDER KIRK S. LIPPOLD (RET), FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER:  Good morning  Dagen.  I think the first thing we need to do is verify through  intelligence channels that in fact took place who carried it out, where it  was launched from, what was used to do it? </p><p> And then at that point, we take a step back, put together the military  forces, and then decide whether we're going to react in a manner that is  going to take away that capability not like we did last time with the  Tomahawk missiles.  But this time, on a more permanent basis and with the  backing of the Security Council hopefully at the U.N.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well Commander, you brought that up, so there was one -- it was  a sarin gas attack last year, a one-time strike by the United States on a  Syrian airbase.  Why haven't we done more since then?  There was a chlorine  gas attack this past January which was the State Department and Rex  Tillerson, then the Secretary of State basically attacked in a statement.   But why haven't we done more to maybe take out all of Assad's air force,  the entire air force?  </p><p> LIPPOLD:  Well, I think Dagen you have to look at it, what is going to be  our engagement?  What is the end state we want to have there?  Assad is  going to continue to exist as the president of Syria because the Russians  are backing him, they now have the Iranians that are also providing  technical knowledge and an ability to also establish their own basis there  which Israel is not going to tolerate, which probably drove the attack into  the T4 or Tiyas Airbase last night.</p><p> But we have to take a look and say, \"OK, do we want to be the world's  leader in this case where a low level attacks have occurred using chemical  weapons?\"  This was absolutely a much larger scale one, it shows that  they're taking out one of the last strongholds of the Syrians rebels.  At  this point, we need to say, \"No, you either go for it conventionally or we  will take out that capability.\"  And if it does mean that we take out the  Syrian air force, then we better be prepared for a little bit longer  investment in time being in Syria with our forces despite what the  president has said.</p><p> MURPHY:  Commander, it's Mike Murphy.  I love your opinion on the timing of  this of attack because do you think it has to do with the fact that  President Trump is fighting on many different fronts?  We have North Korea,  we have the issues here in the U.S., Russia.  You think Syria and Putin got  together and said, \"Maybe this is a good time to test the president's  medal?\"</p><p> LIPPOLD:  I don't think it was timing for that.  I think that the president  is going to react to it and how he reacts.  I think once again,  internationally bent will drive the decision-making process for the U.S.  government as it always should especially where military force is involved.</p><p> I don't think this is going to be a tail-wagging, dog-type scenario, I  think in fact we need to look at it and say what are our national security  interest there?  What is the end state we want to achieve?  And if taking  out the Syrian air force to send a signal to do that turns out to be the  best option for us, then we execute it efficiently, ruthlessly, and with  overwhelming force.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Brian, and I'll let you get in here but the timing, it does beg  the question of this attack comes at -- right after President Trump says  that we can't wait to get out of Syria, that we -- that -- but, again, he  focus on ISIS and we see the threat to the Syrian people and children in  the Assad Regime.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Yes, absolutely.  And the other timing issue that I'd like to  ask you about Commander is you have the entrance this week now of John  Bolton into the National Security Advisor role, that has to change things a  little bit.</p><p> He's been critical of these one-off strikes, do we see the tide shift to a  more permanent comprehensive approach here with Ambassador Bolton moving  into that role?</p><p> LIPPOLD:  Professor, that's a great question.  And I think what you're  going to see is Ambassador Bolton is now the National Security Advisor, not  the executer but the advisor is going to say we need a much more  comprehensive plan.  We need a long range view.  We need goals that we want  to achieve for our national security objectives.</p><p> And he is going to take a more holistic approach into the execution of  national security policy across the board.  So I think that you're going to  see a little bit more robust policy, I think you will see one with more  defined objectives in there, and I think you will see one that will be  executed in fairly short order because he is a decisive individual and he's  going to recommend that to the president who obviously brought him in  because he was a little frustrated that he was being held back in some of  the execution of our policies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The president did tweet because I mentioned the red line at the  beginning, \"If President Obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand,  the Syrian disaster would have ended a long -- long ago.  Animal Assad  would have been history.\"</p><p> Maria spoke with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Michael McCaul  yesterday and he agrees with the president.  Listen to this Commander.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX) HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  There  has to be a consequence to this.  And I think the president's absolutely  right is that President Obama drew the red line, the red line was crossed,  he did nothing.</p><p> And then he negotiate through John Kerry the settlement, this weapons  convention.  I remember John Kerry saying, \"We took all their chemical  weapons away.\"  Obviously not.  They still have this.  And I also blame  Russia and Iran, I think they're complicit with this as well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Commander, I want to get your response to that.  But as I  mentioned earlier, we had that one-time airstrike last April but since  then, there has been a chlorine gas attack that killed 20, mostly children,  that happened in January, there was a statement from the State Department  then but no enforcement.  And Assad certainly knows that he would pay no  price and now this, final thought.</p><p> LIPPOLD:  I think you're absolutely right.  There has to be consequences  for this action.  While there was a red line drawn and unfortunately we did  not react to the red line when Syria crossed it.  We did in fact have one  positive development and that was getting rid of the vast majority of  chemical weapons in there.</p><p> Had we attacked immediately, I doubt we would have ever gotten to that  point with an agreement working with the Russians to make that happen.   That is a positive thing to look at it.  But nonetheless, if you draw a  line as a state actor especially the United States, you have to hold it,  enforce it, and do not waiver on it.  And in doing that, it embolden  people, the one-off strike, that's clearly going to be a test now whether  we react to this in a manner that is much stronger, much more overwhelming  and sends a signal, we will not tolerate this.  </p><p> By the same token, going to Russia and Iran and saying, you're complicit in  this, you have contributed to it, you have created the conditions that  allowed it to happen, you must not do that anymore and there will be  consequences and if your folks happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong  time, that is not our responsibility, it's your decision to put them there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kirk, thank you so much.  Kirk Lippold.  Commander, be well.   Thank you for being here.</p><p> LIPPOLD:  Thank you Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting, \"When a car is  sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12  percent.  When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a  tariff to be paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.   No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p> Coming up, on the hot seat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in Washington  today ahead of two intense days of questioning on Capitol Hill.  This comes  as the company had set to alert millions of users if their data was shared.  </p><p> And tired of being patient?  Congress Trey Gowdy calling out the Justice  Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  New week, new energy for Wall Street, DOW Futures right now are  showing gains across the board, 167 point gain on the DOW Futures right now  after what was a bruising week.  Again, cooler heads prevailing I suppose  when it comes to trade war talk.  We'll see what comes out of the  administration in the coming days.  We're also watching the beginning of  earning season this week.</p><p> Meantime, at least six teenagers from New York severely injured after a  charter bus crashed.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, that's right Dagen.  The bus packed with high school students  returning from a spring break trip to Europe hit an overpass on Long Island  last night.  The impact was so strong, it tore the roof off the bus.  This  happened on the southern state parkway which restricts travel by commercial  vehicles.  Police say the driver did not seem to be familiar with that  restriction.</p><p> Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joining thousands at a vigil  honoring the junior hockey team involved in a tragic bus accident on  Friday.  The team president speaking to the crowd packed into the humble  Broncos Arena.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEVIN GARINGER, HUMBOLDT BRONCOS PRESIDENT:  We will find strength in one  another.  Today and for every day forward, we are all Humboldt Broncos and  we will be forever Humboldt Broncos strong.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Fifteen people are now dead after that team's bus collided with a  tractor trailer.  Among those killed were the team's head coach, the driver  of the bus, and several players.  While the community in Saskatchewan tries  to cope, support has been overwhelming.  A victims fund for the Broncos has  already exceeded $4.5 million.</p><p> Well Deutsche Bank is replacing its CEO.  John Cryan is out and Christian  Sewing is taking over.  Sewing is a 47-year-old executive who's worked for  Deutsche Bank for nearly three decades.  Germany's biggest bank has been  struggling since the 2008 financial crisis.  Analysts say the change could  signal a potential merger with another European bank.  Shares of Deutsche  Bank much higher in the premarket, up over three and a half percent right  now.  </p><p> And then finally there's this, Anheuser-Busch unveiling a new flavor of  beer, Bud Light Orange.  It is a light lagger that is brewed usually actual  peels from oranges.  The company says that you will, \"taste the citrusy  goodness.\"  Bud Light Orange available for a limited time for, yes, the  summer.  Shares of Anheuser-Busch are down about three percent so far this  year.</p><p> Dagen, if you ever put an orange in a beer like an orange slice, makes  sense.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What you do with a Hefeweizen, wheat beer. </p><p> CASONE:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I have a question, is this a shandy?</p><p> BRENBERG:  It sounds like it.  I don't like any of these kinds of beer.  It  sounds like a shandy, so I'm negative on it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Shandy is tip -- do you know shandies?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't know shandy but I know this is like Budweiser and Fanta  mixed together, I don't like it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That actually sounds delicious.</p><p> CARTER:  I know, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  People tweet us, I think a shandy is the -- defined by, it is  like a juice or some fruit flavor or like soda in a beer.  Like, again, the  Leinenkugel's summer shandy is quite delicious on a hot day on the golf  course.</p><p> BRENBERG:  I think beer goes well with beer and nothing else.  So I  wouldn't put any of those stuff, no peels, no nothing.</p><p> CARTER:  My guess is you're not the target audience.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BRENBERG:  I don't think I am.  I don't think I am.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Novartis as closed at $8.7 billion deal for a gene  therapy company in the Midwest.  Details on how the acquisition could boost  the Swiss pharma giant's cancer innovations.</p><p> And Black Panther sailing past Titanic into the history books, another  record shattering weekend for the Marvel movie.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Markets looking to start the new week with some gains, 178 point  gain on the DOW Futures right now as concerns over a trade war with China  ease a little bit.  White House officials helping camp down those fears on  the Sunday shows yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Just technically, we  have taken no action.  It's a long process, there's several months here, so  far no tariffs and no action has been enacted.</p><p> STEPHEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I don't expect there will be a  trade war, it could be but I don't expect it at all.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting this morning, \" When a car is sent to  the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent.   When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be  paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No, it  sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p> Joining me now is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee.  Mike,  what's going to keep these trade concerns in the background for investors,  the start of earnings potentially?</p><p> MICHAEL LEE, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP PRINCIPAL:  I think this is going to  be one of the best earning seasons we've ever had, right?  Not only from  the actually result but we got to remember that earnings are a forward- looking tool and that's what matters -- I'm sorry, stocks are forward- looking tool.</p><p> So what earnings are going to look like for the rest of the year and then  going out to 2019 when we start talking about 2019, I think a lot of people  are going to sit back and say, \"Well you know what, stocks are actually  really cheap, they're not expensive.\"  We're looking at one of the kind of  the greatest growth periods we're going to see in our lifetimes, so.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But what if we do get into a back and forth, a tit-for-tat with  China.  Again, you heard from Larry Kudlow and Secretary of the Treasury,  Steve MNuchin, they're trying to like wipe away some of the fears.</p><p> Like, \"Oh, this might not happen.\"  But, again, I just wish some of those  guys would call people I grew up with, hog farmers, and people who grow  soybeans that that impacts the real American economy, that's what the  market is reflecting that the economy might not be growing as fast and  earnings might not be growing as fast.  And it's Boeing and Caterpillar  last week.</p><p> LEE:  So a couple of things, right?  If you run a small business and your  cost are going to go up 20 or 25 or 30 percent based on some tariff like  this, this could be terrifying for you.  However, on a larger scale, what  can China really do to us if that they're not already doing?</p><p> What, are they going to steal our intellectual property?  I mean, the trade  imbalance from China or trade deficit, we're annualizing at just under $400  billion a share, OK?  That is a much larger portion of their GDP than the  $150 billion to $170 billion that we export to them every year.  Again,  problems for people whose (INAUDIBLE) cost are going to go up.</p><p> Our economy as a whole can withstand a trade war much easier than they can.   The standard of living in China is no one near as high as they make it out  to be.  So if China were to -- if China gets into a trade war with us,  chances are they'll go into recession.  If they go into recession, there's  a good probability of a popular uprising.  So that could -- the only way  that the Chinese government could go out of power is by a recession.</p><p> So the government props up their economy, it's held together with duct tape  and elbow grease.  So it's -- look, I -- it's -- I'm saying this but people  much smarter than me and much more powerful than me know this.  So what  we're seeing is a lot of posturing.  So I don't -- any selloff because of  trade war fears I think is a good buying opportunity.</p><p> MURPHY:  Totally agree completely on that because I think what you're  seeing in the market though is you get these headlines and you're getting  this big whip sauce back and forth and I think that's fine for the  professional traders.  But for the people at home, they could really get  hurt in trading this type of market.</p><p> I believe a lot of those whip sauce have to do with computerize trading,  with the algorithm of trading.  So they're pulling headlines and then  you're seeing these big drops in the market or these big rallies in the  market.  And I think it's important for -- and I love your take on that, a  huge portion of the volume out there in a day-to-day basis is computerized.   So individual people at home can really get hurt trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> LEE:  I would say for people over the last couple of years of markets is  too high, the market is too high.  Well you know what, every time you see  an ugly tweet or an ugly headline or Stormy Daniels or something, the  market's going to selloff.  Here's your opportunity to take some of that  cash and buy some stocks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The market, do I have hope it doesn't selloff on Stormy Daniels.   But go ahead.  I hope investors are smarter than that or the computer.</p><p> LEE:  If you start drilling down and looking at the U.S. economy, a durable  goods are up year-over-year, almost nine percent, that's the highest number  since the early 2000.  You look at manufacturing is doing the best since  the early 2000s.  </p><p> Non-ISM manufacturing is the highest level it's been in 20 years.  You look  at the job market, weekly javas claims have been below 300,000 for almost  three years.  Longest period in almost the history of the entire United  States.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, earnings.  Earnings season starts this week, J.P.  Morgan kind of the big one coming out on Friday, what do you expect overall  growth for the quarter 17 percent but J.P. Morgan expected to put up even  better numbers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> LEE: You know, what I'm going to be looking for is the forward guidance.   What's dragged a lot of these banks back particularly is sales of trading.   And now with the return of volatility, I think sales and trading has kind  of been the (INAUDIBLE) as you look at all the different business units in  all these banks.</p><p> It's going to start to get better and then with the banks, as rates are  going higher, their net interest margins are going to expand.  As net  interest margins are going to expand, banks are going to make a lot more  money in their wallets.  And let's face it, 10 years ago when the banks  were in their hay days they were trading shops, now they get back to being  traditional lenders.  </p><p> So when you were -- when you have a $1 trillion of loans out there, you  make an extra 25 basis points on each loan, it's a lot of money, right?  So  -- I mean, the forward guidance is what I'm looking at and as the  conversation switches from 2018 earnings to 2019 earnings I think people  are going to say, \"Wow, stocks are really, really cheap.  Something's going  on here, like the market's going much higher.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Michael Lee, thank you sir.  Good to see you.  Come back soon.</p><p> LEE:  Thanks very much guys.  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, facing the music, Facebook CEO is set to meet with  lawmakers in Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the  Senate and then the House tomorrow and Wednesday.  Hear from a  whistleblower about the data reveal, the reckless handling of your personal  information, let's call it that.</p><p> And Dr. Seuss has bumped into a new beat, the Migos remix, \"There's a  Wocket in My Pocket,\" you've got to hear to believe.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Easing concerns  over a trade war, sparking a rally on Wall Street, Futures are showing  gains across the board, 176-point gain on the Dow Futures, this after that  sharp selloff on Friday.  </p><p> The major market gauges all down more than two percent, again, a little bit  of a disappointing job's number.  The chief of the feds speaking and then  trade war worries.  In Europe, the market is hovering near the flat line  this morning.  We still have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany, and in Asia overnight, stocks moving up from Shanghai to the KOSPI  in South Korea.  </p><p> Facebook, under fire, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gearing up for his trip to  Capitol Hill, where he will be grilled over the company's privacy  practices.  What to expect from the congressional hearings, ahead.  Calling  for action, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Trey Gowdy, says the  justice department is stonewalling when it comes to handing over documents  tied to the FISA and Hillary Clinton investigations.  Here's what he told  Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  I want to be  able to support the FBI and the DOJ, but the world's premier law- enforcement agency can't seem to operate a damn copying machine.  That is  inexplicable.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have the very latest, a strong message for Iran, hackers  attacking the country's network, leaving an image of the American flag.   Warning, don't mess with our elections.  A little bit of a merger Monday on  Wall Street, Novartis is getting big on gene therapy with its latest  acquisition.  </p><p> And a not so quite start for the box office for A Quiet Place, the horror  film soaring passed expectations.  We have the full box office recap,  ahead, plus, a whole new tune for Dr. Seuss' Wocket in my Pocket, a rap of  the childhood classic, going viral.  </p><p> To our top story this half hour, the clock, ticking on the DOJ, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, now, asking  Federal Prosecutor John Lausch to help speed up the response to GOP demands  for documents related to the surveillance of former Trump Campaign Advisor,  Carter Page.  The firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI and the  investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, the request,  coming after President Trump took to Twitter this weekend, to slam the DOJ  and FBI, writing, what does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?  </p><p> Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents, unredacted, to the  House Judiciary Committee?  Stalling, but for what reason?  Not looking  good.  House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who has been leading  the charge, sounded off, yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOWDY:  I have not seen a clean version and I need to know what's behind  those black lines because it's really important how this investigation  began, when it began and what is the -- what is the weight, what is the  credibility of the evidence upon which this investigation was launched?   And the Department of Justice and the FBI have that document, they won't  let us see the clean version, and I'm struggling to understand why.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This all comes as the DOJ promises to turn over an additional  3600 pages from the FBI today, to the House panel.  Joining us now is  Editor-in-Chief of Axios, Nick Johnston, Nick, your reaction to these new  developments and where do we go from here?</p><p> NICHOLAS JOHNSTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AXIOS:  Yes, I think it's really  important to hear the frustration in Chairman Gowdy's voice what he told  Maria, sort of, how angry he was about how they can't find the copy machine  that could underscores the tension here and how these are Republicans on  the Hill are still very much focused on getting this kind of information.  </p><p> And this is a Republican justice department that they'd say hasn't been  doing it fast enough, even the President, as you showed, has been tweeting  that the document turnover hasn't happened fast enough.  I think, the  appointment of this new attorney, to facilitate that, will probably help.   It might make some of these folks on the Hill, a little happier, but this  is still a very important investigatory focus for them, and they're not  going to give up until they get what they want.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nick, how do the midterm elections factor into this, though,  because even though we have a Republican president in the White House, and  Republican leading the justice department as the Attorney General, you look  at Trey Gowdy and the other heads, Devin Nunes, head of the House  Intelligence Committee, really there, the time window is closing on them  just, potentially, if the Democrats retake the House.  How critical is that  timing?</p><p> JOHNSTON:  I think it's a really great point.  A lot of what Republicans  want to accomplish in the House today is set under the guise of what will  happen in the midterms and Republicans are coming from a -- from a place of  the underdogs, I think, in this election, and if they lose the gavels on  these committees, these investigations go away.  So I think, certainly, in  the coming months, if they don't get the documents, this pressure will only  increase because they know they have to finish this by the end of the year.</p><p> CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No, Nick, I think, it's a really  interesting conversation that's been have about whether or not the  Republican hold strategy, is to undermine -- is undermine the DOJ and say  that there's not going to be trust in these institutions that are so  important.  Do you think that's fair for them to criticize or do you think  the Republicans have a fair, you know, have a real beef here?</p><p> JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a really interesting point.  We've done some  pulling on this, in fact, quickly, after the President went after the  (INAUDIBLE) investigation recently, and we saw favorability for the FBI  plunge among Republicans which is something we haven't seen, essentially,  ever, as long as the department had existed.  </p><p> I think it's a very, sort of, dicey area to be, sort of, attacking these  law enforcement agencies the way they ever remember, you know, these are  members of congress.  They have clear investigatory ability to get these  kinds of documents, and you know what?  If they subpoena them, you need to  provide them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to Facebook (INAUDIBLE) send out notifications  today to millions of affected users in this data mining scandal.  This  comes as congressional aides are confirming that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will  hold meetings today on Capitol Hill, with several lawmakers ahead of this  week's hearings.  Take a listen to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  and Senate Judiciary Committee, John Kennedy, both suggesting that things  are about to change at the tech giant.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  Mark's happy to go to congress because  Mark wants to answer every question people have about the service we  office.  We weren't focused enough and being proactive enough and Mark is  happy to say here's what we weren't doing and here's what we are doing now.</p><p> REP. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  I don't want  to hurt Facebook.  I don't want to regulate them half to death.  But, we  have a problem.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, our problem.  Meantime, a whistleblower, now warning that  the millions of affected users' data could be stored in Russia, I think  that it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's performance because he's sending  out Sheryl Sandberg in his stead, who clearly loves to tell women how to  lean in, in this country, but when -- this is a very serious issue and I  would argue that her performance, last week, in terms of giving interviews,  was a little light, in terms of really grappling with the seriousness of  it.  </p><p> I point to a New York Post, the front page -- the front page of the post,  on Saturday, we own you, pay us for your privacy, shocking, and then Mark  Zuckerberg, famously, in 2010, was sweating like Richard Nixon, breaking  out on a flop sweat-like none other.  Again, it's just going to be  Zuckerberg sitting there, whether the stocks sold off or not.  </p><p> JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a -- this is the main event here.  All the pre- interviews last week with Sheryl Sandberg (INAUDIBLE) were opening acts.   The real thing here, Zuckerberg is on the Hill -- on the Hill, today,  preparing, tomorrow, 2:30, must-see TV.  Zuckerberg, appearing before this  committee, this is something he's never done before in this kind of  hearing, and he doesn't have any natural allies on his committee.  These  senators on both sides of the aisle are gunning for big tech.  And so, this  hearing is a start of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are they really gunning for big tech, though, Nick?  I mean, big  tech is -- you know, when you talk about Silicon Valley and technology, it  is one of the most divided areas, politically, that all of the CEOs have  historically been big givers to Democratic candidates.  Their policies lean  very far left.  There's really not room, you saw with the firing of that  Google employee, not room for conservative thought or speech.  And so, I  just wonder what kind of treatments he gets.  </p><p> JOHNSTON:  I would separate it from that.  What this is, is the final --  the first time congress is really going to ask the questions, are these  tech companies too big and if they know so much about their users and have  they done a good job of explaining to users how much they know.  For a lot  of members of the Hill, this is a mystery to them.  There are no natural  allies for Facebook or rather these big technology companies.  I want to  look to see any friendly questions for Mark, tomorrow, when he's in  congress.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We've known, Mike Murphy, that this was going on for years, in  terms of Facebook not protecting user information, whether you're talking  about RapLeaf or Cloud and their way of enforcement was to call up the  company telling them, don't do that anymore.  </p><p> MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's only because this was somehow related to the Trump  campaign that people are now furious and up in arms.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think what Mark Zuckerberg's going to talk about a lot, this  week, is what Facebook used to do, and what they are doing now, to talk  about how the company has shifted, how they're protecting your data, but  you'll know when go on there, Dagen.  You're giving up a lot of your  information.  If you don't want to give that up, you shouldn't be on  Facebook.  They may have a responsibility to not sell it but they -- once  you're on there, that data is there, and they own it, they do, as the cover  said.  </p><p> BRENBERG,:  Do they know what they're doing now?  That's -- you said  they're going to talk about what they're doing.  Now, I think a lot of  people look at this and say, do they know what they're doing now or are  they really just, like, we actually have no idea what's going on and every  single day now, we're seeing new revelations of more, you know,  inappropriate data sharing, customers having their data used in ways that  they didn't know.  I don't think Facebook has a good handle on where they  are.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think this is years ago this is years ago when -- I think it was  2014, the Cambridge Analytica information ended up being given to the  improper parties.  So, I think, Facebook today, 2018, versus four years  ago, is a vastly different company, it has run differently.  So, I think  that's what they want to underline, is how they are now doing their best to  potentially protect their data the best possible.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  I think they're going to have you lift, kind of, show that, I  really do.  I don't think people think it's changed that much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They knew that data, back in 2015, had been improperly accessed  and they basically said, don't, you know, do away.  Get rid of it, Nick,  final word, real quick.</p><p> JOHNSTON:  I think the key thing here is a lot of people who are, sort of,  really into this issue know about how much Facebook has.  This is the first  time members of congress will learn how big that is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And let's hope that they bone up in advance of this, because we  know how this can go, if they're really not sure of the questions they are  asking.  But, again, WilmerHale, the law firm given Mark Zuckerberg some  prep in advance to that, the Wall Street Journal reported that today.   Nick, thank you so much.</p><p> JOHNSTON:  Always.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Nick Johnston of Axios.  </p><p> JOHNSTON:  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, hackers hit Iran with the cryptic warning, including  an image of the American Flag and a message, don't mess with our elections,  details on that.  An intergalactic debut, the new Solo, a Star Wars story  trailer, finally out.  We'll give you a peek.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Iran hit hard by a global cyberattack with a strong message.   Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, they did, Dagen.  Hackers targeting networks on a number of  countries including data centers in Iran.  The hackers let the image of an  American flag on screen, saying \"don't mess with our elections\".  The  Iranian government says, about 3500 -- across that country.  </p><p> Well, a deal in the pharmaceutical industry to tell you about -- Novartis  is buying the AveXis, the price tag, nearly $9 billion.  The deal is a bet  that at least one promising drug that AveXis is developing to treat spinal  muscular atrophy will turn into a blockbuster drug.  Shares of Novartis are  higher in the premarket, up more than one and quarter percent; AveXis  shares are sharply higher as well. </p><p> Well, this is interesting -- one rapper on YouTube, drew some inspiration  from a kind of unusual place while rhyming to the tune of Migos song \"Walk  it, Talk it\".  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of them are dreaming like that (INAUDIBLE), but  that (INAUDIBLE) when the bottle some are fairly some are not.  Let them  (INAUDIBLE) on the table when they get under the chair.  But that bump on  the sofa when I wish she wasn't there.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  So, you get it when you start watching it, right?  This went  viral.  And instead of \"Walk it, Talk it\", the YouTuber was rapper \"walk it  in my pocket\" but in the Migos style of rapping.  It racks up over a  million views on YouTube.  So, I guess -- I don't know what's next, cat in  the hat?  Cinderella?  Green eggs and ham?  Bring it on!  </p><p> MURPHY:  I've had enough for 15 years.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, you've been doing -- did you rap Dr. Seuss, Theodore Geisel,  for your kids?  </p><p> MURPHY:  For 15 years, straight, for every one of mine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Give me some green eggs and ham.  I want to hear it now.  </p><p> MURPHY:  It's on my YouTube channel.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You give us some green eggs and ham?</p><p> MURPHY:  No.</p><p> CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) like, when we first heard about this, is this the  children that, you know -- like, no, this is a wrapper.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Wrapper, Migos.  Yes!  </p><p> CARTER:  You're all in.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  This is how dads keep their kids engaged.  I mean, you're  reading your book, you've got do something like that.  You can't just read  the book; you got to rap, you got to sing it.  </p><p> CARTER:  You rap your books?</p><p> BRENBERG:  I do something, maybe like an accent.  You know, you got to do  something to make it, and your kids are just to get bored and whatever.   It's a hard job, right?  </p><p> MURPHY:  This is iconic, and you kind of bring it to 2018, I think it needs  a little hip-hop in there, totally.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will not eat green eggs and ham?</p><p> MURPHY:  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Give me the next one.</p><p> MURPHY:  Sam, I am.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, \"A Quiet Place\" making a big noise.  The thriller is  a big win by actors turned director, Emily Blunt and John Krisinski.  A box  office recap, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Another record-breaking weekend at the box office.  Lauren  Simonetti has more details.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  All right.  Good morning, happy Monday.  This is the time we  talk about what was a hit over the weekend.  So, let's give you the list.   In first place, \"A Quiet Place\".  A surprise $50 million opening for this  horror film -- and we're going to talk more about it in a second; let's get  through the rest of the list.  Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", 25  million in the second week; \"Blockers\", 21 million; \"Black Panther\", took  the fourth-place spot, only $8 million this weekend but if you look at what  \"Black Panther\" has done to date, it has unseated \"Titanic\".  So, if you  look at total domestic growth, for this movie, $665 million.  There it is,  number three of all time.  \"The Force Awakens\", number one; \"Avatar\",  number two; and \"Titanic\", now number four.  </p><p> Let's go back to \"A Quiet Place\".  This is a movie that cost $17 million to  make; $50 million in its opening weekend.  So, it was written and directed  by -- of office fame, John Krisinki and his wife Emily Blunt starred, but  it's basically a \"A Quiet Place\" -- there's no dialogue in the movie, and  it's a huge win for Paramount who needed a big hit after about two years of  not having a hit.  So, there you have it.  We're liking horror at the box  office.  And they got the trailer for the new \"Star Wars\".</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you got, Lauren?  Show me.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Let's watch it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard about a job.  A big shot gangster putting  together a crew.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a driver.  I'm a flyer.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've waited a long time for a shot like this.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is he saying?  No, what do you know?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got a line on a ship?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  It hit theaters on the 25th of May.  See, it's the young Han  Solo.  Do we want to see the --</p><p> BRENBERG:  That's a lot of -- it's a lot of pressure to play the young Han  Solo.  He's such a great character.  I think the chances of failing are  really high here.  I'm excited to see.  It looks good in the trailer, but  that's a tough role, right?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Agreed.  </p><p> CARTER:  I like the original \"Star Wars\", I'm not into it.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  It's disconnected.  It's another one of the -- I think this one  takes place before the first one, in 1977.  </p><p> MURHPY:  That tease makes -- while they're getting 600 and 700 million at  the box office, you can count and see more and more \"Star Wars\" prequel,  sequels, whatever.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  You're going to see Han Solo as a 5-year-old at some point --</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes --</p><p> BRENBERG:  I'm not looking forward to that one.</p><p> CARTER:  If I like something or not, it's pretty much a not a good  indicator about whether or not it's going to perform well.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's called monetizing the franchise, just like Disney bought it  in the first place.  And so, they've done a pretty good job.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  It's almost like one a year, right?  There's been like one  \"Star Wars\".</p><p> BRENBERG:  One from the regular series, one of the, kind of the, in between  --</p><p> SIMONETTI:  In between.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Yes, every single year for the next 20 years, at least, right? </p><p> SIMONETTI:  They get some new characters in this one.  And we'll see what  the appetite is for a young Han Solo.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You only need to know one word -- Chewbacca.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Makes an appearance in one of trailers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  And his age?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  190 -- in the film.</p><p> MURHPY:  (INAUDIBLE) like a long time.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  They sure do.</p><p> CARTER:  I hope that's a good indicator.  My dog just looks like him.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I wish our dogs are the same.  Kevin -- someone who looks like  him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Her dog is named Kevin, just to clear that up.  She has two  dogs.  Lauren, thank you so much.  And Lauren is having a baby.  Can you  reveal the name while we're staying here?</p><p> SIMONETTI:  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.  And we're not sharing  names only because I don't care what anybody has to say about them anymore.   Not a name.  Not talking anymore suggestion,</p><p> BRENBERG:  You don't need it, but yes, forget about.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Don't want your input.  Thank you very much.  But you can still  guess if it's boy or girl.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We can segue from Han Solo to Lauren and her impending delivery.   Still ahead, gas prices said to hit their higher level in years this  summer.  We have all the details for you, next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Crisis in Syria;  yet another suspected chemical weapon attacked, leaving dozens dead.  The  international community on high alert.  As the world waits for U.S.  response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.  Despite the  tensions, stocks reporting to a higher open, bouncing back 160-point on the  Dow Futures right now after concerns over a trade war with China, seem to  ease a bit -- you see the gains there.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I think the president's got a point that's been very clear and I'm going to reiterate that point. The pendulum has swung in the wrong direction for too long and the United States of America has been taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the entire world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Despite the tension, stocks are pointing to a bounce back as concerns over a trade war with China eased a little bit, maybe it was the Sunday morning talk show's rhetoric being thrown out by the White House.</p><p>Futures are showing this, 172 point gain on the DOW Futures right now, it's losing week for the Blue Chips last week.

And the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.</p><p>I start with you, markets this week, we get bank earnings, worries about a trade war but, again, now geopolitical concerns that the focusing shifted to that.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR: Yes. Yes, it has. Although it's interesting to watch these back and forth with the trade wars. You get some rhetoric out of the White House, we -- the talk on Thursday night, Friday morning stocks (INAUDIBLE) over the weekend, everybody's out there talking about how this is not a big deal, we don't want a trade war, you come back Monday morning, stocks up again.</p><p>We're seeing this pattern repeat again and again. It seems to take a day or two for markets to digest that you've got rhetoric and you've got reality on trade and the reality probably isn't going to be as bad or as harsh as a rhetoric sounds.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, what are you watching this week?</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO, MANAGING PARTNER: Absolutely. So watching the volatility in the market, that's really spurn -- spurred by this trade war talk. And I think just a few months ago we were talking about there's no volatility in the market.</p><p>We haven't had a one percent move in so many months. Well now you're getting two percent move almost on a daily basis. I think the main thing for investors to do here is to try to block out the headlines and stick with their long-term plans. So we're going to get the down 500s, the bounces above 200s. Overall, there's not going to be a major trade war with China in my opinion, it will back to focus on the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think some of the White House officials needs some messaging help because you've got Secretary MNuchin on Friday talking about the potential of a trade war and then trying to walk back those comments yesterday saying, \"I don't expect it at all in terms of a trade war.\" Don't have your Treasury Secretary utter the words trade war ever.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT: That would be a good first step. But I think it's fascinating to see how the markets are reacting so much to the rhetoric rather than just the policy.</p><p>It's unbelievable, a tweet, one announcement can send the markets in a tailspin. And what's happened traditionally is that we've looked at the experts and say, \"What are we really supposed to be looking at?\" One tweet, one message, one interview can totally change the course of the markets and we're seeing that this week and certainly the White House rhetoric tone way back saying this has always been -- there's nothing new here, nothing's developed here, not a trade war and look, things are softening again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm looking forward to Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill. Again, Facebook will reveal today to Facebook users whose data was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, it's about 70 million people. Estimates are in the United States alone.</p><p>And watch Mark Zuckerberg because back in 2010, he broke out into a Nixonian flop sweat when Walt Mossberg was interviewing him. And I mean sweat was dripping off of his face.</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So if you do that on Capitol Hill, watch your stock tank.</p><p>BRENBERG: His appearances are always so staged managed. This one absolutely cannot be. And so it's going to be interesting to see what he does under that kind of pressure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're trying to get the video but he had sweat dripping off his nose and his chin. I'm not kidding. It's --</p><p>CARTER: This is not where he's comfortable.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. That was -- that was back in the days of the hoodie sweatshirt.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So you're saying he was hot.</p><p>MURPHY: So he's come a long way.</p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE) t-shirt.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He was -- he was just hot. OK. We're going to talk about that all morning. Also coming up, New York Congressman Chris Collins, South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds. Host of Michelle Malkin Investigates on CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin. FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And Legendary Soulman, my friend, Sam Moore. You don't want to miss any of them.</p><p>Our top story this morning, crossing the red line, the world awaiting the U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed dozens of citizens. Yesterday, warplanes bombing an airbase near the City of Homs. Russia and Syria have accused Israel of that strike. Meantime, President Trump sending a strong warning to the Assad Regime he tweeted this, \"Many dead including women and children, in mindless chemical attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to the outside world. President Putin, Russia, and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad, big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever, sick.\"</p><p>Joining us now is -- this morning is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold. Commander, how do you -- what should the U.S. do to respond? And I should point out that we used that phrase red line that was famously a phrase used by President Obama back in 2010. Assad and Syria crossed that red line and we didn't do anything or we didn't attack. What should we do now?</p><p>COMMANDER KIRK S. LIPPOLD (RET), FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER: Good morning Dagen. I think the first thing we need to do is verify through intelligence channels that in fact took place who carried it out, where it was launched from, what was used to do it?</p><p>And then at that point, we take a step back, put together the military forces, and then decide whether we're going to react in a manner that is going to take away that capability not like we did last time with the Tomahawk missiles. But this time, on a more permanent basis and with the backing of the Security Council hopefully at the U.N.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well Commander, you brought that up, so there was one -- it was a sarin gas attack last year, a one-time strike by the United States on a Syrian airbase. Why haven't we done more since then? There was a chlorine gas attack this past January which was the State Department and Rex Tillerson, then the Secretary of State basically attacked in a statement. But why haven't we done more to maybe take out all of Assad's air force, the entire air force?</p><p>LIPPOLD: Well, I think Dagen you have to look at it, what is going to be our engagement? What is the end state we want to have there? Assad is going to continue to exist as the president of Syria because the Russians are backing him, they now have the Iranians that are also providing technical knowledge and an ability to also establish their own basis there which Israel is not going to tolerate, which probably drove the attack into the T4 or Tiyas Airbase last night.</p><p>But we have to take a look and say, \"OK, do we want to be the world's leader in this case where a low level attacks have occurred using chemical weapons?\" This was absolutely a much larger scale one, it shows that they're taking out one of the last strongholds of the Syrians rebels. At this point, we need to say, \"No, you either go for it conventionally or we will take out that capability.\" And if it does mean that we take out the Syrian air force, then we better be prepared for a little bit longer investment in time being in Syria with our forces despite what the president has said.</p><p>MURPHY: Commander, it's Mike Murphy. I love your opinion on the timing of this of attack because do you think it has to do with the fact that President Trump is fighting on many different fronts? We have North Korea, we have the issues here in the U.S., Russia. You think Syria and Putin got together and said, \"Maybe this is a good time to test the president's medal?\"</p><p>LIPPOLD: I don't think it was timing for that. I think that the president is going to react to it and how he reacts. I think once again, internationally bent will drive the decision-making process for the U.S. government as it always should especially where military force is involved.</p><p>I don't think this is going to be a tail-wagging, dog-type scenario, I think in fact we need to look at it and say what are our national security interest there? What is the end state we want to achieve? And if taking out the Syrian air force to send a signal to do that turns out to be the best option for us, then we execute it efficiently, ruthlessly, and with overwhelming force.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Brian, and I'll let you get in here but the timing, it does beg the question of this attack comes at -- right after President Trump says that we can't wait to get out of Syria, that we -- that -- but, again, he focus on ISIS and we see the threat to the Syrian people and children in the Assad Regime.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes, absolutely. And the other timing issue that I'd like to ask you about Commander is you have the entrance this week now of John Bolton into the National Security Advisor role, that has to change things a little bit.</p><p>He's been critical of these one-off strikes, do we see the tide shift to a more permanent comprehensive approach here with Ambassador Bolton moving into that role?</p><p>LIPPOLD: Professor, that's a great question. And I think what you're going to see is Ambassador Bolton is now the National Security Advisor, not the executer but the advisor is going to say we need a much more comprehensive plan. We need a long range view. We need goals that we want to achieve for our national security objectives.</p><p>And he is going to take a more holistic approach into the execution of national security policy across the board. So I think that you're going to see a little bit more robust policy, I think you will see one with more defined objectives in there, and I think you will see one that will be executed in fairly short order because he is a decisive individual and he's going to recommend that to the president who obviously brought him in because he was a little frustrated that he was being held back in some of the execution of our policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The president did tweet because I mentioned the red line at the beginning, \"If President Obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended a long -- long ago. Animal Assad would have been history.\"</p><p>Maria spoke with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Michael McCaul yesterday and he agrees with the president. Listen to this Commander.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX) HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: There has to be a consequence to this. And I think the president's absolutely right is that President Obama drew the red line, the red line was crossed, he did nothing.</p><p>And then he negotiate through John Kerry the settlement, this weapons convention. I remember John Kerry saying, \"We took all their chemical weapons away.\" Obviously not. They still have this. And I also blame Russia and Iran, I think they're complicit with this as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Commander, I want to get your response to that. But as I mentioned earlier, we had that one-time airstrike last April but since then, there has been a chlorine gas attack that killed 20, mostly children, that happened in January, there was a statement from the State Department then but no enforcement. And Assad certainly knows that he would pay no price and now this, final thought.</p><p>LIPPOLD: I think you're absolutely right. There has to be consequences for this action. While there was a red line drawn and unfortunately we did not react to the red line when Syria crossed it. We did in fact have one positive development and that was getting rid of the vast majority of chemical weapons in there.</p><p>Had we attacked immediately, I doubt we would have ever gotten to that point with an agreement working with the Russians to make that happen. That is a positive thing to look at it. But nonetheless, if you draw a line as a state actor especially the United States, you have to hold it, enforce it, and do not waiver on it. And in doing that, it embolden people, the one-off strike, that's clearly going to be a test now whether we react to this in a manner that is much stronger, much more overwhelming and sends a signal, we will not tolerate this.</p><p>By the same token, going to Russia and Iran and saying, you're complicit in this, you have contributed to it, you have created the conditions that allowed it to happen, you must not do that anymore and there will be consequences and if your folks happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is not our responsibility, it's your decision to put them there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kirk, thank you so much. Kirk Lippold. Commander, be well. Thank you for being here.</p><p>LIPPOLD: Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting, \"When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be paid of 25 percent. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p>Coming up, on the hot seat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in Washington today ahead of two intense days of questioning on Capitol Hill. This comes as the company had set to alert millions of users if their data was shared.</p><p>And tired of being patient? Congress Trey Gowdy calling out the Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.</p><p>MCDOWELL: New week, new energy for Wall Street, DOW Futures right now are showing gains across the board, 167 point gain on the DOW Futures right now after what was a bruising week. Again, cooler heads prevailing I suppose when it comes to trade war talk. We'll see what comes out of the administration in the coming days. We're also watching the beginning of earning season this week.</p><p>Meantime, at least six teenagers from New York severely injured after a charter bus crashed. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, that's right Dagen. The bus packed with high school students returning from a spring break trip to Europe hit an overpass on Long Island last night. The impact was so strong, it tore the roof off the bus. This happened on the southern state parkway which restricts travel by commercial vehicles. Police say the driver did not seem to be familiar with that restriction.</p><p>Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joining thousands at a vigil honoring the junior hockey team involved in a tragic bus accident on Friday. The team president speaking to the crowd packed into the humble Broncos Arena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN GARINGER, HUMBOLDT BRONCOS PRESIDENT: We will find strength in one another. Today and for every day forward, we are all Humboldt Broncos and we will be forever Humboldt Broncos strong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Fifteen people are now dead after that team's bus collided with a tractor trailer. Among those killed were the team's head coach, the driver of the bus, and several players. While the community in Saskatchewan tries to cope, support has been overwhelming. A victims fund for the Broncos has already exceeded $4.5 million.</p><p>Well Deutsche Bank is replacing its CEO. John Cryan is out and Christian Sewing is taking over. Sewing is a 47-year-old executive who's worked for Deutsche Bank for nearly three decades. Germany's biggest bank has been struggling since the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts say the change could signal a potential merger with another European bank. Shares of Deutsche Bank much higher in the premarket, up over three and a half percent right now.</p><p>And then finally there's this, Anheuser-Busch unveiling a new flavor of beer, Bud Light Orange. It is a light lagger that is brewed usually actual peels from oranges. The company says that you will, \"taste the citrusy goodness.\" Bud Light Orange available for a limited time for, yes, the summer. Shares of Anheuser-Busch are down about three percent so far this year.</p><p>Dagen, if you ever put an orange in a beer like an orange slice, makes sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What you do with a Hefeweizen, wheat beer.</p><p>CASONE: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have a question, is this a shandy?</p><p>BRENBERG: It sounds like it. I don't like any of these kinds of beer. It sounds like a shandy, so I'm negative on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Shandy is tip -- do you know shandies?</p><p>MURPHY: I don't know shandy but I know this is like Budweiser and Fanta mixed together, I don't like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That actually sounds delicious.</p><p>CARTER: I know, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: People tweet us, I think a shandy is the -- defined by, it is like a juice or some fruit flavor or like soda in a beer. Like, again, the Leinenkugel's summer shandy is quite delicious on a hot day on the golf course.</p><p>BRENBERG: I think beer goes well with beer and nothing else. So I wouldn't put any of those stuff, no peels, no nothing.</p><p>CARTER: My guess is you're not the target audience. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRENBERG: I don't think I am. I don't think I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, Novartis as closed at $8.7 billion deal for a gene therapy company in the Midwest. Details on how the acquisition could boost the Swiss pharma giant's cancer innovations.</p><p>And Black Panther sailing past Titanic into the history books, another record shattering weekend for the Marvel movie.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Markets looking to start the new week with some gains, 178 point gain on the DOW Futures right now as concerns over a trade war with China ease a little bit. White House officials helping camp down those fears on the Sunday shows yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Just technically, we have taken no action. It's a long process, there's several months here, so far no tariffs and no action has been enacted.</p><p>STEPHEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I don't expect there will be a trade war, it could be but I don't expect it at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump tweeting this morning, \" When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be paid of 25 percent. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p>Joining me now is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee. Mike, what's going to keep these trade concerns in the background for investors, the start of earnings potentially?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP PRINCIPAL: I think this is going to be one of the best earning seasons we've ever had, right? Not only from the actually result but we got to remember that earnings are a forward- looking tool and that's what matters -- I'm sorry, stocks are forward- looking tool.</p><p>So what earnings are going to look like for the rest of the year and then going out to 2019 when we start talking about 2019, I think a lot of people are going to sit back and say, \"Well you know what, stocks are actually really cheap, they're not expensive.\" We're looking at one of the kind of the greatest growth periods we're going to see in our lifetimes, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But what if we do get into a back and forth, a tit-for-tat with China. Again, you heard from Larry Kudlow and Secretary of the Treasury, Steve MNuchin, they're trying to like wipe away some of the fears.</p><p>Like, \"Oh, this might not happen.\" But, again, I just wish some of those guys would call people I grew up with, hog farmers, and people who grow soybeans that that impacts the real American economy, that's what the market is reflecting that the economy might not be growing as fast and earnings might not be growing as fast. And it's Boeing and Caterpillar last week.</p><p>LEE: So a couple of things, right? If you run a small business and your cost are going to go up 20 or 25 or 30 percent based on some tariff like this, this could be terrifying for you. However, on a larger scale, what can China really do to us if that they're not already doing?</p><p>What, are they going to steal our intellectual property? I mean, the trade imbalance from China or trade deficit, we're annualizing at just under $400 billion a share, OK? That is a much larger portion of their GDP than the $150 billion to $170 billion that we export to them every year. Again, problems for people whose (INAUDIBLE) cost are going to go up.</p><p>Our economy as a whole can withstand a trade war much easier than they can. The standard of living in China is no one near as high as they make it out to be. So if China were to -- if China gets into a trade war with us, chances are they'll go into recession. If they go into recession, there's a good probability of a popular uprising. So that could -- the only way that the Chinese government could go out of power is by a recession.</p><p>So the government props up their economy, it's held together with duct tape and elbow grease. So it's -- look, I -- it's -- I'm saying this but people much smarter than me and much more powerful than me know this. So what we're seeing is a lot of posturing. So I don't -- any selloff because of trade war fears I think is a good buying opportunity.</p><p>MURPHY: Totally agree completely on that because I think what you're seeing in the market though is you get these headlines and you're getting this big whip sauce back and forth and I think that's fine for the professional traders. But for the people at home, they could really get hurt in trading this type of market.</p><p>I believe a lot of those whip sauce have to do with computerize trading, with the algorithm of trading. So they're pulling headlines and then you're seeing these big drops in the market or these big rallies in the market. And I think it's important for -- and I love your take on that, a huge portion of the volume out there in a day-to-day basis is computerized. So individual people at home can really get hurt trying to get in front of that.</p><p>LEE: I would say for people over the last couple of years of markets is too high, the market is too high. Well you know what, every time you see an ugly tweet or an ugly headline or Stormy Daniels or something, the market's going to selloff. Here's your opportunity to take some of that cash and buy some stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The market, do I have hope it doesn't selloff on Stormy Daniels. But go ahead. I hope investors are smarter than that or the computer.</p><p>LEE: If you start drilling down and looking at the U.S. economy, a durable goods are up year-over-year, almost nine percent, that's the highest number since the early 2000. You look at manufacturing is doing the best since the early 2000s.</p><p>Non-ISM manufacturing is the highest level it's been in 20 years. You look at the job market, weekly javas claims have been below 300,000 for almost three years. Longest period in almost the history of the entire United States.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick, earnings. Earnings season starts this week, J.P. Morgan kind of the big one coming out on Friday, what do you expect overall growth for the quarter 17 percent but J.P. Morgan expected to put up even better numbers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LEE: You know, what I'm going to be looking for is the forward guidance. What's dragged a lot of these banks back particularly is sales of trading. And now with the return of volatility, I think sales and trading has kind of been the (INAUDIBLE) as you look at all the different business units in all these banks.</p><p>It's going to start to get better and then with the banks, as rates are going higher, their net interest margins are going to expand. As net interest margins are going to expand, banks are going to make a lot more money in their wallets. And let's face it, 10 years ago when the banks were in their hay days they were trading shops, now they get back to being traditional lenders.</p><p>So when you were -- when you have a $1 trillion of loans out there, you make an extra 25 basis points on each loan, it's a lot of money, right? So -- I mean, the forward guidance is what I'm looking at and as the conversation switches from 2018 earnings to 2019 earnings I think people are going to say, \"Wow, stocks are really, really cheap. Something's going on here, like the market's going much higher.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Michael Lee, thank you sir. Good to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>LEE: Thanks very much guys. Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, facing the music, Facebook CEO is set to meet with lawmakers in Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate and then the House tomorrow and Wednesday. Hear from a whistleblower about the data reveal, the reckless handling of your personal information, let's call it that.</p><p>And Dr. Seuss has bumped into a new beat, the Migos remix, \"There's a Wocket in My Pocket,\" you've got to hear to believe.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Easing concerns over a trade war, sparking a rally on Wall Street, Futures are showing gains across the board, 176-point gain on the Dow Futures, this after that sharp selloff on Friday.</p><p>The major market gauges all down more than two percent, again, a little bit of a disappointing job's number. The chief of the feds speaking and then trade war worries. In Europe, the market is hovering near the flat line this morning. We still have gains across the board in England, France and Germany, and in Asia overnight, stocks moving up from Shanghai to the KOSPI in South Korea.</p><p>Facebook, under fire, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gearing up for his trip to Capitol Hill, where he will be grilled over the company's privacy practices. What to expect from the congressional hearings, ahead. Calling for action, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Trey Gowdy, says the justice department is stonewalling when it comes to handing over documents tied to the FISA and Hillary Clinton investigations. Here's what he told Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: I want to be able to support the FBI and the DOJ, but the world's premier law- enforcement agency can't seem to operate a damn copying machine. That is inexplicable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have the very latest, a strong message for Iran, hackers attacking the country's network, leaving an image of the American flag. Warning, don't mess with our elections. A little bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street, Novartis is getting big on gene therapy with its latest acquisition.</p><p>And a not so quite start for the box office for A Quiet Place, the horror film soaring passed expectations. We have the full box office recap, ahead, plus, a whole new tune for Dr. Seuss' Wocket in my Pocket, a rap of the childhood classic, going viral.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, the clock, ticking on the DOJ, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, now, asking Federal Prosecutor John Lausch to help speed up the response to GOP demands for documents related to the surveillance of former Trump Campaign Advisor, Carter Page. The firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI and the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, the request, coming after President Trump took to Twitter this weekend, to slam the DOJ and FBI, writing, what does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?</p><p>Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents, unredacted, to the House Judiciary Committee? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good. House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who has been leading the charge, sounded off, yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOWDY: I have not seen a clean version and I need to know what's behind those black lines because it's really important how this investigation began, when it began and what is the -- what is the weight, what is the credibility of the evidence upon which this investigation was launched? And the Department of Justice and the FBI have that document, they won't let us see the clean version, and I'm struggling to understand why.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: This all comes as the DOJ promises to turn over an additional 3600 pages from the FBI today, to the House panel. Joining us now is Editor-in-Chief of Axios, Nick Johnston, Nick, your reaction to these new developments and where do we go from here?</p><p>NICHOLAS JOHNSTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AXIOS: Yes, I think it's really important to hear the frustration in Chairman Gowdy's voice what he told Maria, sort of, how angry he was about how they can't find the copy machine that could underscores the tension here and how these are Republicans on the Hill are still very much focused on getting this kind of information.</p><p>And this is a Republican justice department that they'd say hasn't been doing it fast enough, even the President, as you showed, has been tweeting that the document turnover hasn't happened fast enough. I think, the appointment of this new attorney, to facilitate that, will probably help. It might make some of these folks on the Hill, a little happier, but this is still a very important investigatory focus for them, and they're not going to give up until they get what they want.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nick, how do the midterm elections factor into this, though, because even though we have a Republican president in the White House, and Republican leading the justice department as the Attorney General, you look at Trey Gowdy and the other heads, Devin Nunes, head of the House Intelligence Committee, really there, the time window is closing on them just, potentially, if the Democrats retake the House. How critical is that timing?</p><p>JOHNSTON: I think it's a really great point. A lot of what Republicans want to accomplish in the House today is set under the guise of what will happen in the midterms and Republicans are coming from a -- from a place of the underdogs, I think, in this election, and if they lose the gavels on these committees, these investigations go away. So I think, certainly, in the coming months, if they don't get the documents, this pressure will only increase because they know they have to finish this by the end of the year.</p><p>CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: No, Nick, I think, it's a really interesting conversation that's been have about whether or not the Republican hold strategy, is to undermine -- is undermine the DOJ and say that there's not going to be trust in these institutions that are so important. Do you think that's fair for them to criticize or do you think the Republicans have a fair, you know, have a real beef here?</p><p>JOHNSTON: Right. This is a really interesting point. We've done some pulling on this, in fact, quickly, after the President went after the (INAUDIBLE) investigation recently, and we saw favorability for the FBI plunge among Republicans which is something we haven't seen, essentially, ever, as long as the department had existed.</p><p>I think it's a very, sort of, dicey area to be, sort of, attacking these law enforcement agencies the way they ever remember, you know, these are members of congress. They have clear investigatory ability to get these kinds of documents, and you know what? If they subpoena them, you need to provide them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to move on to Facebook (INAUDIBLE) send out notifications today to millions of affected users in this data mining scandal. This comes as congressional aides are confirming that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will hold meetings today on Capitol Hill, with several lawmakers ahead of this week's hearings. Take a listen to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Senate Judiciary Committee, John Kennedy, both suggesting that things are about to change at the tech giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: Mark's happy to go to congress because Mark wants to answer every question people have about the service we office. We weren't focused enough and being proactive enough and Mark is happy to say here's what we weren't doing and here's what we are doing now.</p><p>REP. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I don't want to hurt Facebook. I don't want to regulate them half to death. But, we have a problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, our problem. Meantime, a whistleblower, now warning that the millions of affected users' data could be stored in Russia, I think that it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's performance because he's sending out Sheryl Sandberg in his stead, who clearly loves to tell women how to lean in, in this country, but when -- this is a very serious issue and I would argue that her performance, last week, in terms of giving interviews, was a little light, in terms of really grappling with the seriousness of it.</p><p>I point to a New York Post, the front page -- the front page of the post, on Saturday, we own you, pay us for your privacy, shocking, and then Mark Zuckerberg, famously, in 2010, was sweating like Richard Nixon, breaking out on a flop sweat-like none other. Again, it's just going to be Zuckerberg sitting there, whether the stocks sold off or not.</p><p>JOHNSTON: Right. This is a -- this is the main event here. All the pre- interviews last week with Sheryl Sandberg (INAUDIBLE) were opening acts. The real thing here, Zuckerberg is on the Hill -- on the Hill, today, preparing, tomorrow, 2:30, must-see TV. Zuckerberg, appearing before this committee, this is something he's never done before in this kind of hearing, and he doesn't have any natural allies on his committee. These senators on both sides of the aisle are gunning for big tech. And so, this hearing is a start of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are they really gunning for big tech, though, Nick? I mean, big tech is -- you know, when you talk about Silicon Valley and technology, it is one of the most divided areas, politically, that all of the CEOs have historically been big givers to Democratic candidates. Their policies lean very far left. There's really not room, you saw with the firing of that Google employee, not room for conservative thought or speech. And so, I just wonder what kind of treatments he gets.</p><p>JOHNSTON: I would separate it from that. What this is, is the final -- the first time congress is really going to ask the questions, are these tech companies too big and if they know so much about their users and have they done a good job of explaining to users how much they know. For a lot of members of the Hill, this is a mystery to them. There are no natural allies for Facebook or rather these big technology companies. I want to look to see any friendly questions for Mark, tomorrow, when he's in congress.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We've known, Mike Murphy, that this was going on for years, in terms of Facebook not protecting user information, whether you're talking about RapLeaf or Cloud and their way of enforcement was to call up the company telling them, don't do that anymore.</p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's only because this was somehow related to the Trump campaign that people are now furious and up in arms.</p><p>MURPHY: I think what Mark Zuckerberg's going to talk about a lot, this week, is what Facebook used to do, and what they are doing now, to talk about how the company has shifted, how they're protecting your data, but you'll know when go on there, Dagen. You're giving up a lot of your information. If you don't want to give that up, you shouldn't be on Facebook. They may have a responsibility to not sell it but they -- once you're on there, that data is there, and they own it, they do, as the cover said.</p><p>BRENBERG,: Do they know what they're doing now? That's -- you said they're going to talk about what they're doing. Now, I think a lot of people look at this and say, do they know what they're doing now or are they really just, like, we actually have no idea what's going on and every single day now, we're seeing new revelations of more, you know, inappropriate data sharing, customers having their data used in ways that they didn't know. I don't think Facebook has a good handle on where they are.</p><p>MURPHY: I think this is years ago this is years ago when -- I think it was 2014, the Cambridge Analytica information ended up being given to the improper parties. So, I think, Facebook today, 2018, versus four years ago, is a vastly different company, it has run differently. So, I think that's what they want to underline, is how they are now doing their best to potentially protect their data the best possible.</p><p>BRENBERG: I think they're going to have you lift, kind of, show that, I really do. I don't think people think it's changed that much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They knew that data, back in 2015, had been improperly accessed and they basically said, don't, you know, do away. Get rid of it, Nick, final word, real quick.</p><p>JOHNSTON: I think the key thing here is a lot of people who are, sort of, really into this issue know about how much Facebook has. This is the first time members of congress will learn how big that is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And let's hope that they bone up in advance of this, because we know how this can go, if they're really not sure of the questions they are asking. But, again, WilmerHale, the law firm given Mark Zuckerberg some prep in advance to that, the Wall Street Journal reported that today. Nick, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSTON: Always.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you, Nick Johnston of Axios.</p><p>JOHNSTON: Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, hackers hit Iran with the cryptic warning, including an image of the American Flag and a message, don't mess with our elections, details on that. An intergalactic debut, the new Solo, a Star Wars story trailer, finally out. We'll give you a peek.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Iran hit hard by a global cyberattack with a strong message. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, they did, Dagen. Hackers targeting networks on a number of countries including data centers in Iran. The hackers let the image of an American flag on screen, saying \"don't mess with our elections\". The Iranian government says, about 3500 -- across that country.</p><p>Well, a deal in the pharmaceutical industry to tell you about -- Novartis is buying the AveXis, the price tag, nearly $9 billion. The deal is a bet that at least one promising drug that AveXis is developing to treat spinal muscular atrophy will turn into a blockbuster drug. Shares of Novartis are higher in the premarket, up more than one and quarter percent; AveXis shares are sharply higher as well.</p><p>Well, this is interesting -- one rapper on YouTube, drew some inspiration from a kind of unusual place while rhyming to the tune of Migos song \"Walk it, Talk it\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Some of them are dreaming like that (INAUDIBLE), but that (INAUDIBLE) when the bottle some are fairly some are not. Let them (INAUDIBLE) on the table when they get under the chair. But that bump on the sofa when I wish she wasn't there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: So, you get it when you start watching it, right? This went viral. And instead of \"Walk it, Talk it\", the YouTuber was rapper \"walk it in my pocket\" but in the Migos style of rapping. It racks up over a million views on YouTube. So, I guess -- I don't know what's next, cat in the hat? Cinderella? Green eggs and ham? Bring it on!</p><p>MURPHY: I've had enough for 15 years.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, you've been doing -- did you rap Dr. Seuss, Theodore Geisel, for your kids?</p><p>MURPHY: For 15 years, straight, for every one of mine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Give me some green eggs and ham. I want to hear it now.</p><p>MURPHY: It's on my YouTube channel.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You give us some green eggs and ham?</p><p>MURPHY: No.</p><p>CARTER: (INAUDIBLE) like, when we first heard about this, is this the children that, you know -- like, no, this is a wrapper.</p><p>MURPHY: Wrapper, Migos. Yes!</p><p>CARTER: You're all in.</p><p>BRENBERG: This is how dads keep their kids engaged. I mean, you're reading your book, you've got do something like that. You can't just read the book; you got to rap, you got to sing it.</p><p>CARTER: You rap your books?</p><p>BRENBERG: I do something, maybe like an accent. You know, you got to do something to make it, and your kids are just to get bored and whatever. It's a hard job, right?</p><p>MURPHY: This is iconic, and you kind of bring it to 2018, I think it needs a little hip-hop in there, totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We will not eat green eggs and ham?</p><p>MURPHY: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Give me the next one.</p><p>MURPHY: Sam, I am.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, \"A Quiet Place\" making a big noise. The thriller is a big win by actors turned director, Emily Blunt and John Krisinski. A box office recap, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Another record-breaking weekend at the box office. Lauren Simonetti has more details.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Good morning, happy Monday. This is the time we talk about what was a hit over the weekend. So, let's give you the list. In first place, \"A Quiet Place\". A surprise $50 million opening for this horror film -- and we're going to talk more about it in a second; let's get through the rest of the list. Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", 25 million in the second week; \"Blockers\", 21 million; \"Black Panther\", took the fourth-place spot, only $8 million this weekend but if you look at what \"Black Panther\" has done to date, it has unseated \"Titanic\". So, if you look at total domestic growth, for this movie, $665 million. There it is, number three of all time. \"The Force Awakens\", number one; \"Avatar\", number two; and \"Titanic\", now number four.</p><p>Let's go back to \"A Quiet Place\". This is a movie that cost $17 million to make; $50 million in its opening weekend. So, it was written and directed by -- of office fame, John Krisinki and his wife Emily Blunt starred, but it's basically a \"A Quiet Place\" -- there's no dialogue in the movie, and it's a huge win for Paramount who needed a big hit after about two years of not having a hit. So, there you have it. We're liking horror at the box office. And they got the trailer for the new \"Star Wars\".</p><p>MCDOWELL: What do you got, Lauren? Show me.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Let's watch it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard about a job. A big shot gangster putting together a crew.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a driver. I'm a flyer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've waited a long time for a shot like this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is he saying? No, what do you know?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got a line on a ship?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: It hit theaters on the 25th of May. See, it's the young Han Solo. Do we want to see the --</p><p>BRENBERG: That's a lot of -- it's a lot of pressure to play the young Han Solo. He's such a great character. I think the chances of failing are really high here. I'm excited to see. It looks good in the trailer, but that's a tough role, right?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Agreed.</p><p>CARTER: I like the original \"Star Wars\", I'm not into it.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's disconnected. It's another one of the -- I think this one takes place before the first one, in 1977.</p><p>MURHPY: That tease makes -- while they're getting 600 and 700 million at the box office, you can count and see more and more \"Star Wars\" prequel, sequels, whatever.</p><p>BRENBERG: You're going to see Han Solo as a 5-year-old at some point --</p><p>MURPHY: Yes --</p><p>BRENBERG: I'm not looking forward to that one.</p><p>CARTER: If I like something or not, it's pretty much a not a good indicator about whether or not it's going to perform well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's called monetizing the franchise, just like Disney bought it in the first place. And so, they've done a pretty good job.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's almost like one a year, right? There's been like one \"Star Wars\".</p><p>BRENBERG: One from the regular series, one of the, kind of the, in between --</p><p>SIMONETTI: In between.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes, every single year for the next 20 years, at least, right?</p><p>SIMONETTI: They get some new characters in this one. And we'll see what the appetite is for a young Han Solo.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You only need to know one word -- Chewbacca.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Makes an appearance in one of trailers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And his age?</p><p>MCDOWELL: 190 -- in the film.</p><p>MURHPY: (INAUDIBLE) like a long time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI: They sure do.</p><p>CARTER: I hope that's a good indicator. My dog just looks like him.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I wish our dogs are the same. Kevin -- someone who looks like him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Her dog is named Kevin, just to clear that up. She has two dogs. Lauren, thank you so much. And Lauren is having a baby. Can you reveal the name while we're staying here?</p><p>SIMONETTI: I don't know if it's a boy or a girl. And we're not sharing names only because I don't care what anybody has to say about them anymore. Not a name. Not talking anymore suggestion,</p><p>BRENBERG: You don't need it, but yes, forget about.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Don't want your input. Thank you very much. But you can still guess if it's boy or girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We can segue from Han Solo to Lauren and her impending delivery. Still ahead, gas prices said to hit their higher level in years this summer. We have all the details for you, next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.

As the world waits  for a U.S. response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TOM BOSSERT, WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR:  I wouldn't take  anything off the table, these are horrible photos, we're looking into the  attack at this point.  I think the president's got a point that's been very  clear and I'm going to reiterate that point.  The pendulum has swung in the  wrong direction for too long and the United States of America has been  taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the  entire world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Despite the tension, stocks are pointing to a bounce back as  concerns over a trade war with China eased a little bit, maybe it was the  Sunday morning talk show's rhetoric being thrown out by the White House.</p><p>Futures are showing this, 172 point gain on the DOW Futures right now, it's  losing week for the Blue Chips last week.  This comes after that massive  selloff on Friday with the DOW, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P all falling more than two  percent.</p><p>In Europe, you have some buying to report, the England, France, and  Germany, we have gains across the board.  In Asia overnight, stocks also  moving higher.  The biggest winner there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Zuckerberg taking the Hill, Facebook CEO set to meet with lawmakers in  Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate  tomorrow.  The latest as the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says more  people's data could have been exposed.</p><p>And a change at the top, Deutsche Bank naming a new CEO, the details as  shares jumped on the news.</p><p>And terrifying moments on a New York highway, a tour bus slamming into an  overpass leaving six people seriously injured, more on their condition  ahead.</p><p>And the DOJ stonewalling, why Congress Trey Gowdy is calling out the  Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses. </p><p>And orange going to love this, Bud Light going citrus for the summer, the  new flavor hitting store shelves coming up.  I think that's called a summer  shandy.  </p><p>All of that and so much more this morning, Pollster Maslansky and Partners  President, Lee Carter.  Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.   And the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  </p><p>I start with you, markets this week, we get bank earnings, worries about a  trade war but, again, now geopolitical concerns that the focusing shifted  to that.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR:  Yes.   Yes, it has.  Although it's interesting to watch these back and forth with  the trade wars.  You get some rhetoric out of the White House, we -- the  talk on Thursday night, Friday morning stocks (INAUDIBLE) over the weekend,  everybody's out there talking about how this is not a big deal, we don't  want a trade war, you come back Monday morning, stocks up again.</p><p>We're seeing this pattern repeat again and again.  It seems to take a day  or two for markets to digest that you've got rhetoric and you've got  reality on trade and the reality probably isn't going to be as bad or as  harsh as a rhetoric sounds.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, what are you watching this week?</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO, MANAGING PARTNER:  Absolutely.  So watching the  volatility in the market, that's really spurn -- spurred by this trade war  talk.  And I think just a few months ago we were talking about there's no  volatility in the market.</p><p>We haven't had a one percent move in so many months.  Well now you're  getting two percent move almost on a daily basis.  I think the main thing  for investors to do here is to try to block out the headlines and stick  with their long-term plans.  So we're going to get the down 500s, the  bounces above 200s.  Overall, there's not going to be a major trade war  with China in my opinion, it will back to focus on the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think some of the White House officials needs some messaging  help because you've got Secretary MNuchin on Friday talking about the  potential of a trade war and then trying to walk back those comments  yesterday saying, \"I don't expect it at all in terms of a trade war.\"   Don't have your Treasury Secretary utter the words trade war ever.</p><p>LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  That would be a  good first step.  But I think it's fascinating to see how the markets are  reacting so much to the rhetoric rather than just the policy.</p><p>It's unbelievable, a tweet, one announcement can send the markets in a  tailspin.  And what's happened traditionally is that we've looked at the  experts and say, \"What are we really supposed to be looking at?\"  One  tweet, one message, one interview can totally change the course of the  markets and we're seeing that this week and certainly the White House  rhetoric tone way back saying this has always been -- there's nothing new  here, nothing's developed here, not a trade war and look, things are  softening again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm looking forward to Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill.   Again, Facebook will reveal today to Facebook users whose data was accessed  by Cambridge Analytica, it's about 70 million people.  Estimates are in the  United States alone.</p><p>And watch Mark Zuckerberg because back in 2010, he broke out into a  Nixonian flop sweat when Walt Mossberg was interviewing him.  And I mean  sweat was dripping off of his face.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So if you do that on Capitol Hill, watch your stock tank.</p><p>BRENBERG:  His appearances are always so staged managed.  This one  absolutely cannot be.  And so it's going to be interesting to see what he  does under that kind of pressure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're trying to get the video but he had sweat dripping off his  nose and his chin.  I'm not kidding.  It's --</p><p>CARTER:  This is not where he's comfortable.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  That was -- that was back in the days of the hoodie  sweatshirt.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So you're saying he was hot.</p><p>MURPHY:  So he's come a long way.</p><p>CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) t-shirt.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was -- he was just hot.  OK.  We're going to talk about that  all morning.  Also coming up, New York Congressman Chris Collins, South  Dakota Senator Mike Rounds.  Host of Michelle Malkin Investigates on  CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And Legendary Soulman, my friend, Sam Moore.  You don't want  to miss any of them.  </p><p>Our top story this morning, crossing the red line, the world awaiting the  U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed  dozens of citizens.  Yesterday, warplanes bombing an airbase near the City  of Homs.  Russia and Syria have accused Israel of that strike.  Meantime,  President Trump sending a strong warning to the Assad Regime he tweeted  this, \"Many dead including women and children, in mindless chemical attack  in Syria.  Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army,  making it completely inaccessible to the outside world.  President Putin,  Russia, and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad, big price to  pay.  Open area immediately for medical help and verification.  Another  humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever, sick.\"</p><p>Joining us now is -- this morning is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk  Lippold.  Commander, how do you -- what should the U.S. do to respond?  And  I should point out that we used that phrase red line that was famously a  phrase used by President Obama back in 2010.  Assad and Syria crossed that  red line and we didn't do anything or we didn't attack.  What should we do  now?</p><p>COMMANDER KIRK S. LIPPOLD (RET), FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER:  Good morning  Dagen.  I think the first thing we need to do is verify through  intelligence channels that in fact took place who carried it out, where it  was launched from, what was used to do it? </p><p>And then at that point, we take a step back, put together the military  forces, and then decide whether we're going to react in a manner that is  going to take away that capability not like we did last time with the  Tomahawk missiles.  But this time, on a more permanent basis and with the  backing of the Security Council hopefully at the U.N.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Commander, you brought that up, so there was one -- it was  a sarin gas attack last year, a one-time strike by the United States on a  Syrian airbase.  Why haven't we done more since then?  There was a chlorine  gas attack this past January which was the State Department and Rex  Tillerson, then the Secretary of State basically attacked in a statement.   But why haven't we done more to maybe take out all of Assad's air force,  the entire air force?  </p><p>LIPPOLD:  Well, I think Dagen you have to look at it, what is going to be  our engagement?  What is the end state we want to have there?  Assad is  going to continue to exist as the president of Syria because the Russians  are backing him, they now have the Iranians that are also providing  technical knowledge and an ability to also establish their own basis there  which Israel is not going to tolerate, which probably drove the attack into  the T4 or Tiyas Airbase last night.</p><p>But we have to take a look and say, \"OK, do we want to be the world's  leader in this case where a low level attacks have occurred using chemical  weapons?\"  This was absolutely a much larger scale one, it shows that  they're taking out one of the last strongholds of the Syrians rebels.  At  this point, we need to say, \"No, you either go for it conventionally or we  will take out that capability.\"  And if it does mean that we take out the  Syrian air force, then we better be prepared for a little bit longer  investment in time being in Syria with our forces despite what the  president has said.</p><p>MURPHY:  Commander, it's Mike Murphy.  I love your opinion on the timing of  this of attack because do you think it has to do with the fact that  President Trump is fighting on many different fronts?  We have North Korea,  we have the issues here in the U.S., Russia.  You think Syria and Putin got  together and said, \"Maybe this is a good time to test the president's  medal?\"</p><p>LIPPOLD:  I don't think it was timing for that.  I think that the president  is going to react to it and how he reacts.  I think once again,  internationally bent will drive the decision-making process for the U.S.  government as it always should especially where military force is involved.</p><p>I don't think this is going to be a tail-wagging, dog-type scenario, I  think in fact we need to look at it and say what are our national security  interest there?  What is the end state we want to achieve?  And if taking  out the Syrian air force to send a signal to do that turns out to be the  best option for us, then we execute it efficiently, ruthlessly, and with  overwhelming force.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Brian, and I'll let you get in here but the timing, it does beg  the question of this attack comes at -- right after President Trump says  that we can't wait to get out of Syria, that we -- that -- but, again, he  focus on ISIS and we see the threat to the Syrian people and children in  the Assad Regime.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes, absolutely.  And the other timing issue that I'd like to  ask you about Commander is you have the entrance this week now of John  Bolton into the National Security Advisor role, that has to change things a  little bit.</p><p>He's been critical of these one-off strikes, do we see the tide shift to a  more permanent comprehensive approach here with Ambassador Bolton moving  into that role?</p><p>LIPPOLD:  Professor, that's a great question.  And I think what you're  going to see is Ambassador Bolton is now the National Security Advisor, not  the executer but the advisor is going to say we need a much more  comprehensive plan.  We need a long range view.  We need goals that we want  to achieve for our national security objectives.</p><p>And he is going to take a more holistic approach into the execution of  national security policy across the board.  So I think that you're going to  see a little bit more robust policy, I think you will see one with more  defined objectives in there, and I think you will see one that will be  executed in fairly short order because he is a decisive individual and he's  going to recommend that to the president who obviously brought him in  because he was a little frustrated that he was being held back in some of  the execution of our policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The president did tweet because I mentioned the red line at the  beginning, \"If President Obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand,  the Syrian disaster would have ended a long -- long ago.  Animal Assad  would have been history.\"</p><p>Maria spoke with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Michael McCaul  yesterday and he agrees with the president.  Listen to this Commander.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX) HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  There  has to be a consequence to this.  And I think the president's absolutely  right is that President Obama drew the red line, the red line was crossed,  he did nothing.</p><p>And then he negotiate through John Kerry the settlement, this weapons  convention.  I remember John Kerry saying, \"We took all their chemical  weapons away.\"  Obviously not.  They still have this.  And I also blame  Russia and Iran, I think they're complicit with this as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Commander, I want to get your response to that.  But as I  mentioned earlier, we had that one-time airstrike last April but since  then, there has been a chlorine gas attack that killed 20, mostly children,  that happened in January, there was a statement from the State Department  then but no enforcement.  And Assad certainly knows that he would pay no  price and now this, final thought.</p><p>LIPPOLD:  I think you're absolutely right.  There has to be consequences  for this action.  While there was a red line drawn and unfortunately we did  not react to the red line when Syria crossed it.  We did in fact have one  positive development and that was getting rid of the vast majority of  chemical weapons in there.</p><p>Had we attacked immediately, I doubt we would have ever gotten to that  point with an agreement working with the Russians to make that happen.   That is a positive thing to look at it.  But nonetheless, if you draw a  line as a state actor especially the United States, you have to hold it,  enforce it, and do not waiver on it.  And in doing that, it embolden  people, the one-off strike, that's clearly going to be a test now whether  we react to this in a manner that is much stronger, much more overwhelming  and sends a signal, we will not tolerate this.  </p><p>By the same token, going to Russia and Iran and saying, you're complicit in  this, you have contributed to it, you have created the conditions that  allowed it to happen, you must not do that anymore and there will be  consequences and if your folks happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong  time, that is not our responsibility, it's your decision to put them there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kirk, thank you so much.  Kirk Lippold.  Commander, be well.   Thank you for being here.</p><p>LIPPOLD:  Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting, \"When a car is  sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12  percent.  When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a  tariff to be paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.   No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p>Coming up, on the hot seat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in Washington  today ahead of two intense days of questioning on Capitol Hill.  This comes  as the company had set to alert millions of users if their data was shared.  </p><p>And tired of being patient?  Congress Trey Gowdy calling out the Justice  Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  New week, new energy for Wall Street, DOW Futures right now are  showing gains across the board, 167 point gain on the DOW Futures right now  after what was a bruising week.  Again, cooler heads prevailing I suppose  when it comes to trade war talk.  We'll see what comes out of the  administration in the coming days.  We're also watching the beginning of  earning season this week.</p><p>Meantime, at least six teenagers from New York severely injured after a  charter bus crashed.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that's right Dagen.  The bus packed with high school students  returning from a spring break trip to Europe hit an overpass on Long Island  last night.  The impact was so strong, it tore the roof off the bus.  This  happened on the southern state parkway which restricts travel by commercial  vehicles.  Police say the driver did not seem to be familiar with that  restriction.</p><p>Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joining thousands at a vigil  honoring the junior hockey team involved in a tragic bus accident on  Friday.  The team president speaking to the crowd packed into the humble  Broncos Arena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN GARINGER, HUMBOLDT BRONCOS PRESIDENT:  We will find strength in one  another.  Today and for every day forward, we are all Humboldt Broncos and  we will be forever Humboldt Broncos strong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Fifteen people are now dead after that team's bus collided with a  tractor trailer.  Among those killed were the team's head coach, the driver  of the bus, and several players.  While the community in Saskatchewan tries  to cope, support has been overwhelming.  A victims fund for the Broncos has  already exceeded $4.5 million.</p><p>Well Deutsche Bank is replacing its CEO.  John Cryan is out and Christian  Sewing is taking over.  Sewing is a 47-year-old executive who's worked for  Deutsche Bank for nearly three decades.  Germany's biggest bank has been  struggling since the 2008 financial crisis.  Analysts say the change could  signal a potential merger with another European bank.  Shares of Deutsche  Bank much higher in the premarket, up over three and a half percent right  now.  </p><p>And then finally there's this, Anheuser-Busch unveiling a new flavor of  beer, Bud Light Orange.  It is a light lagger that is brewed usually actual  peels from oranges.  The company says that you will, \"taste the citrusy  goodness.\"  Bud Light Orange available for a limited time for, yes, the  summer.  Shares of Anheuser-Busch are down about three percent so far this  year.</p><p>Dagen, if you ever put an orange in a beer like an orange slice, makes  sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What you do with a Hefeweizen, wheat beer. </p><p>CASONE:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have a question, is this a shandy?</p><p>BRENBERG:  It sounds like it.  I don't like any of these kinds of beer.  It  sounds like a shandy, so I'm negative on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shandy is tip -- do you know shandies?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't know shandy but I know this is like Budweiser and Fanta  mixed together, I don't like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That actually sounds delicious.</p><p>CARTER:  I know, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People tweet us, I think a shandy is the -- defined by, it is  like a juice or some fruit flavor or like soda in a beer.  Like, again, the  Leinenkugel's summer shandy is quite delicious on a hot day on the golf  course.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I think beer goes well with beer and nothing else.  So I  wouldn't put any of those stuff, no peels, no nothing.</p><p>CARTER:  My guess is you're not the target audience.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BRENBERG:  I don't think I am.  I don't think I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Novartis as closed at $8.7 billion deal for a gene  therapy company in the Midwest.

It's a long process, there's several months here, so  far no tariffs and no action has been enacted.</p><p>STEPHEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I don't expect there will be a  trade war, it could be but I don't expect it at all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting this morning, \" When a car is sent to  the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent.   When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be  paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No, it  sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p>Joining me now is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee.  Mike,  what's going to keep these trade concerns in the background for investors,  the start of earnings potentially?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP PRINCIPAL:  I think this is going to  be one of the best earning seasons we've ever had, right?  Not only from  the actually result but we got to remember that earnings are a forward- looking tool and that's what matters -- I'm sorry, stocks are forward- looking tool.</p><p>So what earnings are going to look like for the rest of the year and then  going out to 2019 when we start talking about 2019, I think a lot of people  are going to sit back and say, \"Well you know what, stocks are actually  really cheap, they're not expensive.\"  We're looking at one of the kind of  the greatest growth periods we're going to see in our lifetimes, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But what if we do get into a back and forth, a tit-for-tat with  China.  Again, you heard from Larry Kudlow and Secretary of the Treasury,  Steve MNuchin, they're trying to like wipe away some of the fears.</p><p>Like, \"Oh, this might not happen.\"  But, again, I just wish some of those  guys would call people I grew up with, hog farmers, and people who grow  soybeans that that impacts the real American economy, that's what the  market is reflecting that the economy might not be growing as fast and  earnings might not be growing as fast.  And it's Boeing and Caterpillar  last week.</p><p>LEE:  So a couple of things, right?  If you run a small business and your  cost are going to go up 20 or 25 or 30 percent based on some tariff like  this, this could be terrifying for you.  However, on a larger scale, what  can China really do to us if that they're not already doing?</p><p>What, are they going to steal our intellectual property?  I mean, the trade  imbalance from China or trade deficit, we're annualizing at just under $400  billion a share, OK?  That is a much larger portion of their GDP than the  $150 billion to $170 billion that we export to them every year.  Again,  problems for people whose (INAUDIBLE) cost are going to go up.</p><p>Our economy as a whole can withstand a trade war much easier than they can.   The standard of living in China is no one near as high as they make it out  to be.  So if China were to -- if China gets into a trade war with us,  chances are they'll go into recession.  If they go into recession, there's  a good probability of a popular uprising.  So that could -- the only way  that the Chinese government could go out of power is by a recession.</p><p>So the government props up their economy, it's held together with duct tape  and elbow grease.  So it's -- look, I -- it's -- I'm saying this but people  much smarter than me and much more powerful than me know this.  So what  we're seeing is a lot of posturing.  So I don't -- any selloff because of  trade war fears I think is a good buying opportunity.</p><p>MURPHY:  Totally agree completely on that because I think what you're  seeing in the market though is you get these headlines and you're getting  this big whip sauce back and forth and I think that's fine for the  professional traders.  But for the people at home, they could really get  hurt in trading this type of market.</p><p>I believe a lot of those whip sauce have to do with computerize trading,  with the algorithm of trading.  So they're pulling headlines and then  you're seeing these big drops in the market or these big rallies in the  market.  And I think it's important for -- and I love your take on that, a  huge portion of the volume out there in a day-to-day basis is computerized.   So individual people at home can really get hurt trying to get in front of  that.</p><p>LEE:  I would say for people over the last couple of years of markets is  too high, the market is too high.  Well you know what, every time you see  an ugly tweet or an ugly headline or Stormy Daniels or something, the  market's going to selloff.  Here's your opportunity to take some of that  cash and buy some stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The market, do I have hope it doesn't selloff on Stormy Daniels.   But go ahead.  I hope investors are smarter than that or the computer.</p><p>LEE:  If you start drilling down and looking at the U.S. economy, a durable  goods are up year-over-year, almost nine percent, that's the highest number  since the early 2000.  You look at manufacturing is doing the best since  the early 2000s.  </p><p>Non-ISM manufacturing is the highest level it's been in 20 years.  You look  at the job market, weekly javas claims have been below 300,000 for almost  three years.  Longest period in almost the history of the entire United  States.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, earnings.  Earnings season starts this week, J.P.  Morgan kind of the big one coming out on Friday, what do you expect overall  growth for the quarter 17 percent but J.P. Morgan expected to put up even  better numbers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LEE: You know, what I'm going to be looking for is the forward guidance.   What's dragged a lot of these banks back particularly is sales of trading.   And now with the return of volatility, I think sales and trading has kind  of been the (INAUDIBLE) as you look at all the different business units in  all these banks.</p><p>It's going to start to get better and then with the banks, as rates are  going higher, their net interest margins are going to expand.  As net  interest margins are going to expand, banks are going to make a lot more  money in their wallets.  And let's face it, 10 years ago when the banks  were in their hay days they were trading shops, now they get back to being  traditional lenders.  </p><p>So when you were -- when you have a $1 trillion of loans out there, you  make an extra 25 basis points on each loan, it's a lot of money, right?  So  -- I mean, the forward guidance is what I'm looking at and as the  conversation switches from 2018 earnings to 2019 earnings I think people  are going to say, \"Wow, stocks are really, really cheap.  Something's going  on here, like the market's going much higher.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Michael Lee, thank you sir.  Good to see you.  Come back soon.</p><p>LEE:  Thanks very much guys.

What to expect from the congressional hearings, ahead.  Calling  for action, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Trey Gowdy, says the  justice department is stonewalling when it comes to handing over documents  tied to the FISA and Hillary Clinton investigations.  Here's what he told  Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  I want to be  able to support the FBI and the DOJ, but the world's premier law- enforcement agency can't seem to operate a damn copying machine.  That is  inexplicable.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have the very latest, a strong message for Iran, hackers  attacking the country's network, leaving an image of the American flag.   Warning, don't mess with our elections.  A little bit of a merger Monday on  Wall Street, Novartis is getting big on gene therapy with its latest  acquisition.  </p><p>And a not so quite start for the box office for A Quiet Place, the horror  film soaring passed expectations.  We have the full box office recap,  ahead, plus, a whole new tune for Dr. Seuss' Wocket in my Pocket, a rap of  the childhood classic, going viral.  </p><p>To our top story this half hour, the clock, ticking on the DOJ, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, now, asking  Federal Prosecutor John Lausch to help speed up the response to GOP demands  for documents related to the surveillance of former Trump Campaign Advisor,  Carter Page.  The firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI and the  investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, the request,  coming after President Trump took to Twitter this weekend, to slam the DOJ  and FBI, writing, what does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?  </p><p>Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents, unredacted, to the  House Judiciary Committee?  Stalling, but for what reason?  Not looking  good.  House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who has been leading  the charge, sounded off, yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOWDY:  I have not seen a clean version and I need to know what's behind  those black lines because it's really important how this investigation  began, when it began and what is the -- what is the weight, what is the  credibility of the evidence upon which this investigation was launched?   And the Department of Justice and the FBI have that document, they won't  let us see the clean version, and I'm struggling to understand why.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This all comes as the DOJ promises to turn over an additional  3600 pages from the FBI today, to the House panel.  Joining us now is  Editor-in-Chief of Axios, Nick Johnston, Nick, your reaction to these new  developments and where do we go from here?</p><p>NICHOLAS JOHNSTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AXIOS:  Yes, I think it's really  important to hear the frustration in Chairman Gowdy's voice what he told  Maria, sort of, how angry he was about how they can't find the copy machine  that could underscores the tension here and how these are Republicans on  the Hill are still very much focused on getting this kind of information.  </p><p>And this is a Republican justice department that they'd say hasn't been  doing it fast enough, even the President, as you showed, has been tweeting  that the document turnover hasn't happened fast enough.  I think, the  appointment of this new attorney, to facilitate that, will probably help.   It might make some of these folks on the Hill, a little happier, but this  is still a very important investigatory focus for them, and they're not  going to give up until they get what they want.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nick, how do the midterm elections factor into this, though,  because even though we have a Republican president in the White House, and  Republican leading the justice department as the Attorney General, you look  at Trey Gowdy and the other heads, Devin Nunes, head of the House  Intelligence Committee, really there, the time window is closing on them  just, potentially, if the Democrats retake the House.  How critical is that  timing?</p><p>JOHNSTON:  I think it's a really great point.  A lot of what Republicans  want to accomplish in the House today is set under the guise of what will  happen in the midterms and Republicans are coming from a -- from a place of  the underdogs, I think, in this election, and if they lose the gavels on  these committees, these investigations go away.  So I think, certainly, in  the coming months, if they don't get the documents, this pressure will only  increase because they know they have to finish this by the end of the year.</p><p>CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No, Nick, I think, it's a really  interesting conversation that's been have about whether or not the  Republican hold strategy, is to undermine -- is undermine the DOJ and say  that there's not going to be trust in these institutions that are so  important.  Do you think that's fair for them to criticize or do you think  the Republicans have a fair, you know, have a real beef here?</p><p>JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a really interesting point.  We've done some  pulling on this, in fact, quickly, after the President went after the  (INAUDIBLE) investigation recently, and we saw favorability for the FBI  plunge among Republicans which is something we haven't seen, essentially,  ever, as long as the department had existed.  </p><p>I think it's a very, sort of, dicey area to be, sort of, attacking these  law enforcement agencies the way they ever remember, you know, these are  members of congress.  They have clear investigatory ability to get these  kinds of documents, and you know what?  If they subpoena them, you need to  provide them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to Facebook (INAUDIBLE) send out notifications  today to millions of affected users in this data mining scandal.  This  comes as congressional aides are confirming that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will  hold meetings today on Capitol Hill, with several lawmakers ahead of this  week's hearings.  Take a listen to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  and Senate Judiciary Committee, John Kennedy, both suggesting that things  are about to change at the tech giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  Mark's happy to go to congress because  Mark wants to answer every question people have about the service we  office.  We weren't focused enough and being proactive enough and Mark is  happy to say here's what we weren't doing and here's what we are doing now.</p><p>REP. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  I don't want  to hurt Facebook.  I don't want to regulate them half to death.  But, we  have a problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, our problem.  Meantime, a whistleblower, now warning that  the millions of affected users' data could be stored in Russia, I think  that it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's performance because he's sending  out Sheryl Sandberg in his stead, who clearly loves to tell women how to  lean in, in this country, but when -- this is a very serious issue and I  would argue that her performance, last week, in terms of giving interviews,  was a little light, in terms of really grappling with the seriousness of  it.  </p><p>I point to a New York Post, the front page -- the front page of the post,  on Saturday, we own you, pay us for your privacy, shocking, and then Mark  Zuckerberg, famously, in 2010, was sweating like Richard Nixon, breaking  out on a flop sweat-like none other.  Again, it's just going to be  Zuckerberg sitting there, whether the stocks sold off or not.  </p><p>JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a -- this is the main event here.  All the pre- interviews last week with Sheryl Sandberg (INAUDIBLE) were opening acts.   The real thing here, Zuckerberg is on the Hill -- on the Hill, today,  preparing, tomorrow, 2:30, must-see TV.  Zuckerberg, appearing before this  committee, this is something he's never done before in this kind of  hearing, and he doesn't have any natural allies on his committee.  These  senators on both sides of the aisle are gunning for big tech.  And so, this  hearing is a start of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they really gunning for big tech, though, Nick?  I mean, big  tech is -- you know, when you talk about Silicon Valley and technology, it  is one of the most divided areas, politically, that all of the CEOs have  historically been big givers to Democratic candidates.  Their policies lean  very far left.  There's really not room, you saw with the firing of that  Google employee, not room for conservative thought or speech.  And so, I  just wonder what kind of treatments he gets.  </p><p>JOHNSTON:  I would separate it from that.  What this is, is the final --  the first time congress is really going to ask the questions, are these  tech companies too big and if they know so much about their users and have  they done a good job of explaining to users how much they know.  For a lot  of members of the Hill, this is a mystery to them.  There are no natural  allies for Facebook or rather these big technology companies.  I want to  look to see any friendly questions for Mark, tomorrow, when he's in  congress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We've known, Mike Murphy, that this was going on for years, in  terms of Facebook not protecting user information, whether you're talking  about RapLeaf or Cloud and their way of enforcement was to call up the  company telling them, don't do that anymore.  </p><p>MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's only because this was somehow related to the Trump  campaign that people are now furious and up in arms.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think what Mark Zuckerberg's going to talk about a lot, this  week, is what Facebook used to do, and what they are doing now, to talk  about how the company has shifted, how they're protecting your data, but  you'll know when go on there, Dagen.  You're giving up a lot of your  information.  If you don't want to give that up, you shouldn't be on  Facebook.  They may have a responsibility to not sell it but they -- once  you're on there, that data is there, and they own it, they do, as the cover  said.  </p><p>BRENBERG,:  Do they know what they're doing now?  That's -- you said  they're going to talk about what they're doing.  Now, I think a lot of  people look at this and say, do they know what they're doing now or are  they really just, like, we actually have no idea what's going on and every  single day now, we're seeing new revelations of more, you know,  inappropriate data sharing, customers having their data used in ways that  they didn't know.  I don't think Facebook has a good handle on where they  are.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think this is years ago this is years ago when -- I think it was  2014, the Cambridge Analytica information ended up being given to the  improper parties.  So, I think, Facebook today, 2018, versus four years  ago, is a vastly different company, it has run differently.  So, I think  that's what they want to underline, is how they are now doing their best to  potentially protect their data the best possible.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  I think they're going to have you lift, kind of, show that, I  really do.  I don't think people think it's changed that much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They knew that data, back in 2015, had been improperly accessed  and they basically said, don't, you know, do away.  Get rid of it, Nick,  final word, real quick.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  I think the key thing here is a lot of people who are, sort of,  really into this issue know about how much Facebook has.  This is the first  time members of congress will learn how big that is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And let's hope that they bone up in advance of this, because we  know how this can go, if they're really not sure of the questions they are  asking.  But, again, WilmerHale, the law firm given Mark Zuckerberg some  prep in advance to that, the Wall Street Journal reported that today.   Nick, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSTON:  Always.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Nick Johnston of Axios.  </p><p>JOHNSTON:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, hackers hit Iran with the cryptic warning, including  an image of the American Flag and a message, don't mess with our elections,  details on that.  An intergalactic debut, the new Solo, a Star Wars story  trailer, finally out.  We'll give you a peek.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Iran hit hard by a global cyberattack with a strong message.   Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, they did, Dagen.  Hackers targeting networks on a number of  countries including data centers in Iran.  The hackers let the image of an  American flag on screen, saying \"don't mess with our elections\".  The  Iranian government says, about 3500 -- across that country.  </p><p>Well, a deal in the pharmaceutical industry to tell you about -- Novartis  is buying the AveXis, the price tag, nearly $9 billion.  The deal is a bet  that at least one promising drug that AveXis is developing to treat spinal  muscular atrophy will turn into a blockbuster drug.  Shares of Novartis are  higher in the premarket, up more than one and quarter percent; AveXis  shares are sharply higher as well. </p><p>Well, this is interesting -- one rapper on YouTube, drew some inspiration  from a kind of unusual place while rhyming to the tune of Migos song \"Walk  it, Talk it\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of them are dreaming like that (INAUDIBLE), but  that (INAUDIBLE) when the bottle some are fairly some are not.  Let them  (INAUDIBLE) on the table when they get under the chair.  But that bump on  the sofa when I wish she wasn't there.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  So, you get it when you start watching it, right?  This went  viral.  And instead of \"Walk it, Talk it\", the YouTuber was rapper \"walk it  in my pocket\" but in the Migos style of rapping.  It racks up over a  million views on YouTube.  So, I guess -- I don't know what's next, cat in  the hat?  Cinderella?  Green eggs and ham?  Bring it on!  </p><p>MURPHY:  I've had enough for 15 years.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, you've been doing -- did you rap Dr. Seuss, Theodore Geisel,  for your kids?  </p><p>MURPHY:  For 15 years, straight, for every one of mine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give me some green eggs and ham.  I want to hear it now.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's on my YouTube channel.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You give us some green eggs and ham?</p><p>MURPHY:  No.</p><p>CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) like, when we first heard about this, is this the  children that, you know -- like, no, this is a wrapper.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Wrapper, Migos.  Yes!  </p><p>CARTER:  You're all in.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  This is how dads keep their kids engaged.  I mean, you're  reading your book, you've got do something like that.  You can't just read  the book; you got to rap, you got to sing it.  </p><p>CARTER:  You rap your books?</p><p>BRENBERG:  I do something, maybe like an accent.  You know, you got to do  something to make it, and your kids are just to get bored and whatever.   It's a hard job, right?  </p><p>MURPHY:  This is iconic, and you kind of bring it to 2018, I think it needs  a little hip-hop in there, totally.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will not eat green eggs and ham?</p><p>MURPHY:  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give me the next one.</p><p>MURPHY:  Sam, I am.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, \"A Quiet Place\" making a big noise.  The thriller is  a big win by actors turned director, Emily Blunt and John Krisinski.  A box  office recap, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Another record-breaking weekend at the box office.  Lauren  Simonetti has more details.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Good morning, happy Monday.  This is the time we  talk about what was a hit over the weekend.  So, let's give you the list.   In first place, \"A Quiet Place\".  A surprise $50 million opening for this  horror film -- and we're going to talk more about it in a second; let's get  through the rest of the list.  Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", 25  million in the second week; \"Blockers\", 21 million; \"Black Panther\", took  the fourth-place spot, only $8 million this weekend but if you look at what  \"Black Panther\" has done to date, it has unseated \"Titanic\".  So, if you  look at total domestic growth, for this movie, $665 million.  There it is,  number three of all time.  \"The Force Awakens\", number one; \"Avatar\",  number two; and \"Titanic\", now number four.  </p><p>Let's go back to \"A Quiet Place\".  This is a movie that cost $17 million to  make; $50 million in its opening weekend.  So, it was written and directed  by -- of office fame, John Krisinki and his wife Emily Blunt starred, but  it's basically a \"A Quiet Place\" -- there's no dialogue in the movie, and  it's a huge win for Paramount who needed a big hit after about two years of  not having a hit.  So, there you have it.  We're liking horror at the box  office.  And they got the trailer for the new \"Star Wars\".</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you got, Lauren?  Show me.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let's watch it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard about a job.  A big shot gangster putting  together a crew.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a driver.  I'm a flyer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've waited a long time for a shot like this.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is he saying?  No, what do you know?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got a line on a ship?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It hit theaters on the 25th of May.  See, it's the young Han  Solo.  Do we want to see the --</p><p>BRENBERG:  That's a lot of -- it's a lot of pressure to play the young Han  Solo.  He's such a great character.  I think the chances of failing are  really high here.  I'm excited to see.  It looks good in the trailer, but  that's a tough role, right?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Agreed.  </p><p>CARTER:  I like the original \"Star Wars\", I'm not into it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's disconnected.  It's another one of the -- I think this one  takes place before the first one, in 1977.  </p><p>MURHPY:  That tease makes -- while they're getting 600 and 700 million at  the box office, you can count and see more and more \"Star Wars\" prequel,  sequels, whatever.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  You're going to see Han Solo as a 5-year-old at some point --</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes --</p><p>BRENBERG:  I'm not looking forward to that one.</p><p>CARTER:  If I like something or not, it's pretty much a not a good  indicator about whether or not it's going to perform well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called monetizing the franchise, just like Disney bought it  in the first place.  And so, they've done a pretty good job.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's almost like one a year, right?  There's been like one  \"Star Wars\".</p><p>BRENBERG:  One from the regular series, one of the, kind of the, in between  --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In between.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes, every single year for the next 20 years, at least, right? </p><p>SIMONETTI:  They get some new characters in this one.  And we'll see what  the appetite is for a young Han Solo.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You only need to know one word -- Chewbacca.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Makes an appearance in one of trailers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And his age?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  190 -- in the film.</p><p>MURHPY:  (INAUDIBLE) like a long time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  They sure do.</p><p>CARTER:  I hope that's a good indicator.  My dog just looks like him.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I wish our dogs are the same.  Kevin -- someone who looks like  him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Her dog is named Kevin, just to clear that up.  She has two  dogs.  Lauren, thank you so much.  And Lauren is having a baby.  Can you  reveal the name while we're staying here?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.  And we're not sharing  names only because I don't care what anybody has to say about them anymore.   Not a name.  Not talking anymore suggestion,</p><p>BRENBERG:  You don't need it, but yes, forget about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Don't want your input.  Thank you very much.  But you can still  guess if it's boy or girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can segue from Han Solo to Lauren and her impending delivery.   Still ahead, gas prices said to hit their higher level in years this  summer.  We have all the details for you, next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Crisis in Syria;  yet another suspected chemical weapon attacked, leaving dozens dead.  The  international community on high alert.  As the world waits for U.S.  response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.  Despite the  tensions, stocks reporting to a higher open, bouncing back 160-point on the  Dow Futures right now after concerns over a trade war with China, seem to  ease a bit -- you see the gains there.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, great to see you as always.  And great to see all of you.   I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, April 9th.  Your  top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Crisis in Syria, yet another suspected chemical weapons attack leaving  dozens dead, the international community on high alert.  As the world waits  for a U.S. response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TOM BOSSERT, WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISOR:  I wouldn't take  anything off the table, these are horrible photos, we're looking into the  attack at this point.  I think the president's got a point that's been very  clear and I'm going to reiterate that point.  The pendulum has swung in the  wrong direction for too long and the United States of America has been  taken advantage of in their responsibility to provide security for the  entire world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Despite the tension, stocks are pointing to a bounce back as  concerns over a trade war with China eased a little bit, maybe it was the  Sunday morning talk show's rhetoric being thrown out by the White House.</p><p> Futures are showing this, 172 point gain on the DOW Futures right now, it's  losing week for the Blue Chips last week.  This comes after that massive  selloff on Friday with the DOW, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P all falling more than two  percent.</p><p> In Europe, you have some buying to report, the England, France, and  Germany, we have gains across the board.  In Asia overnight, stocks also  moving higher.  The biggest winner there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p> Zuckerberg taking the Hill, Facebook CEO set to meet with lawmakers in  Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the Senate  tomorrow.  The latest as the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says more  people's data could have been exposed.</p><p> And a change at the top, Deutsche Bank naming a new CEO, the details as  shares jumped on the news.</p><p> And terrifying moments on a New York highway, a tour bus slamming into an  overpass leaving six people seriously injured, more on their condition  ahead.</p><p> And the DOJ stonewalling, why Congress Trey Gowdy is calling out the  Justice Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses. </p><p> And orange going to love this, Bud Light going citrus for the summer, the  new flavor hitting store shelves coming up.  I think that's called a summer  shandy.  </p><p> All of that and so much more this morning, Pollster Maslansky and Partners  President, Lee Carter.  Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.   And the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian Brenberg.  </p><p> I start with you, markets this week, we get bank earnings, worries about a  trade war but, again, now geopolitical concerns that the focusing shifted  to that.</p><p> BRIAN BRENBERG, KING'S COLLEGE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR:  Yes.   Yes, it has.  Although it's interesting to watch these back and forth with  the trade wars.  You get some rhetoric out of the White House, we -- the  talk on Thursday night, Friday morning stocks (INAUDIBLE) over the weekend,  everybody's out there talking about how this is not a big deal, we don't  want a trade war, you come back Monday morning, stocks up again.</p><p> We're seeing this pattern repeat again and again.  It seems to take a day  or two for markets to digest that you've got rhetoric and you've got  reality on trade and the reality probably isn't going to be as bad or as  harsh as a rhetoric sounds.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike, what are you watching this week?</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO, MANAGING PARTNER:  Absolutely.  So watching the  volatility in the market, that's really spurn -- spurred by this trade war  talk.  And I think just a few months ago we were talking about there's no  volatility in the market.</p><p> We haven't had a one percent move in so many months.  Well now you're  getting two percent move almost on a daily basis.  I think the main thing  for investors to do here is to try to block out the headlines and stick  with their long-term plans.  So we're going to get the down 500s, the  bounces above 200s.  Overall, there's not going to be a major trade war  with China in my opinion, it will back to focus on the U.S. economy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think some of the White House officials needs some messaging  help because you've got Secretary MNuchin on Friday talking about the  potential of a trade war and then trying to walk back those comments  yesterday saying, \"I don't expect it at all in terms of a trade war.\"   Don't have your Treasury Secretary utter the words trade war ever.</p><p> LEE CARTER, POLLSTER AND MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS PRESIDENT:  That would be a  good first step.  But I think it's fascinating to see how the markets are  reacting so much to the rhetoric rather than just the policy.</p><p> It's unbelievable, a tweet, one announcement can send the markets in a  tailspin.  And what's happened traditionally is that we've looked at the  experts and say, \"What are we really supposed to be looking at?\"  One  tweet, one message, one interview can totally change the course of the  markets and we're seeing that this week and certainly the White House  rhetoric tone way back saying this has always been -- there's nothing new  here, nothing's developed here, not a trade war and look, things are  softening again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I'm looking forward to Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill.   Again, Facebook will reveal today to Facebook users whose data was accessed  by Cambridge Analytica, it's about 70 million people.  Estimates are in the  United States alone.</p><p> And watch Mark Zuckerberg because back in 2010, he broke out into a  Nixonian flop sweat when Walt Mossberg was interviewing him.  And I mean  sweat was dripping off of his face.  </p><p> CARTER:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So if you do that on Capitol Hill, watch your stock tank.</p><p> BRENBERG:  His appearances are always so staged managed.  This one  absolutely cannot be.  And so it's going to be interesting to see what he  does under that kind of pressure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're trying to get the video but he had sweat dripping off his  nose and his chin.  I'm not kidding.  It's --</p><p> CARTER:  This is not where he's comfortable.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  That was -- that was back in the days of the hoodie  sweatshirt.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So you're saying he was hot.</p><p> MURPHY:  So he's come a long way.</p><p> CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) t-shirt.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He was -- he was just hot.  OK.  We're going to talk about that  all morning.  Also coming up, New York Congressman Chris Collins, South  Dakota Senator Mike Rounds.  Host of Michelle Malkin Investigates on  CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin.  FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  And Legendary Soulman, my friend, Sam Moore.  You don't want  to miss any of them.  </p><p> Our top story this morning, crossing the red line, the world awaiting the  U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed  dozens of citizens.  Yesterday, warplanes bombing an airbase near the City  of Homs.  Russia and Syria have accused Israel of that strike.  Meantime,  President Trump sending a strong warning to the Assad Regime he tweeted  this, \"Many dead including women and children, in mindless chemical attack  in Syria.  Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army,  making it completely inaccessible to the outside world.  President Putin,  Russia, and Iran are responsible for backing animal Assad, big price to  pay.  Open area immediately for medical help and verification.  Another  humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever, sick.\"</p><p> Joining us now is -- this morning is former Commander of the USS Cole, Kirk  Lippold.  Commander, how do you -- what should the U.S. do to respond?  And  I should point out that we used that phrase red line that was famously a  phrase used by President Obama back in 2010.  Assad and Syria crossed that  red line and we didn't do anything or we didn't attack.  What should we do  now?</p><p> COMMANDER KIRK S. LIPPOLD (RET), FORMER USS COLE COMMANDER:  Good morning  Dagen.  I think the first thing we need to do is verify through  intelligence channels that in fact took place who carried it out, where it  was launched from, what was used to do it? </p><p> And then at that point, we take a step back, put together the military  forces, and then decide whether we're going to react in a manner that is  going to take away that capability not like we did last time with the  Tomahawk missiles.  But this time, on a more permanent basis and with the  backing of the Security Council hopefully at the U.N.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well Commander, you brought that up, so there was one -- it was  a sarin gas attack last year, a one-time strike by the United States on a  Syrian airbase.  Why haven't we done more since then?  There was a chlorine  gas attack this past January which was the State Department and Rex  Tillerson, then the Secretary of State basically attacked in a statement.   But why haven't we done more to maybe take out all of Assad's air force,  the entire air force?  </p><p> LIPPOLD:  Well, I think Dagen you have to look at it, what is going to be  our engagement?  What is the end state we want to have there?  Assad is  going to continue to exist as the president of Syria because the Russians  are backing him, they now have the Iranians that are also providing  technical knowledge and an ability to also establish their own basis there  which Israel is not going to tolerate, which probably drove the attack into  the T4 or Tiyas Airbase last night.</p><p> But we have to take a look and say, \"OK, do we want to be the world's  leader in this case where a low level attacks have occurred using chemical  weapons?\"  This was absolutely a much larger scale one, it shows that  they're taking out one of the last strongholds of the Syrians rebels.  At  this point, we need to say, \"No, you either go for it conventionally or we  will take out that capability.\"  And if it does mean that we take out the  Syrian air force, then we better be prepared for a little bit longer  investment in time being in Syria with our forces despite what the  president has said.</p><p> MURPHY:  Commander, it's Mike Murphy.  I love your opinion on the timing of  this of attack because do you think it has to do with the fact that  President Trump is fighting on many different fronts?  We have North Korea,  we have the issues here in the U.S., Russia.  You think Syria and Putin got  together and said, \"Maybe this is a good time to test the president's  medal?\"</p><p> LIPPOLD:  I don't think it was timing for that.  I think that the president  is going to react to it and how he reacts.  I think once again,  internationally bent will drive the decision-making process for the U.S.  government as it always should especially where military force is involved.</p><p> I don't think this is going to be a tail-wagging, dog-type scenario, I  think in fact we need to look at it and say what are our national security  interest there?  What is the end state we want to achieve?  And if taking  out the Syrian air force to send a signal to do that turns out to be the  best option for us, then we execute it efficiently, ruthlessly, and with  overwhelming force.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Brian, and I'll let you get in here but the timing, it does beg  the question of this attack comes at -- right after President Trump says  that we can't wait to get out of Syria, that we -- that -- but, again, he  focus on ISIS and we see the threat to the Syrian people and children in  the Assad Regime.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Yes, absolutely.  And the other timing issue that I'd like to  ask you about Commander is you have the entrance this week now of John  Bolton into the National Security Advisor role, that has to change things a  little bit.</p><p> He's been critical of these one-off strikes, do we see the tide shift to a  more permanent comprehensive approach here with Ambassador Bolton moving  into that role?</p><p> LIPPOLD:  Professor, that's a great question.  And I think what you're  going to see is Ambassador Bolton is now the National Security Advisor, not  the executer but the advisor is going to say we need a much more  comprehensive plan.  We need a long range view.  We need goals that we want  to achieve for our national security objectives.</p><p> And he is going to take a more holistic approach into the execution of  national security policy across the board.  So I think that you're going to  see a little bit more robust policy, I think you will see one with more  defined objectives in there, and I think you will see one that will be  executed in fairly short order because he is a decisive individual and he's  going to recommend that to the president who obviously brought him in  because he was a little frustrated that he was being held back in some of  the execution of our policies.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The president did tweet because I mentioned the red line at the  beginning, \"If President Obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand,  the Syrian disaster would have ended a long -- long ago.  Animal Assad  would have been history.\"</p><p> Maria spoke with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, Michael McCaul  yesterday and he agrees with the president.  Listen to this Commander.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX) HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  There  has to be a consequence to this.  And I think the president's absolutely  right is that President Obama drew the red line, the red line was crossed,  he did nothing.</p><p> And then he negotiate through John Kerry the settlement, this weapons  convention.  I remember John Kerry saying, \"We took all their chemical  weapons away.\"  Obviously not.  They still have this.  And I also blame  Russia and Iran, I think they're complicit with this as well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Commander, I want to get your response to that.  But as I  mentioned earlier, we had that one-time airstrike last April but since  then, there has been a chlorine gas attack that killed 20, mostly children,  that happened in January, there was a statement from the State Department  then but no enforcement.  And Assad certainly knows that he would pay no  price and now this, final thought.</p><p> LIPPOLD:  I think you're absolutely right.  There has to be consequences  for this action.  While there was a red line drawn and unfortunately we did  not react to the red line when Syria crossed it.  We did in fact have one  positive development and that was getting rid of the vast majority of  chemical weapons in there.</p><p> Had we attacked immediately, I doubt we would have ever gotten to that  point with an agreement working with the Russians to make that happen.   That is a positive thing to look at it.  But nonetheless, if you draw a  line as a state actor especially the United States, you have to hold it,  enforce it, and do not waiver on it.  And in doing that, it embolden  people, the one-off strike, that's clearly going to be a test now whether  we react to this in a manner that is much stronger, much more overwhelming  and sends a signal, we will not tolerate this.  </p><p> By the same token, going to Russia and Iran and saying, you're complicit in  this, you have contributed to it, you have created the conditions that  allowed it to happen, you must not do that anymore and there will be  consequences and if your folks happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong  time, that is not our responsibility, it's your decision to put them there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kirk, thank you so much.  Kirk Lippold.  Commander, be well.   Thank you for being here.</p><p> LIPPOLD:  Thank you Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news, President Trump just tweeting, \"When a car is  sent to the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12  percent.  When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a  tariff to be paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.   No, it sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p> Coming up, on the hot seat, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in Washington  today ahead of two intense days of questioning on Capitol Hill.  This comes  as the company had set to alert millions of users if their data was shared.  </p><p> And tired of being patient?  Congress Trey Gowdy calling out the Justice  Department over the investigation into alleged FISA abuses.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  New week, new energy for Wall Street, DOW Futures right now are  showing gains across the board, 167 point gain on the DOW Futures right now  after what was a bruising week.  Again, cooler heads prevailing I suppose  when it comes to trade war talk.  We'll see what comes out of the  administration in the coming days.  We're also watching the beginning of  earning season this week.</p><p> Meantime, at least six teenagers from New York severely injured after a  charter bus crashed.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, that's right Dagen.  The bus packed with high school students  returning from a spring break trip to Europe hit an overpass on Long Island  last night.  The impact was so strong, it tore the roof off the bus.  This  happened on the southern state parkway which restricts travel by commercial  vehicles.  Police say the driver did not seem to be familiar with that  restriction.</p><p> Well, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joining thousands at a vigil  honoring the junior hockey team involved in a tragic bus accident on  Friday.  The team president speaking to the crowd packed into the humble  Broncos Arena.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEVIN GARINGER, HUMBOLDT BRONCOS PRESIDENT:  We will find strength in one  another.  Today and for every day forward, we are all Humboldt Broncos and  we will be forever Humboldt Broncos strong.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Fifteen people are now dead after that team's bus collided with a  tractor trailer.  Among those killed were the team's head coach, the driver  of the bus, and several players.  While the community in Saskatchewan tries  to cope, support has been overwhelming.  A victims fund for the Broncos has  already exceeded $4.5 million.</p><p> Well Deutsche Bank is replacing its CEO.  John Cryan is out and Christian  Sewing is taking over.  Sewing is a 47-year-old executive who's worked for  Deutsche Bank for nearly three decades.  Germany's biggest bank has been  struggling since the 2008 financial crisis.  Analysts say the change could  signal a potential merger with another European bank.  Shares of Deutsche  Bank much higher in the premarket, up over three and a half percent right  now.  </p><p> And then finally there's this, Anheuser-Busch unveiling a new flavor of  beer, Bud Light Orange.  It is a light lagger that is brewed usually actual  peels from oranges.  The company says that you will, \"taste the citrusy  goodness.\"  Bud Light Orange available for a limited time for, yes, the  summer.  Shares of Anheuser-Busch are down about three percent so far this  year.</p><p> Dagen, if you ever put an orange in a beer like an orange slice, makes  sense.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What you do with a Hefeweizen, wheat beer. </p><p> CASONE:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I have a question, is this a shandy?</p><p> BRENBERG:  It sounds like it.  I don't like any of these kinds of beer.  It  sounds like a shandy, so I'm negative on it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Shandy is tip -- do you know shandies?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't know shandy but I know this is like Budweiser and Fanta  mixed together, I don't like it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That actually sounds delicious.</p><p> CARTER:  I know, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  People tweet us, I think a shandy is the -- defined by, it is  like a juice or some fruit flavor or like soda in a beer.  Like, again, the  Leinenkugel's summer shandy is quite delicious on a hot day on the golf  course.</p><p> BRENBERG:  I think beer goes well with beer and nothing else.  So I  wouldn't put any of those stuff, no peels, no nothing.</p><p> CARTER:  My guess is you're not the target audience.  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BRENBERG:  I don't think I am.  I don't think I am.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Novartis as closed at $8.7 billion deal for a gene  therapy company in the Midwest.  Details on how the acquisition could boost  the Swiss pharma giant's cancer innovations.</p><p> And Black Panther sailing past Titanic into the history books, another  record shattering weekend for the Marvel movie.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Markets looking to start the new week with some gains, 178 point  gain on the DOW Futures right now as concerns over a trade war with China  ease a little bit.  White House officials helping camp down those fears on  the Sunday shows yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Just technically, we  have taken no action.  It's a long process, there's several months here, so  far no tariffs and no action has been enacted.</p><p> STEPHEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I don't expect there will be a  trade war, it could be but I don't expect it at all.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting this morning, \" When a car is sent to  the United States from China, there is a tariff to be paid of 2.12 percent.   When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a tariff to be  paid of 25 percent.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No, it  sounds like stupid trade going on for years.\"</p><p> Joining me now is Investmark Advisory Group Principal, Michael Lee.  Mike,  what's going to keep these trade concerns in the background for investors,  the start of earnings potentially?</p><p> MICHAEL LEE, INVESTMARK ADVISORY GROUP PRINCIPAL:  I think this is going to  be one of the best earning seasons we've ever had, right?  Not only from  the actually result but we got to remember that earnings are a forward- looking tool and that's what matters -- I'm sorry, stocks are forward- looking tool.</p><p> So what earnings are going to look like for the rest of the year and then  going out to 2019 when we start talking about 2019, I think a lot of people  are going to sit back and say, \"Well you know what, stocks are actually  really cheap, they're not expensive.\"  We're looking at one of the kind of  the greatest growth periods we're going to see in our lifetimes, so.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But what if we do get into a back and forth, a tit-for-tat with  China.  Again, you heard from Larry Kudlow and Secretary of the Treasury,  Steve MNuchin, they're trying to like wipe away some of the fears.</p><p> Like, \"Oh, this might not happen.\"  But, again, I just wish some of those  guys would call people I grew up with, hog farmers, and people who grow  soybeans that that impacts the real American economy, that's what the  market is reflecting that the economy might not be growing as fast and  earnings might not be growing as fast.  And it's Boeing and Caterpillar  last week.</p><p> LEE:  So a couple of things, right?  If you run a small business and your  cost are going to go up 20 or 25 or 30 percent based on some tariff like  this, this could be terrifying for you.  However, on a larger scale, what  can China really do to us if that they're not already doing?</p><p> What, are they going to steal our intellectual property?  I mean, the trade  imbalance from China or trade deficit, we're annualizing at just under $400  billion a share, OK?  That is a much larger portion of their GDP than the  $150 billion to $170 billion that we export to them every year.  Again,  problems for people whose (INAUDIBLE) cost are going to go up.</p><p> Our economy as a whole can withstand a trade war much easier than they can.   The standard of living in China is no one near as high as they make it out  to be.  So if China were to -- if China gets into a trade war with us,  chances are they'll go into recession.  If they go into recession, there's  a good probability of a popular uprising.  So that could -- the only way  that the Chinese government could go out of power is by a recession.</p><p> So the government props up their economy, it's held together with duct tape  and elbow grease.  So it's -- look, I -- it's -- I'm saying this but people  much smarter than me and much more powerful than me know this.  So what  we're seeing is a lot of posturing.  So I don't -- any selloff because of  trade war fears I think is a good buying opportunity.</p><p> MURPHY:  Totally agree completely on that because I think what you're  seeing in the market though is you get these headlines and you're getting  this big whip sauce back and forth and I think that's fine for the  professional traders.  But for the people at home, they could really get  hurt in trading this type of market.</p><p> I believe a lot of those whip sauce have to do with computerize trading,  with the algorithm of trading.  So they're pulling headlines and then  you're seeing these big drops in the market or these big rallies in the  market.  And I think it's important for -- and I love your take on that, a  huge portion of the volume out there in a day-to-day basis is computerized.   So individual people at home can really get hurt trying to get in front of  that.</p><p> LEE:  I would say for people over the last couple of years of markets is  too high, the market is too high.  Well you know what, every time you see  an ugly tweet or an ugly headline or Stormy Daniels or something, the  market's going to selloff.  Here's your opportunity to take some of that  cash and buy some stocks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The market, do I have hope it doesn't selloff on Stormy Daniels.   But go ahead.  I hope investors are smarter than that or the computer.</p><p> LEE:  If you start drilling down and looking at the U.S. economy, a durable  goods are up year-over-year, almost nine percent, that's the highest number  since the early 2000.  You look at manufacturing is doing the best since  the early 2000s.  </p><p> Non-ISM manufacturing is the highest level it's been in 20 years.  You look  at the job market, weekly javas claims have been below 300,000 for almost  three years.  Longest period in almost the history of the entire United  States.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, earnings.  Earnings season starts this week, J.P.  Morgan kind of the big one coming out on Friday, what do you expect overall  growth for the quarter 17 percent but J.P. Morgan expected to put up even  better numbers (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> LEE: You know, what I'm going to be looking for is the forward guidance.   What's dragged a lot of these banks back particularly is sales of trading.   And now with the return of volatility, I think sales and trading has kind  of been the (INAUDIBLE) as you look at all the different business units in  all these banks.</p><p> It's going to start to get better and then with the banks, as rates are  going higher, their net interest margins are going to expand.  As net  interest margins are going to expand, banks are going to make a lot more  money in their wallets.  And let's face it, 10 years ago when the banks  were in their hay days they were trading shops, now they get back to being  traditional lenders.  </p><p> So when you were -- when you have a $1 trillion of loans out there, you  make an extra 25 basis points on each loan, it's a lot of money, right?  So  -- I mean, the forward guidance is what I'm looking at and as the  conversation switches from 2018 earnings to 2019 earnings I think people  are going to say, \"Wow, stocks are really, really cheap.  Something's going  on here, like the market's going much higher.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Michael Lee, thank you sir.  Good to see you.  Come back soon.</p><p> LEE:  Thanks very much guys.  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, facing the music, Facebook CEO is set to meet with  lawmakers in Washington today as he prepares to face a grilling before the  Senate and then the House tomorrow and Wednesday.  Hear from a  whistleblower about the data reveal, the reckless handling of your personal  information, let's call it that.</p><p> And Dr. Seuss has bumped into a new beat, the Migos remix, \"There's a  Wocket in My Pocket,\" you've got to hear to believe.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Easing concerns  over a trade war, sparking a rally on Wall Street, Futures are showing  gains across the board, 176-point gain on the Dow Futures, this after that  sharp selloff on Friday.  </p><p> The major market gauges all down more than two percent, again, a little bit  of a disappointing job's number.  The chief of the feds speaking and then  trade war worries.  In Europe, the market is hovering near the flat line  this morning.  We still have gains across the board in England, France and  Germany, and in Asia overnight, stocks moving up from Shanghai to the KOSPI  in South Korea.  </p><p>Facebook, under fire, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gearing up for his trip to  Capitol Hill, where he will be grilled over the company's privacy  practices.  What to expect from the congressional hearings, ahead.  Calling  for action, House Oversight Committee Chairman, Trey Gowdy, says the  justice department is stonewalling when it comes to handing over documents  tied to the FISA and Hillary Clinton investigations.  Here's what he told  Maria on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  I want to be  able to support the FBI and the DOJ, but the world's premier law- enforcement agency can't seem to operate a damn copying machine.  That is  inexplicable.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have the very latest, a strong message for Iran, hackers  attacking the country's network, leaving an image of the American flag.   Warning, don't mess with our elections.  A little bit of a merger Monday on  Wall Street, Novartis is getting big on gene therapy with its latest  acquisition.  </p><p> And a not so quite start for the box office for A Quiet Place, the horror  film soaring passed expectations.  We have the full box office recap,  ahead, plus, a whole new tune for Dr. Seuss' Wocket in my Pocket, a rap of  the childhood classic, going viral.  </p><p> To our top story this half hour, the clock, ticking on the DOJ, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, now, asking  Federal Prosecutor John Lausch to help speed up the response to GOP demands  for documents related to the surveillance of former Trump Campaign Advisor,  Carter Page.  The firing of Andrew McCabe from the FBI and the  investigation into Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server, the request,  coming after President Trump took to Twitter this weekend, to slam the DOJ  and FBI, writing, what does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?  </p><p> Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents, unredacted, to the  House Judiciary Committee?  Stalling, but for what reason?  Not looking  good.  House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who has been leading  the charge, sounded off, yesterday, on Sunday Morning Futures.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOWDY:  I have not seen a clean version and I need to know what's behind  those black lines because it's really important how this investigation  began, when it began and what is the -- what is the weight, what is the  credibility of the evidence upon which this investigation was launched?   And the Department of Justice and the FBI have that document, they won't  let us see the clean version, and I'm struggling to understand why.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This all comes as the DOJ promises to turn over an additional  3600 pages from the FBI today, to the House panel.  Joining us now is  Editor-in-Chief of Axios, Nick Johnston, Nick, your reaction to these new  developments and where do we go from here?</p><p> NICHOLAS JOHNSTON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AXIOS:  Yes, I think it's really  important to hear the frustration in Chairman Gowdy's voice what he told  Maria, sort of, how angry he was about how they can't find the copy machine  that could underscores the tension here and how these are Republicans on  the Hill are still very much focused on getting this kind of information.  </p><p> And this is a Republican justice department that they'd say hasn't been  doing it fast enough, even the President, as you showed, has been tweeting  that the document turnover hasn't happened fast enough.  I think, the  appointment of this new attorney, to facilitate that, will probably help.   It might make some of these folks on the Hill, a little happier, but this  is still a very important investigatory focus for them, and they're not  going to give up until they get what they want.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nick, how do the midterm elections factor into this, though,  because even though we have a Republican president in the White House, and  Republican leading the justice department as the Attorney General, you look  at Trey Gowdy and the other heads, Devin Nunes, head of the House  Intelligence Committee, really there, the time window is closing on them  just, potentially, if the Democrats retake the House.  How critical is that  timing?</p><p> JOHNSTON:  I think it's a really great point.  A lot of what Republicans  want to accomplish in the House today is set under the guise of what will  happen in the midterms and Republicans are coming from a -- from a place of  the underdogs, I think, in this election, and if they lose the gavels on  these committees, these investigations go away.  So I think, certainly, in  the coming months, if they don't get the documents, this pressure will only  increase because they know they have to finish this by the end of the year.</p><p> CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No, Nick, I think, it's a really  interesting conversation that's been have about whether or not the  Republican hold strategy, is to undermine -- is undermine the DOJ and say  that there's not going to be trust in these institutions that are so  important.  Do you think that's fair for them to criticize or do you think  the Republicans have a fair, you know, have a real beef here?</p><p> JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a really interesting point.  We've done some  pulling on this, in fact, quickly, after the President went after the  (INAUDIBLE) investigation recently, and we saw favorability for the FBI  plunge among Republicans which is something we haven't seen, essentially,  ever, as long as the department had existed.  </p><p> I think it's a very, sort of, dicey area to be, sort of, attacking these  law enforcement agencies the way they ever remember, you know, these are  members of congress.  They have clear investigatory ability to get these  kinds of documents, and you know what?  If they subpoena them, you need to  provide them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to Facebook (INAUDIBLE) send out notifications  today to millions of affected users in this data mining scandal.  This  comes as congressional aides are confirming that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will  hold meetings today on Capitol Hill, with several lawmakers ahead of this  week's hearings.  Take a listen to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  and Senate Judiciary Committee, John Kennedy, both suggesting that things  are about to change at the tech giant.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  Mark's happy to go to congress because  Mark wants to answer every question people have about the service we  office.  We weren't focused enough and being proactive enough and Mark is  happy to say here's what we weren't doing and here's what we are doing now.</p><p> REP. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  I don't want  to hurt Facebook.  I don't want to regulate them half to death.  But, we  have a problem.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, our problem.  Meantime, a whistleblower, now warning that  the millions of affected users' data could be stored in Russia, I think  that it's going to be Mark Zuckerberg's performance because he's sending  out Sheryl Sandberg in his stead, who clearly loves to tell women how to  lean in, in this country, but when -- this is a very serious issue and I  would argue that her performance, last week, in terms of giving interviews,  was a little light, in terms of really grappling with the seriousness of  it.  </p><p> I point to a New York Post, the front page -- the front page of the post,  on Saturday, we own you, pay us for your privacy, shocking, and then Mark  Zuckerberg, famously, in 2010, was sweating like Richard Nixon, breaking  out on a flop sweat-like none other.  Again, it's just going to be  Zuckerberg sitting there, whether the stocks sold off or not.  </p><p> JOHNSTON:  Right.  This is a -- this is the main event here.  All the pre- interviews last week with Sheryl Sandberg (INAUDIBLE) were opening acts.   The real thing here, Zuckerberg is on the Hill -- on the Hill, today,  preparing, tomorrow, 2:30, must-see TV.  Zuckerberg, appearing before this  committee, this is something he's never done before in this kind of  hearing, and he doesn't have any natural allies on his committee.  These  senators on both sides of the aisle are gunning for big tech.  And so, this  hearing is a start of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are they really gunning for big tech, though, Nick?  I mean, big  tech is -- you know, when you talk about Silicon Valley and technology, it  is one of the most divided areas, politically, that all of the CEOs have  historically been big givers to Democratic candidates.  Their policies lean  very far left.  There's really not room, you saw with the firing of that  Google employee, not room for conservative thought or speech.  And so, I  just wonder what kind of treatments he gets.  </p><p> JOHNSTON:  I would separate it from that.  What this is, is the final --  the first time congress is really going to ask the questions, are these  tech companies too big and if they know so much about their users and have  they done a good job of explaining to users how much they know.  For a lot  of members of the Hill, this is a mystery to them.  There are no natural  allies for Facebook or rather these big technology companies.  I want to  look to see any friendly questions for Mark, tomorrow, when he's in  congress.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We've known, Mike Murphy, that this was going on for years, in  terms of Facebook not protecting user information, whether you're talking  about RapLeaf or Cloud and their way of enforcement was to call up the  company telling them, don't do that anymore.  </p><p> MICHAEL MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's only because this was somehow related to the Trump  campaign that people are now furious and up in arms.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think what Mark Zuckerberg's going to talk about a lot, this  week, is what Facebook used to do, and what they are doing now, to talk  about how the company has shifted, how they're protecting your data, but  you'll know when go on there, Dagen.  You're giving up a lot of your  information.  If you don't want to give that up, you shouldn't be on  Facebook.  They may have a responsibility to not sell it but they -- once  you're on there, that data is there, and they own it, they do, as the cover  said.  </p><p> BRENBERG,:  Do they know what they're doing now?  That's -- you said  they're going to talk about what they're doing.  Now, I think a lot of  people look at this and say, do they know what they're doing now or are  they really just, like, we actually have no idea what's going on and every  single day now, we're seeing new revelations of more, you know,  inappropriate data sharing, customers having their data used in ways that  they didn't know.  I don't think Facebook has a good handle on where they  are.  </p><p> MURPHY:  I think this is years ago this is years ago when -- I think it was  2014, the Cambridge Analytica information ended up being given to the  improper parties.  So, I think, Facebook today, 2018, versus four years  ago, is a vastly different company, it has run differently.  So, I think  that's what they want to underline, is how they are now doing their best to  potentially protect their data the best possible.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  I think they're going to have you lift, kind of, show that, I  really do.  I don't think people think it's changed that much.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They knew that data, back in 2015, had been improperly accessed  and they basically said, don't, you know, do away.  Get rid of it, Nick,  final word, real quick.</p><p> JOHNSTON:  I think the key thing here is a lot of people who are, sort of,  really into this issue know about how much Facebook has.  This is the first  time members of congress will learn how big that is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And let's hope that they bone up in advance of this, because we  know how this can go, if they're really not sure of the questions they are  asking.  But, again, WilmerHale, the law firm given Mark Zuckerberg some  prep in advance to that, the Wall Street Journal reported that today.   Nick, thank you so much.</p><p> JOHNSTON:  Always.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Nick Johnston of Axios.  </p><p> JOHNSTON:  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, hackers hit Iran with the cryptic warning, including  an image of the American Flag and a message, don't mess with our elections,  details on that.  An intergalactic debut, the new Solo, a Star Wars story  trailer, finally out.  We'll give you a peek.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Iran hit hard by a global cyberattack with a strong message.   Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, they did, Dagen.  Hackers targeting networks on a number of  countries including data centers in Iran.  The hackers let the image of an  American flag on screen, saying \"don't mess with our elections\".  The  Iranian government says, about 3500 -- across that country.  </p><p> Well, a deal in the pharmaceutical industry to tell you about -- Novartis  is buying the AveXis, the price tag, nearly $9 billion.  The deal is a bet  that at least one promising drug that AveXis is developing to treat spinal  muscular atrophy will turn into a blockbuster drug.  Shares of Novartis are  higher in the premarket, up more than one and quarter percent; AveXis  shares are sharply higher as well. </p><p> Well, this is interesting -- one rapper on YouTube, drew some inspiration  from a kind of unusual place while rhyming to the tune of Migos song \"Walk  it, Talk it\".  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some of them are dreaming like that (INAUDIBLE), but  that (INAUDIBLE) when the bottle some are fairly some are not.  Let them  (INAUDIBLE) on the table when they get under the chair.  But that bump on  the sofa when I wish she wasn't there.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  So, you get it when you start watching it, right?  This went  viral.  And instead of \"Walk it, Talk it\", the YouTuber was rapper \"walk it  in my pocket\" but in the Migos style of rapping.  It racks up over a  million views on YouTube.  So, I guess -- I don't know what's next, cat in  the hat?  Cinderella?  Green eggs and ham?  Bring it on!  </p><p> MURPHY:  I've had enough for 15 years.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, you've been doing -- did you rap Dr. Seuss, Theodore Geisel,  for your kids?  </p><p> MURPHY:  For 15 years, straight, for every one of mine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Give me some green eggs and ham.  I want to hear it now.  </p><p> MURPHY:  It's on my YouTube channel.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You give us some green eggs and ham?</p><p> MURPHY:  No.</p><p> CARTER:  (INAUDIBLE) like, when we first heard about this, is this the  children that, you know -- like, no, this is a wrapper.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Wrapper, Migos.  Yes!  </p><p> CARTER:  You're all in.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  This is how dads keep their kids engaged.  I mean, you're  reading your book, you've got do something like that.  You can't just read  the book; you got to rap, you got to sing it.  </p><p> CARTER:  You rap your books?</p><p> BRENBERG:  I do something, maybe like an accent.  You know, you got to do  something to make it, and your kids are just to get bored and whatever.   It's a hard job, right?  </p><p> MURPHY:  This is iconic, and you kind of bring it to 2018, I think it needs  a little hip-hop in there, totally.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will not eat green eggs and ham?</p><p> MURPHY:  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Give me the next one.</p><p> MURPHY:  Sam, I am.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, \"A Quiet Place\" making a big noise.  The thriller is  a big win by actors turned director, Emily Blunt and John Krisinski.  A box  office recap, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Another record-breaking weekend at the box office.  Lauren  Simonetti has more details.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  All right.  Good morning, happy Monday.  This is the time we  talk about what was a hit over the weekend.  So, let's give you the list.   In first place, \"A Quiet Place\".  A surprise $50 million opening for this  horror film -- and we're going to talk more about it in a second; let's get  through the rest of the list.  Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", 25  million in the second week; \"Blockers\", 21 million; \"Black Panther\", took  the fourth-place spot, only $8 million this weekend but if you look at what  \"Black Panther\" has done to date, it has unseated \"Titanic\".  So, if you  look at total domestic growth, for this movie, $665 million.  There it is,  number three of all time.  \"The Force Awakens\", number one; \"Avatar\",  number two; and \"Titanic\", now number four.  </p><p> Let's go back to \"A Quiet Place\".  This is a movie that cost $17 million to  make; $50 million in its opening weekend.  So, it was written and directed  by -- of office fame, John Krisinki and his wife Emily Blunt starred, but  it's basically a \"A Quiet Place\" -- there's no dialogue in the movie, and  it's a huge win for Paramount who needed a big hit after about two years of  not having a hit.  So, there you have it.  We're liking horror at the box  office.  And they got the trailer for the new \"Star Wars\".</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you got, Lauren?  Show me.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Let's watch it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard about a job.  A big shot gangster putting  together a crew.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a driver.  I'm a flyer.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've waited a long time for a shot like this.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What is he saying?  No, what do you know?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You got a line on a ship?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  It hit theaters on the 25th of May.  See, it's the young Han  Solo.  Do we want to see the --</p><p> BRENBERG:  That's a lot of -- it's a lot of pressure to play the young Han  Solo.  He's such a great character.  I think the chances of failing are  really high here.  I'm excited to see.  It looks good in the trailer, but  that's a tough role, right?  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Agreed.  </p><p> CARTER:  I like the original \"Star Wars\", I'm not into it.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  It's disconnected.  It's another one of the -- I think this one  takes place before the first one, in 1977.  </p><p> MURHPY:  That tease makes -- while they're getting 600 and 700 million at  the box office, you can count and see more and more \"Star Wars\" prequel,  sequels, whatever.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  You're going to see Han Solo as a 5-year-old at some point --</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes --</p><p> BRENBERG:  I'm not looking forward to that one.</p><p> CARTER:  If I like something or not, it's pretty much a not a good  indicator about whether or not it's going to perform well.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's called monetizing the franchise, just like Disney bought it  in the first place.  And so, they've done a pretty good job.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  It's almost like one a year, right?  There's been like one  \"Star Wars\".</p><p> BRENBERG:  One from the regular series, one of the, kind of the, in between  --</p><p> SIMONETTI:  In between.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Yes, every single year for the next 20 years, at least, right? </p><p> SIMONETTI:  They get some new characters in this one.  And we'll see what  the appetite is for a young Han Solo.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You only need to know one word -- Chewbacca.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Makes an appearance in one of trailers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  And his age?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  190 -- in the film.</p><p> MURHPY:  (INAUDIBLE) like a long time.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  They sure do.</p><p> CARTER:  I hope that's a good indicator.  My dog just looks like him.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  I wish our dogs are the same.  Kevin -- someone who looks like  him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Her dog is named Kevin, just to clear that up.  She has two  dogs.  Lauren, thank you so much.  And Lauren is having a baby.  Can you  reveal the name while we're staying here?</p><p> SIMONETTI:  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.  And we're not sharing  names only because I don't care what anybody has to say about them anymore.   Not a name.  Not talking anymore suggestion,</p><p> BRENBERG:  You don't need it, but yes, forget about.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Don't want your input.  Thank you very much.  But you can still  guess if it's boy or girl.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We can segue from Han Solo to Lauren and her impending delivery.   Still ahead, gas prices said to hit their higher level in years this  summer.  We have all the details for you, next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, April 9th, your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  Crisis in Syria;  yet another suspected chemical weapon attacked, leaving dozens dead.  The  international community on high alert.  As the world waits for U.S.  response, President Trump warning of a big price to pay.  Despite the  tensions, stocks reporting to a higher open, bouncing back 160-point on the  Dow Futures right now after concerns over a trade war with China, seem to  ease a bit -- you see the gains there.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The DOJ - as well as U.S. courts - claim that the warrant is sufficient to force Microsoft to hand over data stored on its server in Ireland. Microsoft, a host of other big tech companies, and now Ireland disagree. <br/>Earlier this year, a group of tech giants like Cisco and Verizon signed briefs disputing the legal authority of the warrant, claiming that the U.S. has no jurisdiction over a company's data stored in another country even if the company in question is American. The Irish government has now issued an amicus brief in support of Microsoft, while admitting that existing contracts between Ireland and the U.S. technically allow for the sharing of data. The brief says: <br/>Ireland has a genuine and legitimate interest in potential infringements by other states of its sovereign rights with respect to its jurisdiction over its territory...Ireland does not accept any implication that it is required to intervene into foreign court proceedings to protect its sovereignty. Second, Ireland continues to facilitate cooperation with other states, including the United States, in the fight against crime and, in this regard, Ireland and the United States are parties to a treaty addressing the subject of this appeal. <br/>Jan Albrecht, a member of the European Parliament, has also issued an amicus brief with a pointed message for U.S. courts: <br/>European citizens are highly sensitive to the differences between European and U.S. standards on data protection. Such concerns are frequently raised in relation to the regulation of cross-border data flows and the mass-processing of data by U.S. technology companies. The successful execution of the warrant at issue in this case would extend the scope of this anxiety to a sizeable majority of the data held in the world's data centers outside the U.S. (most of which are controlled by U.S. corporations) and would thus undermine the protections of the EU data protection regime, even for data belonging to an EU citizen and stored in an EU country. <br/>This case is a critical one for setting a precedent for data ownership and the jurisdiction of countries over their data housed overseas. As support for Microsoft mounts on a global scale, all eyes will be on U.S. courts and the DOJ as they consider their next moves. 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNWS-46393491</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LGMTWW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DYM-NMR1-F11P-X195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Legal Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7141\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>December 30, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Such is the magnitude of the job, Bradbury - as the head of the OECD's digital economy taskforce secretariat - was named in December by by the International Tax Review as the equal-most influential person in global tax.</p><p>In an interview with The Australian Financial Review, Bradbury says from Paris that the potential global tax reforms could \"redefine who has taxing rights in a way that is even more profound\" than originally envisaged by world leaders when they set up the project. For the past six years the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project has had a big focus on how to collect more tax from digital firms such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google.</p><p>In the data-rich modern economy, tech giants have sometimes tried to avoid having a physical presence (in tax jargon known as a permanent establishment) in jurisdictions to pay minimal tax in lucrative developed markets like Europe and Australia.</p><p>How to tax the provision of online advertising by Facebook and Google, Amazon's cloud services and advertising, and subscription and freemium streaming services by Netflix and Spotify is a vexed issue for tax authorities around the world. With American tech and other intellectual property-intensive darlings in the firing line, the Obama and Trump administrations have bitten back.</p><p>The US is concerned anti-American forces in Europe are attempting a revenue heist and regulatory attacks on Silicon Valley giants at the expense of Uncle Sam. There has been a stalemate on forging international consensus on taxing the digital economy after the US last year effectively vetoed proposals.</p><p>Yet in a surprise twist, the global tax debate was recently turned on its head. Trump's top Treasury international tax official, former PwC and Baker McKenzie tax adviser Chip Harter, offered an olive branch to other countries. The US may be prepared to do a deal on global tax.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the vulnerabilities in the global tax base are not limited to highly digital firms but are more widespread for intangible assets owned by the likes of McDonald's, Starbucks and Nike. The American quid pro quo is that the original BEPS project be expanded beyond the digital economy to the rules on taxing IP and intangible assets more broadly.</p><p>Under the US proposal, a larger share of the profits would be taxed where a product is consumed - potentially delivering valuable revenue to big consumer markets like the US.</p><p>\"It's potentially bigger than the BEPS project because it would redefine who has taxing rights,\" Bradbury says.</p><p>The 127 members of BEPS in January agreed to examine proposals involving two pillars that might form the basis of a long-term consensus. The first focuses on the allocation of taxing rights between countries and the second addresses other issues.</p><p>\"Under the first pillar, which focuses on the allocation of taxing rights among countries, several proposals have been made that would allocate more taxing rights to market-user jurisdictions in the case of highly digitalised firms,\" Bradbury says. \"These proposals would require a reconsideration of existing transfer pricing rules and contemplate solutions that go beyond the arm's length principle - which has been the key principle underpinning the transfer pricing rules.</p><p>\"The second pillar will consider granting new taxing rights that would strengthen the ability of jurisdictions to tax profits where other jurisdictions with taxing rights apply a low effective tax rate to those profits.\"</p><p>Opinions diverge widely. The US wants to allocate some of the residual profit from intangibles to the consumer market, such as the US. The United Kingdom is keen to expand the taxing rights on big tech firms but wants to restrain the advancement into other industries that might hit its own multinationals.</p><p>The UK is also less interested in taxing where the \"consumer\" is, and is keener on taxing where the \"user\" is. A \"user\" of a digital platform may upload photos, make social media posts or sign up friends to a service, without paying any money. Though they are technically not a \"consumer\", arguably these users add value to the digital company, even if no money changes hands.</p><p>To complicate matters, the Germans and French believe if the system is going to move beyond taxing digital firms, then a global minimum corporate tax should be imposed - a change the US corporate tax reforms in 2016 effectively imposed on US-headquartered multinationals.</p><p>Bradbury is in the thick of all this. To be sure, the OECD working on behalf of the Group of 20 world leaders faces an uphill task to finalise a compromise by a deadline of 2020.</p><p>With impatient governments in Australia and the UK rolling out unilateral tax laws to hit multinational tax avoidance, tax experts are worried a failure to achieve a breakthrough could lead to an international tax war. Others argue unilateral action by Australia may encourage countries to work out a global solution.</p><p>Bradbury, who as a Labor assistant treasurer did some of the early work on Australia's multinational tax-avoidance laws, is diplomatic: \"Australia has been closely engaged in this work and this will be increasingly important as we move into the next phase of deliberations.\"</p><p>Many private-sector tax advisers believe the OECD's task is nigh on impossible, given the intractable political fight over how to carve up the global tax pie.</p><p>\"It is hard to see how the OECD will be able to achieve a consensus by 2020 and if they don't I think we will see more unilateral measures becoming permanent,\" says Clayton Utz tax partner Niv Tadmore. \"That would create ambiguity and incoherence in the international tax system.\"</p><p>Bradbury won't concede he has the impossible in front of him. In fact, the father of four teenage students recently signed a three-year contract extension at the OECD in Paris, which would take him to eight years in the job. He is ensconced in Parisian life, musing that his bilingual children are much more fluent in French than he.</p><p>It's a long way for the former western Sydney MP from the time he climbed aboard a patrol boat in Darwin with then-prime minister Julia Gillard to showcase his border security credentials before the 2010 election. Bradbury shows little interest in resuming a Canberra political life, but admits politics is part of the job at the OECD.</p><p>\"We are trying to achieve consensus with 127 jurisdictions at the table, all contributing on an equal footing,\" he says. \"Our work is not like a parliament where you need 50 per cent plus one. You need to understand the various interests and perspectives of countries. That requires an even greater understanding of the positions of the countries and national interests. It's a technical exercise but also a political one.\"</p><p>In comparison to a breakdown in multilateralism on trade and immigration, Bradbury at least thinks tax has the potential underpinnings for a deal.</p><p>\"At a time when there seems to be almost complete intractability on so many global issues, this seems to be one area where countries are constructively engaging with a strong desire to make progress,\" he says.</p><p>\"In my experience there is a pretty strong degree of political will among countries to try to address these issues. Where that leads us in the next couple of years remains to be seen.\"AFR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc749u4qgzaz41lb5eop99</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHV-7911-JD34-V2GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1389\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The session paired the two to address pressing digital economy prospects and problems at a crucial juncture where both e-commerce and data regulation are needed but require extraordinary global collaboration.  Navigating this complex digital terrain is the preserve of public sector, policy-makers and the private sector and requires ample inputs from all to make it work.  The issues are far from simple.  They also have knock-on effects across value chains, countries, consumers and all commerce \u2013 and they impact everything from the nebulous, such as trust, to the nefarious, such as hacking and data theft. </p><p>Amani Abou-Zeid Amani Abou-Zeid, Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy at the African Union Commission [Photo Gallery on Flickr]  The data-driven economy gives rise to new opportunities for wealth creation and addressing sustainable development challenges.  It also raises concerns such as data privacy and security, the regulation of cross-border data flows, market concentration and taxation.  As such, rules are important, attendees at the fifth UNCTAD eCommerce Week, at the United Nations\u2019 European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on 2 April heard.  \u201cAs with other areas of trade, rulemaking about data and e-commerce will need to achieve a balance between potential trade disciplines and national policy objectives,\u201d said UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant.  Call and response  Understanding how digital data and trade interact requires different perspectives to bring a complex picture into focus.  The African Union\u2019s (AU) infrastructure and energy commissioner, Amani Abou-Zeid, said aside from physical infrastructure, mobile money, and a better understanding of the informal economy, one of the biggest challenges in Africa is data.  The lack of it, how it differs, and the inability to analyze it when it does exist, are all concerns.  \u201cWhen we talk about data for trade, there is an assumption that this data exists,\u201d Ms. Abou-Zeid said. \u201cLack of up-to-date data is recognized as one of the impacts of lower intra-African trade. When there is data, it can differ from agency to agency and sometimes even within agencies.\u201d  The AU is working to address the data issue, she said, saying it would establish a trade observatory located within the AU Commission with funding from the International Trade Centre and the European Union.  The observatory would deal with the issue of not having a central trade data repository at a continental level and quantitative information to make decisions.  The term data though, said Deborah Elms, founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, has been used too loosely, which makes it confusing and complicated.  \u201cData is used to describe everything, so it ends up describing nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be more precise.\u201d  \u201cThe more complicated you make it, the more difficult you make it for small businesses operating in the digital world.\u201d  With data and trade at the core of the wide-ranging discussion, the definitional issue was central.  Governments are grappling with this, said Lantosoa Rakotomalala, Madagascar\u2019s industry, trade and crafts minister.  \u201cWe have all the challenges relating to (digital) connection, data storage and ensuring this data is secure.  \u201cBut on the other hand, we also have research and development policies which today are not yet allowing us to fully appreciate the usage of data in terms of economic development,\u201d she said, but added there were costs especially in machine learning, new equipment and the rights to a private life.  She said an additional challenge is identifying how to process and analyze data in Africa.  The case of Paraguay is heartening for other developing nations, but also demonstrates that connectivity alone is not enough.  Pedro Mancuello, Paraguay\u2019s vice minister of trade, said while more that 86% of people in Paraguay have internet, only 14.3% buy online. This connectivity is a  testament to its investment in digital infrastructure, but also a portend of what\u2019s required to get entrepreneurs selling, and consumers buying, online.  But getting online is a challenge for many says, said Jo\u00e3ozinho Mendes of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).  \u201cBecause of the digital divide an awful lot of our producers are simply not able to have such a high online profile for economic, infrastructure or indeed educational reasons.\u201d  He said he doesn\u2019t believe data collection is a bad thing and contributes to development.  \u201cDigital technologies do generate a great deal of information, but we need to be in a position to process, collect, analyses, and store it to implement development strategies. Hence the need to develop competencies that allow us to manage data,\u201d Mr. Mendes said.    The data divide  On the industry and civil society side, there was emphasis on the difference between consumer and business data and its use.  Consumers International\u2019s director general Helena Leurent said data benefits consumers daily, citing the example of TripAdvisor.  But she said there is a dark side that needs to be considered.  \u201cThe value that companies and nations gain from data originates from individuals. Our ability to create a rich personal profile which helps aid decision-making and recommendations is the same thing that then creates the challenges.\u201d  \u201cFor consumers there is a fear that (their data) is being used against them, which stops them wanting to engage in a digital world,\u201d she said.  Meanwhile Ms. Elms\u2019 view is that while big data may be the preserve of big tech companies, the 2,500 companies in her network simply don\u2019t see business information as data that needs major protections.  \u201cIt\u2019s just information that is needed to do business. If you want to move goods from country A to country B, companies need to be able to use your address and credit card to do that,\u201d Ms. Elms said.  Indeed, data can be a force for good, a point made by Xiaofei Yao, founder and CEO of Rogrand E-commerce, China\u2019s largest pharmaceutical supply chain management company.  She said: \u201cData has become an essential thing for business.\u201d  \u201cMany describe data as the oil of the future \u2013 but it\u2019s more than just oil, it\u2019s the engine and currency in the digital economy \u2013 and is much more powerful than its fiscal counterparts as it helps us understand more about ourselves, our country and our civilization.\u201d  \u201cIt will fundamentally enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of production and services.\u201d  \u201cWe are all desperate to get more data. Despite the concerns we should look into the uniqueness of the data to overcome these, and design by industry and sector around the purpose of the data use.\u201d  The meeting agreed data can be a force for good, but it needs to be better defined and understood ahead of regulation efforts, which could damage the engines of economic growth it aims to help.   \u201cWhatever the outcome of trade negotiations, it is clear that more support is needed to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era,\u201d Ms. Durant added.  The fifth edition of eCommerce Week \u2013 an annual gathering that draws leading e-commerce figures, start-ups, policy makers and officials from around the world \u2013 is taking place in Geneva from 1 to 5 April. The theme of this year\u2019s week, which comprises dozens of sessions, is \"From Digitalization to Development\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN942085020190405</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTG-BW31-DXCW-D48Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When there is data, it can differ from agency to agency and sometimes even within agencies.\"</p><p>The AU is working to address the data issue, she said, saying it would establish a trade observatory located within the AU Commission with funding from the International Trade Centre and the European Union.</p><p>The observatory would deal with the issue of not having a central trade data repository at a continental level and quantitative information to make decisions.</p><p>The term data though, said Deborah Elms, founder and executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, has been used too loosely, which makes it confusing and complicated.</p><p>\"Data is used to describe everything, so it ends up describing nothing,\" she said. \"We have to be more precise.\"</p><p>\"The more complicated you make it, the more difficult you make it for small businesses operating in the digital world.\"</p><p>With data and trade at the core of the wide-ranging discussion, the definitional issue was central.</p><p>Governments are grappling with this, said Lantosoa Rakotomalala, Madagascar's industry, trade and crafts minister.</p><p>\"We have all the challenges relating to (digital) connection, data storage and ensuring this data is secure.</p><p>\"But on the other hand, we also have research and development policies which today are not yet allowing us to fully appreciate the usage of data in terms of economic development,\" she said, but added there were costs especially in machine learning, new equipment and the rights to a private life.</p><p>She said an additional challenge is identifying how to process and analyze data in Africa.</p><p>The case of Paraguay is heartening for other developing nations, but also demonstrates that connectivity alone is not enough.</p><p>Pedro Mancuello, Paraguay's vice minister of trade, said while more that 86% of people in Paraguay have internet, only 14.3% buy online. This connectivity is a testament to its investment in digital infrastructure, but also a portend of what's required to get entrepreneurs selling, and consumers buying, online.</p><p>But getting online is a challenge for many says, said Joozinho Mendes of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA).</p><p>\"Because of the digital divide an awful lot of our producers are simply not able to have such a high online profile for economic, infrastructure or indeed educational reasons.\"</p><p>He said he doesn't believe data collection is a bad thing and contributes to development.</p><p>\"Digital technologies do generate a great deal of information, but we need to be in a position to process, collect, analyses, and store it to implement development strategies. Hence the need to develop competencies that allow us to manage data,\" Mr. Mendes said.</p><p>The data divide</p><p>On the industry and civil society side, there was emphasis on the difference between consumer and business data and its use.</p><p>Consumers International's director general Helena Leurent said data benefits consumers daily, citing the example of TripAdvisor.</p><p>But she said there is a dark side that needs to be considered.</p><p>\"The value that companies and nations gain from data originates from individuals. Our ability to create a rich personal profile which helps aid decision-making and recommendations is the same thing that then creates the challenges.\"</p><p>\"For consumers there is a fear that (their data) is being used against them, which stops them wanting to engage in a digital world,\" she said.</p><p>Meanwhile Ms. Elms' view is that while big data may be the preserve of big tech companies, the 2,500 companies in her network simply don't see business information as data that needs major protections.</p><p>\"It's just information that is needed to do business. If you want to move goods from country A to country B, companies need to be able to use your address and credit card to do that,\" Ms. Elms said.</p><p>Indeed, data can be a force for good, a point made by Xiaofei Yao, founder and CEO of Rogrand E-commerce, China's largest pharmaceutical supply chain management company.</p><p>She said: \"Data has become an essential thing for business.\"</p><p>\"Many describe data as the oil of the future but it's more than just oil, it's the engine and currency in the digital economy and is much more powerful than its fiscal counterparts as it helps us understand more about ourselves, our country and our civilization.\"</p><p>\"It will fundamentally enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of production and services.\"</p><p>\"We are all desperate to get more data. Despite the concerns we should look into the uniqueness of the data to overcome these, and design by industry and sector around the purpose of the data use.\"</p><p>The meeting agreed data can be a force for good, but it needs to be better defined and understood ahead of regulation efforts, which could damage the engines of economic growth it aims to help.</p><p>\"Whatever the outcome of trade negotiations, it is clear that more support is needed to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era,\" Ms. Durant added.</p><p>The fifth edition of eCommerce Week an annual gathering that draws leading e-commerce figures, start-ups, policy makers and officials from around the world is taking place in Geneva from 1 to 5 April. The theme of this year's week, which comprises dozens of sessions, is \"From Digitalization to Development\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122832470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT4-0KS1-DYTH-G3TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dedicated mobile broadband connections will gradually become more ubiquitous, but less retail subscription-oriented; broadband subscriptions would otherwise be more numerous by 2029. In time, subscription numbers will become less relevant as an indicator of growth. As operators pursue connected strategies, so the number of devices linked to a single account-holder will proliferate. Connected cars, smart homes, smart meters, smart prosthetics and clothing will be just a few of a myriad of 'things' connecting to the internet. Monetising connected services will be operators' new priority, although many will struggle unless they are prepared to abandon their legacy business models. Although it has become heavily commoditised and, therefore, less attractive as a paid-for service, voice still has an important role to play. It will be included in multi-product bundles and will, therefore, count in operators' reported connection numbers, especially in developed markets where triple-play uptake is developing rapidly. In less developed markets, voice will continue to be required as a stand-alone product although, increasingly, it will migrate to less transparent IP offerings.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1582900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WN-4JD1-F0J5-8375-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

Dedicated mobile broadband connections will gradually become more ubiquitous, but less retail subscription-oriented; broadband subscriptions would otherwise be more numerous by 2029. In time, subscription numbers will become less relevant as an indicator of growth. As operators pursue connected strategies, so the number of devices linked to a single account-holder will proliferate. Connected cars, smart homes, smart meters, smart prosthetics and clothing will be just a few of a myriad of 'things' connecting to the internet. Monetising connected services will be operators' new priority, although many will struggle unless they are prepared to abandon their legacy business models. Although it has become heavily commoditised and, therefore, less attractive as a paid-for service, voice still has an important role to play. It will be included in multi-product bundles and will, therefore, count in operators' reported connection numbers, especially in developed markets where triple-play uptake is developing rapidly. In less developed markets, voice will continue to be required as a stand-alone product although, increasingly, it will migrate to less transparent IP offerings.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1559650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6067-SX11-F0J5-81PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

The cost cuts aim to \"restore the group's competitiveness and ensure its long-term development within the framework of the Alliance\", it said, referring to its strategic partnership with Japanese carmakers Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors. Renault expects to cut EUR800 million costs by streamlining vehicle design and development - by reducing component diversity and increasing standardisation - and optimising resources. It aims to save EUR650 million in production operations, accelerating digitalisation and reducing industrial capacity. Global production capacity will be reduced to 3.3 million by 2024 from 4 million vehicles in 2019. Its \"workforce adjustment project\" will be based on retraining measures, internal mobility, and voluntary departures. The cuts will affect 4,600 jobs in France, plus the reduction of more than 10,000 positions elsewhere in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">----------</p><p>Japanese industrial conglomerate Hitachi reported a fall in annual profit as Covid-19 hit revenue, expecting a further decrease in sales in the coming year. Revenue for the year to March 31 fell 8% to JPY8.767 trillion - around USD81.8 billion - from JPY9.480 trillion the year before. leading net income to slump to JPY127.2 billion from JPY312.0 million. Adjusted operating profit fell 12% to JPY661.8 billion. Excluding the impact of Covid-19, profit would have been JPY708.8 billion, the firm said, down on JPY754.9 billion the prior year due to JPY24.0 billion in foreign exchange losses and JPY26.0 billion in growth investments. \"The decrease was due to the decline in profit in Hitachi Construction Machinery segment and Hitachi Metals segment despite the increase in profit in the Industry segment and the IT segment,\" the firm said.</p><p>----------</p><p>Costco Wholesale late Thursday reported a third-quarter sales bounce, with profit also rising despite booking USD283 million in costs related to Covid-19. In the three months to May 10, sales climbed 4.8% annually to USD36.45 billion from USD33.96 billion, helping lift pretax income by 3.6% to USD1.16 billion from USD1.12 billion. It was a period which saw demand boosted due to the Covid-19 pandemic and consumer stock piling. But the membership-only retailer said it incurred USD283 million in costs related to the virus, including \"incremental wage and sanitation\" expenses.</p><p>----------</p><p>China-based travel services provider Trip.com swung to a first-quarter loss as revenue sunk by almost half, demonstrating just how much the sector has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic in recent months. \"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought significant challenges to the global travel industry. However, it is encouraging that by now, we have seen stabilisation or recovery of travel activities in many of the markets where we operate,\" Executive Chair James Liang said. Net revenue in the three months to March 31 was 42% lower year-on-year at RMB4.74 billion, about USD669 million, from RMB8.17 billion. The company, which operates the eponymous Trip.com brand as well as the Skyscanner travel search engine, swung to a first-quarter loss from operations of RMB1.51 billion from a profit of RMB885 million.</p><p>----------</p><p>MARKETS</p><p>----------</p><p>50%?) that today will see significant US action versus China in the form of sanctions beyond merely not allowing key members of the Hong Kong government to vacation in Hawaii or California from now on,\" commented Rabobank. </p><p>----------</p><p>CAC 40: down 1.3% at 4,710.97</p><p>DAX 30: down 1.5% at 11,602.08</p><p>FTSE 100: down 1.0% at 6,156.55</p><p>----------</p><p>DJIA: called down 0.8%</p><p>Nasdaq Composite: called down 0.7%</p><p>S&amp;P 500: called down 0.7%</p><p>----------</p><p>S&amp;P/ASX 200: closed down 1.6% at 5,755.70</p><p>Hang Seng: closed down 0.7% at 22,961.47</p><p>Nikkei 225: closed down 0.2% at 21,877.89</p><p>----------</p><p>EUR: up at USD1.1111 (USD1.1067)</p><p>GBP: down at USD1.2305 (USD1.2323)</p><p>USD: down at JPY107.30 (JPY107.60)</p><p>GOLD: firm at USD1,723.78 per ounce (USD1,722.65)</p><p>OIL (Brent): up at USD35.24 a barrel (USD34.45)</p><p>(currency and commodities changes since previous London equities close)</p><p>----------</p><p>ECONOMICS AND GENERAL</p><p>----------</p><p>US President Donald Trump said he will give a press conference Friday on China amid rising US-Chinese tensions over Hong Kong and the coronavirus fallout. Trump told reporters of his plan at an Oval Office meeting Thursday, but gave no specific details of what he would be announcing. Fears that China will use a new law to end Hong Kong's freedom as a semi-autonomous territory have prompted expectations that Trump plans to hit back, possibly signaling a wider confrontation between the two economic superpowers. Washington and Beijing are already clashing over responsibility for the extent of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China but has caused devastation in the US.</p><p>----------</p><p>Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued a letter addressed to \"Fellow citizens\", outlining the reasoning behind her support of Beijing's latest move to take control of the city's national security law. In the letter, which was circulated widely by local news organisations and via the government's website, Lam called Hong Kong \"the home we all treasure\", defined by \"its Lion Rock spirit\" - a reference to shared local core values. In her appeal, Lam lamented that Hong Kong's community had been traumatised by a year of protests. She outlined how violence by rioters had escalated and said that opposition forces and organisations calling for Hong Kong's \"independence\" and \"self determination\" were blatantly challenging Central authorities as well as Hong Kong's own government. Lam's letter comes a day after a joint statement was made by leaders from the UK, the US, Canada and Australia, reiterating their \"deep concern\" regarding Beijings decision to impose a national security law in Hong Kong.</p><p>----------</p><p>Trump signed an order seeking to strip social media giants such as Twitter of legal immunity for content on their platforms in a move slammed by his critics as a legally dubious act of political revenge. The executive order calls on government regulators to evaluate if online platforms should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users. If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat internet platforms as \"publishers\" potentially liable for user-generated content. Trump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms \"have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.\" The move comes a day after an angry tirade from the US leader against Twitter after the platform for the first time labelled two of his tweets with fact-check notices, calling them misleading.</p><p>----------</p><p>French first quarter gross domestic product was revised up slightly but still showed a sharp drop, National Institute of Statistics &amp; Economic Studies said, while inflation continues to slow. In the first quarter of the year, GDP fell 5.3% quarter-on-quarter after a 0.1% decline in the fourth quarter of 2019. While a severe fall, the first quarter reading has been revised up from the initial report of a 5.8% drop. Imports slumped 5.7% in the quarter and exports were down 6.1%, while household consumption expenditure was down an \"unprecedented\" 5.6%. In a separate release, INSEE said the annual inflation rate should slow to 0.2% in May, according to preliminary figures, from 0.3% in April. \"This drop in inflation should result from an accentuated fall in the prices of energy and manufactured products and a slowdown in food prices,\" said INSEE.</p><p>----------</p><p>Italy's economic performance was downwardly revised by national statistics agency Istat, confirming the damage caused by the new coronavirus pandemic, which hit the country earlier than European neighbours. Gross domestic product fell by 5.3% in first quarter of 2020 from the final quarter of 2019, following a decrease of 0.3% in previous quarter. The quarter-on-quarter decline in the first quarter initially had been estimated at 4.7%. On an annual basis, Italy's GDP dropped by 5.4% in the first quarter, swinging from an increase of 0.1% in last quarter of 2019. Istat initially estimated the annual fall at 4.8%.</p><p>----------</p><p>Japan's industrial production dropped 9.1% in April from the previous month, marking the third straight month of fall, due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the government said. The decline was steeper than the median forecast of a 5.4% decrease by analysts surveyed by the Nikkei Business Daily, following a 3.7% fall in March. Manufacturers expect industrial production to fall 4.1% in May and to rebound 3.9% in June, a survey conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, showed. The index of industrial shipments fell 8.8% to 85 in April from the previous month and that of industrial inventories slipped 0.3% to 106.1, the ministry said. The government also reported that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 2.6% in April from 2.5% in the previous month.</p><p>----------</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLNGF-1590742756898949000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLNGF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-BJ71-JBN8-N0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><timeReceived>08:59 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Alliance News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alliance News Global 500</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0006T6Y</classCode><className>REGIE NATIONALE DES USINES RENAULT SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002HQL</classCode><className>NISSAN MOTOR CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002GPR</classCode><className>MITSUBISHI MOTORS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00084KJ</classCode><className>HITACHI CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000292A</classCode><className>COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0007QGR</classCode><className>HITACHI CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY (AMERICA) CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0007T64</classCode><className>HITACHI CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY PTE LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS522220 SALES FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp; UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC6141 PERSONAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp; PASSENGER CAR BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS336211 MOTOR VEHICLE BODY MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS333120 CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC3713 TRUCK &amp; BUS BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC3531 CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY &amp; EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp; SUPERCENTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC5399 MISC.

Australia's financial intelligence watchdog, AUSTRAC, said the wrongdoing included Westpac failures to monitor international payments suspected of funding child exploitation. Westpac acknowledged the breaches in a statement submitted Thursday to a federal court, which must now approve the fine, the largest civil penalty in Australian history. The penalty exceeded a provision of USD900 million Westpac budgeted earlier this year to cover the expected penalty. \"I would like to apologise sincerely for the bank's failings,\" Peter King, Westpac's chief executive, said in announcing the agreement. King said Westpac had beefed up its financial crime monitoring capabilities and undertaken a \"reassessment of our culture, governance and accountability\" to prevent future breaches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">----------</p><p>TikTok is urging a federal court to block US President Donald Trump from banning the app, arguing the move is based on election politics rather than legitimate national security concerns. Attorneys are scheduled to argue the case on Thursday before a judge who will decide whether to put Trump's order on hold until a lawsuit over the ban is resolved. \"As the President's and other agency officials' confusing and contradictory statements about TikTok over many months demonstrate, the prohibitions were not motivated by a genuine national security concern, but rather by political considerations relating to the upcoming general election,\" the motion for a preliminary injunction contended. A deal to restructure ownership of the popular video app was thrown into doubt Monday when Trump vowed to block any deal that allows its Chinese parent firm to retain any control. The comments raised fresh concerns over a deal that appeared to avert a US-ordered ban of TikTok, which the Trump administration has called a national security risk and has threatened to ban without ownership changes.</p><p>----------</p><p>Major automakers Tesla, Volvo, Ford Motor and Daimler subsidiary Mercedes-Benz have sued the US government over tariffs on Chinese goods, demanding customs duties paid on imports be returned, with interest. The lawsuits, which were filed in recent days in the New York-based Court of International Trade, concern tariffs imposed by the Office of the US Trade Representative on imports from China, which Tesla in its filing called \"arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\" The duties came amid a wider trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, and the automakers are asking for the tariffs to be revoked and any money paid to import parts returned.</p><p>----------</p><p>UK defence and medical technology firm Smiths Group said revenue from continuing operations for the year to July 31 was up 2% to GBP2.55 billion, though down 1% on an underlying basis. Pretax profit more than halved to GBP133 million, however, from GBP304 million the year before. Smiths Group said profit was hit by lower volumes in the second half as well as additional costs to support business continuity, and the firm also took GBP31 million in restructuring costs and GBP24 million of write-downs. Smiths declared a final dividend of 24p a share and a delayed interim dividend of 11p, taking the total payout for financial 2020 to 35p, down 24% from 45.9p paid a year ago.</p><p>----------</p><p>UK water utility United Utilities Group said revenue for the six months ending September 30 is expected to be lower than the first half of last year, reflecting its allowed regulatory revenue changes and lower consumption from businesses as a result of Covid-19. However, it noted the negative impact was partly offset by higher consumption from households. Underlying operating profit is also expected to be down year-on-year due to lower revenue and an anticipated moderate increase in infrastructure renewals expenditure. Looking ahead, the company highlighted its operating performance is on track against its AMP7 plan, adding that it continues to target net outcome delivery incentive outperformance for the full year.</p><p>----------</p><p>MARKETS</p><p>----------</p><p>European stocks gave back the gains made on Wednesday to trade in the red, following losses in the US and Asia. In Sydney, Westpac ended essentially flat, down 0.1%. \"One step forward, two steps back. It appears the wall of worry is just too big for the markets to climb right now without the odd setback.

Sunak will address the Commons after cancelling this year's Budget. With the furlough work scheme due to finish at the end of October, he will announce measures aimed at protecting millions of jobs in sectors hit by the latest government guidance on Covid-19. As the number of new cases rose by more than 6,000, new restrictions came into force in England on Thursday, and the much-delayed coronavirus contact tracing app was finally launched. Sunak's intervention comes after increasing pressure from business groups, MPs and unions to extend the furlough scheme amid fears the new restrictions will damage the economy.</p><p>----------</p><p>German business confidence strengthened further in September, figures from the Ifo showed. The Ifo business climate reached 93.4 in September, improving from August's 92.5 and rising well off the low of 74.6 recorded in April. The current situation monitor rose to 89.2 in September from 87.9 in August, while the expectations index nudged up to 97.7 from 97.2. \"The German economy is stabilising despite rising infection numbers,\" the Munich-based institute noted. By sector, the manufacturing business climate index rose to minus 0.2 in September from minus 5.6 in August, better than the reading of minus 2.6 recorded at the start of 2020. Sentiment in the service sector softened somewhat - in line with PMI data on Wednesday showing Germany's service sector slipped into contraction in September - with the index coming in at 6.9 from 7.7.</p><p>----------</p><p>Switzerland's central bank kept interest rates on hold and said the country's virus-induced economic downturn in the first half of the year was \"somewhat less strong than feared\". The Swiss National Bank kept its policy rate at minus 0.75%. The Swiss franc was lower in the wake of the SNB decision. In the year-to-date, the dollar has fallen around 4.5% against the franc. The bank noted the strength of the Swiss franc and said it remains \"willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market\". Turning to forecasts, the SNB said the inflation outlook is \"subject to unusually high uncertainty\". The forecast for this year remains deflation of 0.6%, though this is likely to edge back into positive territory in 2021 at an inflation rate of 0.1% and accelerate in 2022 to 0.2%. </p><p>----------</p><p>The Trump administration unveiled legislation Wednesday aimed at limiting the liability shield of online services for content they host, the latest in a series of proposals motivated by a backlash against Big Tech platforms. The Justice Department said its proposal seeks to reform a law known as Section 230 which protects internet services from liability from third-party content. \"For too long Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,\" said Attorney General William Barr. \"Ensuring that the internet is a safe, but also vibrant, open and competitive environment is vitally important to America.\" Barr said the bill would make platforms liable if they \"unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate criminal activity online.\"</p><p>----------</p><p>US President Trump declined to fully commit to a peaceful transfer of power following the November election, during a briefing Wednesday at the White House. \"We're gonna have to see what happens,\" Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about ensuring a peaceful handover. The reporter had asked the president: \"Win, lose or draw in this election, will you commit here today for a peaceful transferral of power after the election?\" After a long-winded response, Trump pushed back, saying there could be a \"continuation\" of power. First he said: \"We're going to have to see what happens.\" Then Trump added: \"There won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\" In 2016, when Trump first ran for office, he pledged to accept the election results if they were clear cut, and if he emerged victorious.</p><p>----------</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALLNGF-1600939147336785800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALLNGF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X6-X3J1-DY4B-C34P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><timeReceived>09:19 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Alliance News Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alliance News Global 500</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002RXP</classCode><className>WESTPAC BANKING CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

While the COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique short-term challenges for the industry1[1], given the pandemic is a fundamentally life sciences centred problem it is not surprising that governments, investors and society as a whole have continued to turn to the life sciences sector for solutions. This has caused investors to maintain interest in the sector as the pandemic has developed - from venture capital and government grants contributing to the growth of digital health and medtech companies, to listed biotechs experiencing significant valuation leaps off the back of successful early stage COVID-19 vaccine trials. Accordingly, in just the first half of 2020, over $16 billion was invested globally in life sciences companies, demonstrating the resilience of the sector.Given the continued white-hot growth of the life sciences industry, it comes as no surprise that the demand for real estate facilities that tailor to these companies is also in high demand. </p><p>With that demand comes the real estate capital allocators, investors and developers looking to capitalize on these opportunities. These real estate players also now view life sciences real estate, or 'propsci,'2[2] as an asset class within the real estate industry that is distinguished from office or industrial space and that warrants a separate allocation consideration for diversification and growth opportunities. LIFE SCIENCE CLUSTERS AND REAL ESTATE CONSIDERATIONS The growth of life sciences has created geographic concentrations of interconnected life sciences companies and institutions, or 'clusters,' forming in key global locations, including in the U.S. and the UK. The forming of clusters has been driven by a variety of factors, including a broad recognition that proximity between market participants can drive overall productivity. While it may seem paradoxical for a company to locate near its competitor, a deeper examination reveals that clustering creates synergies for all participants who can benefit from communal resources, regional trade, lobby and support groups, shared infrastructure and logistics channels, and a common regulatory and legal framework (and, in some instances, local tax incentives).Traditionally, life sciences clusters have organically developed over time near recognized research universities and teaching hospitals, as these provide ready access to talent across key scientific disciplines and easy means for intellectual property transfer from these institutions to private companies. In recent times, traditional big spenders on R&amp;#38;D in the life sciences sector (like big pharma) have increasingly favoured collaboration, often with smaller venture-funded companies that have spun out from leading academic institutions, as a means of achieving a stake in innovation while reducing in-house R&amp;#38;D risk and expenditure. An interesting by-product of the growth of venture-funded companies is the increasing availability of flexible short-lease lab spaces targeted at covenant weak start-ups and SMEs (click here[3] to read more on flexible leases in the life sciences sector).Meanwhile, like in many other sectors, big data (and small data) analytics is increasingly seen as a means to achieve a competitive advantage in the life sciences sector, especially given the broad data sets that are generated, analysed and used. This is leading to many life sciences companies considering headquarters in central metropolitan locations to compete with Big Tech for the recruitment and retention of 'data talent' (from graduates to senior executives) who are increasingly desiring a dynamic urban work address for lifestyle reasons. The trend towards data is also leading to a greater proportional occupation of office-like space, rather than laboratory space, to support a more computer (data) focused workforce.Life sciences real estate covers the specialized real estate requirements for companies involved in life sciences, including the biopharmaceutical, medical technology, genomics, diagnostics and digital health sectors, which focus on end products that use the latest technology to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Whether a start-up with a promising cell therapy or an established big pharma company with expanding product lines, the real estate need for life science companies can vary greatly - whether it is lab space or diagnostic testing or more traditional R&amp;#38;D space. Investors looking to add propsci to their portfolios need to be mindful of the operational elements required for life science companies as well as the flexibility to expand as treatments or drugs are approved for further testing and production. In this article, we will explore some of the traditional propsci 'clusters' in the U.S. and the UK as well as emerging clusters that may be well-positioned for investment opportunities. US HOT SPOTS AND WHAT'S NEXT The top three propsci clusters in the U.S. are the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston and San Diego. These three markets have been the dominant clusters for life science companies and investors as well as for real estate. As of the end of 2019, the vacancy rate in markets like Boston/Cambridge and San Francisco was at or near zero. In 2019, more than one million square feet of life sciences dedicated space was delivered in San Francisco (without including the Oakland/East Bay market that saw another 500,000 square feet of space).3[4] In the Boston market (which includes Cambridge), there is over three million square feet of life sciences space under construction. In San Diego, demand is outpacing new supply and rental rates are up as much as 12% from 2019. Given the existing talent pool as well as the continued venture capital investments and National Institute of Health (NIH) grants that will be made to life science companies in these markets, we expect to see real estate developers and investors continue to look for new opportunities in these markets. As an example, the owner of the Hilltop Mall, a traditional retail mall located in near Oakland, California that has struggled in recent years to keep or add new retail tenants, has announced that the project is being redeveloped as a biotech and life sciences campus.Looking beyond the traditional 'big-3' clusters, there are several clusters that have attracted substantial capital and governmental investment and appear ripe for significant propsci growth. Among these markets are places like Chicago, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Baltimore. These clusters share many of the same characteristics of Boston, San Francisco and San Diego - well-regarded research universities, high levels of private investment and governmental grants and a deep and growing talent pool to draw from. As an example, Chicago, home to some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world as well as medical device and diagnostic companies, has seen vacancy in the low single digits and the number of life sciences employees doubling since 2010. In Philadelphia, there are more than 49,000 people employed by approximately 800 life sciences companies. Philadelphia is the third largest recipient of National Institute of Health Funding in the U.S. and is the largest recipient of NIH funding for gene and cell therapy research. In New Jersey, more than 85,000 people are employed by life sciences companies4[5]. Real estate investors are focused on both central and northern New Jersey for investments opportunities. Baltimore, like many of the other 'clusters,' has seen vacancy at 1% but new development has been more limited. Given the cluster approach taken by the industry, markets like Chicago, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Baltimore, as well as other more recently emerging clusters such as Raleigh-Durham, Seattle and Minneapolis, investors looking at these markets not only have the benefit of geographic diversity but also industry diversity as these life science clusters are home to companies with different focuses within the life sciences industry. UK HOT SPOTS AND WHAT'S NEXT On the other side of the pond, the UK is now the number one destination for life sciences capital raisings in Europe, with over 1 billion raised annually over the last five years, and with more than half of this coming from venture capital. This achievement has been underpinned by life sciences being a focus of the UK Government's Industrial Strategy, which has resulted in over 5,600 life sciences companies operating in the UK, generating a turnover of over 60 billion. Covering the life sciences product development, supply and services chain, these companies contribute to the employment of over 220,000 people.In the UK, the 'golden triangle' of London, Cambridge, Oxford and surrounding areas is seen as the most advanced of the life sciences clusters, where around 80% of all UK life science investment happens. This cluster is home to a highly-diverse and large population consisting of academics, clinicians, leading universities, research centres, healthcare providers, innovative SMEs and start-ups, large industry corporates, and fit-for-purpose real estate and infrastructure.The golden triangle is followed by Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Nottingham, where there are also significant amounts of concentrated activity. Next tier emerging destinations include Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle. These secondary and emerging destinations all have a key ingredient for success - world-renown universities in close proximity. These destinations also have the potential to benefit from the UK Government's publicized goal to invest in rebalancing the UK economy so that it is not overly-reliant on the UK's south-east region where the golden triangle is located. Furthermore, given the compact size of Great Britain (being smaller than each of the U.S. states of Idaho and Kansas by comparison), there is an argument that it has the potential to operate as one big cluster in its own right, with participants having access to the same synergies, business benefits and networking opportunities as those which exist in a more conventional compact cluster, especially given the advanced integrated transport links between cities. The rollout of the High Speed Two (HS2) rail network over the next few years will reduce existing travel times between London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow, further advancing the argument that 'Great Britain is one big cluster.'The UK is also seeing real estate investors capitalizing on the increased demand and success of clusters by developing ground-up, large-scale multi-purpose communities that cater to life sciences businesses at every stage of their life cycle, from start-up to scale-up and developed corporates. This can be seen in Central London - for example, White City's life sciences district which houses multiple global life sciences companies alongside Imperial College's White City Campus. This can also be seen in regional cities - for example, Alderley Park in Cheshire, which offers more than one million square feet of high specification lab space, a range of on-site scientific services, an accelerator delivering a comprehensive program of business support for start-ups and scale-ups, state-of-the-art connectivity and conference centers, and collaborative workspaces suitable for tech workers cohabitating near and working together with life sciences companies.James Sheppard of Kadans Science Partner in London comments: 'Although the creation of life science real estate is essential, it is also important to build and enhance the life science ecosystem - this can only happen by having a deep knowledge of a local ecosystems strengths and weaknesses.' Kadans see the UK as an area with significant growth potential and considerable opportunities both in and outside the Golden Triangle. 'The UK's academic research base is world class and its commercialization ability is increasing all the time, providing a pipeline of exciting high- growth companies. Although the UK life science market is changing, there are still considerable challenges in life science real estate. For example, understanding the technical requirements of tenants, the suitability of buildings and the covenants of life sciences companies mean the barriers to entry in life science real estate remain high.'It is clear that life sciences real estate is more than just an operational decision for life sciences companies - it can provide a competitive advantage through strategic access to talent, funding, innovation and shared resources. Not surprisingly, real estate investors in the U.S. and UK are looking to capitalize on this trend and we anticipate seeing a robust desire by a growing number of capital allocators, investors and developers to add life science investments to their portfolios. PART IV PREVIEW: The next article in the Envisioning the New Normal: Real Estate + Life Sciences series will explore some of the key considerations for landlords when underwriting new tenants operating in the life sciences industry. We will discuss the importance of understanding a company's science, as well as its funding and business model, and the ways in which landlords can seek to protect themselves against losses as a result of future financing difficulties and tenant specification packages. 1 \"Envisioning the New Normal in the Life Sciences Industry[6],\" Goodwinlaw.com2 PropSci Webpage[7], Goodwinlaw.com3 Cushman &amp;#38;

We are in the final hour of trading on Wall Street with the Dow on pace for its best day in months. Thank you, Jay Powell. We will be discussing that later in the show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for now, what you're looking at right now is live pictures outside Winfield House in London, of course. You can see the First Lady Melania Trump and President Donald Trump, of course. Guests will be arriving any moments and they will be welcoming them. This is the U.S. Ambassador's residence in London, of course. It will be capping the second day of President Trump's State Visit in the U.K.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They're just talking quietly as you can see to themselves as they await those guests. Bianca Nobilo, I think joins us now as we are awaiting the arrival of more people for the dinner. The Queen of course, not attending this dinner tonight. I don't believe, but she is going to be represented by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.</p><p>Bianca, are you with us? What more can we expect tonight? It's been a pretty whirlwind day, of course, a lot of politics and some interesting comments on trade, of course and the future relationship with the U.K., too. What do you make of it?</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you put it well, Julia. This dinner caps off these two days the Trumps have enjoyed in London. It is an affair which will be meticulously planned. The First Lady has a huge role in that.</p><p>It's held at the Ambassador's residence in Regent's Park. It is again another very lavish affair, but nothing on that State Banquet which we saw last night. And overall, the lawmakers I've been speaking to, the members of government that I've spoken to were concerned about this trip before it happened, and the main goal was that it would go off without great incident.</p><p>And so far, barring those insults towards the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan from President Trump right before he landed, it has managed to be given that there's a lot of controversy with President Trump priced in, it's managed to be a fairly successful trip.</p><p>The monarchy have done their job. They've allowed a smooth set of proceedings to go past with the Trumps, and they've enjoyed all of these spectacles together, which would have been very important to the President who is somebody who has expressed great reverence for the Royal Family. He has Scottish heritage himself.</p><p>So everything has gone pretty much the plan, even the news conference today and today was the day focused on politics and trade. So it was likely to be a little bit more controversial than yesterday, which was laden with Royal protocol.</p><p>Today, we had President Trump to be very conciliatory and he praised Prime Minister May who is resigning at the end of this week, but he said that she doesn't get enough credit and that he applauded her negotiating strategy, saying that she might even be a better negotiator than him -- a rare moment of self-deprecation from the President there.</p><p>He also weighed in somewhat to the conservative leadership contest, discussing how he liked Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt who he has had a lot of face time with over the last few days and mentioned Michael Gove.</p><p>But President Trump is known to interfere with domestic politics. He did that last time he was here for a working visit, by sharing his thoughts on Brexit and how it should be conducted.</p><p>So given what the expectations were, and they were low from the people I was speaking to, this has gone off pretty well as a visit so far.</p><p>So there will be many within government who will be breathing a sigh of relief, as far as the official proceedings go, that everything has gone pretty much to plan all the while there have all sleeping a lot of protest and huge opposition from the Labour Party Chief, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, who could potentially become Prime Minister, leading one of the protests against Donald Trump today and addressing everybody there, saying the focus should be on peace and stability.</p><p>And we later then found out the President Trump had actually invited -- sorry, that Jeremy Corbyn had actually invited Donald Trump to a meeting, but Donald Trump declined, he said, because Jeremy Corbyn was too focused on the negative, and he chose not to meet him and said he never had met him.</p><p>So there's been a couple of bumps in the road. But all in all, it's a side to President Trump we don't see often one, which was a lot more reverential, and certainly yesterday when the Queen was involved, a more refined and polite side of the President.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. And as you pointed out, as well, as far as the broader concerns were concerned here, sticking to the script, the President today, I think perhaps made a real difference.</p><p>And what you just saw there was live pictures of course of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall meeting President Trump and the First Lady and heading in to the U.S. Ambassador's residence there.</p><p>Hala, I'll bring you in here to and let you hand over for, as Bianca was describing, a pretty busy day so far.</p><p>[15:05:12] GORANI: Sure, we'll see you in a few minutes there, Julia, because we're starting to see these arrivals that Winfield House. One of our guests a few minutes ago said essentially this is the most beautiful residence in all of London with a garden the size of several football fields, that really this is going to be a lavish affair, not on the scale of a Royal Banquet at Buckingham Palace, obviously, but they're really going to be putting on, rolling out the red carpet for their guests -- key politicians, business leaders, VIPs -- both British and American are going to be invited to this event, to this reciprocal dinner as it's called to thank the Queen, Her Majesty, the Queen for the Banquet.</p><p>Prince Charles is representing, by the way, the Royal Family there with the Duchess of Cornwall. Bianca Nobilo joins me once again there from Winfield -- from actually, in fact, outside 10 Downing Street, but we do have a live feed from Winfield House. Who is expected to be on the guest list tonight? We saw Prince Charles that was expected, but who else?</p><p>NOBILO: The guest list is being kept pretty tight for this event. We do know that Prince Charles and Camilla will be in attendance tonight. Where all the focus has been today is on these other meetings which the President has held at Winfield House, which came as something of a surprise.</p><p>I was told by sources earlier in the week that there was so-called executive time for the President to use his discretion this afternoon, and he did. So he chose to meet with Nigel Farage, the man who is synonymous with the Brexit project, so called Mr. Brexit and they've had a bond that's gone back a year or two.</p><p>In fact, President Trump actually invited Nigel Farage onto the stage in one of his campaign events back in 2016 in America. Nigel Farage said that that was a good meeting that Trump was in -- was on good form that he believed in Brexit. So that meeting happened.</p><p>And then the President also met with two -- I don't think it would be unkind to say -- very peripheral figures in British politics. That would be Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party, and Owen Paterson, two Brexiteers, you wouldn't necessarily expect that the President would choose to meet with, they also visited him at Winfield House.</p><p>Now, we understand that an invitation was extended to Boris Johnson to meet with the President, but he declined that for this evening, because he wants to focus on a campaign event because this visit has happened and he is in the British media being intertwined with the Tory leadership contest, which is happening, even though it doesn't officially start until next week, it is already underway.</p><p>And Boris Johnson, who his sometimes referred to in the media as the British Trump, even though that's somewhat of an oversimplification, is considered to be the front runner in that contest -- Hala.</p><p>GORANI: All right, Bianca. We'll go back to Winfield House and to you as well, once we see more arrivals this evening. I want to bring in David Sim. He is a lecturer at University College London in U.S. History. Thanks for joining us. So special relationship, we heard that term a lot. Where does it originate?</p><p>DAVID SIM, HISTORIAN, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, the term itself originates in 1946. Churchill coins it in a speech that he gives after the Second World War to characterize this close relationship that of course, has won the Second World War, but it has deeper roots.</p><p>I mean, this is really a late 19th Century phenomenon. In the late 19th century, liberal elites in both the United States and Britain feel themselves confronting issues of immigration, of industrialization, of urbanization, and in this period, they feel a sense of shared identity. They struggled with the shared problems of modernity, but it's really at that point we're talking about here, the Age of Gladstone when this rhetoric first begins to emerge.</p><p>GORANI: So it has roots that, as you say, are much deeper. And these are themes that are current themes today. Anxieties about immigration, and whether or not shared, because we heard the Prime Minister and the President both talk about, quote, \"shared values and history,\" right?</p><p>SIM: I mean, I guess one of the primary differences here is that in this period in the late 19th Century, both Britain and the United States are outward facing. They are the engines of globalization.</p><p>What we're seeing this time is a reaction to globalization, both in Brexit --</p><p>GORANI: A retreat.</p><p>SIM: Absolutely. So in terms of the Brexit vote, and in terms of the Trump presidency, we're seeing a critique of globalization and the entrenchment of this relationship, which is no longer as outward looking and rather more insular now protecting these nations from globalized forces.</p><p>GORANI: Well, where once globalization benefited the countries, I guess, here they have, at least within their countries, groups of people who believe globalization is a threat.</p><p>SIM: Yes, yes, absolutely. And those are two groups that are in the ascendant, both in the United States and in Britain.</p><p>GORANI: Now, how will history remember this meeting -- this State Visit -- because there's been so much criticism directed at President Trump because of his rhetoric, because of how he is demonized in the eyes of some Muslims and immigrants and he has said things about women that were unsavory, et cetera and those who criticize Donald Trump and dislike him, some of them sometimes intensely don't believe he deserved a State Visit.</p><p>[15:10:15] SIM: No, of course. I think one of the kind of interesting paradoxes about this visit is that you're seeing a separation of Trump from the United States.</p><p>But actually, the Trump visit has given voice to a pro-American sentiment in its expression of anti-Trumpism. So British audiences who are obviously very anti-Trump have differentiated between the two and you're seeing a kind of sympathy with Americans who are also enduring the Trump presidency, just as we are enduring the Trump presidency.</p><p>GORANI: Right. Because here when you say obviously, he's not popular, you base that on what? On polling?</p><p>SIM: On opinion polls, on news coverage in general. I mean, he is really a divisive figure and an unpopular figure.</p><p>GORANI: But also, when you're saying this similar anti-immigrant and nationalistic forces, there's ideological kinship. There's not -- it's not an accident that the President today welcomed Nigel Farage, for instance, at Winfield House.</p><p>SIM: No, of course.</p><p>GORANI: Iain Duncan Smith who is a hard Brexiteer as well, former leader of the Conservative Party, he wanted to meet with Boris Johnson. Instead, they had a 20 minute phone call, because Boris Johnson is involved in a campaign event for the leadership of the party. So he is reaching out and wanting a relationship with those particular men.</p><p>SIM: Yes. And I mean, let's give him credit here. I mean, he is reading the wave of the future. I mean, one of the ironies of this trip is that it couldn't be worse -- worse times. Donald Trump is negotiating with a Prime Minister who has no political authority. He knows that, she knows that.</p><p>And in the sense, you can see the logic of meeting with this next generation of Tory leaders, people who six months from now, he is going to have to come back and deal with if that trade deal is going to get off the ground.</p><p>GORANI: It could have been even more awkward, you know how?</p><p>SIM: How is that?</p><p>GORANI: If the meaningful vote for had gone ahead on June 3rd and she'd lost.</p><p>SIM: Meaningful vote 72 --</p><p>GORANI: But that didn't happen.</p><p>SIM: Thank goodness. Thank you.</p><p>GORANI: So there was that off the table. David, maybe it's a really -- I don't know for the Prime Minister not having to worry about that. David Sim, thanks very much.</p><p>Julia, we will have much more a little bit later on this visit. Back to you for now in New York.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you very much for that and we look forward to it. All right, we're going to take a break here on the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, but for now, President Trump may be playing the gracious guest over in Britain, but back home, he is threatening to cause new rifts with America's neighbors warning Mexico once again that tariffs are coming.</p><p>And antitrust laws used for railroads back in the 1800s are the same laws that police Silicon Valley today in the United States. Congress though looking to change that. All that after this. Stay with us.</p><p>[15:15:19] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. Amid all the pomp and pageantry of his State Visit to Great Britain, President Trump couldn't resist the opportunity of sending a warning to his neighbors on the other side of the Atlantic.</p><p>Speaking alongside Theresa May, President Trump warned Mexico it will face tariffs by next week, and they'll keep going higher until it helps curb the flow of migrants across the U.S. border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try and enter our country and they could stop it very quickly, and I think they will.</p><p>And if they won't, we're going to put tariffs on and every month those terrorists go from 5 percent to 10 percent, to 15 percent, to 20 percent and then to 25 percent. And what will happen then is all of those companies that have left our country and gone to Mexico are going to be coming back to us and that's okay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: CNN senior White House correspondent Pam Brown joins us now from London. Great to have you with us, Pam. Can't help noticing the difference once again between the message that the President was sending and what we're hearing from the Mexicans here with the Foreign Minister saying there is 80 percent chance of reaching some kind of negotiated solution here. So what's going on?</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Right. Yes, it was a bit of a dichotomy there when you look at the comparison. President Trump at this joint press conference with Prime Minister May stood very firm on the tariffs on Mexico. It's a controversial policy.</p><p>Republicans on Capitol Hill have been trying to discourage this. They are against the President putting tariffs on Mexico, particularly for this reason to stem the flow of migrants - undocumented migrants over the border. They don't think that this is the solution.</p><p>And it did not appear from what you heard from President Trump today that they are close to reaching this deal. He was asked by a reporter about whether it was enough, whether what Mexico has done in the wake of that announcement in stemming the flow of undocumented migrants was enough. And the President said absolutely not, that those tariffs will go into effect on June 10th and they will continue to escalate.</p><p>And he also made clear that Mexico will pay for it, a very different to and from what you're hearing from Mexico, more optimism on that side, that something could be struck before the tariffs go into effect.</p><p>And what was interesting is on that moment, in particular, what you saw was vintage Trump. For the rest of the press conference, he really seemed sort of jovial. He was complimentary of Prime Minister May, something that we hadn't seen in a while. He had actually been critical of her in the past over her dealing with Brexit.</p><p>Today, though he said she deserves more credit, that perhaps she is a better negotiator than him. He was self-deprecating, which is something we rarely see from the President.</p><p>But when he came to Mexico, when he was asked about that, it was vintage Trump standing firm, saying, \"No, those tariffs will still go into effect. What Mexico has done to this point simply isn't enough.\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's going to be fascinating to watch particularly when you've got key Republican senators here going, \"This is the wrong thing to be doing at this moment.\" And it's prejudicing NAFTA mark two. It's going to be interesting to see. Pamela Brown, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, despite the harsh trade warnings from President Trump, U.S. markets were soothed by Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell speaking in Chicago today. Powell said the Fed could step into steady the ship if Donald Trump's trade war begins to rock the U.S. economy. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: I'd first like to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters. We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook. And as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let me give you a look at the effect of those remarks. We've got the Dow up around 450 points, its best day in fact, since February. The S&amp;P 500 climbing some 1.9 percent towards its biggest one-day gain since January, and the NASDAQ spiked by more than 2 percent back out of correction territory. So initially it was below 10 percent from the recent highs.</p><p>Paul La Monica with me to break it all down. Paul, I am mystified. I'm looking at the speech, \"We will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\" Markets are a party.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I think, Julia, clearly the investment community is interpreting \"act as appropriate\" as code for we will cut interest rates if the economy starts to backslide because of the effect of all these tariffs and the trade war that we are seeing.</p><p>It does seem like it is perhaps a bit of an overly ebullient reaction, but for the day at least, it is risk on type environment. Again, you look at the only two stocks I checked before coming up here that were actually lower today, Verizon which is a classic, defensive yield play.</p><p>[15:20:10] CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: And Coca-Cola, boring consumer staples. So everything else is higher.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So it's a risk-on day.</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As we, as we call it. You know, it's interesting. I spoke to Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz this week and he said, \"Look, the Fed needs to indicate that they are willing to cut rates here, because otherwise, we're going to find ourselves in a situation where the market throws a tantrum again,\" and perhaps we go back to the kind of sell off that we saw back in December. I mean, who is in charge here? Is it investors? Or is it the Federal Reserve?</p><p>LA MONICA: Unfortunately, you could argue that going back to the Bernanke years and then it continued with Janet Yellen, and now with Jerome Powell, the market does seem to have the sway over the Federal Reserve, for better for worse.</p><p>When the market throws a temper tantrum, the market, the Fed seems to act as if there's no other way than to just placate and give the market what it wants. As a parent of young children, I know that doesn't always work because they then take advantage of you, and that is what I think investors are doing to the Fed right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I guess we could make the point that we're only really taking back around as much as we've lost in the last couple of sessions, for example. I mean, we saw the big tech sell off yesterday in particular.</p><p>So if you look at it in that kind of light, then perhaps it's only taking back a little bit of what we've lost him and we're still significantly off the highs here, but still dangerous territory for the Federal Reserve.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think the key is when the Fed has its next meeting, and we see what those dot plots look like and what their economic projections are, and what Jerome Powell says in the press conference, is he going to signal that, yes, my bad, so to speak, we shouldn't have raised rates in December, we hear you loud and clear. Here comes the rate cut to take back the December rate hike.</p><p>But then we're going back on hold because hopefully, maybe politicians will get their act together and we'll have a trade deal and we won't need to cut rates further.</p><p>But that's going to be I think, very interesting. I'm not so sure the Fed wants to signal that it's going to aggressively cut rates when they're already low. And the job market is still healthy, and we're not necessarily in recession territory yet. So that's going to be I think, very interesting to see.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, another fine line to be walked by Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, the pinch of the President's Trump's trade war is being felt across the United States. In Arizona, on the border with Mexico, the City of Nogales imports nearly 3 million tons of Mexican produce a year. Now business leaders there say their livelihoods are at risk. Vanessa Yurkevich has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This month, Jaime Chamberlin is expecting truckloads full of grapes from Mexico. But he wasn't expecting to pay tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIME CHAMBERLAIN, PRESIDENT, CHAMBERLAIN DISTRIBUTING: So 5 percent for now is absolutely horrible. Going to 10, 15 percent, 20 percent, I can't even -- I can't even imagine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YURKEVICH (voice over): Chamberlain imports 100 percent of his fruits and vegetables from Mexico to his warehouse in Nogales, Arizona. If the President's tariffs take effect next week --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: We have red peppers coming out of Sinaloa.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YURKEVICH (voice over): Chamberlain, who voted for Trump, will pay more to bring his produce across the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAMBERLAIN: These are not good ideas and this is not the way I would do things. But this is the way the President is choosing to do things because of the Congress that we have. You know, I'm not always going to be on the side of the President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YURKEVICH (voice over): The U.S. imports $26 billion of agricultural products from Mexico each year, and manufacturing dwarfs that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD RUBIN, PRESIDENT, JAVID LLC: We're shipping $450 million annually across the border. For my customers to pay an extra $100 million, I'm not sure that they're going to stick around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YURKEVICH (voice over): Richard Rubin owns 26 factories in Mexico, importing materials for American companies which he says provides millions of U.S. jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUBIN: Mexico is our friend, right? Mexico deserves the respect and the dignity. It's not a business, it's a country. And this should be solved through diplomacy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YURKEVICH (voice over): Guillermo Valencia brokers trade deals between U.S. and Mexican companies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUILLERMO VALENCIA, PRESIDENT, VALENCIA INTERNATIONAL: We're throwing punches in the dark because we don't know what to expect. We know that we have to take this President serious. Some people are saying he is just threatening. But we can't just assume he is just threatening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YURKEVICH (voice over): As the broker, Valencia ensures tariffs are paid. His company imports and exports products to Mexico.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALENCIA: This is a component for a major U.S. manufacturer that's producing electric cars.</p><p>YURKEVICH (on camera): So this could be in someone's back seat one day?</p><p>VALENCIA: Absolute -- it will be in someone's back seat one day. So if you haven't bought this car yet, there's going to be an increased cost to this car.</p><p>YURKEVICH: Because of the tariffs?</p><p>VALENCIA: Because of the tariffs, right. And it could be up to 25 percent. And it could be more because if this product went back and through a couple of times, depending on the amount of times, it could be 50, 70 percent. Tariff upon tariff, upon tariff, upon tariff.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:25:09] CHATTERLEY: CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich reporting there for us. Now, the Trump administration imposed major new restrictions on travel to Cuba, saying Cuba plays a destabilizing force in the Western hemisphere, and a stark reversal of Obama era policy. The White House will ban most educational and recreational travel to the island.</p><p>U.S. Airlines tells CNN they will review the order and take the appropriate measures to comply. CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If you are a U.S. citizen, and you were hoping to go to Cuba and hadn't planned your trip just yet, you may have waited too long. The Trump administration on Tuesday rolled back much of the Obama-era opening with the communist-run island. It is going to be much more difficult for U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba now.</p><p>The Trump administration said that essentially what they've done is made it illegal to go to Cuba as a tourist, what they called veiled tourism that even though tourism is restricted, travel is restricted to Cuba.</p><p>Now one category of people who travel will no longer be allowed. These were the organized group tours, also how people came to Cuba on U.S. cruise ships, and that will no longer be prohibited. It's not clear if cruises will be prohibited as well. But it's going to be a lot tougher for Americans to go to the island.</p><p>It's essentially rolling back the changes that were made under President Obama and the Trump administration said they're doing this because of Cuba's assistance to Venezuela. Cuba is backing to the Maduro regime and the Cubans is quote, \"a communist foothold in the region.\"</p><p>This will obviously have an impact on the Cuban government. Hotels were full with Americans. Americans were the second largest category travelers after Canadians, so this will hurt the Cuban government.</p><p>It's always going to hurt U.S. cruises, U.S. airlines because you have less people coming from the U.S. and Cuban entrepreneurs. These are people who have opened up restaurants and Airbnb's and apartment rentals to meet this increased demand of all these Americans coming and there'll be many, many less Americans coming because even though while some categories of travel will still be allowed, this is really how many, if not most Americans came the island, and it will now be prohibited.</p><p>President Trump says that he is taking a very different tact towards Cuba, much more sanctions and the Cuban economy which is already suffering will likely suffer even more. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Mexico City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we're going to take a quick break here again, on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, but still to come, we'll be back live in London where President Trump is mixing business with pleasure, hinting at least about what a post Brexit trade deal with the U.K. might just look like. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>[15:30:00] JULIA CHATTERLEY, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Julia Chatterley, we'll be back to London and Hala in just a moment for the latest on President Trump's state visit to the U.K. First, though, let me give you the headlines on CNN at this hour.</p><p>Marking the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre when hundreds, possibly thousands of pro-democracy protestors were killed by security forces in Beijing. This candlelight vigil took place Tuesday in Hong Kong. Mainland China forbids any commemorations.</p><p>Sources are disputing last week's report the top North Korean diplomat was executed. The sources confirmed that Kim Chol was blamed for failure of February's U.S.-North Korea summit, that they say that instead of being executed, he was forced to sit in his office writing statements of self- criticism.</p><p>Sudan's military leaders are drawing international criticism after Monday's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. At least 35 people were killed. Sudan's transitional military council is promising national elections within nine months, but critics vow to continue their opposition.</p><p>The U.S. is announcing major new restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba. The new policy blocks organized tour groups and U.S. cruise ships from stopping in the island. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says the move is a result of Cuba playing a quote, \"destabilizing role in the western hemisphere\". And those are the headlines this hour. Now give you back to Hala in London. Hala?</p><p>HALA GORANI, HOST, GORANI TONIGHT: All right, Julia, thanks, see you in a little bit. The Trumps are playing host right now to the British royal family. They're holding a dinner at the U.S. ambassador's residence in London to cap the second day of President Trump's state visit here.</p><p>The queen is represented by her son, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. There you see them there in the footage just moments ago being welcomed by the U.S. President and Melania Trump. Now, for those of you interested in this sort of thing, would like to know the menu.</p><p>I understand that it opens with fresh tomatoes and burrata cheese before a grilled filet of beef. It's been a whirlwind day as the morning agenda turned from pomp to policy. First, it was a business breakfast at St. James' Palace before a press conference with the outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May.</p><p>The Trumps were then given a tour of the Churchill war rooms, that is the underground bunker from where Britain directed its war efforts against Nazi, Germany. Trans-Atlantic Trade was top of the agenda on Mr. Trump's second day in Britain. The president spent the morning at a breakfast with a U.K. business leaders.</p><p>And hours later, Mr. Trump repeated his calls for a trade agreement in a press conference. The president said a post-Brexit deal would have quote, \"phenomenal potential\", and claimed it could see U.S. trade with Britain double or even triple. Hadas Gold is in London, and Hadas, maybe you've seen the \"Evening Standard\", this is the front page, let's do this deal. This is what the U.K. press has picked up on at least so far at the end of day two of the state visit.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Hala, I don't think that you can look at all of the pomp and circumstance and the gracious way with which the U.K. welcomed President Trump without thinking in the back of your mind about that free-trade deal that the U.K. will definitely need and want after Brexit because they will be in a much different negotiating position they are currently as part of the EU.</p><p>Now, President Trump says that's a good thing for the U.K. and a good thing for the United States that they will negotiate an even better deal. And as you noted, he claims this would increase trade by even two to three times which could potentially -- I guess an inward trade is now just around 200 - - just over $200 billion a year, would really raise up the amount of trade between the U.S. and the U.K.</p><p>But the U.K. will be in an interesting position post-Brexit because the U.S. has already noted that it will want certain concessions in a potential free-trade deal with the United Kingdom.</p><p>[15:35:00] This includes everything from agricultural tariffs and changing the standards of the food that the U.K. accepts, that's where this whole idea of chlorinated chicken comes in here. But the EU has different standards than the U.S., and the U.K. could find itself in a precarious position trying to balance the U.S. won mandated concessions with the EU.</p><p>Now, the U.S., while it is the largest single country trading partner for the U.K., the EU as a nation -- as a collection of nations, more than 20 nations together, actually accounts for even more than the U.S. does. But still, the U.S. will be a very important trading partner because of the post-Brexit landscape where the U.K. will likely lose some of its trade with the EU and hopefully, it's hoping to make it up with the U.S. trade.</p><p>But for also Donald Trump made the statement today during that press conference about the National Healthcare System and opening up that as part of the trade deal, potentially letting U.S. companies be involved in the NHS by their selling of pharmaceuticals, even allowing U.S. companies to bid on contracts from the NHS, and that got quite a bit of blow-back here in the U.K. including from some candidates for Prime Minister like Matt Hancock saying that it's not going to be on the table.</p><p>But of course, all of this is dependent on Brexit and when and how that happens in October is the current deadline. But we still don't know what an actual Brexit deal will look like, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Right, indeed whether it will happen on October 31st, whether there will be an election before that or after that. It's also uncertain going forward, thanks very much Hadas Gold.</p><p>It's what the president might demand from the U.K. in return for striking a trade deal that has many people here worried as Hadas was saying there. Let's go to Kate Andrews; Associate Director at the Institute of Economic Affairs. The president is saying trade could increase two to three times. But in order for any of that to happen, certain markets need to be opened by the U.K., perhaps lowering some of the food safety standards or the agricultural standards that the U.K. has upheld and that most Britains are attached to in order to make that happen.</p><p>KATE ANDREWS, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS: I think this is a political storm in a tea cup. The reality is that if the NHS were put on the table by the USA, the U.K. could take it off the table during the negotiating process. The U.S. does not get to dictate all of the terms of a free-trade deal.</p><p>It's a deal for a reason, both sides have to come together. Also American companies already can put in bids and indeed win bids for NHS contracts. This isn't the breaking news that many people want to see it to be. The reality is that the NHS is a real sacred cow in the U.K. to call for any kind of change or any kind of reform as a big no, especially for politicians.</p><p>So I think that this is being built up in many ways, almost as a signaling point about how much one might care for the NHS. It seems deeply unlikely that the U.K. would negotiate --</p><p>GORANI: Yes --</p><p>ANDREWS: On the NHS. Agriculture seems more likely because the evidence around things like chlorinated chicken actually suggests that it can reduce the amount of food poisoning, but this is all going to be part of that negotiation. Nothing is said and done until both countries sign on the dotted line.</p><p>GORANI: Right, but then you have the U.K. in a much more vulnerable position post-Brexit. It might lose some of its trade with the EU, certainly the weaker partner here in any trade negotiation with the U.S. as opposed to when it's part of an economic bloc like the European Union.</p><p>ANDREWS: So certainly the case that when any country or bloc is doing a trade deal with the U.S., it can be a difficult circumstance. U.S. is a big power from that perspective. But there are some benefits for Britain being out on its own. For example, it can decide what its own red lines are. If the EU is doing a free-trade deal with the U.S., which it is attempting to do at the moment, all the countries have to sign up to.</p><p>But the U.K. is in a much better position to do something faster. Now, you make a very good point, whatever the U.K. decides with the U.S., they then in turn have to turn to the EU and say, are you comfortable if any U.S. products potentially get over the border?</p><p>It's not going to be a walk in the park. But it's certainly the case that Britain out on its own can probably draw up deals faster and just stick to its own red lines rather than having to take into account the red lines of the other 27 countries in the European Union.</p><p>GORANI: Sure -- oh, it gives you more flexibility, whether it gives you more negotiating powers and other questions. And by the way, Kate, I want to tell you that we have some news about who will be attending this reciprocal dinner. So we understand that the first lady will be sitting next to the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla, the spouse of Prince Charles and Mr. May, unsurprising seating arrangement there.</p><p>President Trump is sitting between the Prince of Wales and the Prime Minister as well. We understand Secretary Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary and the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ambassador Bolden who is a national security adviser, Sarah Sanders who is the press secretary, Mick Mulvaney, Tony Blair is part of this, and then --</p><p>ANDREWS: Yes --</p><p>GORANI: Obviously other assembled VIPs. Tony Blair, I wonder, what's your -- there were rumblings that he would be attending this dinner. What do you make of that?</p><p>[15:40:00] ANDREWS: Well, they've brought in all of the big political hitters. Tony Blair is a very interesting character in British politics at the moment, because obviously, he represented and oversaw such a successful time for the Labor Party in U.K. politics.</p><p>But the Labor Party has very much shifted to the left. Many in the party now denounce many aspects of Tony Blair. But of course, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he also helped facilitate that very special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K., and you might think if the Prime Minister attended something similar in the U.S. that former presidents could be invited.</p><p>It doesn't strike me as that odd. But my goodness, what -- to be a fly on the wall and to be able to talk about what politics was like back in the '90s and early 2000s --</p><p>GORANI: Yes --</p><p>ANDREWS: Compared to what it's like now, the rhetoric, everything has so dramatically changed.</p><p>GORANI: Sure, Kate Andrews, thanks very much, really appreciate it. Julia, I have actually a more detailed version of this menu. So heritage tomatoes with fresh burrata and garden basil which is basically mozzarella to me, grilled filet of beef, pommes anna, watercress puree, you have some carrots to go with that. And then for dessert, summer berries, home-made vanilla ice cream and Muscovado Sugar -- I'm not sure how to pronounce that one? Trille(ph), yes, it's a French word, isn't it? Yes.</p><p>So, what do you make of that, Julia?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Where's the chocolate?</p><p>GORANI: It's such a pretty basic menu, I mean, so was the banquet menu, I don't know where the chocolate is. What is the chocolate?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes --</p><p>GORANI: I don't think they had chocolate yesterday either.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No, I know, I'm like skip to the dessert and work backwards. Where's the chocolate? It sounds very nice --</p><p>GORANI: Exactly --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, no indigestion in this meal.</p><p>GORANI: No, absolutely, simple and solid, I like that type of menu, nothing too complicated. Anyway, that's what we have for you for now, Julia. We'll have a lot more on CNN a little bit later. But for now, back to you in New York.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you very much, and again, we'll look forward to that, certainly I like talking about food and the dresses of course as well. Camilla and the first lady looking beautiful. All right, coming up on the show, Silicon Valley bashing is well and truly en vogue. Democrats, Republicans, Americans and Europeans, they're all getting in on the regulatory reaction. The question is, will it have bite? We'll discuss.</p><p>[15:45:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the era of self-regulation is over for Silicon Valley. Democrats have warned Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google that the anti- trust investigation is coming. Representative David Cicilline is leading the charge. He says it's time for laws from the 1800s to finally be updated.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): These are statutes that were written mostly during the time of the railroad monopolies. Is a very different economy today. So one of the things we're going to have to look at is do our anti- trust statutes today meet the needs of the 21st century economy? Is price the only relevant consideration?</p><p>I think that's one of the things we have to look at. But no one should think all of this is free. This is data which is being collected, used and so this also preventing competitors from entering the marketplace which typically will drive down prices. So, the question about anti-competitive conduct and what it means to the consumer is a real issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Attacking Silicon Valley is clearly popular these days. Donald Trump and the Republicans claim the likes of Facebook and Google have a quote, \"anti-conservative bias\". The president has criticized Apple for manufacturing outside the United States and he says incorrectly accused Amazon of abusing the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>Democrats meanwhile slam social media companies for not doing enough to stop fake news. Now, they're launching this anti-trust investigation and threatening new legislation to rein them in. At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have struck a rare deal.</p><p>The FTC will be keeping an eye on the likes of Amazon and Facebook, while the Department of Justice, DOJ will be watching Apple and Google. Of course, across the Atlantic, the U.S. has been a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley for years and it shows no sign of letting up.</p><p>Maureen Ohlhausen is the former commissioner at the FTC and she's now partner of Baker Botts anti-trust practice. Maureen, fantastic to chat you again and to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS once again. Is it true when you hear someone saying that the kind of laws that we're using right now date back to the 1800s, that's what we're using to tackle Silicon Valley today. I mean, that's a travesty, surely.</p><p>MAUREEN OHLHAUSEN, FORMER COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Well, the laws are written very generally to stop any competitive conduct or agreements. And there's been a hundred years of court interpretation and agency enforcement doctrine to update those laws to the modern day.</p><p>So, there's been major enforcement actions against companies like Microsoft, IBM before that. So the anti-trust laws have kept up, though, I think there is a question about whether they're -- they need additional powers or changes to the current anti-trust laws.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, you made that point, the last time you were on the show, you said, look, the FTC can only act with the teeth or the bite that Congress has given it right now. Do you think when you look at the noises that we're hearing from both the Democrats and the Republicans here, that we could actually see the two sides come together and give more powers to regulators because surely otherwise we're not going to see real potent progress here on greater regulation?</p><p>OHLHAUSEN: Well, I disagree that we necessarily need more regulation. I think the question is, is there any competitive conduct happening in the markets today? Do the agencies have the right level of enforcement and the right tools to challenge it? And then if there's a decision that there's anti-competitive conduct and somehow it can't be reached, I think at that point is where the discussion is necessary to say, do the anti-trust laws need to do something different?</p><p>But I don't think we're at that point yet. I think we're still trying to figure out those first two questions.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you see anti-competitive behavior when you look at these big companies, the Amazons, the Apples, the Facebooks, the Googles?</p><p>OHLHAUSEN: Well, not necessarily because one of the things we need to have a clear handle on is what is actually anti-competitive. If you're competing hard and you're offering consumers the best choices, the best options, you're bringing out new products, better prices, more convenience and you end up winning the race, that's not illegal under American anti- trust law.</p><p>Ad I would be concerned if that was illegal. But on the other hand, if you have companies who are taking actions to keep competitors out of the market, not by competing the hardest, but by engaging in some kind of exclusionary behavior that doesn't benefit consumers. That's where anti- trust agencies should focus their attention.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's quite fascinating to me, because if I look at the approach the Europeans have taken, they've tackled Google, Alphabet, time and time again, and they've pushed for this and they've actually fined them. And yet, the United States is in -- bit on the back foot on this and hasn't. So is there a mismatch?</p><p>[15:50:00] You're saying actually that the Europeans are getting it wrong or actually is the United States -- to your point earlier on the show, lacking bite.</p><p>OHLHAUSEN: So there's a different law in Europe, it's called the abuse of dominance standard, whereas in the U.S., we are looking at whether there is anti-competitive conduct. And they're slightly different standards.</p><p>I think one of the questions is whether there are negative impacts for consumers, not just competitors, but for consumers that the U.S. anti-trust laws can't reach. And I think that's where the conversation should be focused.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, what we saw in the markets yesterday was $130 billion to $140 billion of market cap wiped out for some of these big tech players. Even in our wildest imaginations, any kind of fine that's coming is going to be nowhere near that size quite frankly. And even if it does come, there are those who look at this and say, look, it's going to take years.</p><p>Would you agree the action, affirmative action to do something about this could take years if it even comes?</p><p>OHLHAUSEN: If there is an enforcement action, if any of these changes are signals lead to any kind of investigations, then complaints, then litigation through the courts, it will take several years. Now, Congress is considering some members of Congress, Mr. Cicilline in particular mentioned this, they're considering whether the anti-trust laws should be changed.</p><p>I think that also would take several years. But anti-trust law is not the only factor that affects competition in the market, and even the hearings in the house are focusing on this. Are there other regulations that might be dampening a competition that can be changed more quickly rather than bringing a largest anti-trust enforcement action or trying to get the anti- trust laws themselves changed. Are there other types of regulation that need to be examined as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, this conversation just convinced me there's a huge buying opportunity in some of these names. Maureen, wow, thank you so much for that. Maureen Ohlhausen speaking there --</p><p>OHLHAUSEN: My pleasure --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you for joining us. All right, we're going to take a quick break, when we return, Facebook investors clambering for change when it comes to Mark Zuckerberg's control. The problem is they're not going to get it. We'll discuss, stay with us.</p><p>[15:55:00] CHATTERLEY: Facebook feeling pressure from its own shareholders according to a new regulatory filing. Sixty eight percent of ordinary investors want Mark Zuckerberg ousted as chairman. That's up from 51 percent last year. The catch is, the man they want out holds 58 percent of the voting power and overruled them at this year's meeting. CNN's Heather Kelly joins me now.</p><p>Heather, it was a symbolic shareholder revoke because no matter what they vote for here, it means absolutely nothing because Mark Zuckerberg holds all the power.</p><p>HEATHER KELLY, CNN BUSINESS TECH EDITOR: Yes, and this isn't the first time they've had one of these symbolic votes. They seem to be doing it kind of every year these days, knowing full well that as they're not named Zuckerberg, their votes ultimately won't matter enough to make a difference.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When will it ever make a difference? I'm just looking at what the votes were, 83 percent of outside shareholders as we call them, they also backed a proposal to try and scrap this dual class structure in the shares that mean and allow Mark Zuckerberg to be so much more powerful.</p><p>I mean, even if that gets to a 100 percent, it's irrelevant, you either own the stock and you just get on with it or you sell the stock and move on.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, and I think that was basically the plan when it was set up like this seven years ago when Facebook went public. Mark and a number of insiders, some co-founders, Sheryl Sandberg, they have these voting shares that are worth ten times as much as regular shareholders, and it's exactly for these reasons. So when there are down times or controversies, they can kind of keep their leadership the same and carry on with minimal pressure from the outside.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting and you make the great point, Heather that this was the case when they went public. They make this clear to investors right from the get-go. This is the structure, like it or leave it --</p><p>KELLY: Yes --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And we've seen other companies recently, Pinterest for example doing exactly the same thing. There's nothing wrong with this and they're making it clear to shareholders. It's simply a choice thing.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, and Lyft also. So I think a number of the companies --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes --</p><p>KELLY: That are choosing to IPO this year kind of have that decision to make. Are they going to go the Facebook route, keep more control and it seems to kind of have minimal pushback --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Heather, I'm just going to interrupt you actually because I do want to get to London -- apologies for this, but we are getting some live pictures from inside the dinner that President Trump is hosting for the royal family in London. I just want to bring in Hala Gorani as we listen in and see if we can hear anything that's going on.</p><p>I can see a smiling President Trump there, sitting next to Prince Charles, of course, as we were expecting. And Hala, you were saying this earlier that the seating arrangement here obviously very interesting as well.</p><p>GORANI: Certainly, I mean, it's unsurprising there because this is a reciprocal dinner and Prince Charles is representing the queen at this dinner, he would be seated to the right of Melania Trump, the first lady. I'm seeing -- catching a glimpse there of Ivanka Trump at the next table, Theresa May seated to the left of the U.S. president.</p><p>We're seeing Prince Charles as you mentioned as well. There's Melania Trump to her left, is the spouse, Mr. May, who is obviously the husband of the outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May. And there you have kind of an assembled group of VIPs from the business world, from the political world.</p><p>I also saw Jeremy Hunt who's the Foreign Secretary and who is a man who was praised by the president today during that news conference in London. He is one of the leading contenders for the leadership of the Conservative Party and a hopeful in terms of becoming the next Prime Minister alongside Boris Johnson who is the front-runner.</p><p>So everybody seemed in a relaxed mood and people have remarked that the president of the United States himself seemed quite relaxed over the last several days. And that's our first glimpse of what's going on inside Winfield House for this reciprocal dinner that is going on as we speak, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it was fascinating to see, and I agree with your point, everything that I watched today, a very comfortable, relatively comfortable president of the United States and Theresa May, I'd argue too. I mean, quite nice for her to be able to do this and not have to worry about the implications afterwards and negotiating any broader trade deal as well.</p><p>We'll continue to watch the developments if we get any further live --</p><p>GORANI: Yes --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Pictures on CNN, we will bring them to you. But I just want to give you a look right now at the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street. We got the Dow up some 514 points right now, it looks like it's going to be the best day for the Dow since February as we were discussing earlier. The S&amp;P climbing around 1.9 percent, the biggest one day gain since January if indeed we manage to close at that level.</p><p>The Nasdaq up over 2.6 percent as you can see out of correction territory as a result of the rally. Only two stocks are keeping the Dow from going 30 for 30 in the green. As Paul La Monica mentioned, Coca-Cola and Verizon are down. Two of the consumer staples, Nike the leader up more than 5 percent, Apple also jumping 3.5 percent.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>And that is the closing bell this Wednesday. Of course, you can see the caucus there, Skechers, in fact, ringing the closing bell this evening.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019060401cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8H-FYP1-DXH2-610H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Tiananmen Square</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cuba</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.K.</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

This report is a go-to resource to understand and build individuals knowledge of the burgeoning virtual health assistant space in healthcare.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commercial models are still nascent, the technology (AI) is premature, clinical evidence is sparse, integration into existing EMRs/health records is incomplete, and data security concerns exist. Despite all of this we explore if AI assistants rise above being \"second-class concierge\".</p><p>In the virtual AI combination space, think of reduced admin burden for HCPs, think of reduced consultation time and outpatient clinic time, think of an informed and engaged patient in control of their health and disease, think of a hospital whose beds are not full, think of an insurance plan that you understand clearly. The utopian world of healthcare in our minds could actually be reality if we do this right. This is huge.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>- End user perception<br/>- The willingness of consumer  clinicians to use VHA's<br/>- Adoption of VHA's to date<br/>- Commercial models are still nascent<br/>- The technology (AI) is premature<br/>- Clinical evidence is sparse<br/>- Integration into existing EMRs incomplete<br/>- Data security concerns<br/>- Integrated part of healthcare delivery</p><p>Countries Covered:</p><p>- UK<br/>- USA<br/>- India<br/>- UK<br/>- Germany<br/>- China<br/>- Australia</p><p>Audience</p><p>Anyone in the healthcare space interested in VHAs (HCPs, Start-Ups, Pharma, Payers, Big Tech, Patients, etc).
