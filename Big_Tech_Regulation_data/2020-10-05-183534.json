And the technology companies themselves are not immune --\u00a0their business plans could be derailed as the shutdown\u00a0prevents agencies from responding\u00a0to regulatory filings and causes delays in\u00a0reviews of new devices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The effect of the shutdown on the tech sector puts a fine point on the increasing interdependence of Washington and Silicon Valley. Though technologists have long tried to keep an arms distance from policymakers and regulators, here are some ways this industry can't escape the reach of the stalemate between the White House and Democrats in Congress:\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             1. The Federal Trade Commission is closed for business - tying up the federal agency responsible for policing Big Tech.          </p><p>In the wake of multiplescandals at Facebooklast year, the FTC's closely watched investigation into the social network and whether it violated a 2011 order from the agency intended to safeguard users' data is\u00a0on hold, as my colleague Brian Fung reported.\u00a0\"The key part of any investigation is the information-gathering stage, which is revealing documents and talking to people,\" David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau, told Brian. \"It just stops. And it has to stop in an organized way.\"</p><p>The agency is shut down as there is growing support in Congress to expand its resources, staffing and rulemaking authority to take on more technology issues, such as privacy. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii)\u00a0last year introduced privacy legislation that would give the agency these broader authorities, and it gained support from Senate Democrats but not Senate Republicans.</p><p>             2. The SEC is operating in a limited capacity - potentially stymying a rush of long-awaited tech companies to the public markets.          </p><p>This was supposed to be the year the initial public offering floodgates opened - and we would finally see trading begin on billion-dollar start-ups such as\u00a0Uber, Lyft and Pinterest. The timeline for those IPOs is now up in the air, \u00a0as Bloomberg reported. Uber and Lyft have both filed confidentially, but neither has received feedback on their submissions from the SEC.</p><p>It's not just the Silicon Valley darlings that are impacted. The Wall Street Journal reported that some biotech companies planning to list shares in January have had to push back their plans because of the shutdown.</p><p>In past shutdowns, the SEC has been able to draw on surplus cash to remain open during government shutdowns. It did not have the funds available to do that this time, according to the Journal.</p><p>             3. Robo-call and identity theft victims are left in the lurch.          </p><p>Don't expect the onslaught of spam phone calls to stop while the government is shut down, my colleague Tony Romm reported. Federal regulators aren't around to take consumers' complaints or investigate the most egregious offenders. \"It's a neighborhood with no police on the beat,\" Alex Quilici, the chief executive of an app that helps users block robo-calls, told Tony.</p><p>And victims of identity theft are also left without a clear avenue for restitution. Louette Duvall, a 67-year-old woman who had her purse with all her credit cards stolen, told NBC News that she tried to contact the FTC after the incident. No one at the closed agency answered the phone, and its identity theft website said the service was down because of the shutdown. \"It was like I can't stop it and my government is not there to help,\" she told NBC.</p><p>             4. The Federal Communications Commission isn't certifying new devices heading to market.          </p><p>Radio frequency devices such as phones and TVs undergo an often lengthy process to get certified by the Federal Communications Commission. That's not happening during the shutdown, as Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat on the committee, pointed out:</p><p>Though businesses are used to waiting a long time to have these devices approved, a prolonged government shutdown could affect their timelines for rolling out new products.</p><p>             5. Stories of employees without paychecks could affect government's ability to recruit top tech and science talent.          </p><p>There are also implications for tech efforts by\u00a0government, which has an uphill battle when it comes to recruiting tech and science talent. It can't offer the cushy perks or lofty salaries that come with positions in Silicon Valley. But as\u00a0the Verge noted,\u00a0the threat of weeks without pay may make federal government jobs less appealing to a young generation of scientists.</p><p>\"I don't know if I want a job that could be used as a pawn to further someone's agenda,\" Kathleen Farley, a graduate student at Rutgers University at Newark, told the Verge.</p><p>             6. Dozens of government websites have been rendered insecure or inactive.          </p><p>Some NASA, Justice Department and other government agency websites were insecure or not working as of today because important security certificates had expired,\u00a0according to a report from Internet security company Netcraft.\u00a0With so many federal employees out, the agencies probably\u00a0do not have the IT resources to renew the certificate.</p><p>It's not the only IT issue the shutdown is posing for the government. A key vote on legislation to elevate the position of federal chief information officer to a presidentially appointed position has been delayed, probably until after the shutdown, Politico reported on Friday.\u00a0One of the bill's sponsors told Politico the shutdown is putting the government behind in tech recruiting.</p><p>             Correction: A previous version of today's newsletter misidentified the state Sen. Brian Schatz\u00a0represents. The senator is from Hawaii.\u00a0          </p><p>             BITS: Trump said his administration will shake up\u00a0the way it manages temporary H1-B visas that enable American\u00a0firms to bring qualified professionals such as tech workers to the United States, the Associated Press's Colleen Long and Deb Reichmann reported. The tech industry has stressed the importance of this\u00a0visa and supporters of the program say that it encourages students to remain in the United States once they obtain a diploma in a high-tech domain.</p><p>\"H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,\" Trump said in a tweet\u00a0Friday.\u00a0\"We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.\" Trump's tweet probably referred to changes that the Department of Homeland Security proposed late last year\u00a0- though\u00a0the final changes have not been published yet.\u00a0\"The proposal included a shift to online applications for the coveted visas and changed procedures to increase the advantages of applicants with graduate degrees,\" according to the AP.          </p><p>             NIBBLES: The prevalence on YouTube last week\u00a0of conspiracy theories about the health of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has recently undergone\u00a0cancer surgery, shows that the video platform's efforts to prevent its\u00a0algorithm from promoting misinformation are still falling short, The Washington Post's\u00a0Tony Romm and Drew Harwell reported. On Wednesday, more than half of the top 20 search results\u00a0for Ginsburg's initials \"RBG\" in YouTube directed users to false far-right videos, with most of this false content coming\u00a0from\u00a0QAnon, a fringe movement.</p><p>             \"The algorithm rewarded the conspiracy videos over reliable news based on what it calculated was their 'relevance,' signaling that the videos were probably new, popular or suitable to the search,\"\u00a0my colleagues wrote. \"By Thursday, a day after YouTube was contacted by The Washington Post, searches for 'RBG' also surfaced multiple videos from mainstream news organizations.\" The conspiracy theories about\u00a0Ginsburg's health also extended to Twitter. Additionally, data from CrowdTangle, a social-monitoring company, showed that several Facebook groups also discussed the theories.</p><p>             BYTES: Automation stands to deeply alter the service industry and cut down on workers' hours, according to the Atlantic's Sidney Fussell.\u00a0 However, it's unlikely automation will replace these jobs outright or impact hourly wages.\u00a0For instance,\u00a0\"partial automation\" could turn a two-person job at a front desk overnight\u00a0into a one-person job where an employee would be assisted by a robot, Fussell noted.    Service workers worry about the trend: Employees of Marriott International asked that their jobs not be taken over by robots as part of their demands during a strike late last year.</p><p>             \"Automated experiments include robots that take over bartending and salad-making duties on cruise ships and in airports, and that deliver food to hotel guests' rooms,\" according to the Atlantic.\u00a0\"More hotels are offering automated check-in via app or even - in China - via facial recognition. Alexa-enabled speakers in hotel rooms let guests ask for sightseeing tips and order toothbrushes without talking to staff.\" (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, which makes the virtual assistant Alexa, is the owner of The Washington Post.)</p><p>             - Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei\u00a0fired a Chinese employee who was detained in Poland on suspicion\u00a0of spying, The Post's\u00a0Anna Fifield\u00a0reported. Huawei\u00a0said Wang Weijing, who also goes by Stanislaw Wang, brought the company \"into disrepute\" and sought to distance itself from him. \"Huawei has decided to terminate the employment of Mr. Wang Weijing, who was arrested on suspicion of breaking Polish law. His alleged actions have no relation to the company,\" the company said in a statement. A Polish citizen employed by the European carrier Orange and who used to work for a Polish\u00a0intelligence agency was also detained, Anna reported. He and Wang have denied the charges.</p><p>             -\u00a0Elon Musk's SpaceX\u00a0intends to cut its workforce by 10 percent,\u00a0according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Andy Pasztor. Such reduction would amount to about 600 employees.\u00a0\"The move, believed to be the most significant cutback since SpaceX gained international prominence about a decade ago, is the latest sign of major strategic and technical challenges roiling the closely held Southern California company,\"\u00a0Pasztor\u00a0wrote.</p><p>             - More tech news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - Furloughed federal workers are being recruited via social media to work for companies such as Uber, Lyft and Postmates, according to BuzzFeed News's\u00a0Caroline O'Donovan. People who have encouraged furloughed employees to join\u00a0gig economy companies during the shutdown often have a financial incentive\u00a0to refer potential new workers.\u00a0\"Companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Postmates, and Instacart offer these workers the opportunity to earn money as independent contractors without having to get a new job,\" BuzzFeed News reported.\u00a0\"Government employees are allowed to take outside work during the shutdown, as long as it doesn't violate the government ethics rules that typically apply to their employment.\"</p><p>             However, Debra Roth, managing partner at Shaw Bransford &amp; Roth, told Nextgov's\u00a0Frank Konkel\u00a0that furloughed workers who moonlight could endanger their employment.\u00a0\"They could be risking their jobs or other administrative charges against them,\" Roth said. \"Depending upon your job activity and the agency you work for, the agency may or may not allow you to have to outside employment.\"</p><p>             - William P. Barr, Trump's nominee for attorney general, said he would recuse himself from the Justice Department's review of the proposed merger of\u00a0AT&amp;T and Time Warner should he be confirmed, according to a news release\u00a0from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Klobuchar said that Barr, a former board member of\u00a0Time Warner, made the commitment during a meeting with her.</p><p>\"As Ranking Member of the Antitrust Subcommittee and as someone deeply concerned about maintaining a marketplace that benefits consumers, it is critically important that the Justice Department is able to complete an unbiased review of the proposed AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"Given Mr. Barr's ties to Time Warner, this commitment from Mr. Barr to recuse himself from the Department's review is necessary.\"          </p><p>             - More tech news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Warnings are increasing\u00a0about the perils that electric scooters can represent for pedestrians, according to my colleague\u00a0Peter Holley, who reported that\u00a0doctors in five cities said trauma centers receive pedestrians who are badly injured in incidents involving those devices several times a week.\u00a0Lime and Bird, two of the biggest e-scooter firms, said safety is a priority.\u00a0Lime said it seeks to \"promote safe-riding behavior and proper etiquette\" with an investment of more than $3 million while Bird said it gives safety information that's adapted to local laws in its app, Peter reported.</p><p>             - Meanwhile, Lime is also facing troubles abroad.

It will mark the first time lawmakers will hear from executives in a public setting about going toe-to-toe with companies including Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google, my colleague Tony Romm reports. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          These smaller companies are taking a major risk by speaking out because they often rely on the tech titans to reach consumers' eyeballs, while simultaneously competing in with them in offering some services. Another factor raising the stakes is the industry's relationship-driven business culture. One wrong move can limit opportunities for investment or acquisitions.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"They face potential for very significant economic retribution as a result of what they share,\" David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat at the helm of the antitrust investigation, told Tony. \"We have certainly heard from a number of companies about the practices of large technology companies that are very troubling, that have had negative consequences for other businesses, that they are unwilling to share in a public forum.\"       </p><p>             The congressional field hearing has the potential to open the floodgates for companies to be more forthcoming with their concerns about allegedly anti-competitive conduct. The companies in the hot seat come from across the country and make very different products - highlighting how a broad range of corporations have grievances against Big Tech and might look to Congress for help.\u00a0          </p><p>Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement at the Open Markets Institute, an organization backed by groups that advocate for breaking up Big Tech, told Tony the public nature of the hearing will lead to more transparency.\u00a0</p><p>\"We don't often hear from those entrepreneurs because they can't afford to speak out,\" Hubbard said. \"We haven't had a look under the hood of these companies.\"</p><p>          The chief executive of Sonos, Patrick Spence, said he kept quiet for years before going public with his concerns.\u00a0The audio company executive told Tony the company's brand and business \"puts me in a unique position to speak up about our experience and still be able to thrive and grow.\"</p><p> \"I feel a duty to do that given there are many smaller companies that aren't going to have the same ability to do that. It might be life or death for them,\" Spence said.</p><p>          Here's a guide to the anti-competitive concerns each company is expected to raise, based on Tony's interviews with each of the witnesses.\u00a0       </p><p>             1. PopSockets chief executive David Barnett says he will accuse Amazon of bullying tactics, which prompted the smartphone kickstand maker to sever its two-year relationship with the e-commerce giant's retail operation in November.\u00a0          </p><p>          PopSockets said its lengthy battle with Amazon cost the company millions. The company tried to get the e-commerce giant's help with counterfeits on the website, only to be pressured to spend more on its own marketing. The company also worried about a series of changes to Amazon policies that essentially forced it to sell directly to Amazon, allowing the titan to set the prices of its products it later sold to customers.       </p><p>          PopSockets ultimately opted to sever its two-year relationship with Amazon's retail division. Barnett said Amazon leaders tried -- unsuccessfully -- to pressure the company even when PopSockets said it had reached its breaking point.       </p><p>          \"They acted as if it wasn't in our power to break up with them,\" he said. \"That's where the antitrust power comes in. For most businesses our age, it's not in their power to break up with Amazon. It's not within their power to find an alternative.\"       </p><p>Amazon said the conflict arose because PopSockets essentially broke its rules. Amazon prohibits a firm from simultaneously selling through another intermediary that could later undercut the e-commerce giant on price.</p><p> \"Amazon obsesses over our customer experience and we have policies for brands to ensure they are consistently meeting customer expectations,\" said Jack Evans, a spokesman at Amazon.</p><p>          PopSockets is trying to restart its relationship with the e-commerce giant. Barnett hopes the company can make changes on its own, and if not, he thinks Washington should step in.\u00a0       </p><p>             2. Tile general counsel Kirsten Daru says she will warn that Apple stifles services like its business that help people locate lost belongings.          </p><p>          Tile was long in Apple's good graces, but their relationship deteriorated in 2019, when Apple moved toward rolling out \"Find My,\" an enhanced effort to help its customers better locate their lost devices even when they are offline. It mimics many of the features long offered by Tile, and also has a major leg up: Apple made \"Find My\" functional even when iPhone owners turn off all location tracking.       </p><p>          Tile, meanwhile, must obtain users' permission in hard-to-find settings, Daru said, then repeatedly give it again when presented with reminders. Daru said it resulted in a \"confusing and frustrating experience for our users.\" \"We're looking to Congress to level the playing field.\"       </p><p>Apple said the changes are about protecting users' privacy. \"Apple has not built a business model around knowing a customer's location or the location of their device,\" spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement.</p><p>             3. Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson plans to blast Google's dominant search engine, which he says favors larger collaborative workplace rivals that pay for prime advertising real estate.          </p><p>          \u00a0The well-known programmer said he plans to tell regulators to \"broaden your definition of what antitrust enforcement is, and what consumer harm looks like.\"       </p><p>          Basecamp's rivals for months have been running ads on Google against the company's name and trademark, making it harder for people who search for Basecamp's name to find it in the results.\u00a0       </p><p>Google's practices puts smaller players like Basecamp in a position where they have to buy advertising just to compete on Google search, Hansson says. \"If you want protections from these baseless, anticompetitive ads,\" he said, \"you have to pay [Google] protection money.\"       </p><p>          \"They built their monopoly by having a great search engine that really helped people,\" he said. \"Now that they have that monopoly, they're exploiting it to reap monopoly profits.\"       </p><p>Google spokesman Jose Castaneda pushed back against Basecamp's claims. He said competitors are allowed to \"bid on trademarked terms because it offers users more choice when they are searching.\"</p><p>             4. Spence, of Sonos, will say that Google stole its technology for use in its competing smart-home tools.\u00a0          </p><p>          Last week, Sonos revealed in court documents it is suing Google on these grounds. Google has denied the charge, and this week said Sonos has made \"misleading statements.\"\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>In testimony, Spence said he plans to raise awareness as to the ways tech giants practice what he called \"efficient infringement.\" For some of those companies, the calculation is that \"over the long term we'll just pay the fines. We can outlast anybody else given the war chest they have. By the time the war finishes we'll have dominated the category anyways,\" he said.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg will hold a private event in San Francisco to solicit support from some of the tech industry's biggest power brokers,Recode's Theodore Schleifer writes. The event highlights how the world's eighth richest person could win over wealthy supporters who are concerned about liberal Democrats' anti-billionaire rhetoric.\u00a0</p><p>          The event was described as \"a private gathering of business and community leaders to hear directly from Mike on his path to victory,\" according to a copy of an invitation seen by Recode. Bloomberg's direct pitch to the tech industry, where he has deep financial ties, highlights how he's continuing to seek support from Silicon Valley, even as other candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are rejecting their support.\u00a0       </p><p>\"Mike is supporting Democrats and that's what this event is about,\" a Bloomberg spokesperson told Recode. \"These are people who want to support the Democratic Party and we're bringing them together to help candidates up and down the ballot. As everyone knows, Mike has never taken a penny from special interests and as a tech entrepreneur himself, he appreciates the creativity, job creation, and ecosystem of innovation in this community.\"</p><p>The Bloomberg's campaign has invited Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Ron Conway, LinkedIn co-founder founder Reid Hoffman and political fundraiser Susie Tompkins Buell. Conway confirmed his attendance to Recode.

The United States has said it will \"study additional measures of combating the online sale of counterfeit or pirated goods,\" CNBC reports.\u00a0</p><p>(Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p>Amazon said earlier this month that it would ramp up counterfeit reporting to authorities, in an effort to assist law enforcement on cracking down on the copycats.

That reliance could make it particularly difficult for some companies to go public with competition concerns against tech giants like Google.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Google can make or break any company in the digital media sector,\" said Jason Kint, the chief executive of the online publishing group Digital Content Next.\u00a0(The Washington Post is a member of Digital Content Next). \u00a0\"They are the number one source of distribution and monetization more than any company on the web. What benefit is there in crossing them?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The relationship-driven business culture in Silicon Valley could also make it harder for companies to voice competition concerns, one venture capitalist says.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, Silicon Valley is a very small community, particularly at the top,\" said Robert Ackerman, the managing director and founder of the venture capital firm AllegisCyber Capital. \"People go out of their way to avoid certain types of\u00a0conflict in fear of blowback and ending up on a pseudo enemies list.\"</p><p>             That could create a challenge for House lawmakers eager to investigate whether Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are using their size and dominance to unfairly hamper emerging competitors. The top lawmaker leading the House investigation into competition in the tech industry says he's already running into this issue - and it underscores why it's time for Washington to step in and examine the consequences of concentrated power in the industry. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)          </p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the House lawmakers' antitrust probe, said last week that\u00a0smaller companies' reliance on the larger platforms \"makes them concerned about raising their voice, raising concerns about the monopoly power of these platforms,\" according to Reuters.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you look at the size of some of the large platforms, their ability to exclude people from the platform can result in closing the business,\" Cicilline told reporters.\u00a0</p><p>\"That's sort of the most dangerous consequence of this kind of concentration, is the ability to exclude rivals, put them out of business, diminish innovation, diminish entrepreneurship, diminish choices for consumers,\" he said.</p><p>This fear of backlash doesn't just apply to small companies, Kint says. He notes that Google for example is a major funder of media trade groups, think tanks and academics.\u00a0</p><p> \"It's dangerous to bite the hand that feeds you,\" Kint told me.\u00a0\"Honestly, it's really the best symptom of the problem.\"\u00a0</p><p>Fear of backlash from the tech giants might not be the only factor preventing smaller tech outfits from engaging with Washington. Some venture capitalists said the companies' silence could instead reflect a general skepticism of working with lawmakers.\u00a0</p><p>\"If anything, people worry more about government actions causing more harm than good,\" said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. \"To paraphrase [President] Reagan, for most Silicon Valley companies, the 10 most dangerous words in the English language are 'I am from the government and I'm here to help.' \"</p><p>             To be sure, there have been a handful of companies that have come forward with their complaints about the tech giants' power. Google has particularly been in the crosshairs, as last week the chief strategy officer at the music lyric company Genius wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post describing Google's power as a threat to the open Internet. The review website Yelp has also emerged as a prominent critic of Google on antitrust issues.\u00a0</p><p>But other, smaller firms may be more willing to take a more secretive approach to working with regulators than blasting the companies publicly. Federal regulators such as the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are divvying up tech oversight\u00a0and considering opening investigations into some companies, including Google. Any potential investigation could be a more confidential avenue for the companies to share their concerns with Washington than testifying in front of House lawmakers.\u00a0</p><p>\"People now can form a line around the block at the Department of Justice and speak under the veil of confidentiality,\" Luther Lowe, Yelp's senior vice president of public policy\u00a0who supports greater antitrust scrutiny of Google, told me. \u00a0</p><p>Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has said he's not surprised by the antitrust scrutiny here at home\u00a0after the\u00a0company has gone through recent investigations in Europe. He said in a recent CNN interview\u00a0it's \"perfectly fine\" for companies to face increased scrutiny when they get big enough. He did note there are some benefits for companies to being big\u00a0because they're able to make long-term investments in new techologies like quantum computing without fear of short-term returns.\u00a0</p><p> \"Scrutiny is right, and we will participate constructively in these discussions,\" he said.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos wants to disabuse lawmakers of the notion that artificial intelligence is a quick fix to counterterrorism as he\u00a0testifies\u00a0in front of Congress\u00a0today.</p><p>\"There's a lot of overstatement in Silicon Valley and D.C. over the capability to use machine learning,\" Stamos\u00a0tells The Technology 202 in an interview. \"Machine learning has some significant limitations. It can't be told to do something, it must be trained.\" And in some cases, it \"fails spectacularly.\"</p><p>The technology's limitations were recently highlighted in the aftermath of the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooting, when\u00a0companies struggled to remove a flood of graphic videos of the attack. The companies' response to the shooting videos is expected to be high on the agenda as\u00a0the\u00a0House Homeland Security Committee grapples with the role of AI in countering terrorism.\u00a0</p><p>In his research, Stamos has found that AI can be up to 1,000 times more successful in moderating some content than others - but that relies on a number of factors including the content it has been trained on. Stamos says failing AI was just one of \"three or four\" issues, including a toxic Internet ecosystem friendly to white supremacist content, that allowed for the content to proliferate.</p><p>But just because artificial intelligence isn't a panacea for detecting terrorist content, it\u00a0doesn't mean tech companies are helpless. In his testimony, Stamos will advocate for the creation of a coordinating body similar to that used by global financial services to monitor risk that could handle counterterrorism alongside election security and fraud.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0A\u00a0Vermont law requiring companies that compile and sell individual data to register with the state isn't living up to lawmakers' promises,\u00a0\u00a0my colleague Douglas MacMillan found in an investigation. Of the mere dozens of firms that have complied since the law went into effect in January, few offered the basic details required by the law, such as how the data is being used.</p><p>Amerilist, a data broker that sold The Washington Post a list of 5,000 people's information, didn't register until it was contacted by Douglas about the law. Ravi Backerdan, chief executive of Amerilist, told Douglas that registering \"may have fallen under the radar.\" So far, the Vermont attorney general hasn't leveraged any fines against noncompliant firms.</p><p>Advocates and privacy experts warn that the shadowy, unregulated world of data brokers can lead to exploitation and harassment. But others in the industry warn that laws such as Vermont's could inhibit important business features such as fraud protection.</p><p>Privacy legislation in other states has received significant pushback and gutting. A success in Vermont could turn the tables. Douglas writes:</p><p>\"Earlier this month, a group of 40 state attorneys general recommended the creation of a clearinghouse for all data brokers in the country. In public comments to the FTC, the state officials said a registry could help prevent the 'loss of privacy that occurs when consumers are subject to increasingly extensive monitoring without increased public awareness or oversight.'\"</p><p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates called for greater government oversight of the tech industry in a speech in Washington yesterday, citing concerns ranging from privacy to the influence of Big Tech on the democratic process.          </p><p>\"Technology has become so central that governments have to think: What does that mean about elections? What does that mean about bullying? What does it mean about wiretapping authorities that let you find out what's going on financially or drug-money laundering, things like that?\" Gates said. \"So, yes, the government needs to get involved.\"</p><p>Gates did not go as far as to call for antitrust action, but did acknowledge the role government played in shaping Microsoft's business. The 2001 antitrust trial has been widely cited as a factor that held Microsoft back in the shift to mobile phones, and Gates said yesterday the company would have developed a mobile operating system if it weren't for the probe. The antirust activity also accelerated his retirement from the company, he said.\u00a0</p><p>The role of government in technology\u00a0has changed significantly since the days when Gates bragged about not having an office in Washington, he said. \"The fact that now\u00a0this is the way people consume\u00a0media has really brought it into a realm where we need to shape it so that the benefits need to outweigh the negatives,\" he said.</p><p>             - News from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>- A new report from Deloitte and the National Venture Capital Association found venture capital firms are starting to make some progress on addressing the gender and racial gaps in the profession. The number of venture capital firms with diversity and inclusion programs nearly doubled from 2016, and 26 percent of firms now have formal programs for hiring diverse employees as compared to 10 percent in 2016. Women remain underrepresented, but now make up 14 percent of investment partners, verses 11 percent in 2016. The report found that the industry has a ways to go when it comes to hiring more minorities. Smaller firms in general hire more Black\u00a0and hispanic investment professionals than larger firms, so mid-size and larger firms have proportionally smaller diversity and inclusion\u00a0figures and a bigger gap to close, according to the report.\u00a0</p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Coming Up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-61f50502cfa244daa515901f012e5d52</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDT-WPF1-DXKP-J0FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1837\"/><timeReceived>12:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We will see you back in your inboxes ready to go for 2019 on Jan. 7. Thanks for reading this past year and we hope you, your family and friends have a relaxing and happy holiday season and new year.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             While we're away, check out The Post's new premier daily podcast, Post Reports. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Every weekday. Get new episodes online, to your email or in a podcast app: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Stitcher          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Ctrl &amp;plus; N          </p><p>As a gruesome video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley swiftly circulated online in 2014, Twitter and YouTube decided to ban the graphic content from their platforms.As they raced to stop the videos spread under pressure from people tweeting #ISISmediablackout, major technology companies began to informally coordinate, according to a former Twitter employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were\u00a0not authorized to speak on the record. The response marked one of the first times the technology companies worked together to identify problematic content and remove it from their competing platforms.Twitter, which didn't host native video at the time, began notifying video services\u00a0 such as\u00a0YouTube of links to various versions\u00a0of the video so the video service\u00a0could remove them. The\u00a0ex-Twitter employee said the incident was a \"turning point\" for the industry.\"It was a big wake-up call,\" the employee said. \"It brought everyone together very quickly.\"</p><p>The Foley example is illustrative of what isn't yet formally happening\u00a0among major tech companies as they face perhaps their biggest challenge yet from Washington over botched efforts to fight Russian disinformation during the 2016 election -- and then struggled to publicly disclose the information they found.Though the industry now has\u00a0 more formal channels to help it share and identify terrorist content or child exploitation on platforms, the sharing of data about disinformation campaigns among social media networks has largely been informal and voluntary. It has not followed the example of the financial-services sector, which has -- for example -- found some effective information-sharing strategies in the event of a major breach.</p><p>This week, a pair of reports commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee underscored that Russia carried out its disinformation campaign during the 2016 election on virtually every social network even though most press reports focused on the Kremlin's efforts on\u00a0Twitter and Facebook. As platforms such as\u00a0YouTube, Instagram and even Pinterest were in the spotlight this week, incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)\u00a0told my colleague Tony Romm a top challenge is tech companies \"sharing information among each other,\" noting it might \"need to be addressed legislatively.\"\u00a0</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter\u00a0previously said\u00a0before the 2018 midterm elections that they were cooperating\u00a0on election integrity efforts --\u00a0but they've provided very little detail about what efforts they might have implemented or are even considering to share information.</p><p>             Here were their responses when asked yesterday about strategies for sharing information with each other: Facebook declined to comment. Google said the company does share information with industry and law enforcement. Twitter didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             There are some complex and unique barriers to information sharing among the big tech firms, experts said. First off, there's no real consensus on what constitutes disinformation, raising the question of when information should be shared to begin with. There are also major differences in the way platforms display content, making similar efforts across platforms harder to track and identify. And\u00a0the companies are fiercely competitive and have not always presented a public, unified front\u00a0on disinformation campaigns.</p><p>             Any collaboration\u00a0also comes with serious\u00a0concerns about protecting consumer privacy, something lawmakers are also intensely concerned about. However,\u00a0a\u00a0Tuesday report from the New York Times revealed that Facebook gave other technology companies like Amazon and Microsoft much broader\u00a0access to its users' personal information than previously disclosed. If Facebook is willing to share personal data when it benefits the firm\u00a0financially, it may be harder for them to make the case they can't share data about disinformation threats because they are concerned about privacy.\u00a0</p><p>             Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at\u00a0Recorded Future, said there's a great deal of interest in threat sharing right now but\u00a0coordination is\u00a0often very limited to small, trusted groups.\u00a0          </p><p>             \"It's one of those things that everyone thinks is a great idea,\" she said. \"But in practice, it's more complicated and not as effective as we think.\"          </p><p>She pointed to the challenges inherent in sharing information across platforms that display different content\u00a0said -- while other companies might share a common web link, Facebook won't necessarily be helped if Twitter gives it a suspicious Twitter handle.</p><p>The companies could\u00a0get around this by sharing data like IP addresses, which could potentially be used to see whether\u00a0the same device is posting disinformation on multiple platforms.</p><p>             Any coordination may be further hampered by the intense competition among the tech giants.\u00a0          </p><p>A recent New York Times story exposed how Facebook's strategy in Washington has often attempted to shift attention from its own problems by drawing scrutiny to its competitors. In a fall hearing on Capitol Hill, Google refused to send an\u00a0executive lawmakers deemed senior enough as the company tried to distance itself from Twitter and Facebook on election-security issues. The result was a rash of negative media coverage for the search giant that distracted from Facebook's time in the hot seat.</p><p>Bruce McConnell, a former top Department of Homeland Security cybersecurity official, said the competitions creates a unique challenge for tech companies.\u00a0He said internally, the companies\u00a0are building tools and databases to make it easier to identify and evaluate disinformation.</p><p>             \"They could share those tools and approaches with each other in a more formal way,\" he said.          </p><p>McConnell pointed out there are relatively few players in the social media industry, and they are all established and know one another. And the incentive to figure it out should be crystal clear.</p><p>             \"Do the companies want to get their act together individually and collectively? Or do they want the government to regulate them?\" McConnell said.          </p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Facebook forged partnerships with several tech giants that gave\u00a0those companies much more extensive access to users'\u00a0personal data than\u00a0the social network had previously acknowledged,\u00a0according to an investigation by the New York Times's Gabriel J.X. Dance, Michael LaForgia and Nicholas Confessore. Such vast access to Facebook data sometimes occurred without users' knowledge or consent.\u00a0Here are some examples from the report of the personal information that Facebook gave to other companies:</p><p>A Facebook spokeswoman said\u00a0that the social network hasn't found any evidence of abuse by the partner companies. \"Facebook did say that it had mismanaged some of its partnerships, allowing certain companies' access to continue long after they had shut down the features that required the data,\" the Times\u00a0reported.          </p><p>The partnerships may run afoul of a 2011 consent agreement the company struck with the FTC, which prohibits Facebook from sharing user data without explicit permission. Facebook said the\u00a0arrangements did not violate the FTC agreement, but former FTC technologist Ashkan Soltani\u00a0and \"three former employees of the F.T.C.'s consumer protection division, which brought the case that led to the consent decree, said in interviews that its data-sharing deals had probably violated the agreement,\" according to the Times.\u00a0</p><p>In response to the New York Times article, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called for a national privacy law. Last week, he introduced his own privacy bill:</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook\u00a0illustrated how numerous sites and online services are \"holding onto the ghosts of our Internet pasts\" when it disclosed\u00a0last week that a bug may have allowed third-party apps to access\u00a0photos that millions of users started to upload but didn't post publicly,\u00a0The Washington Post's Drew Harwell reported.\u00a0\"Many websites start sharing or saving the text, photos or other information before we commit with a click of 'post,' 'enter' or 'submit,' and sometimes even after we choose to delete,\" according to my colleague.</p><p>             Tiffany Li, a fellow at Yale Law School's Information Society Project, told\u00a0Drew that companies should inform consumers\u00a0that they are able to monitor more than just what users actually post. People \"don't realize that apps can track not only what you post but any activity on the app,\" Li said. \"And if people don't know the risks, they haven't been well-informed. That's on the companies.\"</p><p>             Yet not all firms save data that users decided not to share publicly. \"Snapchat, the video-sharing app in which most messages self-destruct, uploads content as an encrypted file to its servers once someone starts a message,\" Drew reported. \"But if that user has second thoughts before sending, the keys to decrypt it are never created, and the unsent message is deleted within 24 hours or less.\"</p><p>             BYTES: The chief executive of the company that wrote one of the\u00a0reports on Russian online disinformation efforts admitted engaging\u00a0in misleading online activity himself last year during a race the\u00a0Alabama\u00a0Senate race.\u00a0However, he said he didn't seek to affect the election's result, The Post's Craig Timberg, Tony Romm and Aaron C. Davis reported. \"Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of the research firm New Knowledge, said he created a Facebook page under false pretenses to test his ability to appeal to conservative voters and bought a small amount of retweets - spending less than $10 - to measure the potential 'lift' he could achieve in social media messaging,\" my colleagues wrote.</p><p>Morgan said he acted in his personal capacity and was trying to figure out how misinformation spread, according to my colleagues.\u00a0\"At the time, it seemed kind of innocuous, and a year later, with the benefit of history ... maybe I would second-guess that decision now,\" Morgan said.\u00a0          </p><p>             -\u00a0As Apple tries to break into India, the company has faced\u00a0 \"a rout\" in one of the world's fastest growing emerging markets,\u00a0according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Newley Purnell and Tripp Mickle.\u00a0Contrary to its competitors, the Journal reported that Apple has been \"inflexible\" in its approach to the Indian market by maintaining high prices for the iPhone\u00a0and not seeking to adapt the devices to meet the expectations of\u00a0the country's 1.3 billion consumers.\u00a0</p><p>             -\u00a0\"The number of iPhones shipped in India has fallen 40% so far this year compared with 2017, and Apple's market share there has dropped to about 1% from about 2%, research firm Canalys estimates,\"\u00a0Purnell and Mickle reported. \"The Cupertino, Calif., company posted revenues of $1.8 billion in India this fiscal year.

The president spent more time blaming the Internet and social media for the shootings than racism, hatred or access to guns, according to an analysis by my colleague Philip Bump.\u00a0</p><p>             While Trump is now promising to \"shine a light\" on the dark corners of the internet, experts note that the administration did not even sign onto the Christchuch call, a key international agreement to curb violent extremism online after the New Zealand shootings.\u00a0Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft all signed onto the May agreement to work closely with each other and the 18 participating governments to stop\u00a0their platforms from fostering terrorism. The United Kingdom, Canada and\u00a0France were among those who did sign on.\u00a0</p><p>             And\u00a0violent speech on social media \"wasn't even mentioned\" as the White House hosted a high-profile\u00a0social media summit last month, said\u00a0Clint Watts, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent now at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\u00a0The summit's circus-like atmosphere seemed designed to amplify conservatives' accusations of bias against the platforms.\u00a0</p><p>             Trump's call for social media companies to take a greater role in searching for possible predictors of violent acts could also be difficult to square with his charges that Big Tech is already going overboard in the effort to moderate accounts,\u00a0Watts also points out.\u00a0</p><p>             One\u00a0primary reason\u00a0that social media companies do remove or limit the reach of accounts is due to concerns the speech could lead to violence, he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"What the administration is saying is constantly at odds with itself,\" Watts said in an interview. \"If you're the main social media platforms, what do you do?\"\u00a0</p><p>             Case in point: The White House expressed concerns that signing the Christchuch call\u00a0could run afoul of the First Amendment despite his personal crusade to regulate companies for perceived bias against conservatives. Now, he's opening the door to more drastic moderation from the companies themselves.\u00a0</p><p>             It also was unclear from Trump's brief comments how the potential work with the department would differ from what technology companies already do to combat violent extremism on their platforms.</p><p>Michael Beckerman, the chief executive of the Internet Association, said the tech industry is committed to continue working with law enforcement on these issues.</p><p>\"Violent and terroristic speech violate IA member company policies and have no place either online or in our society. IA members work everyday to find dangerous content and remove it from their platforms,\" said Beckerman, whose\u00a0trade group represents some of the large technology companies including Google and Facebook in Washington. \"IA members are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement, stakeholders, and policymakers to make their platforms safer, and to prevent people from using their services as a vehicle for disseminating violent, hateful content.\"</p><p>Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter declined to comment on the record, but the companies all have policies that state they cooperate with law enforcement.\u00a0</p><p>The mainstream technology platforms have been stepping up their efforts to combat violence and hate speech on their platforms following broad global pressure, especially after the public backlash following the New Zealand attacks earlier this year.\u00a0Still, the spotlight is only growing as the El Paso gunman is believed to have posted a white nationalist manifesto to 8chan. It was the third mass shooting this year to begin with a hateful screed on the website.\u00a0</p><p>Watts says the rise of fringe platforms like 8chan is actually\u00a0evidence that the tech companies' efforts to moderate content have been working, and extremists have to turn to alternative platforms where less content moderation occurs.\u00a0</p><p>             Watts also was skeptical that the Justice Department has the resources and and expertise to conduct research on the rise of domestic terrorism on social media.\u00a0          </p><p>Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez,\u00a0co-founder of Change The Terms, a\u00a0coalition of civil rights groups focused on fighting the spread of hate speech on social media, said the government can't be trusted to take on this issue, either --\u00a0and warned new tools they develop could be \"dangerous\" and risk infringing on free\u00a0speech. It should be\u00a0up to the companies to do even more to effectively enforce their policies and invest in better content moderation, Gonz\u00e1lez argues.\u00a0</p><p>Gonz\u00e1lez\u00a0also criticized Trump's own attacks on immigrants on social media as \"part of the problem.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm not interested in seeing predictive policing online,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said. \"I'm interested in seeing him ramp down his rhetoric online.\"          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The fate of 8chan, the forum used by the El Paso accused shooter to post his manifesto, has brought attention to \"the role played by the Internet's hidden infrastructure in deciding what ideas and content can circulate online,\"my colleague Drew Harwell reports. The ordeal shows how\u00a0the companies that provide the backbone to the Internet are having to decide about weighing in on questions of content moderation.</p><p>Cloudflare, a company that protects websites from cyberattacks, terminated services for 8chan Sunday night, citing the platform's role in both the El Paso shooting as well as two other mass shootings to take place this year. The company then moved to rival BitMitigate, the platform that took on the Daily Stormer after Cloudflare terminated the neo-Nazi site in 2017. \"But by Monday afternoon, both 8chan and the Daily Stormer plunged into darkness when Voxility, a tech firm that has leased servers to BitMitigate, announced that it would no longer provide those services,\" Drew reported.</p><p>8chan, which was called a terrorist haven by its own founder, \"crossed [a] line,\" Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wrote in a blog post explaining the company's decision. But Prince added that the \"law may need additional remedies\" to prevent companies such as his from having to make moderation decisions in the first place. \"We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Trump warned on Twitter on Monday morning that his administration is \"watching Google very closely\" for signs that the company is taking actions that could hinder his path to retake the White House in 2020. Trump's tweets followed a former Google employee's allegations in a Fox News interview that the search giant's executives promised to make sure that Trump \"loses in 2020\" in the wake of his 2016 victory.</p><p>Trump said the remarks from the former Google employee, Kevin Cernekee, cast doubt on promises he said that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai made to him during a recent visit to the Oval Office. From his Twitter:</p><p>Trump also repeated accusations that the Mountain View, Calif., company is biased against conservatives.\u00a0Google denied allegations of bias, telling The Tech 202 in a statement:\u00a0\"The statements made by this disgruntled former employee are absolutely false. We go to great lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in ways that don't take political leanings into account. Distorting results for political purposes would harm our business and go against our mission of providing helpful content to all of our users.\"</p><p>Cernekee, the former Google engineer who appeared on Fox News, says he was fired from the company for being an outspoken conservative and has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board.\u00a0Google disputed this too: \"We enforce our workplace policies without regard to political viewpoint. Lively debate is a hallmark of Google's workplace culture; harassment, discrimination, and the unauthorized access and theft of confidential company information is not.\"</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon's practice of tacitly encouraging sellers to lower their prices or risk being lowered\u00a0in search results\u00a0could come under scrutiny from Congress and the Federal Trade Commission as lawmakers pursue antitrust inquiries into the company,Bloomberg News's Spencer Soper reports. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)\u00a0       </p><p>          Independent sellers that operate on Amazon often also list on other platforms including Walmart and eBay. But if the prices on those sites creep below the price for the same item on Amazon, merchants get a price alert with warnings that they may lose prominence in search results and other privileges that help sellers lock down a sale.\u00a0       </p><p>          The price alerts, first developed in response to a European investigation into a former Amazon policy that explicitly required merchants to offer their best prices, were expanded to U.S. sellers earlier this year after calls to break up the company increased. But the feature could endure new scrutiny from regulators in the United States,\u00a0where sellers say the company's dominance online means they're forced to comply or lose significant business.       </p><p>          \"If regulators can prove that this conduct is causing merchants to raise prices on other platforms, Amazon loses the argument that their policies are all about giving everyone lower prices,\" Michael Kades, a former FTC attorney and antitrust researcher, told Bloomberg.       </p><p>             A group of Democratic senators led by Sherrod Brown (Ohio) is demanding that Google convert its more than 120,000 contract and temporary workers into full-time employees, according to a letter they sent to Google CEO Pichai released on Monday. The senators, including 2020 hopefuls Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), and Kamala D.

But a whopping 89 percent of experts in The Technology 202 Network say their responses so far do not inspire confidence.\u00a0</p><p>\"Fighting misinformation and online voter manipulation is not a one-time effort, it is a continuous game of cat-and-mouse,\" said Hadi Partovi, chief executive of Code.org and an early investor in Facebook, Uber and Airbnb. \"The leaders of all the major online platforms would agree their job is far from 'done.' \"</p><p>             The Technology 202 Network is a panel of more than 100 experts from across government, industry and the consumer advocacy community invited to vote in our ongoing surveys. (You can see the full list of experts here. Some were granted anonymity in exchange for their participation.)\u00a0</p><p>             The responsibility to tackle disinformation and other threats shouldn't just be on tech companies, some industry experts argued. \"Social media companies should be doing more, but are we comfortable with [Facebook chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg or [Twitter's] Jack Dorsey as the arbiters of truth?\" said Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of the real estate service Redfin.\u00a0</p><p>But Kelman says that policymakers aren't really equipped to handle the problem, either. \"We elect governments, not corporations, to regulate speech, run fair elections and deter foreign interference. But most government folks lack the technical expertise to regulate the Internet, and many actually prefer a wide-open field for partisan warfare.\"\u00a0</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley, insists that \"technology companies should be investing in authentication tools, both for users and for content, to ensure that the news Americans are seeing online this year is honest and real.\" Yet Khanna also says it's time for Congress to finally pass legislation to force companies to take action: \"Congress should also provide a basic regulatory framework so that social media companies remove blatant disinformation and hate speech that goes viral from their platforms.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Many experts said tech companies' lack of transparency about interference attempts makes it virtually impossible for voters to know whether adversaries are trying to influence them.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The first step in preventing manipulation for individuals is knowing that it may be afoot,\" said Danielle Keats Citron, a Boston University law professor and 2019 MacArthur fellow, commonly known as a \"genius grant\" recipient. \"In short, so much is hidden from voters that we cannot tell the extent of the manipulation, let alone what companies are doing about it.\"</p><p>Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, said he's \"skeptical\" that tech companies have done enough - \"but the truth is we have no real way to know.\"</p><p>             Tech companies have promised big investments to address potential foreign interference on their platforms, including rooting out fake accounts and             labeling posts             that fact-checkers have deemed false. But the Network experts say these changes are just the tip of the iceberg. \"Small initiatives with great fanfare won't do the job,\" said Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration.\u00a0</p><p>             The approach to tackling disinformation and other threats has been inconsistent across Big Tech, said Falon Fatemi, the chief executive of start-up Node.io. \"While some companies have invested heavily in this area and taken a proactive approach to this challenge, it is evident that some have not yet employed all that artificial intelligence can do to combat this problem,\" she wrote. \"All tech companies have a moral, and furthermore, business rationale to do better here, and to employ the latest and greatest AI for good in this uncertain time.\"</p><p>             Some respondents singled out Facebook's policies as being particularly problematic: The company has said it will permit politicians to lie in ads and allow campaigns to target narrow slices of voters with political messages based on highly personalized data amassed by the company. (Google has put tougher restrictions on how political ads can be targeted).</p><p>If Facebook wants to be serious about election integrity, it should follow Twitter's lead and do away with political ads altogether, said Karla Monterroso, the head of Code 2040, a nonprofit group advocating for diversity in the industry. \"Tying money and targeted ad data to freedom of speech is ridiculous,\" Monterroso said. \"No one is entitled to that amount of data tied to a microphone in exchange for money. Especially if they are spreading lies.\"</p><p>\"Facebook won't even stop running political ads. It's hard to fathom, and Zuckerberg's reasoning is either based on extremely ulterior motives or is just hardheaded,\" said Bradley Tusk, founder of Tusk Ventures.</p><p>             Several Network participants noted that the companies don't have the right incentives to fix the problems with disinformation because of their business models. \"Truly fixing Facebook's threat to free and fair elections would require fundamental changes to its business model, but Facebook is not going to risk its billion dollars a week in targeted digital advertising revenue unless it's forced to do so,\" said Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at Open Markets Institute.</p><p>\"The actions of Facebook and Google since 2016 raise serious doubts about the sincerity of their commitment to protecting democracy,\" \u00a0said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley investor and author of \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\" \"Both companies employ business models and algorithms that amplify hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories because such content is unusually profitable. Rather than compromise their business models, both companies have made only cosmetic changes to appease policymakers.\"\u00a0</p><p>             And rampant disinformation on these platforms disproportionately affects minority groups, warned Rashad Robinson, the president of the civil rights group Color of Change. \"Make no mistake, these platforms know they have a problem - they acknowledged it in 2016 and they are aware of it today,\" he said. \"Yet these companies are making an active choice not to do more to end misinformation online, and that choice will disproportionately harm the communities most in need of the resources determined by elections and the upcoming census count.\"</p><p>             Just 11 percent of The Network - which includes executives from most major social networks - said that the companies are doing enough.          </p><p>Kevin Martin, Facebook's vice president for public policy and FCC chairman during the George W. Bush administration, sought to highlight the company's progress.</p><p>\"We have made strides in improving our security efforts through massive investments in people and technology to increase transparency, combat abuse and protect election integrity across the world,\" Martin said. \"While we know our work will never be complete, we are committed to combating these threats.\"</p><p>Jesse Blumenthal, vice president of technology and innovation policy for the network backed by Charles Koch and like-minded investors, said it is up to each individual to discern fact from fiction. \"Social media companies are in a 'cat-and-mouse' game with all sorts of bad actors. It is easy to focus only on the challenges that exist and lose sight of the ways that social media platforms can and do help bring important information to light,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it is up to each of us to sort true information from falsehoods. Individuals are responsible for their actions. No company can or should think for you.\"\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             - More responses from members of our Network panel about whether social media companies are prepared for the 2020 elections:\u00a0          </p><p>Update: This section has been updated to reflect Devich-Cyril's current job title.\u00a0</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Tech companies and their workers are struggling to keep up with coronavirus as U.S. cases grow:\u00a0          </p><p>- Listings for face masks - for prices ranging from 75 cents to $1,000 apiece - were still surfacing yesterday on Facebook Marketplace,\u00a0the Verge's Makena Kelly found.

But the company says it won't flag videos that were posted before its new media policy took effect on March 5 - and             the video the letter appears to describe             was published on March 3. \u00a0          </p><p>That could escalate tensions between the company and Trump after Twitter applied its first \"manipulated media\" flag to a video retweeted by Trump on Sunday.\u00a0</p><p>\"In order for American elections to remain free and fair, it is critical that the Biden campaign be held to the same standard it is demanding apply to others,\" wrote Michael Glassner, chief operating officer of Donald J. Trump for President in the letter. Glassner said the video Biden shared \"manipulates audio and video of President Trump to mislead Americans and give a false impression.\" The campaign video splices together many clips of Trump speaking that Glassner says were \"deceptively edited\" and taken out of context.\u00a0</p><p>\"We've received the letter and intend to respond,\" said Katie Rosborough, a Twitter spokeswoman. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Whisper, a once-popular app to anonymously share secrets, left the intimate confessions and messages of hundreds of millions of users exposed online,my colleague Drew Harwell reports. Bad actors could have used the exposed data to tie users to their personal posts, potentially opening them to blackmail or harassment, researchers say.\u00a0          </p><p>The confessions included deeply personal information, such as sexual orientation, confessions of adultery and posts about suicide. Millions of the records belonged to children, researchers found.\u00a0</p><p>\"This has very much violated the societal and ethical norms we have around the protection of children online,\" researcher Dan Ehrlich told Drew. \"No matter what happens from here on out, the data has been exposed for years. [People could] have their lives ruined and their families blackmailed because of this.\"</p><p>The data, which was publicly available online, included age, gender, ethnicity and location coordinates from the users' last submitted post. Many of the coordinates traced to specific schools, workplaces, military bases and residential neighborhoods. The researchers were also able to access user accounts, including private messages.</p><p>The researchers alerted federal law enforcement officials and the company to\u00a0the vulnerability. The researchers said they also shared their findings with human rights groups for fear the exposed data could have been abused by government officials or spies.</p><p>Shortly after researchers and The Post contacted the company on Monday, access to the data was removed. T          he\u00a0company told Drew in a statement that much of the data was meant to be public to users from within the Whisper app. The database found by the researchers, however, was \"not designed to be queried directly,\" a company official said.\u00a0       </p><p>             (This item has been updated to include a statement from Whisper.)          </p><p>Twitter reached a deal with the activist hedge fund Elliott Management that will leave chief executive Jack Dorsey in place, Corrie Driebusch reports for the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0</p><p>The agreement stops one of the most significant efforts to oust a famous tech founder, and it will lead to changes on the social network's board.Twitter will have to appoint two new board members under the agreement, expanding what was an eight-person board. The company also had to agree to search for a third independent director, Twitter said.</p><p>             - More news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - The coronavirus outbreak\u00a0also prevented Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman from testifying at a Senate antitrust hearing today. Yelp executive Luther Lowe will testify in\u00a0his place while Stoppelman deals with \"operational changes\" at the company resulting from the outbreak, a spokeswoman said.\u00a0          </p><p>Lowe will argue that Google's favors itself in\u00a0its own rating and reviews features, and that \"poses a dire threat to our market, the local search market, as well as many other specialized search markets.\" It's an argument that Yelp\u00a0has made for nearly a decade,\u00a0and now the company is betting\u00a0that lawmakers in Washington are ready to listen as scrutiny grows of the tech giants. Antitrust laws can provide a remedy to Google's anticompetitive behavior that hurts Yelp, other search engines and consumers, Lowe will argue.</p><p>\"This self-serving bias matches unwitting consumers with objectively lower-quality information,\" Lowe will say in his testimony, provided to The Technology 202.\u00a0</p><p>Google has denied Yelp's accusations.</p><p>\"We build Google Search for our users. Our users tell us they want quick access to information, and we're constantly innovating Search to help people easily find what they're looking for -- whether it's information on a web page, directions on a map, products for sale or a translation,\" Google spokeswoman Julie Tarallo McAlister\u00a0wrote in a statement.</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             -Today:          </p><p>             -Coming up:          </p><p>             -Postponed:           Nava Public Benefit Corporation has postponed tonight's event \"Impact at Scale: From Big Tech to Civic Tech.\"\u00a0       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5e69e24d5b464b6687fb9d199e9aa1c5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-B9R1-JB4M-V2M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2597\"/><timeReceived>12:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The launch will be the most high-profile test to date for the company -              which my colleague Christian Davenport reports was once criticized as a billionaire's long shot fantasy.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          \"One industry veteran told me, 'You know their rockets are put together with rubber bands and sealing wax,'\" Lori Garver, a former deputy National Aeronautics and Space Administration who pushed the agency to outsource human spaceflight to the private sector, told Christian. \"'It's not real. It won't fly.'\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          But Wednesday's launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule with astronauts aboard underscores just how much Musk's company has shaken up the space business.</p><p>             The company may earn a place in the history books for ushering in a new era of space travel.\u00a0          </p><p>          The mission marks a broader shift at the NASA away from the costly and time-consuming project of building government-owned spacecraft. If tomorrow's launch is a success, it could signal that more future space endeavors will be based on similar partnerships between corporations and governments.\u00a0       </p><p>          The mission is also poised to end a drought of launches of humans to orbit from U.S. soil since the space shuttle retired almost a decade ago. The rise of greater collaboration between companies like SpaceX and the federal government could reduce U.S. dependence on foreign space programs such as Russia, which has ferried American astronauts to the space station in intervening years.\u00a0</p><p>The flight marks an apparent victory for SpaceX in its long-running rivalry with Boeing.\u00a0</p><p>Countries used to vie against one another in space achievements, as the United States and Soviet Union famously did in the effort to land a man on the moon. But these days, companies are defining the space race.\u00a0</p><p>No one thought that Musk's relative upstart would beat the legacy aerospace giant to space, Christian writes. The fact that SpaceX appears to have won the race underscores just how much space travel has changed as it becomes increasingly privatized.\u00a0</p><p>SpaceX may have had an advantage in its contract with NASA because it's known for reusing materials, making it more cost efficient. The company has built a reputation for repurposing all sorts of things, even a 125,000-gallon liquid nitrogen tank that an employee found scrapped at an old abandoned Cape Canaveral launch site.</p><p>\"We had to be super scrappy,\" Musk once told The Washington Post. \"If we did it the standard way, we would have run out of money. For many years, we were week to week on cash flow, within weeks of running out of money. It definitely creates a mind-set of smart spending. Be scrappy or die: Those were our two options. Buy scrap components, fix them up, make them work.\"</p><p>But SpaceX still has had high-profile problems along its path.\u00a0</p><p>Several incidents have raised questions about whether there's enough government oversight of private space companies. The company has had two Falcon 9 rockets explode, and it struggled with a parachute system \u00a0needed to slow down the spacecraft on its return to Earth. The company said last year that its Dragon capsule was completely destroyed during a test.\u00a0</p><p>Since these incidents, SpaceX has uncovered what caused the problems and fixed them, NASA tells Christian.\u00a0</p><p>The launch will also be a pivotal assessment of the Trump administration's space ambitions.\u00a0</p><p>\"If it goes well, it would be a moment of triumph for an administration that boasts it is 'renewing American leadership in space' and would no doubt end up in election-year campaign ads,\" Christian writes. \"If something goes wrong, it would be a staggering blow that could send the space agency reeling and jeopardize the White House's signature mission to return astronauts to the moon by 2024.\"</p><p>          President Trump and Vice President Pence are planning to attend the launch, which is scheduled for 4:33 p.m. Wednesday from launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.       </p><p>          Trump has previously shown an interest in having high-profile \"space barons,\" such as Musk and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, and their companies play a role in rejuvenating space travel, Christian writes.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"Rich guys, they love rocket ships,\" Trump said in 2018. \"That's good. That's better than us paying for them.\"\u00a0       </p><p>The coronavirus will make this launch different from others.\u00a0</p><p>Don't expect to see the usual crowds near the Kennedy Space Center, The Verge's Nicole Wetsman writes. NASA is taking some precautions to ensure the safety of the astronauts and ground crew by conducting temperature checks, and spreading people out at Mission Control. They'll disinfect rooms regularly and put up Plexiglass between different work stations.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're looking at all the things where we can practice the guidelines for social distancing, and at the same time, launch this very important mission to the International Space Station,\" said Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, during a press call this month.</p><p>             Programming note: The Washington Post will \u00a0tomorrow broadcast the SpaceX launch on our homepage and on YouTube. The Post's Libby Casey will anchor the broadcast with space industry reporter Davenport, which will include exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the astronauts and launch.\u00a0</p><p>Guests will include NASA astronaut Suni Williams, and former NASA astronauts Frank Culbertson Jr. and Pam Melory, as well as Ellen Stofan, the Director of the Smithsonian's Air &amp; Space Museum. The program will feature an exclusive online interview with Elon Musk and reporting and analysis from the Post's Joel Achenbach, Whitney Leaming and Whitney Shefte.</p><p>Take some time to read this fun article from Christian before tomorrow's launch:</p><p>             Note to readers: The Technology 202 will only publish today, Wednesday and Thursday this week. We will return to our normal schedule next week.          </p><p>A new bill would prohibit tech giants from offering political advertising tools that target users based on demographics or behavioral data.</p><p>The bill, introduced by Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), would apply to all communications or advocacy for a federal candidate and would be enforced by the Federal Election Commission. Democrats have raised concerns since the 2016 election that \"microtargeting\" can\u00a0make it more challenging to police disinformation in political ads. \u00a0</p><p>\"Microtargeting political ads fractures our open Democratic debate into millions of private, unchecked silos, allowing for the spread of false promises, polarizing lies, disinformation, fake news, and voter suppression,\" Eshoo said in a news release.\u00a0\"With spending on digital ads in the 2020 election expected to exceed $1.3 billion, Congress must step in to protect our nation's Democratic process.\"\u00a0</p><p>The Banning Microtargeted Political Ads Act has the support of nearly a dozen privacy and campaign finance experts and advocacy groups. Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, who has expressed support for regulating microtargeting, said she was glad to see the issue receiving attention.</p><p>             Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.)             is also expected             to introduced legislation today that would limit use of the technology to targeting users only on the basis of age, gender and location. Eshoo's bill has greater restrictions on how location data can be used to microtarget.\u00a0</p><p>Approximately 72 percent of Americans also favor greater regulation of the practice, according to a Knight-Gallup poll earlier this year.</p><p>             Clarification: This item has been updated to clarify Weintraub's comments.          </p><p>          Officials in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou may make its coronavirus health-tracking technology permanent.       </p><p>          The proposed permanent version of the tool would assign individuals a color-coded health badge based on \"a collation of their medical records, physical examination results, and lifestyle habits, such as smoking and alcohol consumption,\" the Wall Street Journal's Liza Lin reports. Officials have used QR-code-based health-rating apps to control the movement of residents to limit the spread of the virus during the pandemic.       </p><p>             The announcement sparked a backlash on Chinese social media, where residents accused the city of using the pandemic as an excuse to expand government monitoring of citizens.\u00a0          </p><p>          It also came days after Robin Li, chief executive of the Chinese tech giant Baidu and a member of a Chinese political advisory body, introduced a new nonbinding proposal urging legislators to wind down collection of personal information used in the coronavirus response. There has been a recent push in the nation for increased privacy protections against the government, Lin reports.       </p><p>Ireland's top privacy watchdog has yet to crack down on Big Tech in the two years since Europe's landmark data protection law took effect, critics say.</p><p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission has yet to finalize investigations into any tech companies and has struggled to keep up with thousands of complaints introduced under the General Data Protection Regulation, Mark Scott of Politico reports.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"Nothing has really changed,\" said Fred Logue, a Dublin-based privacy lawyer. \"When you deal with them, you don't get the sense that they are there to vindicate data protection rights.\"       </p><p>Of the nearly 7,000 complaints the agency received last year, about 4,500 were completed without any specific enforcement action and about 1,000 are awaiting fines or enforcement actions.</p><p>             European Union officials in other countries have also complained about the agency             '             s slow pace. Several told Politico that they waited months for little or no updates for cases referred to Ireland. France and Germany moved to take action against Google without waiting on Ireland.</p><p>Helen Dixon, who heads the agency of more than 140 regulators, defended its actions. \"We are now on a pathway where we are going to resolve, one by one, as fast as we can with as many resources as we can, these very entrenched issues,\" she told Scott.</p><p>             The agency expects to launch fines against Facebook and Twitter by early summer - \u00a0a year after the enforcement actions were expected.          </p><p>More thoughts on GDPR's birthday yesterday from European Parliament member Sophie in 't Veld:       </p><p>President Trump is considering creating a White House commission to review alleged online bias against conservatives.</p><p>The administration may also encourage the Federal Communications Commission and the FEC to embark on similar reviews, John D. McKinnon and Alex Leary report in the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0</p><p>President Trump has long railed against an alleged anti-conservative bias from online platforms, even hosting a summit on the subject last summer. Tech companies have consistently disputed his claims. An independent audit of Facebook last year found no evidence supporting his claims.</p><p>More White House news:</p><p>A key evangelical group supporting Trump is upping its data mining efforts to give the campaign a boost amid the pandemic.</p><p>United In Purpose \"plans to use data mining to identify millions of new voters and target them with cheap ads on Facebook,\" Lee Fang of the Intercept reports.\u00a0</p><p>The group, founded by a former technology entrepreneur, is powered by Pioneer Solutions, a data-mining operation used to find and activate religious voters. A leak of the group's database showed that it has demographics information on nearly 200 million Americans. It also shares connections with CatholicVote, a group that has used cellphone data to target Catholic voters in support of the Republican Party.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft and Google are providing web services to Chinese surveillance firms blacklisted by the United States for human rights abuses.</p><p>The services include email, website hosting and log-in authentication, according researchers at privacy website Top10VPN, CNBC reports.</p><p>The new report alleges that Amazon and Google are providing Web services for Dahua Technology and Hikvision, two video surveillance companies blacklisted for aiding in the abuses of Uighurs, China's Muslim minority population. Artificial intelligence start-ups SenseTime and Megvii were also blacklisted for human rights abuses but appear to still be using Microsoft technology.</p><p>All four Chinese companies have disputed allegations of their involvement in human rights abuses. None of the U.S. companies mentioned in the report immediately responded to CNBC for comment.</p><p>More industry news:</p><p>Nose for news?

Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wants Congress to\u00a0hold an immediate hearing with Facebook and other technology platforms to address the \"abject failure\" to stop the spread of graphic videos and messaging:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After Facebook removed 1.5 million videos of the shooting rampage at two mosques in Christchurch within the first 24 hours of the attack -- and there were still many more available online -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she wants answers.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand but that doesn't mean we can't play an active role in seeing it resolved,\" Arden said. \"This is an issue I will look to be discussing directly with Facebook.\"</p><p>U.K. Home Secretary Sajid\u00a0Javid said on Twitter that \"enough is enough\":\u00a0</p><p>          The U.K. lawmaker who leads the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee in the House of Commons\u00a0said there needs to be \"a serious review\" of why the companies' attempts to police the content weren't more effective:       </p><p>             The growing international outcry could be a game-changer for Silicon Valley companies wary of more regulation.\u00a0          </p><p>             Other countries, particularly in Europe, have been\u00a0adopting tougher rules when it comes to hate speech -- and it's likely that the toughest restrictions on the technology companies' content moderation practices will continue to be outside the United States.\u00a0          </p><p>Countries such as\u00a0Germany and United Kingdom are setting penalties for the companies when they fail to remove harmful content. In Germany,\u00a0regulators can fine companies if they fail to remove illegal content in less than 24 hours. In the United Kingdom, ministers are planning to establish a new technology regulator that could dole out fines in the billions if companies such as Facebook or Google (which owns YouTube) fail to remove harmful content from their platforms. Actions regulators take\u00a0in those countries take could set the tone globally for how governments should address the\u00a0proliferation of violent content on social media.          </p><p>             There could also be action in the U.S. The extremely\u00a0broad volume of videos spread across various social networks could reignite debate over whether Congress needs to update a decades-old law that shields companies from legal liability for content posted on their platforms.\u00a0</p><p>Less than six months ago, in the wake of the massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue, hate speech linked to the attack rekindled debate in Congress over whether\u00a0Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act\u00a0needed to be updated.</p><p>The provision generally protects tech companies from legal action related to content that people have posted on their websites. Sen. Mark R Warner (D-Va.), said last year this law might need an overhaul.\u00a0</p><p> \"I have serious concerns that the proliferation of extremist content - which has radicalized violent extremists ranging from Islamists to neo-Nazis - occurs in no small part because the largest social media platforms enjoy complete immunity for the content that their sites feature and that their algorithms promote,\" Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told my colleague Tony Romm in the fallout of the Pittsburgh shooting. He did not comment this weekend on whether he would renew this charge after the New Zealand attack.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             The\u00a0industry has largely resisted any changes to the law. As my colleague Tony said on Twitter in the hours following the New Zealand shooting:</p><p>             The companies have already made investments to better police harmful content, ranging from improved algorithms to expanding their ranks of human content moderators under previous political pressure. But expect renewed questions from policymakers across the world over whether these investments were enough.\u00a0          </p><p>Tech companies \"have a content-moderation problem that is fundamentally beyond the scale that they know how to deal with,\" Becca Lewis, a researcher at Stanford University and the think tank Data &amp; Society, told my colleagues Friday. \"The financial incentives are in play to keep content first and monetization first.\"</p><p>             BITS: YouTube took unprecedented steps to quell the spread of videos of the New Zealand massacre. But even its attempts to temporarily disable search functions and speed up automated review functions were outmatched by a flood of repackaged and recut videos designed to outsmart the company's systems,\u00a0my colleagues Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg report.\u00a0As soon as the company's \"incident commanders\" removed one video, another would appear, as quickly as one per second in the hour after the shooting.\u00a0</p><p>\"This was a tragedy that was almost designed for the purpose of going viral,\" Neal Mohan, YouTube's chief product officer, said in an interview with The Washington Post. \"We've made progress, but that doesn't mean we don't have a lot of work ahead of us, and this incident has shown that especially in the case of more viral videos like one there's more work to be done.\"</p><p>The videos came much more quickly and in greater volume than in previous mass shootings, such as the fall Pittsburgh synagogue massacre last year. While video from the point of view of the victims has spread in previous shootings, the New Zealand attacks were unique because the shooter apparently live streamed itself from a GoPro camera.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: The data scientist known for developing the quiz app that allowed the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica to sweep up vast information about Facebook users is suing Facebook for defamation,\u00a0according to the New York Times's Matthew Rosenberg.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly tried to shift the blame onto Aleksandr Kogan in the year since the scandal first broke, claiming he says the data the app was sweeping up was only being used for academic purposes. But Kogan says that the fine print in his app said that the data could be used commercially. That violated Facebook's rules, but the company did not appear to be checking whether apps were complying.\u00a0</p><p> \"Alex did not lie, Alex was not a fraud, Alex did not deceive them, this was not a scam,\" Steve Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Kogan, told the Times. \"Facebook knew exactly what this app was doing, or should have known. Facebook desperately needed a scapegoat, and Alex was their scapegoat.\"</p><p>In a statement, Liz Bourgeois, a spokeswoman for Facebook, called\u00a0the action\u00a0 a \"frivolous lawsuit\" from someone who \"violated our policies and put people's data at risk.\"</p><p>             BYTES: In the absence of action in Washington, some of the country's most powerful state attorneys general are signaling that they're prepared to take action against Google and Facebook,\u00a0my colleague Tony reports.\u00a0These law enforcement officials are concerned about the vast troves of personal information Silicon Valley businesses have collected -- and its impact on privacy and competition.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think what we've found is that Big Tech has become too big and that, while we may have been asleep at the wheel, they were able to consolidate a tremendous amount of power,\" Jeff Landry (R), Louisiana's attorney general, told Tony in an interview.\u00a0</p><p>States such as Arizona and Mississippi are taking aim at Google's data collection practices, while Washington is challenging Facebook's business practices in court.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are in a moment where the federal government's level of effectiveness and engagement on a range of issues, on technology, consumer protection and privacy, is limited,\" Phil Weiser (D), Colorado's attorney general, told my colleage. \"Absent federal intervention, he said, \"states in general or state AGs are able to act.\"</p><p>             \u00a0The New Zealand massacre highlights\u00a0the unique challenges technology companies face when it comes to policing live online broadcasts -- which effectively can't be cut off, reports the Wall Street Journal's Yoree Koh.\u00a0Only ten people were tuned into the shooter's broadcast on Facebook Live, according to an archive of the page, but it has now likely been viewed millions of times as it was copied across the internet in various forms.</p><p> \"Artificial intelligence software isn't powerful enough to fully detect violent content as it is being broadcast, according to researchers. And widely available software enables people to instantly record and create a copy of an online video,\" Koh reported. \"That means the footage now lives on people's phones and computers, showing how little control the major tech platforms have over the fate of a video once it airs.\"</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-77b461362b0a4bb388882789c6096050</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-SB41-DXKP-J45T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1516\"/><timeReceived>1:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We're getting ready for Wednesday's Technology 202 Live event with keynote speakers including former Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer and California attorney general Xavier Becerra. You can sign up for the livestream and find more details here.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Big Cable isn't scared of tech giants\u00a0getting into TV streaming.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A top cable lobbyist says any talk of traditional television's demise is \"dramatically premature\" - even as Apple is expected to announce\u00a0a new video subscription service with its own original content. It's the latest tech heavyweight\u00a0to get into the Hollywood game, in which\u00a0Amazon, Netflix and Google's YouTube have been competing for years.\u00a0</p><p>NCTA Internet and Television Association President and former Federal Communications Chairman Michael Powell says that\u00a0technology companies have totally different goals -- and ways to make money.\u00a0</p><p>\"They're a radically different thing than what we are,\" Powell told me and C-SPAN journalist Peter Slen on an upcoming\u00a0episode of the network's \"The Communicators\" show, set to air later this week.\u00a0\"The gold for them is not the service. The gold for them is the data the service produces.\"          </p><p>             Still, Powell concedes that back in Washington, the cable industry and Big Tech have a complicated relationship. He would even describe them as \"frenemies.\"\u00a0          </p><p>Technology companies and cable businesses are constantly competing in the market for consumers' eyeballs. The cable industry is wary of Silicon Valley's growing power and the impact that has on competition in the market.\u00a0</p><p>But on some issues, they align: Both want federal privacy laws that would supersede a possible patchwork of state laws.\u00a0</p><p>\"You can't hold a grudge very long in this space,\" Powell told us. \"You have to take issues as they come and recognize it for this we are not friends, but tomorrow we may have to be for the good of the order.\"\u00a0</p><p>                             The following is an excerpt our interview with Powell from \"The Communicators,\" which will air on C-SPAN later this week, lightly edited for length and clarity.\u00a0We'll share video in The Technology 202 after it airs.\u00a0                       </p><p>             Zakrzewski: Do you think we're in a \"techlash\"\u00a0moment right now?</p><p>             Powell: To use that term, there's no doubt about it.</p><p>I've been around this town long enough to think this is the biggest whiplash I've ever seen take place in policy or public sentiment. Just a handful of years ago at the height of the Obama administration, these companies could do absolutely no wrong. They essentially walked around town with a halo over their heads. They told America themselves that they do no evil, they are connecting the world, that their origin myths are all positive and beneficial to society. I think politicians drank that Kool Aid pretty aggressively for the last decade or so. Starting with the 2016 election and shortly thereafter, the shocking flip of that has been really quite dramatic.</p><p>Some of it's probably overdone, but all of it's probably overdue.</p><p>Every century there's a great case that defines antitrust for that generation. The next great case in world history will be Google.</p><p>It is materializing. It will be around tech power and that will define antitrust for the foreseeable future.</p><p>             Zakrzewski: Why do you focus specifically on Google?          </p><p>             Powell:\u00a0I don't. I mention them by way of exemplar. Some of the problems you can issue spot with respect to one\u00a0are equally applicable to all.</p><p>I think it's a little bit of a mistake to lump them as a single thing. They really do very different things but they use similar methodology which is a thing we have to get our head around.</p><p>There are some problems in antitrust law that are worth the government evaluating and having a conversation with. Antitrust worries about two big companies merging two to one. But these companies kill companies in their cradle, not when they're at rival size.</p><p>They take them out at a stage where antitrust would say that's not a big merger. Facebook buying WhatsApp doesn't seem like a big merger in classic antitrust terms. I think they're very, very good at identifying competitive threats through technology rather than market asset and size.</p><p>             Slen: What about the regulatory structure? Your\u00a0industries are regulated differently than the broadcast TV channels, Netflix, Facebook, Google etc. Should they all be regulated in a similar way?          </p><p>I think they all have to be at least harmonized in some sort of overarching regulatory philosophy.\u00a0</p><p>Almost all of our regulation is ancient legacy.</p><p>I would argue the regulatory environment is just an accident of history. It's not rational, intentional decisions about what the optimal public interest is. It's just a whole bunch of atomistic pieces, that don't go together in any whole, and people game the systems.</p><p>Are [tech companies] my enemy? No. But I think bad public policy is always my enemy, and right now no one can say we have an intentional set of national public policies around how to regulate the digital information industry. It is a hodgepodge of kind of one-off stuff that you would be hard-pressed to weave a thread through in a logical way. I think it's a task we'll eventually have to take on.</p><p>             Zakrzewski: As there's increasingly calls for greater regulation of the tech industry, are you concerned about the negative implications regulations on\u00a0privacy or increased resources for the FTC might have on the cable industry?          </p><p>We're proudly out front in supporting those efforts.</p><p>If [Massachusetts Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren and to be bipartisan, [Missouri Republican Sen. Josh]\u00a0Hawley, are very, very worried about market power and tech, they can't even get at that question until they get at the question of how they can collect, vacuum up and use data and privacy. I think that's before we get to cyber threats, foreign actors attacking our system. Basically there's not going to be any endeavor of human nature that's not going to come down to who gets what about me and how they can use it in what ways. If I had my way, Congress would put down every other weapon almost and spend an enormous amount of energy on this.</p><p>Cable worries about it because it worries about it for its consumers. It also realizes we're not an ad-fueled model, we associate ourselves with Apple's argument. Look we make money. But we don't make money selling you. We actually send you a bill. We charge you a lot. You may not like how much we charge you. But we don't give you stuff for free and go make up for it by taking everything we know about you and selling it.</p><p>We have a different relationship with the consumer that's more direct, more intimate, we take your check.

He said a the workshop hosted yesterday at Stanford University that there are still opportunities for upstarts to challenge the large Silicon Valley incumbents, which he argued can be slow-moving because of their size.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"I don't think today is any different from 20 or 30 years ago,\" he said. \"All of these companies are vulnerable in some fashion or another.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          Ram Shriram, an early investor in Google, said there continue to be areas where start-ups can take on the incumbents. \"The way Big Tech will get disrupted is by new technologies like AI,\" he said.\u00a0       </p><p>             The workshop highlighted the wide chasm between the venture capital community and Washington, where concerns about the tech industry's power are snowballing as lawmakers and government enforcers intensify their scrutiny of Silicon Valley. Major Democratic candidates running for president such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have also called for big companies like Facebook to be broken up.          </p><p>             Yet some big investors are content with the status quo \u00a0          -             and they're worried that any increased federal antitrust regulation could have unintended consequences.\u00a0          </p><p>          \"It's a bit of a double-edged sword,\"           Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures, told me in an interview at the event. \"In a way, yes there are some potential bad behaviors that happen. These platforms don't have a level playing field. But at the same time, there's so much goodness in the ecosystem. They buy failing companies. Employees spin out of them and start their own companies. It's\u00a0a way more nuanced situation.\"       </p><p>             Investors hope that lawmakers will consider these nuances as antitrust fever expands. In addition to DOJ's review, the Federal Trade Commission also opened antitrust investigations into some large tech companies, including Facebook. The House antitrust subcommittee is conducting a broad review of Silicon Valley's power. And state attorneys general have also opened their own probes into Facebook and Google's power.\u00a0</p><p>          Venture capitalists are particularly concerned about any actions taken by regulators that could hamper larger tech companies' acquisitions of start-ups - especially because those deals are often a key driver of returns for investors. Several expressed skepticism of the FTCs announcement this week it would review large tech companies' mergers over the past decade - requesting documents even for deals that were not large enough to warrant deeper inspection at the time.\u00a0       </p><p>          Nakache said the announcement was a \"head-scratcher,\" especially because many of the deals involved struggling companies that had few other options but to sell.\u00a0</p><p>          \"I would certainly find it disturbing if the objective was to have close scrutiny over small acquisitions,\" she said. \"Because I feel like that is not where the problems are, in my view.\"       </p><p>          The DOJ officials attending the event were actively seeking to create a channel of communication with start-up investors as they continue their months-long review into antitrust issues in Silicon Valley.\u00a0       </p><p>          Makan Delrahim, the a          ssistant attorney general for the DOJ antitrust division, opened the event by sharing an email address with investors where they could reach out with concerns or information that might be relevant, even under the condition of anonymity.\u00a0       </p><p>          Manish Kumar, from the DOJ's San Francisco office, sought to ensure investors that the department would enforce antitrust laws as \"conscientiously\" as possible.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"We will certainly be mindful of what was a refrain today of unintended consequences in the course of that,\" he said.       </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Larry Ellison, the founder of database software company Oracle, is hosting a fundraiser for President Trump next week, Recode's Theodore Schleifer reports. The event could draw new political scrutiny to the tech billionaire.\u00a0          </p><p>          Ellison is expected to host Trump at his home in California's Coachella Valley next week for a \"Golf Outing and Reception,\" according to an invitation           obtained by the local newspaper, The Desert Sun          . The paper reports that supporters can join a golf outing and have their photo taken with the president for $100,000. For\u00a0$250,000, contributors get a photo, golf outing and can participate in a round-table discussion.</p><p>Oracle's employees already pushed back against even less significant ties between the company and the administration.\u00a0       </p><p>\"Ellison though has long been one of Silicon Valley's most eccentric and independent-minded leaders, and so he might care little about the blowback,\" Theodore writes. \u00a0</p><p>Ellison is no longer Oracle's chief executive but is its chief technology officer and executive chairman.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Sens.

The bill signals that growing bipartisan skepticism of the technology could drive regulation as early as this year.          </p><p>\"Facial recognition technology is both a powerful and a problematic new frontier,\" Merkley said. \"Before this unregulated market becomes too big to tame, Congress needs to put a moratorium on federal use of facial recognition while we develop responsible and ethical guidelines for its use going forward.\"</p><p>The \"Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act\" \"would create a commission made up of law enforcement, privacy and technology experts and no fewer than seven members representing communities impacted negatively by the use of facial recognition technology. It would also bar state and local governments from using federal funding to purchase the technology.\"</p><p>Merkley and Booker point to\u00a0government research that shows a majority of facial recognition systems are less accurate when used on nonwhite individuals.

The cancellation signals the growing shadow cast by the virus over the global tech industry.\u00a0</p><p>\"Global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSM [Association] to hold the event,\" the telecommunications industry group that hosts the event said. The conference, which is hosted in Barcelona, normally gathers more than\u00a0100,000 guests from around the world, including the biggest names in technology and global telecommunications.</p><p>The short notice roiled attendees who had booked their travel to Barcelona:</p><p>But others saw it as an opportunity for an industry that loves to hype new means of communication like 5G.

Today the organization launched a fellowship to train diverse tech workers to join organizations including Immigration Advocates Network, which uses digital tools to provide immigrants with legal support, and Motivote, a firm focused on increasing voter turnout.\u00a0       </p><p>          Fellows will attend a boot camp to learn how digital tools work in an advocacy environment, said Sarah Stern, the founder of Cultivate, which provides management training and career development resources.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"Understanding the user and understanding what a volunteer or organizer's experience looks like day-to-day is really different\" from what most technologists are used to, Stern told our researcher Tonya Riley.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that American schools and workplaces should be prepared to take the same precautions.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Companies around the globe are already establishing remote work contingency plans. So far this month, at least 65 public company transcripts included the phrases \"work from home\" or \"working from home,\" according to financial data platform Sentieo's blog. That's up from the prior monthly record of just 11, in April 2018.\u00a0       </p><p>          One such company is Coinbase, a digital currency exchange headquartered in San Francisco. Its publicly released contingency plans allow for even more workers to stay home the outbreak intensifies. Options include including potentially limiting visitors to the office and ending meal service in the office if more employees are working from home.\u00a0       </p><p>          But it cautioned that it was planning for the worst scenarios. \"The most important overall context to have here is that we're planning for a really negative outcome,\" the document said. \"We don't expect to see anything like this in reality.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             Remote meeting tech might also get a boost if travel and conferences continue to be canceled due to concerns about covid-19. Facebook announced yesterday it would cancel its upcoming developers' conference due to concerns about the virus. Instead, the company is planning to videostream some of the content. Many tech companies have major conferences in the spring that could be disrupted, and they've already taken steps to limit employee travel to countries such as China.\u00a0       </p><p>             As there are increasing signs that people could be spending more time at home, Wall Street is thinking about its next play. Analysts at MKM Partners suggested video-streaming services such as Netflix or gaming company Activision could come out winners if more people are quarantined and looking for entertainment at home.\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>          \"We tried to identify what products/services/companies would potentially benefit in a world of quarantined individuals. What would people do if stuck inside all day?\" JC O'Hara of MKM Partners said in a note, according to a CNBC report.\u00a0       </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Clearview AI, a controversial facial-recognition start-up, had contracts with thousands of government agencies, retailers and other organizations around the world, Ryan Mac, Caroline Haskins and Logan McDonald report for BuzzFeed News. Documents reveal the company's clients included U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Best Buy, Walmart and a sovereign wealth fund in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The revelations underscore how many entities around the world already were accessing Clearview AI's technology. There are calls to regulate the company, and social networks such as Twitter have mounted legal challenges against Clearview for scraping photos from their services. But there was little public scrutiny of the company until the New York Times revealed last month that the company had developed systems to match photos of people of interest to online images culled from millions of sites.\u00a0</p><p>The company's software has been used by more than 2,200 law enforcement departments, government agencies and companies across 27 countries, according to BuzzFeed.\u00a0</p><p>\"Clearview has taken a flood-the-zone approach to seeking out new clients, providing access not just to organizations, but to individuals within those organizations - sometimes with little or no oversight or awareness from their own management,\" BuzzFeed reports.\u00a0</p><p>The reporting undermines Clearview executives' defense of their product. Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That said on Fox Business earlier this month that it was \"strictly for law enforcement.\" But BuzzFeed reports the company has been pursuing clients in industries as varied as law, retail, banking and gaming.\u00a0</p><p>Clearview pushed back on BuzzFeed's reporting. \"There are numerous inaccuracies in this illegally obtained information,\" Clearview attorney Tor Ekeland told BuzzFeed. \"As there is an ongoing Federal investigation, we have no further comment.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to fine AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile at least $200 million combined for exposing some customers' real-time location data, David Shepardson reports for Reuters.              The companies will be able to challenge the fines before they're finalized, and the precise amount could change.          </p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said earlier this year that \"one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law.\" The FCC and the carriers did not immediately comment.             \u00a0          </p><p>The agency said in May 2018 it was investigating reports that a website vulnerability may have allowed mobile phone customers to be tracked. The investigation expanded into other ways that third-party firms use consumers' location.\u00a0</p><p>Mobile phone companies have permitted location-data use for programs such as roadside assistance, logistics, medical emergency alert services, human trafficking alerts and fraud prevention, David reports.\u00a0</p><p>Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel criticized the agency for taking too long to respond to reports that \"shady middlemen could sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data.\" She added: \"It's chilling to consider what a black market could do with this data.\"</p><p>An industry group representing wireless carriers said last month that \"upon hearing allegations of misuse of the data, carriers quickly investigated, suspended access to the data and subsequently terminated those programs.\"\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Teenagers are using the video-sharing app TikTok to form political coalitions,Taylor Lorenz reports in the New York Times.

His trip will be the companies' chance to weigh in on a host of new proposals from British lawmakers aimed at\u00a0reining\u00a0in Big Tech,                                    which would have broad implications extending beyond the country's borders.                    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, says he is meeting with executives from companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter to tell them they're out of time to self-regulate. The voluntary steps the companies have taken to tackle disinformation haven't been enough, he wrote in an op-ed this weekend as members of the British Parliament unveiled a scathing report that endorsed holding the companies accountable for abusive or harmful content on their platforms.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wright said industry should want to have input as the U.K. considers new regulation, and he plans to talk to the companies about plans to ensure what lawmakers do is\u00a0\"effective.\"</p><p>             \"I'm not asking their permission to do it,\" Wright said in an interview with the BBC this weekend.</p><p>             Wright also said the United Kingdom is well-positioned to \"lead the way\" when it comes to regulating Silicon Valley.\u00a0 That should be cause for concern among technology companies, especially after the British report endorsed a series of tough measures to hold them to a higher standard on disinformation, election integrity and privacy.\u00a0</p><p>             The aggressive international\u00a0calls to crack down\u00a0on Silicon Valley could also provide a template for other governments. Regulators in the United States and other European countries are escalating oversight of technology giants like Facebook after repeated privacy scandals and Russian interference in the 2016 election highlighted the platforms' vulnerability to foreign influence operations.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is in early negotiations\u00a0with the company over a multibillion-dollar, record-setting fine following a probe into its privacy lapses. Germany's competition watchdog recently restricted the social network's practice of merging data from its main service with data it collects from other services it owns like\u00a0WhatsApp as well third-party sites.\u00a0</p><p>The 108-page British report offers a number of recommendations, including proposals to empower local election regulators to oversee social-media companies. The lawmakers\u00a0even endorsed a special tax to\u00a0pay for an independent regulator\u00a0to scrutinize Silicon Valley and prevent harmful content from spreading online.</p><p>             In the report, lawmakers said they hoped other European regulators would use the evidence they gathered to probe Facebook for privacy violations. The report specifically mentions that Ireland is the lead authority on Facebook under Europe's wide-ranging privacy rules and that they\u00a0hoped Helen Dixon, the country's top privacy regulator, would rely on what they uncovered.</p><p>Damian Collins, the British\u00a0lawmaker who leads the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the House of Commons, told my colleague Tony Romm\u00a0there is \"pretty much strong, cross-party support\u00a0for this reform.\"</p><p>             Collins compared the approach to the way the U.K. regulates key industries across the pond such as\u00a0local broadcasters and major banks. Collins said banks, for example,\u00a0have a \"responsibility to report suspicious activity,\" like money laundering, to the authorities. \"That responsibility doesn't exist for the tech companies in the same way,\" he said.          </p><p>Months ago, Collins and his panel convened nine countries as part of an international committee that grilled a top Facebook executive and pledged further oversight of the tech industry. Collins said the plan is for that panel to meet again in May with the goal of looking\u00a0\"more widely at some of these issues affecting technology companies.\"</p><p>Collins wants lawmakers to \"develop a greater international understanding about the sort of standards we want to see,\" though he noted that\u00a0any resulting regulations ultimately will \"differ country to country.\" But Collins said he believes that two key U.S. lawmakers -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel, feel similarly.</p><p>Karim Palant, public policy manager for Facebook in the United Kingdom, said the company shares lawmakers'\u00a0concerns about disinformation and election integrity.\u00a0</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,\" Palant said in a statement. \"We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p>             BITS: Google has vastly expanded its U.S. footprint, but it's done so rather secretly.\u00a0Some\u00a0communities sometimes\u00a0find out information about the company's deals with local officials only after the agreements have been struck, The Washington Post's Elizabeth Dwoskin reported. Google has used nondisclosure agreements when discussing real-estate expansions with local authorities - for instance, a planned second campus in San Jose - and has also resorted to shell companies in talks for building data centers.\u00a0</p><p>\"Public transparency laws are designed to keep the public interest at the contract table, and the way you do that is with information,\" Michelle Wilde Anderson, a Stanford Law School professor who specializes in state and local government law, told my colleague. \"If you scrutinize the winners and losers in this bargain, you see that Google is overwhelmingly the winner. Google has a strategic interest in getting their name out of these deals so that they go down more quietly, without public debate.\"          </p><p>From\u00a0Elizabeth:</p><p>From The Post's\u00a0Brian Fung:\u00a0</p><p>From\u00a0Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary in the Clinton administration:</p><p>             NIBBLES: Disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol\u00a0Hill on how to best protect users' personal information\u00a0could jeopardize the enactment of\u00a0             \u00a0data privacy legislation, according to\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0John D. McKinnon.       </p><p>             Republicans as well as Silicon Valley companies want federal legislation to preempt states' data privacy rules. But many Democrats oppose the idea. \"States have been at the vanguard of protecting Americans,\" Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy\u00a0Pelosi (D-Calif.), told the Journal. \"All Americans have benefited from state privacy and data breach laws, so their role as policy innovator and law enforcer must be respected.\"       </p><p>Republicans have said that state laws with different requirements could harm companies and consumers. \"Legislative aides say measures under discussion include giving users the right to move their data from one company to another and to allow them to deny use of their data during routine online interactions,\" according to the Journal. \"Participants say there is still momentum for change and room for negotiation.\" Lawmakers will also have to grapple with other issues in their debates over data privacy, including how to regulate\u00a0data brokers as well as businesses outside the tech industry.          </p><p>             BYTES: Apple has made major internal changes as the company tries to become less dependent on iPhone sales.\u00a0But the moves have\u00a0left some rank-and-file employees unsettled, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Tripp Mickle. Such changes, which date back to last year,\u00a0include\u00a0a shakeup among Apple's leadership ranks and a shift in the company's priorities to diversify sources of growth.</p><p>             The company is working to unveil a video offering next month as part of its efforts to expand its services business. It is also reassessing its priorities around artificial intelligence, hardware and retail.          </p><p>\"Leadership moves of the past few months include promoting artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea to the executive team; replacing departing retail chief Angela Ahrendts with head of human resources Deirdre O'Brien; and pushing out top Siri voice-assistant executive Bill Stasior,\" the Journal reported. \"Apple has also trimmed 200 staffers from its autonomous-vehicle project, and is redirecting much of the engineering resources in its services business, led by Eddy Cue, into efforts around Hollywood programming.\"          </p><p>             - Uber sued New York City over a vote last year to put a cap on new ride-hailing licenses, CNBC's\u00a0Steve Kovach reported. \"Rather than rely on alternatives supported by transportation experts and economists, the City chose to significantly restrict service, growth and competition by the for-hire vehicle industry, which will have a disproportionate impact on residents outside of Manhattan who have long been underserved by yellow taxis and mass transit,\" says Uber's lawsuit, according to CNBC.</p><p>             - Amazon's decision to scrap a project to open headquarters in New York probably won't cause much damage to the tech firm, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Jay Greene. The company intends to increase hiring in its technology hubs in 17 other cities in the United States and Canada.\u00a0\"For a company whose global head count has more than quintupled in the past five years to nearly 648,000, walking from the New York deal is unlikely to either slow its ascent or stop its hiring in the city,\" the Journal reported.\u00a0\"The company has more than 800 open positions in New York.\" (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

But it's still a political target in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the top tech industry critics in Congress is now calling for the Justice Department to open a new, criminal antitrust investigation of the e-commerce juggernaut. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said recent reports indicate the company \"has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly.\" His letter, addressed to Attorney General William Barr, cites the Wall Street Journal's reporting that Amazon employees used data from third-party sellers to develop competing products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He said government action is even more urgent because of the virus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Thousands of small businesses have been forced to suspend in-store retail and instead rely on Amazon because of shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic,\" Hawley said. \"Amazon's reported data practices are an existential threat that may prevent these businesses from ever recovering.\"</p><p>The backlash from Hawley stands in stark contrast to the company's goodwill tour.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon has been trumpeting the many new jobs it's creating during the pandemic and its role in delivering essential items. The company's stock climbed to a record high in recent weeks as its e-commerce business appears to not just be immune to the pandemic but benefiting from it. As the country grapples with a record-setting surge in unemployment, the company has announced plans to hire 175,000 new employees, mostly in jobs in its warehouses. Meanwhile, the pandemic dealt a blow to brick-and-mortar retailers, as companies such as Macy's furlough thousands, as Elizabeth Dwoskin reported.\u00a0</p><p>\"There are really two Americas right now,\" said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, told Elizabeth. \"There is Big Tech and there is everyone else. They can do what very few companies can do, which is play offense in the middle of a pandemic.\"</p><p>(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Amazon has pushed back on the notion the pandemic could make it even stronger as other companies falter. Amazon spokesman Dan Perlet told Elizabeth in a statement, \"While we appreciate the opportunity as a retailer to serve customers and are seeing increased demand for essential products, there are no winners out of Covid-19.\"</p><p>Amazon did not immediately respond to request for comment about Hawley's letter, but the company told the Wall Street Journal it has launched an internal investigation into how its employees were using seller data. \u00a0</p><p>Yet the health crisis is exacerbating long-running sore spots for the company in Washington. \u00a0Amazon's recent success could raise new questions about its power.          </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission was already reportedly scrutinizing the company, interviewing sellers about its data practices. Amazon is also part of the House antitrust subcommittee's investigation of the tech industry, as well DOJ's broad review of large tech companies. Amazon, however, has not disclosed formal investigative inquiries from DOJ or FTC as have Facebook and Alphabet.\u00a0</p><p>Those investigations are slowed for now, Elizabeth reports.\u00a0</p><p>But some of the trends that prompted them could be accelerated as many pandemic sellers become even more dependent on Amazon's channels.</p><p>ProPublica reported many suppliers are favoring Amazon over other retailers out of fear the company's algorithms will bury them in rankings if they have product shortages at a time when such vendors are more reliant on e-commerce. Amazon spokeswoman Jodi Seth says the ProPublica report is based on \"temporary changes\" made in light of covid-19.\u00a0</p><p>\"It shouldn't be surprising to anyone that, by definition, products need to be in stock to be on a current best sellers list, and that sellers will prioritize sending stock to retailers where they are out of stock,\" she said. \"These temporary changes were in no way designed to advantage any particular Amazon brand, retail vendor or seller-they were based on how to best serve customers during the outbreak while helping ensure the health and safety of our employees.\"</p><p>             President Trump's long-running feud with the company has also persisted.          </p><p>The administration has weighed tough terms on an emergency coronavirus loan to the U.S. Postal Service in an effort to change charges for delivering packages, Jacob Bogage and Lisa Rein report.\u00a0 A potential price hike on package deliveries - USPS's sole area of profitability in recent years - could hit Amazon and other Internet companies that Trump argues are exploiting the service.\u00a0</p><p>Trump recently suggested to reporters that USPS loses money on every package they deliver for Amazon - a claim The Post's fact checker has given four Pinocchios.</p><p>Trump has also conspicuously omitted mention of Amazon at many White House coronavirus task force briefings - even when praising actions by other tech company chiefs or hosting major retail executives. Bezos, however, is a member of the administration's Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups retail task force.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             The virus is also renewing concerns among regulators about the company's treatment of warehouse workers.          </p><p>The New York state attorney general's office says Amazon may have violated safety standards by taking \"inadequate\" steps to protect warehouse workers in the state amid the pandemic, NPR reported last night.\u00a0</p><p>The office says the company may have run afoul of the state's whistleblower laws for dismissing a warehouse worker who helped lead a protest in a Staten Island facility, according to a letter to Amazon obtained by NPR. The worker, Christian Smalls, called to close the plant after several workers there contracted the coronavirus. Employees have fallen sick at Amazon warehouses around the world, and they have complained Amazon is not offering them proper protective gear.</p><p>\"While we continue to investigate, the information so far available to us raises concerns that Amazon's health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,\" as well as other federal and state guidelines, Letitia James's staff wrote in the letter.\u00a0       </p><p>Five Democratic lawmakers also recently pressed Bezos on the company's decision to fire Smalls.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon has said Smalls was fired for putting other workers at risk by coming to the warehouse after coming in contact with another employee who tested positive for the coronavirus. The company has also said it's taking measures to keep staff safe, such as enforcing social distancing and supplying masks to U.S. and European workers.</p><p>Surveillance technology could help Americans get back to work. But it's untested and raises privacy concerns.\u00a0</p><p>          Businesses, schools and other venues that attract large crowds are embracing surveillance systems,\u00a0including fever-screening stations and\u00a0Bluetooth-enabled social distancing detectors, Drew Harwell reports.\u00a0       </p><p>             So far federal regulators haven't put limits on the technologies.\u00a0 Last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u00a0loosened rules to allow employers to take workers' temperatures and even reject coronavirus-positive applicants. And\u00a0Food and Drug Administration guidelines that suggest temperature-scanning cameras\u00a0should be used alongside clinical-grade thermometers aren't legally binding.       </p><p>          That could set a new norm as more workplaces and businesses such as hotels and grocery stores adopt thermal cameras that have yet to be backed by significant research.       </p><p>             Tech companies behind the new field of products say their work is crucial to reopening the economy, however.          </p><p>          \"We feel like this AI can help bring things back to normalcy,\" said Daniel Putterman, co-chief of thermal surveillance company Kogniz. \"I don't believe body temperature is a piece of private information anymore.\"\u00a0</p><p>The government website responsible for doling out a new round of small-business loans crashed yesterday.</p><p>The glitch left thousands of small businesses wondering if they will get access to the additional $484 billion in Paycheck Protection Program funding that Congress passed last week, Aaron Gregg, Renae Merle and Ben Golliver report.</p><p>Bankers who worked through the weekend to prepare applications for clients expressed their fury online. Cynthia Blankenship, corporate president of Bank of the West, a small community lender in Texas:</p><p>Rob Nichols, CEO and president of the American Bankers Association, said his trade group's members voiced concerns to the agency:</p><p>Tab Bank in Utah said on Monday it had been able to push only five of more than 1,200 applications through the online system before it crashed.</p><p>\"I have been sitting here, watching my screen, refreshing for three hours,\" Curt Queyrouze, the bank's chief executive, told The Post. \"The entire time we've been talking, it's said 'load.' \"</p><p>Tab Bank processed only 90 applications before the initial $349 billion in small-business coronavirus relief funding ran out. Congress passed an additional \u00a0$310 billion in funding last week. Some big businesses criticized for exhausting the initial fund, including Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers, have returned their loans.\u00a0</p><p>             The Small Businesses Administration warned businesses that system problems could occur, media director Carol Wilkerson said.          </p><p>\"SBA notified lenders yesterday that pacing of applications into the E-Tran system would occur, meaning all lenders would be able to submit at the same rate per hour,\" Wilkerson said.\u00a0</p><p>Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast extended their promise to not shut off service or charge late fees through June 30.\u00a0</p><p>The companies first agreed to the pause in March after the Federal Communications Commission urged providers to keep Americans online during the pandemic, David Shepardson at Reuters reports. Comcast also promised to extend unlimited data for no additional charge.\u00a0</p><p>Other companies are expected to follow suit this week in announcing that they will extend their programs past the end of the school year, Reuters reports.\u00a0</p><p>Despite increased demand from more Americans staying at home, telecom companies have reported that networks are holding up well - a claim that has been echoed by President Trump and some FCC officials.\u00a0</p><p>Some venture capitalists are criticizing start-ups for taking small-business coronavirus relief funds.</p><p>Many of the start-ups, already backed with millions in funding, are using the money to extend their cash on hand rather than keep employees, Erin Griffith and David McCabe at the New York Times report. \u00a0</p><p>\"We just think those companies ought to not get in line in front of Main Street businesses,\" said Albert Weng, an investor at Union Square Ventures who is part of a small chorus of VCs urging start-ups not to grab the cash.</p><p>             But others in the industry say start-ups are just as entitled to the assistance, regardless of their backing.          </p><p>\"These are potentially some of the most important companies for America's future competitiveness,\" said Justin Field, the senior vice president of government affairs at the National Venture Capital Association, a lobbying group.</p><p>More from the industry:</p><p>Britain's National Health Service will eschew the contact tracing technology that Apple and Google are rolling out and launch its own software. \u00a0          </p><p>The government-designed app will match contacts on a centralized computer and then send alerts to individuals, Leo Kelion at BBC News reports.</p><p>Tech giants have said their approach better secures users' personal information, but global governments have been skeptical of their promises. The approach puts the United Kingdom at odds with a number of other allies including Germany and Switzerland that are moving forward using Google and Apple tools.</p><p>Amazon reinstated a worker at its Shakopee, Minn., fulfillment center after more than 50 workers staged a walkout Sunday.\u00a0</p><p>The worker alleges she was fired for staying home to protect her two children, an action that would have been covered by unlimited paid leave extended by the company during the pandemic, Lauren Kaori Gurley at Vice reports. (That policy will terminate on May 1.) \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Amazon wouldn't confirm whether the worker had been fired and accused the workers of \"spreading misinformation\" without elaborating. Amazon has also terminated other Shakopee and Staten Island warehouse workers involved in protests of working conditions, though the company denies the terminations were protest-related.</p><p>Zoom's rivals have found a new arena for competition.

U.S. immigration courts are now wrestling with a backlog of more than 750,000 pending asylum applications - even as denial of such claims reached a record high in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Members of the U.S. Digital Service, the elite technology unit that brings in private-sector workers to help the federal government innovate, have created a new tool that could reduce the time it takes for asylum officers to\u00a0write up a key report in the application process\u00a0from four hours to 30 minutes. The team's new online assessment replaces the Microsoft Word documents asylum officers were using to write reports after interviews with asylum seekers.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a very weighty process and obviously a long pole in the tent in processing these applications,\" said Stephanie Neill, the executive director of the Digital Service team at the Department of Homeland Security. These are the service's\u00a0first public comments about the endeavor, which is being used in a pilot program in San Francisco before it's pushed nationwide early next year.</p><p>             Yet the program -- which brought in former\u00a0product managers, designers and engineers from technology companies such as Google to embed alongside asylum officers -- is especially striking at a time when immigration has been perhaps\u00a0the single most contentious issue between the tech industry and Trump's White House.\u00a0          </p><p>The USDS\u00a0was created during the Obama administration\u00a0to recruit tech hotshots solve the government's worst technology problems, and the previous administration made significant inroads with the left-leaning Silicon Valley. As\u00a0Trump's immigration policies\u00a0alienate\u00a0many in the tech industry, USDS is in\u00a0a challenging position as it makes the case that technologists should leave behind high-powered jobs, lofty salaries and California sunshine to work for the agencies whose very policies they rally against.          </p><p>             Since Trump's election, USDS has largely steered clear of touting its work on immigration.\u00a0          </p><p>When talking to potential USDS recruits, Neill says she tries to focus on the impact the private-sector workers can have within the federal government. \"We have an opportunity to have a great impact with these vulnerable populations right now,\" Neill said.</p><p>             Technology executives have been some of the most vocal opponents of the administration's travel ban on foreign nationals from Muslim-majority countries, Trump's family separation policies and crackdown on H-1B visas.\u00a0          </p><p>But Neill hopes that this latest asylum-focused project is something civic-minded tech workers will support. This specific project to identify inefficiencies in the asylum system began in 2017 to chip away at the massive backlog of applications. \"With current trends, obviously the numbers will continue to rise,\" Neill said. \"Asylum seekers are essentially applying for asylum and then waiting four to six years before they can get an actual decision.\"</p><p>As The Post's Nick Miroff reported in November: \"Soaring numbers of migrants have entered the United States taking this administrative path in recent years, often crossing illegally to turn themselves in to U.S. border agents. Since 2014, asylum claims at the border have increased fourfold, adding to a backlog of more than 750,000 pending cases in U.S. immigration courts.\" Right now, thousands of migrants are living in tent cities in Tijuana following a weeks-long caravan journey through Central America to apply for asylum in the United States, according to the AP's Marko Alvarez. He recently reported that some families are illegally crossing into San Diego, as the United States processes only 100 at most asylum applications per day.</p><p>             And as backlash from the public and policymakers mounts against Big Tech over how they handled privacy issues and data breaches, Neill is hoping USDS can benefit from tech talent who might be second-guessing their ties to embattled tech titans. \"I think more now than ever technologists are wondering why they're building tech at Google and Facebook,\" she said. \"You know why you're here.\"</p><p>             But that hasn't stopped the numbers from going down. There are about 162 people are serving at USDS, an approximately 20 percent decline from the roughly 200 people who worked there at the end of the Obama administration. Neill said the group's routine practice of having workers complete tours of duty that average 18 months - and federal hiring freezes - contributed to that decline.</p><p>USDS did not answer repeated requests for comment on whether the number of applications from tech workers or Silicon Valley had declined since the Obama administration.\u00a0USDS did stress in a statement that it is recruiting from across America - not just Silicon Valley - from cities ranging from Phoenix to Austin to cultivate \"diversity of thought.\"</p><p>             The service's focus on the projects, not the politics, marks a stark contrast from the way the Obama administration leveraged the administration's policy positions to inspire technologists to leave Silicon Valley for a stint in the government. The group, which launched in 2014 to institutionalize the practices that saved the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, touted the role tech workers could play in helping the administration realize its priorities. That sense of unity on policy objectives was palpable, said a former Obama official who worked on immigration issues: \"I think the people who came during the Obama administration believed in the things we were doing.\"</p><p>USDS did other work on immigration services during the Obama administration, including an effort to overhaul the refugee admission process that was widely viewed as a success. Until 2016, DHS could only approve refugee registration forms using an ink approval stamp on a physical file. USDS created a system to approve the cases digitally, allowing the Obama administration to meet its goal of admitting 15,000 additional refugees that year. Other efforts to digitize immigration services that began during the Bush administration largely failed, and USDS has been working on modernizing other immigration systems since 2014.</p><p>Eleanor Acer, an advocate for refugees at Human Rights First, says she welcomes any changes that would make the asylum process more efficient and heard positive things about the work USDS did for refugees. But Acer said             any changes made to the asylum process during the Trump administration should be scrutinized, especially because the administration has used the backlog to justify its decision to slash the number of refugees allowed in the country.          </p><p>\"It will be more important than ever to make sure whatever changes are made to improve efficiency do not undermine fairness of the decision-making process,\" she said.</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0 New York\u00a0just became the first U.S. city to set a minimum wage for ride-hailing drivers in\u00a0a landmark decision for gig economy workers burdened with the steep expenses associated\u00a0with driving for Uber or Lyft,\u00a0The Washington Post's Peter Holley reported.\u00a0 The decision by New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission could set a precedent for other cities considering how they can support app-based drivers, who\u00a0as contractors do not have many of the benefits or protections of standard employees. The rate is set at $17.22 per hour after expenses, and the\u00a0Independent Drivers Guild\u00a0said the hourly rate is the equivalent of the city's employee minimum wage, which is $15 per hour.\u00a0\"The new pay rules, which apply to car services Uber, Lyft, Via and Juno, go into effect at the end of the year,\" Peter writes.</p><p>             But Uber, the largest ride-sharing company, criticized the move.\u00a0\"In a statement responding to the wage increase, Uber's director of public affairs, Jason Post, said the new rules will lead to unnecessarily high fare increases for riders and fail to deal with traffic congestion in Manhattan's central business district,\" Peter wrote.\u00a0\"'The TLC's rules do not take into account incentives or bonuses forcing companies to raise rates even higher,' the statement said. 'Companies use incentives and bonuses as part of driver earnings to ensure reliability citywide by providing a monetary incentive to drivers to complete trips in areas that need them the most (such as outside of Manhattan).' \"</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0The Treasury recommended that the Postal Service review its pricing for e-commerce packages in a report that could impact a wide range of online retailers. However, it did not single out Amazon, one of Trump's favorite targets.\u00a0The task force is\u00a0\"recommending a slew of options\" to make the Postal Service \"more profitable,\" as my\u00a0colleague\u00a0Rachel Siegel reported,\u00a0\"it did not go so far as to say the financially strapped Postal Service is losing money to Amazon.com, a company which contracts services from the Postal Service and that has consistently drawn Trump's ire.\" (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>\"On Tuesday, that task force suggested steps the Postal Service can take to respond to the rise of e-commerce, but senior administration officials said the findings don't apply to any particular Postal Service customer,\" Rachel wrote. However, Trump's\u00a0\"push for this review of the Post Office's practices has been viewed as an official action taken to penalize the company,\" according to my colleague.          </p><p>             BYTES: Three tech giants wasted no time in\u00a0 establishing contact\u00a0with new officials at\u00a0the Federal Trade Commission as pressure mounts for regulators\u00a0to crack down on Silicon Valley tech giants. Google, Amazon and Snap\u00a0\"reached out to schmooze the four FTC commissioners appointed by [Trump] soon after [they] were sworn into office in May, according to 73 pages of email communications obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request,\"\u00a0Politico's Margaret Harding McGill reported. \"Google was particularly active, inviting commission staff to coffee, setting up a meeting with the new Republican chairman, Joe Simons, and touting a project it said would give users more control of their data.\"</p><p>The emails that Politico obtained do not show communications from Facebook, which is under investigation by the FTC. \"It was not immediately clear if Facebook simply didn't communicate with the commission offices, or if the FTC is keeping such records under wraps as it investigates the company,\" Harding McGill wrote. As part of Amazon's correspondence with the FTC, a company executive offered\u00a0to \"help\" a\u00a0staffer at the commission, according to Politico. \"Amazon's head of policy in Washington, D.C., Brian Huseman, who previously worked for two Republican FTC chairs, also offered to assist Simons' new chief of staff, writing, 'And if I can help in any way with the job, just holler,' \"\u00a0Harding McGill reported.</p><p>             - Lawmakers will still get a chance to grill Google chief executive Sundar Pichai even though his scheduled appearance on Capitol Hill this week was postponed. Pichai is now set to\u00a0\"testify to Congress on Dec. 11, after lawmakers rescheduled their original hearing in light of former president George H.W. Bush's death,\" The Post's Tony Romm reported. \"The new hearing - confirmed by the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday - will see Pichai field questions from Congress for the first time in response to Republicans' concerns that Google's search algorithm, and services it owns including YouTube, unfairly censor conservative-leaning users. The session initially had been scheduled for this Wednesday.\"</p><p>             - Police drones are coming to New York, and so are concerns about surveillance. \"The New York Police Department on Tuesday unveiled plans to deploy 14 of the unmanned fliers and to train 29 officers to operate them, opening an intense debate about whether an agency previously criticized for illegally surveilling citizens should possess such powerful technology,\" the New York Times's Ashley Southall and Ali Winston reported. \"Senior police officials said the drones would be used for monitoring giant crowds, investigating hazardous waste spills, handling hostage situations and reaching remote areas in crime scenes, among other tasks. They will not be used for routine police patrols, unlawful surveillance or to enforce traffic laws, the officials said. Nor will they be equipped with weapons.\"\u00a0</p><p>Yet critics are unconvinced. Southall and Winston wrote that \"lawyers specializing in civil liberty cases who reviewed the department's proposed drone policy said it did not go far enough in preventing the police from misusing the devices. Advocates for police reform expressed alarm about the department's growing surveillance capacity.\"</p><p>             - More tech news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Facebook announced a policy change that should alleviate pressure on app developers. \"Facebook will now freely allow developers to build competitors to its features upon its own platform,\"TechCrunch's Josh Constine wrote. The social network had used the policy to punish other companies, according to TechCrunch. \"Facebook had previously enforced the policy selectively to hurt competitors that had used its Find Friends or viral distribution features,\" according to Constine. \"Apps like Vine, Voxer, MessageMe, Phhhoto and more had been cut off from Facebook's platform for too closely replicating its video, messaging or GIF creation tools.\"</p><p>             - Google is cracking down on rogue apps, BuzzFeed News's Craig Silverman reported. \"Google removed two popular Cheetah Mobile and Kika Tech apps from its Play store today after finding 'deceptive and malicious behavior' that was first outlined in a BuzzFeed News report,\" Silverman wrote. \"Google said an internal investigation found that CM File Manager and the Kika Keyboard contain code used to execute ad fraud techniques known as click injection and/or click flooding. The activity was first documented in seven Cheetah apps and one from Kika Tech by Kochava, an app analytics and attribution company that shared its research with BuzzFeed News. A Google spokesperson said it continues to investigate the apps, and that it expects to take additional action.\"</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - After a former Facebook employee wrote a memo criticizing how the company treats black people on its platform and within its ranks, Facebook blocked the post. And then it restored it. \"Mark S Luckie, who recently stepped down as strategic partner manager, published the piece on Facebook last week detailing his experiences as a black employee at a tech corporation that largely excludes African Americans, saying the company has also unfairly censored black people on the platform,\" the Guardian's Sam Levin wrote. \"Facebook appeared to prove Luckie's point this week by removing the letter before eventually reinstating it.\" Luckie is also a former Post employee.</p><p>             - More news about technology\u00a0workforce issues:          </p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz around the Web:\u00a0          </p><p>             Aaron Crowell, a longtime health insider, and Lyft's Dan Trigub\u00a0have joined Uber as the company pushes into medical transport, CNBC's Chrissy Farr reports.\u00a0</p><p>             Tomorrow          </p><p>Sen.

Just yesterday,\u00a0a security firm revealed that more than 540 million Facebook records - including users' comments and account names - were left exposed on an Amazon cloud-computing server.          </p><p>In his letter, Simons told Congress that if the agency were given 100 new attorneys focused on data security and privacy, the FTC would not only be able to devote more resources to opening new cases and enforcement, but it could also spend more time studying new technologies and privacy concerns, through workshops, reports and industry studies.\u00a0He also requested funding for\u00a010 to 15 more\u00a0technologists, who could conduct additional research and serve on case teams.</p><p>Justin Brookman, a former policy director of the FTC's Office of Technology Research and Investigation, said agency\u00a0resources dedicated to privacy are \"too slim.\" He also said there's growing demand for internal technologists because each case increasingly has technical elements.</p><p>\"The technologists they have are stretched; they're supporting multiple cases,\"\u00a0said Brookman, who now serves as the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumer Reports. \"With five, it's really hard to meaningfully support the cases they should be doing.\"</p><p>             The FTC's request comes as there is a push to pass a federal privacy law in Congress. Several of the proposals\u00a0under consideration\u00a0would give the FTC greater resources and authority, but it's unclear whether lawmakers can agree on legislation.          </p><p>\"It's shocking that a nation of over 320 million people only has 40 people dedicated to privacy and data security at the FTC,\" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the House Energy and Commerce chairman, said in a statement. \"We will look at giving the FTC more responsibilities in a comprehensive privacy law, but in the meantime we need to ensure that it has the resources necessary to effectively protect consumers.\"</p><p>The sharp contrast between the FTC and European\u00a0resources highlights the divergent approach\u00a0global policymakers have taken to addressing data security. In the United States, the FTC currently has very limited authorities to bring fines against companies for first-time offenses, with the exception of certain instances such as when they involve young children's data. Europe, on the other hand, has the General Data Protection Regulation, which allows the European Union to bring hefty penalties against companies for mishandling users' data. Since the law took effect last year, Europe has been one of the most active sheriff's of Silicon Valley's data practices, and some U.S. lawmakers are looking to GDPR as a model as they develop their own frameworks.\u00a0</p><p>As my colleague Tony Romm has noted, a major test of the FTC's capabilities is its ongoing investigation into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. The agency is negotiating\u00a0a multibillion-dollar fine against the company as it probes whether the social network broke an 8-year-old agreement with the FTC to better steward people's data.\u00a0</p><p>             Calls for more technical resources at the FTC aren't new, even though they're getting more attention at a time when Silicon Valley giants are under greater scrutiny. Efforts to increase tech talent at the agency date back to the Obama administration, when the position\u00a0of chief technologist was first created.\u00a0          However the position           has been empty for about a year.\u00a0          That vacancy has attracted criticism about the current\u00a0administration's commitment to tech talent.       </p><p>          From former FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani:       </p><p>Some who served in the Obama administration were encouraged to see that Simons requested\u00a0more technology resources and supported his request.\u00a0</p><p>\"At the end of the Obama administration, there was recognition that FTC needed additional resources to support its important competition and consumer protection mission,\"\u00a0 Terrell McSweeny, a former FTC commissioner, told me. \"It's encouraging to see the new leadership at the FTC embrace that position.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: People 65 and older play an outsize role in civic life. But they also disproportionately fall prey to misinformation online and struggle more with digital literacy than other demographics,\u00a0Buzzfeed's Craig Silverman reports.\u00a0</p><p>But as technology companies and governments increasingly invest in news literacy projects, they're generally focusing on younger people.\u00a0</p><p> \"This means the very people who struggle the most with digital information and technology risk being left to fend for themselves in an environment where they're being targeted and exploited precisely because of their vulnerabilities,\" Silverman writes.\u00a0</p><p>As the 65 and older demographic rapidly comes online, they're more likely to vote and participate politically in other ways, such as through political donations.\u00a0</p><p> \"With more and more older people going online, and future 65-plus generations already there, the online behavior of older people, as well as their rising power, is incredibly important - yet often ignored,\" Silverman writes.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: House Democrats will hold a hearing with Google and Facebook next week on their efforts to crackdown on the spead of white nationalism and hate speech,my colleague Tony Romm reports.\u00a0\u00a0The hearing, scheduled for April 9 by the House Judiciary Committee, follows a mass shooting last month in New Zealand and other recent racially motivated attacks.\u00a0</p><p>The\u00a0hearing\u00a0seeks to probe \"the impact white nationalist groups have on American communities and the spread of white identity ideology,\" the lawmakers\u00a0announced yesterday, along with \"what social media companies can do\" to quell the proliferation of extremist content online.</p><p> \"Facebook, Google and other tech giants long have faced criticism from Congress for failing to crack down on a wide array of abusive posts, photos and videos that attack people on the basis of race, gender or other traits,\" Tony writes. \"These companies and their peers, including Twitter, explicitly bar such attacks. But their heightened attention to the issue and investments in more content reviewers -along with more potent artificial intelligence tools - still haven't thwarted the proliferation of troubling content.\"</p><p>The proliferation of the New Zealand shooting videos on social media services put this issue front and center most recently. But as Tony notes, the problem is even worse on lesser-known services, such as Gab.ai and 8chan. Those services were used by the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings last fall.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Proto, the company that Whatsapp partnered with to launch a tip line, revealed that its primary goal is to collect research -- not necessarily to immediately address\u00a0misinformation on the service, Buzzfeed's\u00a0Ryan Mac and Pranav\u00a0Dixit report. (We covered the new service and what it means for WhatsApp parent company's Facebook global battle against disinformation\u00a0in yesterday's Technology 202).\u00a0</p><p>WhatsApp unveiled the service on Tuesday as a way people could report suspicious messages and receive a response letting them know if they were confirmed or debunked. But Proto, the Indian startup partnering with Whatsapp on the initiative, had a different message.\u00a0</p><p> \"But when BuzzFeed News inquired about the tip line's effectiveness after submitting several tips and receiving no responses, Proto, the Indian-based company that partnered with WhatsApp, posted\u00a0an FAQ website\u00a0that notes the project is \"not a helpline\" and isn't primarily designed to provide feedback,\" Mac and Dixit report.\u00a0\"Proto uses the tip line 'only as a means to collect information that is otherwise inaccessible given the nature of private messaging.'\"</p><p>Proto also said the tip line is \"not a helpline that will be able to provide a\u00a0 response to every user.\" Proto stated there is a 24-hour window after users submit a tip in which they should get a message fact-checking it or stating it is \"out of scope.\"\u00a0</p><p>A WhatsApp spokesperson told the Buzzfeed reporters that Tuesday's message wasn't intended to imply that every user would receive a response to their tip during the Indian election.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-e0de28019446461fa7ec3649a8b0bd3a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTB-8KF1-DXKP-J38M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1611\"/><timeReceived>12:47 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the Republican charged with leading the Senate's work on tech issues says lawmakers' first\u00a0priority needs to be data privacy legislation.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Senate Judiciary Committee's new tech task force leader, Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), wants to use her perch to hold tech companies accountable. But before Congress aims its hammer at Big Tech's power, she says lawmakers need to pass data privacy legislation and see how that changes the companies' business models and impacts competition in the market.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think what you're going to see us do in the Senate is a more steady,\u00a0incremental approach,\" Blackburn told me.</p><p>             That approach splits sharply from the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee, which has opened a wide-ranging, bipartisan investigation into technology companies' power and their impact on competition. Democrats\u00a0have already held a hearing with executives from top tech companies on antitrust issues, and their work to scale back\u00a0tech's power is expected to only ramp up in the fall when Congress returns.\u00a0          </p><p>             The diverging priorities illustrate that while there is a broad bipartisan consensus that Silicon Valley is overdue for regulation, there's little agreement in a divided Congress about which tech policy issues should even be the priority - let alone how lawmakers should craft such measures.\u00a0          </p><p>Blackburn's task force kicked off its work just before recess last month when the Tennessee Republican\u00a0hosted a bipartisan group of senators for a meeting with executives from companies including Mozilla and Snap. Before the Senate left for recess, Blackburn spoke to The Technology 202 about her priorities for the new task force.

But because Facebook does not explicitly disclose to users that their content is reviewed by a third party, reviewers expressed concern to Sarah that the work was unethical.       </p><p>Facebook told Sarah that the contractors were assigned conversation audio that Facebook Messenger users had elected to have transcribed, and that the contractors were being used to check the accuracy of the artificial intelligence used to transcribe the conversations. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied that the company uses audio recordings in targeting ads in an April 2018 testimony in front of the Senate, but did not explain what happens to recordings after they are collected.       </p><p>          Critics and lawmakers have scrutinized Amazon, Apple and Google for using human reviewers without asking for consent. Microsoft\u00a0also recently came under fire\u00a0for secretly using human reviews of translated audio to improve performance of its software. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)       </p><p>             BYTES: Rival job search websites are asking the European Union's top regulator to temporarily halt Google's job search services in the region while it investigates what the 23 companies argue is \"anticompetitive behavior,\"Reuters's Foo Yun Chee and Paresh Dave report. The request follows a similar complaint in the E.U. from Google rival Yelp, which claims the search giant eats up the traffic of competitors in favor of its own products.</p><p>The complaint, which claims that Google gives an unfair advantage to its own job search feature in its search results, was sent to European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday. Google maintains that because it allows rival search services to use the feature if their listings meet format standards decided by Google, it is not in violation of antitrust laws.\u00a0</p><p>The tool has received more mixed reviews in the United States, where some legacy job sites that\u00a0comply with the search engine's guidelines say they've seen an increase in traffic and applicants. Others, such as Henry Shao, CEO of job search start-up Zippia, agree that Google unfairly demotes companies that don't comply with its requirements.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department have both announced plans to look into online competition in the United States, but both declined to comment to Reuters on Google's job search.</p><p>             BYTES: FTC Chair Joseph Simons would consider breaking up big tech companies depending on the outcome of his agency's investigation into anticompetitive practices in the tech industry,he told Bloomberg News's David McLaughlin in an interview. That could include Facebook, which is being investigated by the FTC and has been accused by lawmakers and competitors of trying quash its competition by buying up rivals, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>\"If you have to, you do it,\" Simons, who oversees an agency task force that is broadly examining competition in tech,\u00a0said about potentially undoing mergers. \"It's not ideal because it's very messy. But if you have to you have to.\" Simons told Bloomberg that it's possible the FTC and the Justice Department, which is working in parallel to examine online platforms and retail, could pursue antitrust investigations into the same companies for different reasons.\u00a0The Justice Department is targeting Google's digital advertising and search business as officials launch a wide-ranging antitrust probe of large tech companies, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Talent news at the intersection of the tech industry and Washington          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-75c5a29392fb4cb5a25c927320ee4013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTG-DW51-DXKP-J1GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><timeReceived>12:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 14, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And some American advocates are hopeful the privacy push across the pond could put pressure on Congress and U.S. regulators to take action.\u00a0          </p><p>             They argue the U.S. children's privacy law is overdue for an update: It was written more than 20 years ago, before the advent of smartphones and many of the services that the U.K. regulations address.\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>          James P. Steyer, the chief executive and founder of the families advocacy nonprofit group Common Sense, told The Technology 202 that he's \"thrilled\" to see Britain taking steps to protect children online.\u00a0       </p><p>\"Young people should be able to learn, grow and benefit from technology without being subject to harms and this code establishes standards for companies to follow and prioritize children's best interests,\" he told me in an email. \"Parents, teachers and families everywhere deserve such safeguards, and we hope the U.S. soon follows suit.\"</p><p>             There are signs that the appetite to address children's privacy is growing on this side of the Atlantic. The Federal Trade Commission has been stepping up its efforts to address children's privacy in recent months,             hitting             YouTube with a record $170 million fine for allegedly violating the children's privacy law. YouTube had to make changes to how it addresses children's content on its service per its settlement with the agency. The agency has also launched a review of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) that could result in updates.\u00a0</p><p>             But Congress has been slow to act. Children's digital privacy appeared to be one of the rare issues of bipartisan consensus in Washington last year, but lawmakers have yet to gain serious traction for proposals that would update COPPA, which was written in 1998 and only applies to children under the age of 13.</p><p>          Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced legislation in March that would update the law to include privacy provisions to protect teens under 16. It would also introduce a \"Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors\" that would limit the collection of children's personal information, and create a new division at the FTC dedicated to children's privacy. Some lawmakers have said elements of it could be included in a broad federal privacy bill. Reps. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) and Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) introduced similar legislation in the House earlier this month, The Hill reports.\u00a0</p><p>             However, it's unlikely that any children's privacy policies in the U.S. would be as aggressive as the U.K. code. The new rules are rooted in Europe's broad data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation. Like GDPR, companies that fail to comply would face steep fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue. By contrast, the U.S. currently does not have a general federal online privacy law.\u00a0</p><p>             British industry groups and companies have also challenged the rules, warning that it could place a burden on start-ups and give an advantage to large tech companies that have more resources for compliance.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The UK has been pioneering in relation to its protection of children on the Internet, particularly its move toward protecting children's data online, which is very fresh,\" Victoria Nash, deputy director of the Oxford Internet Institute and an expert on children's use of digital services, told The Financial Times. \"However, my two concerns are that this wide-ranging regulation tends to increase monopoly power of big tech firms, rather than decrease it. The second is a slight residual concern that it focuses on specific features or tools [like geolocation], which aren't in themselves always problematic.\"</p><p>          If the code is approved by Parliament, companies would have a 12-month period to update their practices, and it would come into full effect by autumn 2021, the British data regulator predicts.\u00a0       </p><p>             BITS: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wants Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos to provide Congress with details on the hacking of his phone,             according to a letter he sent the tech titan yesterday             . The missive followed\u00a0the release of a U.N. report that concluded with \"medium to high confidence\" that an account belonging to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the hack,\u00a0             as my Washington Post colleague Marc Fisher reported             . (Bezos also owns The Post.)</p><p>Wyden's letter\u00a0requests\u00a0the IP addresses of any servers contacted by the malware as well as any evidence as to whether the Saudi government used commercially available software for the hack. Wyden says the technical details of the hack could help the United States protect Americans from similar attacks.\u00a0Some researchers have speculated the tools may have come from the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group because of similarities in their effects, but NSO flatly denied supplying the tools in a statement on its website.\u00a0</p><p>The United Nations, which launched a probe of Bezos's hacked phone as a part of a larger investigation into the crown prince's actions toward perceived opponents,\u00a0called\u00a0for the\u00a0United States and \"other relevant authorities\" to investigate the hack.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Lawmakers are scrutinizing facial recognition start-up\u00a0Clearview AI after the New York Times's Kashmir Hill\u00a0             revealed             \u00a0the company was scraping the photos of billions of social media users, in some cases in violation of those websites' terms of service.

TikTok continues to grow its U.S.-based operations. The company now has more than 400 U.S. employees, according to a blog published yesterday. A U.S.-based chief executive may assuage security concerns raised by members of Congress that the app is beholden to the interests of the Chinese government.</p><p>The company is currently\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that reviews acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign owners.

But the flip side is that the company must navigate local political and policy concerns about how it operates not just in the United States, but within about 63 countries.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             International expansion is essential to its future,\u00a0as the company acknowledged in a\u00a0filing\u00a0to the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission. Markets outside of the United States accounted for about\u00a074 percent of all the company's trips.\u00a0But the company is also acutely\u00a0aware of the risks to its bottom line and reputation that its services in overseas markets pose as it barrels toward its initial public offering\u00a0expected today.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a very difficult company to value because so many things could go wrong, and it also has such large potential upside,\" said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida specializing in IPOs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Uber is almost certainly the most complicated gig economy business to go public so far to date. Uber's top rival, Lyft, doesn't have these international worries because its business operates only in the United States and Canada.\u00a0</p><p>             Uber's\u00a0rise depended on the battles it waged - and won - with U.S. regulators and policymakers over the past decade. As it dicloses\u00a0potential risks to investors, Uber notes its success will in part hinge on its ability to win over leaders across the globe - and it's uncertain whether\u00a0the same playbook will work.          </p><p>             Uber's business model, for instance, depends on classifying its workers as contractors, not employees. But how regulators respond in other countries may vary.\u00a0\"It may be very different than what they do in the U.S., which is complex enough,\" said\u00a0Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia.\u00a0 \"Just multiply the difficulties in the U.S. when you're abroad, especially in newer cities and countries that have their own ways of doing things.\"</p><p>             The problems operating in new markets were\u00a0on full display in China.\u00a0In 2016, it retreated from\u00a0a costly battle in China with\u00a0local rival\u00a0Didi Chuxing\u00a0due to the hefty losses it was suffering by forking over driver and rider subsidies in order to operate.\u00a0Instead of trying to compete, it took a stake in Didi.\u00a0\"Conducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same degree in the United States,\" the company said in the filing last month.\u00a0</p><p>             Here's a breakdown of regulatory and safety risks the company is facing abroad that Wall Street will be weighing as the company begins trading today, according to the company's filings and IPO experts:</p><p>             1. The classification of drivers as contractors remains an open question in many markets.          </p><p>Regulators around the world are challenging the way Uber classifies its workers. Even as U.S. drives\u00a0protested the company's wages and working conditions this week, the global view is much different.\u00a0A Swiss agency just this week ruled that an Uber driver is an employee for whom the company must pay social security contributions. Late last year, a United Kingdom court upheld a ruling that the company that would require the company to give drivers benefits such as\u00a0paid vacation and minimum wage.\u00a0</p><p>             2. In some international markets, the taxi industries are strong and have\u00a0learned from Uber's swift expansion in the United States. It could pressure regulators to block Uber's expansion and favor local businesses.          </p><p>Uber warns in its filing that its business abroad could be hampered by competition -- especially from taxi companies that understand the local market better than it does and \"are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets.\" Many taxi drivers, particularly in European countries, have launched strong opposition to Uber's expansion into their cities. For example, Germany has severely limited ride-hailing services like Uber, and taxi drivers have organized massive protests against efforts to ease those restrictions.\u00a0</p><p>             3. The company could suffer\u00a0reputational damage because of safety incidents involving the service abroad.          </p><p>When a passenger or driver is harmed in one country, it can do damage to Uber's brand around the world. In its filing, the company cites examples of cases abroad that have hurt the company's image, such as a 2014 incident when an Uber driver in India was convicted of kidnapping and raping a female passenger. The company also warns that in Latin America there have been numerous reports of both drivers and passengers using the service being victimized by violent crime -- such as armed robbery, violent assault and rape.\u00a0</p><p>             4. Consumers pay for rides and meal deliveries in cash in certain jurisdictions - potentially raising regulatory and safety concerns.          </p><p>Uber says cash-paid trips accounted for 13% of its global gross bookings. But the company also warns that the use of cash can increase security issues for both riders and drivers, increasing the likelihood of robbery, violent or even fatal attacks. The company says it also opens it up to regulatory scrutiny.\u00a0</p><p> \"For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing,\" the comapny writes.\u00a0\"Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions.\"n</p><p>             5. The company has faced Federal Trade Commission scrutiny at home. But other countries' regulatory bodies also probed it for privacy and competition issues.          </p><p>Uber's 2016 data breach didn't just put it in the glare of regulators here. It opened the company up to fines around the world. U.K. and Dutch regulators imposed fines of nearly $1.2 million related to the breach. And fines from international regulators over privacy regulations may only intensify now that the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation is in effect.</p><p>The company has also faced scrutiny for anti-competitive behavior, especially as its international strategy relies heavily on mergers and acquisitions. For example, Singapore's competition regulator imposed fines and restrictions on the company in relation to a transaction there with local ride-sharing company Grab.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: As Uber goes public with a valuation of about $82 billion today, the company says its real strength isn't in being a taxi alternative. Instead, the company is selling itself as a routing software juggernaut that can reimagine how goods and people move around the world,\u00a0my colleagues Faiz Siddiqui and Greg Bensinger write.\u00a0</p><p>The company's top rival therefore isn't Lyft - it's Amazon, according to analysts. The company's new businesses include freight forwarding, food and package delivery. That's why the company thinks it's worth twice as much as Ford Motor Co. or four times as much as FiatChrysler.\u00a0</p><p>But there are major impediments to that vision, my colleagues write: \"For one thing, it hasn't yet been able to solve the problem of food arriving cold upon delivery.\"</p><p>Uber's food service, Uber Eats, maintains vast troves of data that predict food preparation time or recommend food and restaurants to customers. But beyond the algorithms, reality is hindering the business. Food isn't ready for pickup, drivers who run in to pick up orders can't park, and food often arrives to the customer late.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are still barely scratching the surface when it comes to huge industries like food and logistics, and how the future of urban mobility will reshape cities for the better,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a letter that is part of the company's filing to go public.</p><p>             NIBBLES: The United States blocked a Chinese state-owned telecom company from doing business here and providing phone services to American customers - a signal of fears that Beijing aims to surveil U.S. communications networks,my colleague Tony Romm writes.\u00a0          </p><p>The Federal Communications Commission in a unanimous decision banned China Mobile, a telecom giant with a U.S. subsidiary that operates at a key position for international phone traffic.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai charged that the firm is \"owned and controlled by the Chinese government,\" a connection that raised a \"significant risk\" that authorities there could \"conduct activities that would seriously jeopardize the national security, law enforcement and economic interests of the United States.\"</p><p>Some of the agency's Republicans and Democrats even encouraged the FCC to take additional steps to block other Chinese-tied telecom giants from operating in the United States or selling equipment here. They're calling for scrutiny as White House and Chinese officials are engaged in tense negotiations over tariffs the United States imposed.</p><p>China Mobile didn't respond to a request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is making a pitch to join the Trump administration's effort to have people return to the moon within five years,according to The Washington Post's Christian Davenport.\u00a0</p><p>Bezos unveiled a life-size mock-up of the lander his company, Blue Origin, is developing to carry cargo and supplies to the surface of the moon ahead of a human landing.\u00a0</p><p>Davenport writes, \"he made an emotional case for humanity to expand out into the cosmos, a passion he has held since he was a child and has called the most important work he is doing today.\"</p><p>Bezos and Trump have clashed on many issues, but the tech mogul lauded the administration's proposal to get people back to the moon quickly.\u00a0</p><p>\"I love this,\" he said. \"It's the right thing to do. For those of you doing the arithmetic at home, that's 2024. And we can help meet that timeline, but only because we started three years ago. It's time to go back to the moon - this time to stay.\"</p><p>But neither the Trump administration nor Bezos have been very transparent about how much such an endeavor would cost.

I know she'll bring big ideas and sharp news judgement to this newsletter.\u00a0Follow\u00a0her for the latest tech policy news and send tips at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tonya.riley@washpost.com\">tonya.riley@washpost.com</email>\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             A prominent Silicon Valley investor has spent the last two years shuttling to Washington to sound the alarm about the tech industry's problems. This week, he says he's celebrating signs that an era of inertia on tech regulation is coming to an end.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Roger McNamee says the recent escalation of antitrust scrutiny of Silicon Valley is a signal that Washington is \"getting back to business\" on competition issues. But the prominent Facebook critic says antitrust action alone isn't going to solve the tech industry's problems -- and this week's flurry of scrutiny of tech's power is just the first inning in a lengthy and complicated process.</p><p>\"This is going to be really hard,\" McNamee tells me in an interview. \"History tells you it's going to be disappointing before it's done. But it's a start.\"</p><p>             Antitrust fever has hit Washington -- and politicians are hailing this moment as a \"tipping point\" that will usher in a new era of oversight of Big Tech. But many industry insiders are more skeptical than McNamee that it will result in meaningful change\u00a0-- and are warning that politicians' political motivations and blind spots about how technology actually works could get in the way of effective policy.          </p><p>Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer, struck a cautious tone\u00a0as it becomes politically popular for both Republicans and Democrats alike to target the tech industry's dominance and power.\u00a0</p><p> \"There are legitimate antitrust issues with all of the big tech companies, but we have to be careful to not allow those investigations to serve as political tools,\" he wrote\u00a0on Twitter.\u00a0\"It's sad that this is a potential worry in the US these days.\"</p><p>             Others in Silicon Valley\u00a0who want regulation worried that Washington is late to the game and looking backward as it tries to step up its scrutiny. Jessica Powell, Google's former communications lead, wrote:</p><p>             Washington lawmakers have a reputation in Silicon Valley\u00a0of seeking heavy-handed regulation with little understanding of how the industry's products work.\u00a0That's cause for concern during this antitrust moment, Kara Swisher, a longtime Silicon Valley journalist and co-founder of the tech news publication Recode, wrote in the New York Times.\u00a0</p><p> \"The very same agencies and legislators now screaming for blood have for decades ignored any sensible regulation of Silicon Valley, afraid of killing the golden geeks,\" Swisher wrote. \"Now, though, they are coming in with guns blazing in a way that looks thoughtless and is likely to prove pointless. They remind me of a legal-pad-carrying Avengers team that's going to take a lot of what's good about tech down with what's bad.\"</p><p>             But McNamee has more faith in Washington policymakers and regulators.\u00a0The author of the book \"Zucked \" --\u00a0a memoir in which McNamee describes his wake-up call about the problems at Facebook after serving as an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg -- said\u00a0two years ago it would have been unthinkable that in the span of\u00a0one week House lawmakers would announce a broad probe into monopoly power in the tech industry and there would be reports that the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department were considering opening investigations into tech giants\u00a0such as Google.\u00a0House Judiciary Committee aides confirmed to my colleague Tony Romm yesterday that the investigation will kick off on June 11 with a hearing about the impact of tech giants on local journalism.\u00a0</p><p>It's off to the races, says McNamee. \"Once investigations begin, the game will change, and there's no telling what direction the process will take,\" McNamee told me.\u00a0          </p><p>Though McNamee is bracing for a long process, he says just the spectre of regulation may be enough to start forcing better behavior in the industry.\u00a0</p><p>             \"Antitrust can be incredibly effective just from starting investigation,\" he said. \"Everything becomes discoverable -- behaviors change.\"          </p><p>However, McNamee warned that if Washington is serious about changing Big Tech, lawmakers will have to consider an entirely new regulatory regime. He said past attempts to regulate the tech companies -- like the Federal Trade Commission's 2011 consent decree targeting Facebook -- have fallen short and that the government needs greater enforcement capacity,\u00a0as well as modernized antitrust laws that could be applied to 21st century business models. As House lawmakers launch their broad investigation, they may explore whether the existing antitrust law needs an overhaul.\u00a0</p><p>The tech companies have been quiet as their antitrust trouble have compounded. Apple chief executive Tim Cook denied in an interview aired yesterday that Apple was a monopoly -- but executives at companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon have been silent. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Post.) There were signs the news was shaking the industry on Monday, as the companies'\u00a0stocks tanked following reports of escalated antitrust scrutiny.\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Google is still scrambling to fill key policy positions in Washington -- even as it faces a potential antitrust investigation from the Department of Justice as well as a review from House lawmakers, according to The Information's Ashley Gold.</p><p>The company's top lobbyist role is vacant, and the search giant also hasn't announced who will lead policy for its subsidiary YouTube and the European region. Google had this leadership gap at the top of its Washington office since November, when Susan Molinari, the former Republican congresswoman from New York who held the top lobbying job, exited.</p><p>One possible reason it has taken so long to replace Molinari is that the company needs candidates with both political connections and management chops, Ashley's sources say. Google declined to comment on the vacancies.</p><p>The current in-house policy team is led by former General Electric executive Karan Bhatia, who has tasked himself with reorganizing the company's policy team structure. At least four longtime Washington policy staffers have left the company since he held a meeting to unveil the reorganization late this winter, Ashley writes.</p><p>Google has been subtly wielding steady influence through lobbying and think tank donations for years, but it seems to be lagging behind its Silicon Valley peers in protecting its nest among rising lawmaker scrutiny. Facebook, in contrast, has been on a hiring spree for anti-trust policy experts and lawyers, according to Business Insider's Rob Price.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0The House yesterday passed a bill that would offer a path to citizenship to\u00a0\"dreamers\" who came\u00a0to the United States as children, my colleague Felicia Sonmez writes.\u00a0Tech companies like Google and Facebook have long lobbied for lawmakers to pass legislation to protect dreamers.\u00a0          </p><p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg praised the legislation last night:</p><p>The\u00a0American Dream and Promise Act of 2019\u00a0passed\u00a0237 to 187,\u00a0which would grant dreamers a decade of legal residence status if they meet certain requirements. After two years of higher education or military service or after working for three years, they would then be granted permanent green cards</p><p>Millions of dreamers -- including many tech industry employees -- have been caught in legal limbo as the parties have been sharply divided on immigration issues.\u00a0House Democratic leaders yesterday were hopeful that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would introduce the legislation in the Senate.\u00a0</p><p>\"There should be nothing partisan or political about this legislation,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at a news conference. \"We are proud to pass it, we hope, in a bipartisan way.\"</p><p>But Felicia writes it's unlikely that the Republican Senate leaders will take the legislation up.\u00a0McConnell and other Senate Republican leaders made no mention odidn't mention\u00a0the bill at their news conference yesterday.</p><p>             BYTES: YouTube said it would not take down videos targeting\u00a0a Vox reporter with racist and homophobic taunts -- sparking a\u00a0broad\u00a0criticism of the company's\u00a0content moderation practices,\u00a0according to my colleague Eli Rosenberg.</p><p>Vox reporter Carlos Maza tweeted he was speechless after YouTube announced it would not take action against conservative commentatator and comedian Steven Crowder, who Maza says spent years harassing him for being gay and Latino.\u00a0The company promised to look into the issue after Maza edited together examples of taunts\u00a0from\u00a0Crowder and shared the video in\u00a0tweets that were widely shared.\u00a0</p><p>\"It seems to me to be a clear violation of that policy,\" Maza told my colleague in an interview. \"I understand that speech always involves gray areas, but that it's hard to enforce hate speech policies should not distract from the fact that it's sometimes extremely clear cut.

Meanwhile in the Senate, another Facebook executive will face a grilling about its widely criticized cryptocurrency plans, and Google's lobbying chief will be rebuffing Republicans' allegations that its products are censoring conservatives.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The three hearings highlight\u00a0the tech industry's multi-front battle\u00a0as lawmakers as divergent as President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) say the industry\u00a0can no longer be trusted to regulate itself. The flurry of activity also suggests that Washington is no longer going to allow the tech industry to go its own way without significant congressional oversight.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House antitrust investigation could have the most sweeping impact on the industry,\u00a0as underscored by the four companies on the witness list. Some are calling for big tech companies to be broken up beause they're too powerful, and lawmakers plan to explore whether existing antitrust laws need to be revamped for the digital age.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline\u00a0(D-R.I.), the chair of the House antitrust panel that's conducting the investigation, says the need for Congress to have greater oversight of the tech industry is more acute in the wake of the Federal Trade Commission's decision to fine Facebook $5 billion for violating promises it made to improve its privacy practices. Democrats widely criticized the fine as barely a slap on the wrist for a company that generated close to $56 billion in revenue last year.\u00a0</p><p>             \"If anything that decision by the FTC\u00a0was a reminder of the importance of work we are doing and the role Congress must play in getting these markets to work properly and protecting consumers and protecting competition,\" Cicilline\u00a0told me in an interview Monday night.\u00a0          </p><p>In addition to criticizing the action that the FTC took on privacy, the Rhode Island Democrat\u00a0said he's been disappointed by the FTC's enforcement of existing competition laws and said the investigation will give Congress the opportunity to determine the role it needs to play in promoting competition in tech.\u00a0</p><p>             \"By and large, the FTC has not been effective in addressing the growing concentration of economic power and the dominance of these large technology platforms,\" he said. \"The FTC hasn't had a serious, monopoly, antitrust action in decades.\"\u00a0          </p><p>Cicilline's committee today plans to press the companies on the impact their businesses have on small businesses and entrepreneurs. He expects the panel will look into the acquisitions some of the companies have made, especially of potential competitors on the rise - as Facebook did when the photo-sharing service Instagram was in its early days. Facebook declined to share its testimony ahead of today's hearing, but it pointed to an op-ed the company published in the New York Times defending it against critics who say the company should be broken up.\u00a0</p><p>Though the companies will get the first round of questions from lawmakers, House lawmakers will also hear from some of their toughest critics, including Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who says Facebook needs to be broken up, as well as tech policy experts who have criticized Amazon for allegedly abusing its market dominance. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             Today's hearing is just the second in an investigation that is expected to continue into 2020. The companies' top brass -- like Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai -- won't be on the witness stand today, but Cicilline said they could be at future hearings.\u00a0</p><p>             \"It is hard for me to imagine at some future date we will not also want to hear from some of the CEOs from the major technology firms,\" Cicilline told me. \"I expect that will happen later in this investigation.\"\u00a0          </p><p>Cicilline said the investigation began with bipartisan support, and he hopes that continues. He did acknowledge that could get harder as the committee attempts to create legislative solutions on competition.\u00a0</p><p>             \"The harder part will be crafting the solutions,\" he told me. \"It's easy to identify some of the practices that are problematic.\"\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: A tweet by Trump telling several members Congress to \"go back\" to their own countries does not violate Twitter's policies, the company said on Monday. Researchers now say that Twitter failed to uphold its own rules against attacks on the basis of race or national origin,my colleagues Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell\u00a0and Tony Romm report.</p><p>Although Twitter does not remove violating content by world leaders, it does downrank the posts and covers them with a warning label - a policy change the company introduced last month. Researchers say this policy should apply to Trump's tweet targeting Reps. Alexandira Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.),\u00a0Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.). The tweet sparked broad allegations of racism against women of color.\u00a0       </p><p>\"It's the first major test of their rules, and we're all left wondering why they even set them up in the first place?\" Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, told The Post. She suggested that the White House's allegations that tech companies censor conservatives, which the president repeated at a social media summit last week, could have played a role in Twitter's decision.</p><p>\"That maneuver really forced Twitter into a corner, to where they're not able to execute on this policy, especially when you have the most high-status Twitter user in the fray,\" she said. Twitter would not provide additional information about why the tweet did not violate its policies.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Lawmakers and privacy advocates say that Apple has failed to deliver on its alleged support of federal privacy legislation, my colleagues Reed Albergotti and Tony Romm report.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has met with dozens of lawmakers from both parties across the country, \"but Apple hasn't given its explicit stamp of approval to any federal bills that have been introduced, which would set a national privacy standard,\" Reed and Tony write.</p><p>The inaction from Cook, who has tried to distinguish Apple as a consumer privacy advocate while heavily slamming rival Facebook over its data breaches, rankles some Washington lawmakers.</p><p>\"I would argue there's a need for Apple to be a more vocal part of this debate,\" Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), who recently introduced a bill that would prevent advertisers from using manipulative practices to glean user data, told Tony and Reed.</p><p>And when it comes to state privacy efforts, state legislators say that Apple not only refuses to support measures but has actively worked to soften them. In states including California, Washington and Illinois, Apple finds \"itself aligned with the companies it criticizes in seeking to ward off state legislative proposals, often through lobbying organizations in which they share membership, such as TechNet and CompTIA.\" \u00a0</p><p>\"We advocate for strong federal legislation that protects everyone regardless of which state they may live,\" Apple spokesman Fred Sainz told The Post. \"We understand the frustration at the state level - we are frustrated, too - but this topic is so important we need to be united across America.\"</p><p>             BYTES: Trump tweeted that his administration will \"take a look\" after billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel called on the FBI and CIA to probe Google for allegedly working with the Chinese government.\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p>Trump's tweet underscores the influence Thiel maintains in the Trump administration as the president's\u00a0top supporter in Silicon Valley. The Facebook board member\u00a0gave an interview\u00a0to\u00a0Fox News last night, where he criticized Google for allegedly working with the Chinese government. Thiel provided little specific evidence for his claim, but criticized the company for pulling back from a contract with the Pentagon, known as Project Maven, following protests from employees who did not want to build artificial intelligence that could be used for warfare.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p> \"If you say you're building a Manhattan project for AI, don't you think that would attract the interest of foreign intelligence agencies?\" Thiel said. \"This is just hidden in plain sight. There are all these ways that Chinese nationals are engaged in espionage in the United States.\"\u00a0</p><p>Thiel was escalating allegations first reported by Axios at\u00a0the National Conservatism Conference over the weekend. Google pushed back on those allegations yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>\"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC.\u00a0</p><p>Joe Lonsdale, the co-founder of Palantir, praised Thiel as \"courageous\" for speaking out against Google in a CNBC interview yesterday. Thiel was also a co-founder of Palantir.\u00a0</p><p>\"Everyone in [Silicon] Valley knows that the Chinese government is very involved,\" Lonsdale told\u00a0\"Squawk Alley\"\u00a0in an interview, also not pointing to clear evidence. \"It's something we don't talk about a lot. It was very courageous of [Thiel] to talk about it.\"</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Talent news at the intersection of the tech industry and Washington          </p><p>Former Vine head Jason Toff is leaving Google to join Facebook, where he'll be starting up a new initiative under the company's NPE team, he announced in a tweet yesterday</p><p>             Today:          </p><p>Coming up:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-e78fe19dcfb24cd1b5fdf1fb507425e7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-8B71-DXKP-J05J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1684\"/><timeReceived>1:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sharply criticized the popular social-video app TikTok, calling the company a threat to national security during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Nov. 5.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ctrl + N</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Sen. Josh Hawley has a warning for parents: Popular app TikTok isn't just a destination for teens to share videos of themselves dancing or lip syncing. It's a threat to U.S. national security.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The Missouri Republican argued that the app's Chinese owner could be providing data about Americans to the Chinese government, especially since it collects broad data about TikTok users -- including users' location and even phone contacts.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they're watching and what they share with each other,\" Hawley said at a Senate Judiciary subcommitee hearing.</p><p>He directed his ire at an empty chair reserved for TikTok, which declined to send a representative.\u00a0\"TikTok claims they don't store American user data in China,\" he said. \"That's nice, but all it takes is one knock on the door of their parent company based in China from a Communist Party official.\"</p><p>             TikTok is emerging as one of the most formidable threats in years\u00a0to social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. But its Achilles' heel could be new regulatory pressure in Washington as lawmakers step up their criticism of the company -- and\u00a0the U.S. government opens a national security review of its practices.          </p><p>Hawley's remarks underscore that lawmakers aren't buying TikTok's promises that the company is operating independently of\u00a0the Chinese government -- and does not censor content that\u00a0could be considered controversial or politically sensitive in Beijing.\u00a0\"TikTok claims they don't take direction from China,\" Hawley said at the hearing. \"They claim they don't censor. ... But that's not what former employees of TikTok say.\"</p><p>My colleagues Drew Harwell and Tony Romm reported yesterday that former employees say they felt pressured to satisfy ByteDance by censoring videos, including of heated debates or political discussions widely seen across the Internet. This\u00a0fueled concerns the app is effectively enforcing China's restrictive view of acceptable speech even though the company says it moved its content moderation leadership to the United States\u00a0earlier this year.\u00a0</p><p>TikTok\u00a0went on the defensive yesterday, releasing a blog post outlining how American user data is stored in the U.S. and Singapore and it has localized its content moderation guidelines.\u00a0\"TikTok team, senior staff and myself understand the importance of building a close and transparent working relationship with regulators and lawmakers,\" Vanessa Pappas, TikTok U.S. general manager, wrote in a statement. \"This will be increasingly important during the upcoming U.S. election season.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The stakes for the company\u00a0in Washington are high. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a cross-government group that reviews foreign transactions involving U.S. companies, is investigating the 2017 deal in which ByteDance bought the popular karaoke app, Musical.ly, and later rebranded it as TikTok. The panel has the authority to retroactively terminate deals, implement fines or push corporate changes.\u00a0</p><p>Tech experts tell my colleagues that the surveillance and censorship concerns that lawmakers have are legitimate,\u00a0especially because the app has grown significantly among young users.</p><p>The company \"is operating under a political censorship regime,\" Alex Stamos, the director of the\u00a0Stanford Internet Observatory\u00a0and a former chief security officer at Facebook, told my colleagues. \"The Chinese government has no problem telling [its companies] where they should come down in political debates.\"</p><p>             Klon Kitchen, the tech policy lead at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, told Hawley at the hearing there's no way to ensure the company isn't serving as a \"Trojan horse\" and providing data to the Chinese government.\u00a0          </p><p>Given the current legal regime in China, TikTok's parent would be required to hand over data that the Chinese government requests. Anyone who thinks they wouldn't be required to do so, he said, has \"a fundamental misunderstanding of how the government in Beijing works.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: About 100 Facebook partners may have wrongly accessed the names and profile photos of users in certain groups, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The announcement is the just the latest privacy gaffe acknowledged by Facebook and probably will\u00a0spark lawmaker criticism.</p><p>Facebook did not disclose how many users were affected or which partners accessed the data, but at least 11 partners did so in the past 60 days, Tony reports. Facebook agreed to a $5 billion fine as part of a settlement with federal regulators that also required the company to improve its privacy practices in July.</p><p>\"Although we've seen no evidence of abuse, we will ask them to delete any member data they may have retained and we will conduct audits to confirm that it has been deleted,\" Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, the director of platform partnerships at Facebook, said in the blog post. The company did not respond for requests for comment.</p><p>             NIBBLES: 2020 Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren joined a chorus of critics who say that Twitter's new ban on political advertising creates a loophole for corporations to spread misinformation about political issues while banning activist groups. She specifically called out an ad from ExxonMobil denying climate science, first flagged by journalist Emily Atkin.</p><p>The tweet prompted a response from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who said that Twitter has not yet finalized its new ban on political advertising and will take the Massachusetts senator's suggestions into consideration.</p><p>Twitter's ban on political ads, a sharp rebuke to rival Facebook's decision to not fact-check political ads, drew early praise. But many advocates have criticized it for being overly broad.</p><p>Facebook may be reconsidering elements of its advertising business under public pressure as well, Dylan Byers at NBC News reports. While Facebook maintains a hardened stance toward not censoring political ads, the company may consider doing away with the feature that allows politicians to target their ads to specific audiences based on characteristics including age, race and location, said sources at Facebook who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.</p><p>             BYTES: Reps. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) want to create a new federal agency to oversee how tech companies collect and monetize user data,they announced yesterday. The Online Privacy Act, the latest offering by lawmakers seeking to rein in big tech, would also give users the power to access, correct and delete their own data.\u00a0</p><p>The legislation would also create baseline standards requiring companies to get consent before selling user data and not use data for practices that violate civil rights, such as discriminatory advertising.</p><p>The legislation's Digital Privacy Agency would have powers to fine companies that violate any part of the law $42,530 per incident, the rate for Federal Trade Commission fines. Companies must notify the agency of data breaches within 72 hours.</p><p>State attorneys general would also be empowered to bring civil actions for violations of the bill.</p><p>But the 132-page bill, which would also allow states to pass their own privacy legislation, probably will face\u00a0opposition from Republicans who are bringing their own solutions to the table and want legislation that would preempt state laws.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Fiverr, a tech company that connects businesses with freelancers, is doubling down on services for political campaigns ahead of the 2020 Elections. The company told The Technology 202 exclusively today that it is launching a politics store with more than 100 services for politicians, including\u00a0advertising and speechwriting.\u00a0          </p><p>The announcement highlights how tech services are playing a greater role in campaigns. Fiverr's offerings could be a boon particularly to down-ballot candidates or challengers who don't have the budgets to hire people with advertising or video skills for their campaigns and are seeking marketing support under a time crunch. The politics store's offerings will include freelancers specializing in banner ads, voice overs, website design and social media marketing.\u00a0</p><p>\"The marketing needs of political campaigns are massive, with both incumbents and first-time candidates working harder than ever to cut through the noise and connect with voters,\"\u00a0said Brent Messenger, vice president of public policy and community at Fiverr, in a statement. \"To stay relevant and in touch in the always-on world of modern politics, campaigns need the support of talented people who are available on-demand.\"</p><p>             - News from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             -Coming up:          </p><p>The U.S. government launched a national security review of the Chinese parent company behind TikTok, a popular social-video app, on Nov. 1.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-09a24f9d03734266a7ba3704b65dfe51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFD-4TB1-JB4M-V2HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><timeReceived>2:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There are currently two such centers in Los Angeles...</p><p>with Tonya Riley   TikTok is trying to engage with policymakers through what it calls \u201ctransparency centers,\u201d where outsiders can view the embattled company's content moderation and data security practices.   There are currently two such centers in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. But because the centers got up and running just as the coronavirus pandemic started closing offices around the country, TikTok is now offering virtual sessions showcasing them to about two dozen experts and congressional offices.  The push to open up its operations comes as TikTok is under fire from the Trump administration.  President Trump has signed an executive order to effectively ban TikTok because of national security concerns unless it's sold to an American business. A dministration officials have accused the platform, popular with teens, of sharing U.S. data with the Chinese government in a charge TikTok has repeatedly denied.   Notably, no one from the Trump administration has attended a session at a transparency center, according Michael Beckerman, TikTok's head of U.S. public policy . However, he said  the company has engaged with administration officials in other venues .    \u201cThe more that people are learning about TikTok, the more they like and trust it,\u201d Beckerman told me in an interview. \u201cSo we just want to make sure that the doors are open and we answer any questions and bring actual transparency and accountability that's been lacking in the industry.\"   The clock is running out on TikTok\u2019s efforts to woo U.S. government officials.   Beckerman tells me he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d TikTok will reach a deal with an American acquirer, even as China unveils new export restrictions that could make it more difficult for the business to sell to an American company. The company has received two bids, one from Microsoft and Walmart and a second from a group led by Oracle, according to my colleagues.     The deadline for TikTok to reach a deal is swiftly approaching. And the Wall Street Journal reports the company is discussing an option with that would allow it to avoid a full sale of its U.S. operations. Even without such a move, the Journal reports the outcome would likely involve some sort of restructuring of the business.   The parties have until the week of Sept. 20 to reach a deal before the U.S. government would ban the app, per the terms of an Aug. 6 executive order. A subsequent executive order set a 90-day deadline \u2014 until Nov. 12 \u2014 for any acquisition to be completed.    The virtual transparency center sessions are an attempt to address some of the national security concerns that have contributed to increased scrutiny of the app by the government.    They begin with an introduction to TikTok's U.S. executives, who largely previously worked at other large American tech companies, and in some instances, in government roles. The officials then brief participants on strategies to remove offending content and their stepped up  investments in data security.   TikTok is also attempting to highlight its growing U.S. employee base as geopolitical tensions over its future mount.   During the sessions, officials stress the company\u2019s swift U.S. growth in 2020 as its popularity exploded during the pandemic. TikTok now has more than 1,500 U.S. employees, a headcount that has tripled this year.    Officials also promise a major push in cybersecurity hires, including at least 100 more privacy and cybersecurity professionals by the end of 2020. TikTok has also vowed to add an additional 10,000 jobs in the United States over the next three years. Many of these jobs will be spread throughout the United States in states that don't have major tech hubs, potentially in Michigan and Florida, Beckerman said.    But these hiring efforts could be complicated by a looming ban. Depending on how the Trump administration would enforce such a ban if it occurs, experts say it would raise questions about the company's ability to pay its American-based employees.   Beckerman, however, said recruiting has been \u201cgoing well\u201d despite the uncertainty over the company's future.    It also remains to be seen if TikTok would continue to expand at a rapid clip after being acquired by a larger tech giant. Beckerman declined to comment on potential buyers.    \u201cSecurity and safety are core to the platform, and none of that changes at all no matter what happens or who we're involved with,\" he told me.   Our top tabs Ireland issued a preliminary order requiring Facebook to stop sending user data to the United States.   It \u2019 s the first major step by European Union regulators to enforce a July ruling restricting how tech companies can transfer the personal information of Europeans to America, Sam Schechner and Emily Glazer at the Wall Street Journal report . The ruling could require Facebook to overhaul its data collection services or potentially halt service entirely to E.U. consumers.    The order could set a significant precedent for many other big tech companies that operate in the bloc, including Google and Apple. Failure by Facebook to comply with the order would result in a fine of up to 4 percent of its annual revenue \u2014 or nearly $3 billion.   Facebook criticized the move as potentially devastating to the global economy.   \u201cA lack of safe, secure and legal international data transfers would damage the economy and prevent the emergence of data-driven businesses from the E.U., just as we seek a recovery from Covid-19,\u201d said Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s top policy and communications executive. He confirmed that the order comes as part of a larger inquiry.   At the center of the conflict are E.U. lawmaker concerns over U.S. surveillance laws and lack of strong privacy protections. E.U. and U.S. officials started negotiations this summer to iron out a new data-sharing agreement.  Andy Jassy, Amazon's cloud computing chief,  could eventually take over for Jeff Bezos.   The likelihood of Jassy taking over the reins increased when Jeff Wilke, who ran Amazon\u2019s retail business, announced plans to retire last month, my colleague Jay Greene reports. They were both seen to be groomed for the CEO position whenever the 56-year-old Amazon founder steps down.    Jassy was instrumental in making Amazon a pioneer of the cloud-computing business \u2013 even though the company is still known for its work in e-commerce. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   \u201cAndy pushed to get Amazon into a new business where it hadn\u2019t been,\u201d said a former Amazon executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Jassy has been with the company since 1997, and he is known to embody Bezos\u2019s personality and \u201chigh-risk, high-reward\u201d thinking, Jay reports.   \u201cAndy embodies the culture of Amazon,\u201d said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm that invests in cloud start-ups. \u201cHe has consistently demonstrated the ability to be a builder.\u201d    \u201cHe has adopted a lot of Jeff\u2019s personality,\u201d said a former executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about previous colleagues. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a creative ideas person, rather than an operations person.\u201d   But it\u2019s unlikely that Bezos will retire any time soon, Jay reports. The coronavirus would be a fraught time for the chief executive to leave, and if Microsoft serves as an example, it could take years for the company to form an identity separate from its founder.  The Portland, Ore., City Council voted to ban city and private use of facial recognition technology.  Other cities including Boston, San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., have placed bans on government use of the controversial technology, but the Portland ordinances also block private companies from scanning faces in public. The ordinances do not prevent personal use of the technology, such users using the tech to open their phones.   The bans will take effect in January 2021.   Advocates and researchers have shown that the technology is less accurate when used on non-White faces , and they have warned that it could lead to discrimination in policing.    Amazon announced earlier this summer that it would put a one-year moratorium on sales of facial recognition technology to police, and Microsoft said it would pause it entirely while Congress reviews possible regulation. IBM said it would stop selling general facial recognition entirely.  WeChat users can\u2019t challenge Trump\u2019s ban, the government argues.  \u201cTo hold otherwise would allow a group of social media users to substitute their subjective judgment\u201d for that of the president \u201cmerely because they are unable to use an app that they prefer,\u201d the government said Wednesday in a filing in San Francisco federal court, Edvard Pettersson at Bloomberg News reports .    U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, a nonprofit organization established to fight the executive order that says it is not affiliated with WeChat\u2019s parent company Tencent, and several other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit last month against  Trump nd the commerce secretary. The lawsuit claims the executive order was unconstitutional and the Trump administration did not provide sufficient evidence to support claims WeChat is a national security threat.    The government refuted the argument the president has to provide more evidence for the decision, referring to a Supreme Court decision from two years ago upholding Trump\u2019s travel ban for visitors from a group of Muslim countries.   The Commerce Department is set to say which transactions with WeChat will be banned by Sept. 20. TikTok has filed a similar lawsuit but said it would wait for the final order before asking for a court to block it.  Rant and rave  Residents in San Francisco woke up to an apocalyptic scene as recent wildfires covered the area in ash and smoke. The San Francisco Chronicle \u2019 s Jessica Christian:   Twitter users compared the shocking scene to one out of the science fiction film \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d   Perhaps more dystopian was that iPhone automatically filtered out the smog. Bloomberg News \u2019 s Sarah Frier:   But the apocalypse hasn \u2019 t changed everything. Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2019 s Eva Galperin:   Trump tracker A former senior DHS official alleges he was ordered to stop providing intelligence on Russian election interference.  Wolf, a Trump loyalist who has been in the role nearly a year, said the intelligence \u201cmade the President look bad,\u201d Murphy alleged in a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday with the DHS inspector general.   On July 8, Wolf told Murphy to hold an intelligence notification regarding Russian disinformation because it could hurt the president \u2019 s insistence that Russian interference was a hoax by opponents. Two months before, Wolf told Murphy to stop producing intelligence assessments on Russia and focus on China and Iran.   Murphy said he would not comply with the instructions, which he believed would \u201cput the country in substantial and specific danger,\u201d according to the complaint.   The White House and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.    The House Intelligence Committee has asked Murphy to testify this month.   More White House news:  Workforce report Former NSA chief Keith Alexander is joining Amazon\u2019s board.  Alexander, who is now co-chief executive of IronNet Cybersecurity, also served as commander of the U.S. Cyber Command. He will serve on a four-member audit committee.   Alexander was involved in the NSA \u2019 s broad data collection program revealed in the Edward Snowden leaks, Devin Coldewey at TechCrunch reports . The Snowden leaks led to a change in the way tech companies addressed transparency and user privacy policies.   (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   Alexander also brings defense contracting experience as the tech giant continues to challenge a Pentagon decision to award Microsoft a lucrative cloud-computing contract. The company alleges that President Trump \u2019 s animosity toward Amazon influenced the decision. (Amazon told TechCrunch it will continue to follow rules for conflicts of interest in government contracts.)  Jamie Boone is joining Toyota as director of technology innovation in its government affairs department, according to a news release.

The latest skeptic is President Trump, who said yesterday that he was \u201cnot going to be happy\u201d if ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, maintains its majority stake in the business.    \u201cConceptually, I can tell you I don\u2019t like that,\u201d said Trump, who previously pushed for a full sale of the TikTok service to an American company and threatened to otherwise ban the service. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m not going to be happy with that.\u201d    Trump, who previously pushed for a full sale of the TikTok service to an American company and threatened to otherwise ban the service, added that he expects to be briefed today on the proposal to make Oracle TikTok's \u201ctrusted technology partner.\u201d   \u201cIt has to be 100 percent as far as national security is concerned, and no, I\u2019m not prepared to sign off on anything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have to see the deal.\u201d   The proximity to Nov. 3 makes it a toss-up whether Trump will seek a tough line on China - or compromise and call it a win.   The key question is whether the deal proposed earlier this week to outsource data management to Oracle would do enough to address national security concerns that ByteDance could share Americans' data with the Chinese government.    Top administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have raised concerns about such an arrangement, according to Bloomberg. And behind the scenes, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other officials are pushing for a deal that would give American investors a majority stake in the company that takes over TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reports.     Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, told reporters yesterday that the administration is continuing to review the deal and will \"make sure the interests of the American people is protected.\"  Lawmakers from both parties are also scrutinizing the deal terms.   Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) led Senate Republicans in writing a letter raising concerns about the deal. Rubio emerged as one of the app\u2019s first critics and called upon the Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency organization, to open an investigation into the company\u2019s practices.    \u201cAs this deal appears to fall short of a full acquisition, serious questions remain with regard to Oracle\u2019s role in TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations, the type of technology Oracle will be providing ByteDance, and the question of what will happen to the crucial algorithms, which make the application function,\u201d the senators wrote.    Republican Sens. Thom Tillis (N.C.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Rick Scott (Fla.), Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and John Cornyn (Texas) also signed the letter.   Rubio tweeted this morning that he had had \u201cinformative\u201d discussions with the companies about the plans.   Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has called on the U.S. government to reject the deal.  Democrats have raised concerns about Oracle's role.  \u201cI\u2019m waiting to see all the details, but it\u2019s hard to imagine this is anything but a payoff from China to one of Donald Trump\u2019s major campaign fundraisers,\u201d Wyden said Tuesday. \"Making Oracle a middleman won\u2019t protect Americans against Chinese government influence, and to make matters worse, Oracle has an awful record of harvesting and selling Americans\u2019 private data to anyone with a credit card.\"    Sen. Mark Warner, (D-Va.), said in a speech yesterday that any scrutiny of technology players \u201cmust be done honestly.\u201d He warned that the \u201chaphazard actions on TikTok fail that test and will only invite retaliation against American companies.\u201d  Our top tabs Google is asking employees to more closely moderate internal message boards for racism and abuse.   The company saw an increase in posts by employees being reported, according to internal documents obtained by Jennifer Elias at CNBC . Google attributed the rise in tensions to increased sharing as employees work from home and the current political and social climate.    \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable to acknowledge that there has been content on our platforms that reinforce negative racial stereotypes, used harmful gendered phrases, or insulted Googlers based on their nationality,\u201d Google wrote in an internal memo.   Google\u2019s internal meme generator and question-proposing system for events emerged as two hot spots, with more flags in the first half of 2020 than all of 2019. \u201cHarassment/Discrimination\u201d was the most cited reason.   Leaders of discussion groups now will have to actively moderate their groups and undergo training to guarantee conversations are \u201cinclusive\u201d and relevant to the group\u2019s stated purpose. The move shows how companies are attempting to deal with divisive online conversations as staffers work from home through 2021.   Internal conversations have also been the source of media scrutiny for big tech companies such as Facebook and Google. Google  in 2019, creating a formal policy that tried to curb internal political debates. The move sparked employee ire.  Schools nationwide are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on questionable temperature-scanning tech.  \u201cIn the context of schools, fever screening is a particularly bad idea,\u201d said Katelyn Gostic, an epidemiologist at the University of Chicago who studies the use of symptom-screening systems.   Schools are willing to buy it anyway. \u201cEverything is cumbersome when we are trying to get a thousand kids in school in the morning,\u201d said Shawn Van Scoy, the superintendent of the Gananda Central School District in New York, which has purchased a set of Hikvision cameras. \u201cThis will allow us to assess 40 students every minute as they enter the doors of our building.\u201d   SafeCheck USA, which has sold devices to nearly 100 schools, says its devices can read the temperatures of up to 70 people per minute.    Experts say those claims are dubious and the technology is not meant for high volumes of people at once. At that pace, the technology is \u201cno different than having a fake camera in the building and people have the illusion that they\u2019re safe,\u201d David Pascoe, professor emeritus at the University of Auburn and a U.S. delegate of the International Organization for Standardization for pandemic screening, told NBC News.   SafeCheck USA\u2019s co-founder William Kakon told NBC News that the system \u2019 s accuracy had been tested by third parties, but he declined to provide details.  The Justice Department charged five Chinese citizens with hacking more than 100 companies and institutions.  The arrests are the warning shot by the Trump administration to Beijing that it will not tolerate cybercrime.   The hackers, who appeared to be motivated by financial gain in this case, are members of a group linked to a Chinese civilian spy agency responsible for counterintelligence. One of the hackers boasted that the government would protect him, according to the indictment.   Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen criticized China for turning a blind eye to the alleged crimes.   \u201cNo country can be respected as a global leader while paying only lip service to the rule of law and without taking steps to disrupt brazen criminal acts like these,\u201d Rosen said.   In July, the United States also charged hackers affiliated with China of attempting to break into companies and research institutions working on a coronavirus vaccine.  The Justice Department says WeChat users won\u2019t be charged penalties if the app is banned next week.  The Justice Department clarified its position in response to a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration by WeChat users, David Shepardson of Reuters reports . The group is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the Trump administration from banning the popular Chinese messaging app.   The group claims in its lawsuit that the Trump administration did not provide sufficient evidence that the app is a national security threat when it decided to ban it alongside TikTok.   The Justice Department said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will release regulations for the app on Sunday. While users will not face civil or criminal penalties for use of the app, \u201cuse of the app for such communications could be directly or indirectly impaired through measures targeted at other transactions,\u201d the department said.  Inside the industry Facebook is pairing up with the maker of Ray-Ban to create luxury smart glasses.   The collaboration will be released sometime in 2021, CNBC reports .    \u201cI can \u2019 t go into full product details yet, but they \u2019 re really the next step on the road to augmented-reality glasses. And they look pretty good, too,\u201d chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said at the Facebook Connect conference yesterday.    The company will have employees and contractors wear a prototype of the glasses in September to help develop the technology.  Rant and rave  Signal Fire \u2019 s Josh Constine commented on the optics of the device:   Some Twitter users honed in on the privacy costs of the technology.

Thanks for reading.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook, Google and Twitter long have struggled to battle back allegations in Washington that they censor conservatives online. But their political woes may only worsen after next week, when the White House hosts a \"social media summit\" that could set the stage for even more scrutiny to come.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president's top aides so far have said their scheduled, July 11 event aims to assemble \"digital leaders\" to discuss the \"opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\" In doing so, though, the White House quietly has invited tech's top conservative critics in politics and media, The Post has learned, some of whom say the solution to Silicon Valley's perceived political bias is to break up the tech giants or more aggressively regulate them.          </p><p>             Among those slated to participate is PragerU, a conservative organization that produces videos about national issues that have millions of views on Facebook and YouTube. Google has limited the reach of some of PragerU's videos about Islam and guns so that they can't be viewed by those who have enabled restrictive mode, a setting that some parents and school administrators use to control what kids can access on the site. But PragerU has argued Google's efforts are evidence of Silicon Valley censorship and has sued the tech giant in federal court.</p><p>\"Big tech needs to be held accountable for their actions, and the general public needs to be aware of what's going on,\" said Craig Strazzeri, its chief marketing officer, saying he believed PragerU had been invited to the White House\u00a0because of its lawsuit in federal court.</p><p>             The White House on Monday declined to comment on its plans. It also has invited representatives from\u00a0the conservative groups\u00a0Heritage Foundation and the Media Research Center, spokespeople at each organization said. The center, founded by Brent Bozell, previously has asked the Justice Department to investigate Facebook, Google and Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>             Charlie Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USA, said in an interview Monday that he plans to attend, adding he expects the conversation to touch on questions of whether a company the size of Google is\u00a0too powerful and should be investigated as a monopoly.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment and did not say if they had been invited to join the White House.\u00a0</p><p>             The summit could mark a dramatic escalation in the president's war with Silicon Valley over the way tech companies police their platforms. Even though President Trump is one of social media's most prolific users, regularly broadcasting his views to more than 61 million followers on Twitter each day, he continues to claim that tech giants limit his reach and discriminate against his conservative followers online.\u00a0          </p><p>The White House announced its plans minutes after Trump last week newly accused Twitter of censoring him and alleged that Google rigs elections. Trump repeated his criticisms about social media companies in an interview on Fox News that aired Monday, telling host Tucker Carlson that Facebook, Google and Twitter were \"against me\" before suggesting the administration might \"take action\" against them.\u00a0          </p><p>Trump's attacks have resonated with Republicans around the country, who increasingly are holding hearings, calling for regulations and threatening investigations into Facebook, Google and Twitter out of concern they exhibit political bias. But a wide swath of opponents -- not only Democrats but free-speech experts, tech leaders and even some fellow conservatives -- stress the GOP has entered dangerous political territory.</p><p>\"Politicians, whether they're on the left or the right, shouldn't be dictating online speech codes,\" said Jesse Blumenthal, who leads technology and innovation policy work for Stand Together, the conservative\u00a0group with ties to the Koch brothers. \"We're strong believers in free speech, period. We also believe online platforms have the right to set their own terms.\"</p><p>             The planned White House meeting comes weeks after the Trump administration embarked on an unprecedented online campaign to collect stories about alleged censorship on social media, along with supporters' contact information. The White House since has disabled the survey, but it recently replaced it with a web page that says the administration received \"thousands of responses.\"</p><p>             \"This has become a serious issue for a lot of people,\" Kirk said of the summit. \"They feel their voice is silenced, and they feel they're being de-platformed.\"          </p><p>As soon as White House published the survey on its website, it\u00a0drew sharp criticism from congressional lawmakers and open-government advocates, who felt the Trump administration had improperly tapped federal resources for a project they said is motivated entirely by politics.\u00a0Some repeated their objections Monday, citing the fact that social-media companies should be doing more moderation to stop the spread of harmful content, such as online extremism, not less.</p><p>             \"There is zero evidence that social media companies are biased against conservatives,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a statement. \"In fact, the big tech companies have gone to amazing lengths to avoid confronting right-wing voices that advocate hate and racial division. This summit is a waste of taxpayer dollars intended to pressure tech companies ahead of the 2020 elections and score political points.\"</p><p>             Other critics say Trump has not pointed to evidence of systemic, anti-conservative bias. At times, he's also cited anecdotes that experts have disputed. In a private, April 2019 meeting with Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, for example, the president claimed Twitter secretly reduced his followers. The company always has maintained that follower counts fluctuate because it labors to spot and remove fake bot accounts.\u00a0</p><p>Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, said Facebook, Google, Twitter and the other members of its lobbying association \"don't have a political ideology or political bias.\" He added in a statement: \"Internet companies continue to succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>             BITS: More than 9,000 current and former Border Patrol agents belong to a secret Facebook group where members exchange racist remarks, death threats and distasteful jokes about immigrants,\u00a0Pro Publica's\u00a0A.C. Thompson reveals in a new report. Thompson uncovered posts including\u00a0comments cheering on the death of a 16-year-old Guatemalan detainee as well as multiple images depicting\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) in sexually explicit scenarios.</p><p>Rep. Ocasio Cortez, who visited several CBP facilities yesterday, condemned the \"violent culture\" exhibited by the Facebook posts.\u00a0</p><p>Customs and Border Protection disavowed\u00a0the posts on Monday and released a statement saying that the Department of Homeland Security's agency watchdog is investigating the group for violating agency standards of conduct.</p><p>The group unearthed by Pro Publica is just\u00a0the latest example of law enforcement using Facebook to secretly share racist and sexist content; Reveal reporters\u00a0Will Carless and Michael Corey\u00a0discovered\u00a0hundreds of active and retired law enforcement agents involved\u00a0in hidden white supremacist and anti-government groups in an investigation last month.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Start-up wellness brand Hims and Hers is running hundreds of ads violating Facebook's policy against advertising prescription drugs, Wired's Paris Martineau reveals. Facebook's role in the rise of the start-ups that provide legal but unsupervised prescription medication has put the social media giant in the crosshairs of consumer advocates.</p><p>\"It's dangerous [and] irresponsible,\" Arthur Caplan, director of NYU Langone Medical Center's Division of Medical Ethics told Wired. \"These [online] direct-to-consumer ads are undercutting the idea that you should be seeing a doctor - which is the wrong attitude. It's putting you at risk.\"</p><p>The ads, which promote a variety of products including\u00a0prescription acne medicine and erectile dysfunction pills, may also violate\u00a0U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines by failing to list potential side effects, Paris writes. The FDA declined to comment on whether it would take enforcement action against Facebook or the company.</p><p>Facebook initially removed several violating ads flagged by Wired, but continues to approve similar ads by the company. A Hims and Hers representative tells Wired that it works \"extremely closely\" with Facebook on ad compliance.</p><p>             BYTES:             Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wants answers from the\u00a0Federal Communications Commission about potentially improper corporate influence on an agency advisory panel tasked with shaping cybersecurity standards for the telecommunications industry. Former agency employees\u00a0raised concerns\u00a0over\u00a0the \"heavy sway\" held by industry executives on the panel to reporter Andrea Peterson at the Project for Government Oversight last month.\u00a0</p><p>\"Having the FCC's policymaking process rely on input from individuals employed by, or affiliated with, the corporations that it is tasked with overseeing is the very definition of regulatory capture,\" Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote, citing the POGO report in a letter to the agency released Monday. \"The FCC should be working on behalf of American consumers, not giant telecommunications companies.\"</p><p>The FCC may be in violation of a federal rule that requires advisory committees to \"be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" Peterson noted.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8c2d84eb5dcd4e9b844a246b651c0307</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG9-P0B1-JB4M-V3MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1730\"/><timeReceived>12:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the mounting criticism this week from Trump and other Republicans over the companies' alleged bias against conservatives shows that the backlash to Big Tech is surging across the political spectrum.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In one of President Trump's most explicit criticisms of the technology industry, the\u00a0president at a news conference yesterday\u00a0accused\u00a0Twitter\u00a0of \"big discrimination\" against Republicans -- and also accused leaders of Facebook and Google of colluding with Democrats.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"There is collusion with respect to that, because something has to be going on,\" he said. \"When you get the back scene, back office statements made by executives of the various companies and you see the level of, in many cases hatred, they have for a certain group of people that happen to be in power - that happen to have won the election - you say, 'that's really unfair.' Something's happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebook and Google and Twitter and I do think we have to get to the bottom of it.\"          </p><p>Charges of suppressing conservative voices seem to be shaping Republicans' approach to lashing Big Tech:\u00a0Also this week,\u00a0Rep. Devin\u00a0Nunes (R-Calif.) filed a headline-grabbing $250 million lawsuit against Twitter -- claiming the social network permitted users to attack him because of a political agenda. Though his case has been labeled \"doomed to fail\" by many legal experts, the case provides other Republicans openings to air their grievances.\u00a0</p><p>             The fracas -- combined with recent calls from prominent Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren to break up the technology companies -- highlights how Silicon Valley's spectacular fall from grace has left the industry with few allies on either side of the aisle.          </p><p>             But even as consensus builds in Washington to rein in Big Tech's power, it's not clear if the political parties will ever agree on how they want to bring down the hammer on the companies.\u00a0          </p><p>             Democrats are increasingly raising the prospect of antitrust action to address their concerns with the technology companies -- and there's growing momentum on the left to give the Federal Trade Commission more authorities to investigate potential violations. It's not just Warren's\u00a0calls on the campaign trail:\u00a0Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) published an op-ed in the New York Times yesterday calling on the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0to investigate Facebook for violating antitrust laws.</p><p>             Republicans\u00a0haven't gone as far.\u00a0While\u00a0Trump\u00a0did say last year his administration was looking at antitrust action against Facebook, Google and Amazon, his recently confirmed attorney general, William Barr,\u00a0said he wants to \"find out more about the [market] dynamic\" that allowed Silicon Valley titans to take shape under antitrust enforcers. And when it comes to the FTC, the Trump administration has favored deregulation and may be wary of giving a regulator more power or resource to take on such issues.</p><p>             The pressure from both political parties highlights how difficult it might be for Silicon Valley companies to please political leaders in both parties.\u00a0Sometimes the steps the companies take to put out one fire result in new headaches.\u00a0</p><p>Trump's most recent accusations emerged soon after White House social media director Dan Scavino said on Facebook\u00a0that the social network was \"stopping\" him from replying to comments followers left on his Facebook page. He accused the company of silencing him.</p><p>However, Facebook told my colleague Tony Romm in a statement yesterday that the incident is one intended to stop automated accounts that blocks \"repetitive automated activity\" from one account in a short time frame. \"These limits can have the unintended consequence of temporarily preventing real people like Dan Scavino from engaging in such activity, but lift in an hour or two, which is what happened in this case,\" a spokesman said, apologizing for the mishap.</p><p>Facebook has expanded such efforts to crackdown on automated activity under intense political pressure, especially from Democrats who were concerned about the role bots played in spreading misinformation during the 2016 election.\u00a0</p><p>             One way Republicans may try to crack down on alleged anti-conservative bias is by tinkering with a decades-old law that grants tech companies broad legal immunity for content that users post on their platform. Donald Trump Jr. wrote in an op-ed earlier this week that it's \"high-time\" for conservatives to heed recent suggestions from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to add a \"viewpoint neutrality\" provision to companies protected by the Section 230 provision to ensure conservative voices aren't silenced online.</p><p>             Some Democrats have previously raised the idea of changes to address the spread of hate speech on social media -- which has taken on new relevance in the wake of the New Zealand shooting.          </p><p>             But others, such as\u00a0Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the tech industry's toughest critics in Congress, warned against making any update for fear it would enable politicians to unfairly silence critics.\u00a0          </p><p> \"Donald Trump, Devin Nunes and Ted Cruz are proving exactly why Section 230 is so essential - without protections, all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful in an effort to silence their critics. The fact is, social media companies should be doing more to clean up their platforms, not less. Calls for government regulation of online speech and the business practices of private corporations run counter to everything conservatives claim to believe.\"\u00a0</p><p>             BITS: European Union regulators are once again fining Google -- this time with a $1.7 billion penalty for advertising practices that violate antitrust laws,\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm reports. It's Google's third antitrust penalty from the bloc since 2017.\u00a0</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, announced the punishment at a news conference this morning, where she accsed Google of engaging in \"illegal practices\" in an effort to \"cement its dominant market position\" in the search and advertising markets.\u00a0</p><p> \"The new penalty adds to Google's costly headaches in Europe, where Vestager now has fined the tech giant more than $9 billion in total for a series of antitrust violations,\" Tony write. \"Her actions stand in stark contrast to the United States, where regulators - facing a flood of complaints that big tech companies have become\u00a0too big and powerful\u00a0- have not brought a single antitrust case against Google or any of its peers in recent years, reflecting a widening transatlantic schism over Silicon Valley and its business practices.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook will now withhold detailed demographic data - such as age, gender and Zip codes (which are often used to indicate race) - from advertisers using its targeted ads to market housing, credit and job opportunities,\u00a0my colleagues Tracy Jan and Elizabeth Dwoskin report.\u00a0The company's overhaul is part of a settlement following accusations that employers, lenders and landlords use its tools to discriminate.\u00a0</p><p>Though it marks a significant shift for the company that has built an empire on micro-targeted ads, my colleagues noted yesterday's announcement will likely have little impact on the social network's bottom line. However it could make Facebook less valuable to certain advertisements, such credit card promotions or recruitment.\u00a0</p><p>\"It may not affect Facebook very much, but it will hurt small advertisers who require that narrow targeting to sell products,\" Laura Martin, a senior Internet analyst at the investment bank Needham &amp; Co., told my colleagues. \"If companies can't reach their micro-targeted demographic, they are going to walk away from advertising on Facebook. All ad pricing could go down if demand by advertisers fall.\"</p><p>You can listen to Tracy break down the news on today's Post Reports podcast.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: The widespread sharing of the video of the New Zealand shooting across social media highlighted the role that a nameless group on the message board 8chan played in preserving and then recirculating the video around other corners of the Web,\u00a0my colleague Drew Harwell reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"The original 17-minute live stream was announced on 8chan, an underbelly of the Web known as a haven for far-right extremism and hate speech, and posters there shared tips on how to save and share the video for 'posterity'\u00a0and maximum distribution,'\" Drew wrote.\u00a0\"The ease with which anyone could save and re-upload it online, using a vast network of underground 'mirror'\u00a0sites, ensured it would be permanently stamped across the Web.\"</p><p>Technology companies' content moderation tactics were outmatched by some of these tactics. Facebook for example said it blocked 1.2 million copies from being uploaded, but another 300,000 slipped past its systems and were removed later. The company hasn't said how many people watched the 300,000 videos that did make it on its website. The videos also took off on Twitter and Google.\u00a0</p><p>\"To evade the tech giants' automatic blocking systems, people also began tweaking the video slightly and re-uploading it,\" Harwell reports. \"According to the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a trade group formed by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube, more than 800 'visually distinct videos'\u00a0of the attack had been digitally fingerprinted and banned.\"</p><p>             -- Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, called for a briefing from top technology companies next week on their efforts to police videos of the New Zealand shooting, according to a news release from the Mississippi Democrat's office. In a letter to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter chief Executive Jack Dorsey, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki and Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, Thompson called the companies to prioritize the immediate removal of the terrorist content.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Your companies must prioritize responding to these toxic and violent ideologies with resources and attention,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"If you are unwilling to do so, Congress must consider policies to ensure that terrorist content is not distributed on your platforms - including by studying the examples being set by other countries.\"          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-02014587d3c44097bb80755727cef009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP4-PRV1-DXKP-J044-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1768\"/><timeReceived>1:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

New norms? What is materially different from the White House and the Republican Party have otherwise been signaling all along?\"\u00a0</p><p>             Silicon Valley's broad dismissal of the president's pledges to tackle anti-conservative bias - arguably the top item of his tech agenda - highlights the deepest gulf between industry and Trump's Washington right now. Many are dismissive of the accusations that tech companies are suppressing conservative voices, which they say are\u00a0based on a flawed understanding of how algorithms work and not supported by valid evidence. The companies have been repeatedly denied\u00a0that they are politically\u00a0biased.</p><p>The companies Trump typically targets will reportedly not be in attendance at today's event. But ahead of the summit, the Internet Association, which represents Facebook, Twitter and Google in Washington, was proactive in defending against the president's repeated claims that Silicon Valley companies discriminate against a political ideology.\u00a0</p><p>\"Online platforms are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history,\" said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association in a statement to The Technology 202 yesterday.\u00a0\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect. Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Today's event stands to highlight the very complicated relationship that Trump has with social media. Twitter remains his favored means of communicating with constituents - even about, ironically, his anger at social media companies themselves, like we saw in this morning's Twitter thread.\u00a0</p><p>             And social media played a key role in his rise to the White House. My colleagues Tony Romm, Michael Scherer and Amy B Wang noted\u00a0in a piece earlier\u00a0this week that the White House's guest list for the summit is drawing criticism that the president \"could end up empowering online provocateurs who have adopted controversial political tactics entering the 2020 election campaign.\"</p><p>At today's event, he'll host some of the online influencers who helped stoke support for him on the right online. Twitter user \"CarpeDonktum,\" who is known for making a heavily edited meme of former vice president Joe Biden that Trump shared on his own Twitter feed will be in attendance. So will Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe and Bill Mitchell, a Trump supporter who has promoted a Q-Anon conspiracy, according to Kevin Roose of the New York Times.\u00a0</p><p>             Some social media experts told Kevin that today's summit won't just be about bashing Big Tech, but about the rising influence of these online personalities in politics.\u00a0\"I think the White House social media summit is an opportunity to say thank you for the community that has been at the president's side these last three years and enlist their help in the fights to come,\" said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist.</p><p>But even as the president rolls out the welcome wagon for this cast of Internet supporters, he maintains he (probably) could have won in 2016 without social media:</p><p>             BITS: Amazon plans to announce today that it will retrain a third of its U.S. workers as advances in technology threaten to displace their\u00a0jobs,\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's Chip Cutter writes. The company plans to spend $700 million on the initiative, which aims to retrain 100,000 workers by 2025 through new programs as well as an expansion of existing ones.\u00a0</p><p>\"Technology is changing our society, and it's certainly changing work,\" said Jeff Wilke, chief executive of Amazon's world-wide consumer business, told the Wall Street Journal. He also said that the initiative is meant to help workers \"be prepared for the opportunities of the future.\"</p><p>Some workers in fulfillment centers will be able to retrain for IT support roles, such as helming the machines that operate in Amazon's centers. The programs will also be available to corporate workers, like non-technical employees who will have the opportunity to retrain as software engineers without returning to school. It's one of the biggest retraining programs ever announced -- and breaks down to an investment of about $7,000 per worker at the company.\u00a0</p><p>The initiative comes as Amazon faces a shortage of technical workers. The company currently has more than 20,000 jobs open in the U.S., more than half of which are in Seattle.</p><p>At the same time, the initiative could also provide the company with political cover as it faces broad criticism from labor groups and progressive politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the treatment of its workers. The company last year raised its minimum wage for U.S. employees to $15 per hour under intense pressure.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0             The White House launched an investigation into France's plans to impose a revenue tax on U.S. tech companies Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple,my colleagues Jeanne Whalen and Tony Romm reported yesterday. The unexpected action by the White House has already drawn praise from tech companies and industry groups.       </p><p>\"We applaud the Trump Administration for taking decisive action against France and for signaling to all of America's trading partners that the U.S. government will not acquiesce to tax and trade policies that discriminate against American businesses,\" Amazon told The Post. Google has also called the French tax \"discriminatory.\"</p><p>          The probe would determine whether\u00a0the 3 percent \"is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce unfair to U.S. businesses,\" U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer said in a statement. A similar investigation led to tariffs against China last year.       </p><p>          Trump rebuked the E.U. for using U.S. tech companies as \"easy money\" in an interview with CNBC last month, adding the United States \"should be doing what they're doing.\" (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)       </p><p>             BYTES: The price of bitcoin fell sharply today after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell raised concerns about Facebook's cryptocurrency initiative Project Libra,\u00a0according to CNBC's Ryan Browne. Bitcoin\u00a0fell 12% to about $11,450 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk data.\u00a0</p><p>          The sharp slide underscores the gravity of Powell's warning to\u00a0the House Financial Services Committee\u00a0yesterday that\u00a0the project raises \"serious concerns\" about \"privacy\u00a0money\u00a0laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.\" \u00a0       </p><p>          \"It cannot go forward without there being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed\" those concerns, Powell told the committee.\u00a0\"All of those things will need to be addressed very thoroughly and carefully.\" Powell joins a chorus of concern from lawmakers, including House Financial Services Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) who co-wrote a letter to Facebook calling for a \"moratorium\" on Libra until regulators and Congress can assess the project.       </p><p>          \"I have a lot of questions about Libra,\" Waters told CNBC after the hearing. \"I'm concerned about the fact that it's based in Switzerland. We have a lot of information about Switzerland and money laundering.\" Waters also called Libra a \"threat to the dollar.\"       </p><p>Increased scrutiny from Washington has fueled doubts in Silicon Valley, where \"even companies that want to see Facebook succeed with Libra have reservations about whether it will happen,\" writes CNBC's Salvador Rodriquez. Libra top executive David Marcus will testify before the Senate Banking Committee next week.</p><p>             -- IBM announced its support for a new proposal that would curb a key legal shield\u00a0that applies to platforms such as Google and Facebook - making it contingent on the actions the companies take to limit abuse,\u00a0Bloomberg News's Naomi Nix and Ben Brody reported yesterday. The company joins a growing number of lawmakers and advocates who are trying to update Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a decades-old legal provision that grants Internet companies protection from legal liability for\u00a0content posted to their platforms.       </p><p>IBM is endorsing a \"reasonable care\" approach, which requires companies to act as soon as they are aware of a problem. In essence, it would make companies legally accountable for addressing offending content while still giving them immunity from liability for it appearing on their platforms.       </p><p>\"We simply believe companies should also be held legally responsible to use reasonable, common-sense care when it comes to moderating online content,\"              Ryan Hagemann, IBM government and regulatory affairs technology policy executive,\u00a0wrote in a blog post yesterday.\u00a0\"T          his means, for example, quickly identifying and deleting content focused on child pornography, violence on child-oriented sites, or online content promoting acts of mass violence, suicide, or the sale of illegal drugs.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-90a8ff4139d4481b972bc49636cfc6b4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-DFJ1-JB4M-V259-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1699\"/><timeReceived>1:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was jam-packed with the kind of is-this-really-happening moments that felt like a Twitter feed come to life.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Memes were created in real time:\u00a0Large posters of some of President Trump's most famous tweets were placed on stands. My colleague Philip Bump spotted\u00a0a\u00a0tweet about the president's \"covfefe\" typo next to the bust of Abraham Lincoln.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             And Trump, without a 280-character limit yesterday, gave wide-ranging\u00a0remarks that were made-for-viral moments.\u00a0In addition to blasting the tech companies, he had colorful ways to describe\u00a0his favorite tweets\u00a0(\"It'd be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty\")\u00a0and compared Twitter to a typewriter. He veered from talking about the weather on his Fourth of July celebration (\"They learned it was my real hair that day because I was drenched\") to criticizing former California governor and actor Arnold\u00a0Schwarzenegger's performance on \"The Apprentice.\"\u00a0</p><p>             And the feuds that might otherwise take place online happened live as a\u00a0wide cast             of\u00a0the president's controversial supporters, known for generating sometimes misleading or conspiratorial posts supporting Trump, gathered at the White House.\u00a0Before everyone went home,\u00a0a brawl broke out in the Rose Garden, as former White House official and conservative media personality Sebastian Gorka yelled at Playboy Magazine's Brian Karem. \"You're not a journalist, you're a punk,\" Gorka shouted:</p><p>             But beyond the circus-like atmosphere of the event, the conference had serious implications for Silicon Valley. It highlighted how the president's attacks on Big Tech are creating more political jeopardy for the tech companies in Washington.\u00a0</p><p>As my colleague Tony Romm wrote, \"the conference represented [Trump's] highest-profile broadside against Silicon Valley\u00a0after months of accusations that tech giants censor conservative users and websites.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             Though the companies have repeatedly denied these claims, multiple attendees exiting the event told Tony that congressional Republicans appear poised to act.\u00a0So what's next? Here's what we're tracking:</p><p>             1. The White House says more scrutiny\u00a0is on the\u00a0\u00a0way. The\u00a0tech companies weren't at the White House yesterday, but Trump says the White House will have an event with them soon -- and that their presence would be required. He also issued the following directive to his administration:</p><p>             2. Congressional Republicans' efforts might start with\u00a0Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Tony reports. The Tennessee Republican said she's moving ahead with a task force to study tech giants and \"find answers to the issues of privacy and data security\" as well as competition, as she detailed in a later interview with Tony.</p><p> \"I'm hearing from so many people who are saying, 'We need to put some guard rails in place,' because we've never done that,\" Blackburn said. \"This is not an industry in its infancy. This is an industry that is a mature industry at this point.\"</p><p>             3. Privacy concerns about Big Tech came up at the social media summit, too.\u00a0Conservatives heard from House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, a longtime critic of tech giants' content moderation decisions. But he touched not just on bias but privacy, reiterating a belief that consumers should own their personal data -- and that Congress may need to legislate, according to two people in the room who spoke with Tony.</p><p>McCarthy told me in a statement he's concerned about bias, but that isn't the only tech issue that should concern Americans. \"The collection and use of our data by technology companies must be met with a new privacy framework that allows each American to see our data, control our data, and delete our data,\" McCarthy said.\u00a0\"As the digital age continues to grow, we will be relentless in our pursuit of accountability, innovation, and privacy.\"</p><p>             4. Sen. Josh Hawley got air time for his push to overhaul Section 230, a legal shield that protects tech platforms from liability for content people post on their sites.\u00a0Hawley spoke about his efforts to make that legal immunity contingent on the companies' ability to prove to the government that they are not discriminating against conservatives. (You can read our previous coverage here).\u00a0Trump said Hawley is doing \"important\" work and that he will be in attendance at the White House's upcoming meeting with the tech companies.\u00a0</p><p>             5. But the summit could make it harder for Republicans to work across the aisle on tech isues.\u00a0Democrats sharply criticized the Trump administration for inviting controversial conservative provocateurs who are known for targeting Trump's opponents with inflammatory tweets and misleading videos. From Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), who leads the House's top tech committee, on Twitter:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>Just before Trump kicked off his social media summit yesterday, Twitter went dark\u00a0for users across the United States.\u00a0</p><p>When the site came back online, The Verge's Casey Newton commented on the irony that the\u00a0outage coincided with the event.</p><p>My colleague Hamza Shaban touched on the isolation users felt during the long 60-odd minutes.</p><p>And for some, the outage was almost productive. GV partner M.G. Siegler:</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Trump suggested in a series of tweets last night that Facebook should have to submit to formal bank regulation in launching its new Libra project, something that could spell serious trouble for the social media giant's cryptocurrency plans,my colleagues Tony Romm and Damian Paletta report.</p><p>\"If Facebook did have to register its services as a type of banking, it could be forced to allow the Federal Reserve to scrutinize its entire business operation,\" they write. \"It would also give the Treasury Department more power to investigate its anti-money laundering controls.\"</p><p>Trump also expressed that he is \"not a fan of Bitcoin\" and believes Facebook's new Libra project \"will have little standing or dependability.\" He called the U.S. dollar the \"only one real currency in the USA.\"</p><p>Facebook pointed Tony and Damian\u00a0to previous statements from Dave Marcus, who oversees Facebook's cryptocurrency. \"Facebook will not control the network, the currency, or the reserve backing it,\" Marcus has previously emphasized. \"Facebook will only be one among over a hundred members of the Libra Association by launch.\"</p><p>Money laundering is just one of several concerns about the project that other officials, including House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, have expressed about the social media giant's cryptocurrency project. Waters has called for a \"moratorium\" on the Switzerland-based project until U.S. regulators can get more information.</p><p>Marcus will testify in front of the Senate Banking Committee next week.</p><p>                          NIBBLES: Google confirmed that its contractors review recordings of conversations customers have with their Google Assistant devices,\u00a0my colleague Greg Bensinger reported yesterday. Amazon came under fire by critics earlier this year for similar practices.       </p><p>          The company acknowledged the practice after a whistleblower leaked more than a thousand of the screened recordings to VRT, a Belgian news outlet. The recordings included personal information, such as addresses and medical histories, according to VRT reporters.       </p><p> \"Though Google said just two-tenths of a percent of recordings are used for human review, it also disclosed that customers may occasionally be recorded even when they aren't using Assistant,\" Greg writes.\u00a0</p><p>Google wrote in a blog post that devices with Google Assistant only record when a user gives a wake-up command, such as \"okay Google,\" and that cases of devices picking up a false signal are rare. Of the 1,000 recordings leaked to VRT, 153 were accidental.       </p><p>Google promised to investigate the leak but defended the practice of collecting audio without explicit user consent. Reviewing recordings in different languages \"is a critical part of the process of building speech technology, and is necessary to creating products like the Google Assistant,\" David Monsees, product manager for search wrote in a blog.       </p><p>             BYTES: U.S. tech companies had a hand in developing microprocessors that are being used by a Shenzhen-based company to \"enhance the capabilities of Internet surveillance and censorship technology it provides to human rights-abusing security agencies in China,\"according to a report yesterday from The Intercept's Ryan Gallagher. One employee told The Intercept that the technology is being used to secretly observe the Internet activity of 200 million people.\u00a0</p><p>A nonprofit led by Google and IBM, called The OpenPower Foundation, brokered a \"collaboration\" between IBM, U.S. chip manufacturer Xilinx and the Shenzhen-based business, Semptian, according to Ryan, to build microprocessors that allow computers to monitor vasts troves of data.\u00a0The reported arrangement is drawing criticism from Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), who has been active on tech policy issues involving China.\u00a0</p><p>          \"It's disturbing to see that China has successfully recruited Western companies and researchers to assist them in their information control efforts,\" Warner, Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, told The Intercept.       </p><p>Semptian, Google and Xilinx did not respond to The Intercept's requests for comment. The OpenPower Foundation told The Intercept it \"does not become involved, or seek to be informed, about the individual business strategies, goals or activities of its members.\" An IBM spokesman told The Intercept that the company \"has not worked with Semptian on joint technology development.\" However Ryan reports that a source familiar with Semptian's operations said IBM worked\u00a0with the Shenzhen-based company through a collaborative cloud platform that is supported by an IBM research unit.\u00a0</p><p>             - Talks for a $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint have slowed despite a greenlight from the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal's Drew Fitzgerald and Brent Kendall report. At fault is stalled negotiations with Dish, which is set to acquire offloaded assets from the two companies to form a fourth-major carrier and clear the way for the deal at the Department of Justice.\u00a0\"The deal would help protect more than $21 billion of wireless spectrum licenses [Dish chairman Charlie Ergen] has amassed in recent years by putting them to work on a customer base,\" Drew and Brent write, adding that the FCC \"could rescind some of the licenses if they aren't put to use soon.\"       </p><p>          But the three companies have been unable to reach an agreement over what Dish can do with the assets once it acquires them. Before the companies offered to offload the assets, officials at the Department of Justice recommending blocking the merger, my colleague Tony reported in May. It's likely the companies will miss the July 29 deadline set by the DOJ for negotiations, the Journal reports - the second deadline missed since the merger cleared that FCC. If merger does pass Justice Department review, it could still face court challenges from over a dozen state attorneys general.       </p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             Coming Up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-a0e3df7869c74dc3b42d27c87b8ccc36</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJF-CPS1-JB4M-V2TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1955\"/><timeReceived>1:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Alexander Vindman and former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill were key witnesses in the impeachment inquiry into whether President Trump misused his office for personal political gain.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And some Internet users believed they had more to say on Twitter when accounts with handles matching their names popped up in the aftermath of their publicly televised testimony. The only problem: the accounts were fakes.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter moved Monday night to suspend the accounts named @FionaHillPhd and @LtColVindman, the social media service confirmed to The Technology 202, but only after they had amassed thousands of followers in the wake of the real witnesses blockbuster Capitol Hill testimony. Users were widely retweeting those handles, seemingly under the impression the real Hill and Vindman were authoring the missives.</p><p>Hill and Vindman don't actually have Twitter accounts             - and their legal teams raced to set the record straight and ensure that Twitter took swift action against the false accounts.\u00a0          </p><p>The accounts were of particular concern because some of the tweets appeared credible in light of the witnesses real\u00a0testimony. Both accounts included photos of the officials.\u00a0</p><p>\"The tweets were not entirely outrageous,\" Lee Wolosky, an attorney representing Hill, told me in an interview. \"Anyone who knows Dr. Hill would know that wasn't what she would tweet. But to other observers, it was not patently implausible.\"\u00a0</p><p>             This is the first impeachment process in which social media is playing a key role. That's worrying researchers after the U.S. intelligence community identified Russian trolls and bots as spreading disinformation designed to divide the American electorate and help Trump win the 2016 election. Twitter's quick action to take down the accounts suggests social media companies may be approaching impeachment and the 2020 election differently and more aggressively.          </p><p>The existence of the fake accounts \"proves the basic fact that social media is easily manipulated, and we have to be really careful in analyzing what we're seeing on social media,\" Wolosky said.</p><p>There was at least one previous Twitter account purporting to belong to Hill, but it did not gain as many followers as quickly as @FionaHillPhd,\u00a0Wolosky said.\u00a0Vindman's legal representatives sent a letter two weeks ago to Twitter's general counsel warning the company about\u00a0misinformation related to their client, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. There have been several other accounts impersonating the Purple Heart recipient, the person said.\u00a0</p><p>             Such fake social media accounts could threaten the credibility of\u00a0Vindman and Hill. Both have been careful not to elaborate further publicly on the impeachment proceedings and limited their comments to their Capitol Hill testimony, which the House Intelligence Committee compelled.\u00a0          </p><p>             It wasn't immediately clear who was behind the accounts or what their motivations were for creating them. The Hill impersonator added a note to the Twitter biography denying the account actually belonged to Hill as Wolosky and other Twitter users noted its existence. But the tweets appeared credible to some who watched Hill last week\u00a0debunk\u00a0claims by Trump and Republicans that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.\u00a0</p><p>\"I find it deeply concerning that members of Congress continue to propagate a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine was involved in the interference of our elections,\" the Hill impostor account said in a tweet, which has been removed from Twitter.\u00a0\"That is resoundingly false. The entire U.S. Intelligence community agrees that it was Russia--not Ukraine.\"</p><p>The Vindman account also added that it was a parody to its biography once Twitter users raised questions about its validity.\u00a0Susan Hennessey, the executive editor at Lawfare, noted that\u00a0many of the Vindman impersonator's tweets were mocking\u00a0Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. From her Twitter feed:</p><p>Her tweet referenced a fake Vindman missive that said: \"I am not angry with House Republicans or\u00a0@DevinNunes. I harbor no hatred for our President nor am I a 'Never Trumper'. I simply love our country and believed it was my patriotic calling to tell the truth.\" It was deleted after Twitter suspended the\u00a0@LtColVindman account.\u00a0</p><p>Wolosky said Twitter responded to his report of the fake account in about an hour and should be commended for quickly suspending it. But the incident highlights how the impeachment witnesses's lawyers have to constantly monitor\u00a0for other impostors or misinformation related to their clients.\u00a0</p><p>             \"We are carefully watching and going to respond quickly,\" Wolosky said.\u00a0          </p><p>Here are a few screengrabs from the fake accounts:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The Democrat leading the House antitrust investigation into Silicon Valley is concerned that Apple's strengthened privacy protections could be a guise for anti-competitive behavior,\u00a0my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"There is a growing risk that without a strong privacy law in the United States, platforms will exploit their role as de facto private regulators by placing a thumb on the scale in their own favor,\" House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chairman David N. Cicilline (R.I.) told Reed in his first comments on the matter.\u00a0</p><p>House lawmakers have also met with Apple's partners over concerns that its App Store policies disadvantage rivals as a part of its ongoing antitrust probe, Reed reports. Apple changed its iPhone settings in June to make turning on permanent location tracking a multistep process for non-Apple apps. Turning location services off is extremely difficult for Apple services, however, potentially giving the company an advantage over competitors as it turns to data and location-driven services for profit</p><p>Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim also hinted that privacy could become a factor in the agency's antitrust probe in a speech last week.</p><p>\"We continually work with developers and take their feedback on how to help protect user privacy while also providing the tools developers need to make the best app experiences,\" Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told Reed.</p><p>             TikTok suspended the profile of a 17-year-old whose\u00a0lesson on China's treatment of its Muslim minority disguised as a makeup tutorial went viral yesterday. The removal adds to growing suspicions that the Chinese-owned company moderates content abroad to meet Beijing's strict censorship rules,\u00a0          my colleagues Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report.</p><p>TikTok says the account's owner, Feroza Aziz, had her account suspended because her previous account using the same phone number had violated the platform's rules about posting terrorist content.\u00a0</p><p>\"TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities and did not do so in this case,\" Eric Han, head of the company's U.S. trust and safety team, said in a statement to The Post.</p><p>Aziz says she never got an explanation from TikTok about her suspension, and the video that violated the policies for terrorist content had only briefly mentioned Osama bin Laden - as a joke.\u00a0</p><p>The incident highlights the struggle of social media companies to draw a line between content moderation and censorship. TikTok's lack of transparency into its content moderation guidelines has made it difficult for the company to dispute claims of censorship influenced by the Chinese government.</p><p>\"It's completely at the whim of these giant tech companies [as to] what they decide to tell us, and we have no way to fact-check their account of things,\" said Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St. John's University School of Law who studies social media and free speech. \"There's no outside mechanism of enforcement.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Voters may not share Elizabeth Warren's focus on breaking up Big Tech,\u00a0Recode's Theodore Schliefer reports. In interviews with 50 voters across five events for the 2020 Democratic candidate, not one person brought up tech companies' growing reach\u00a0as a top concern, he reports.</p><p>The gap between the senator from Massachusetts and her potential supporters highlights the difficulty in getting voters to rally against the abuses of Silicon Valley when its impact can feel removed and impersonal.</p><p>\"Facebook one way or the other doesn't affect my life. I still have to cook dinner and go to work every day. I have all this other stuff,\" said Sarah Oliver, who struggles with $8,000 in medical debt, at one rally. \"It's not life and death for us. Whereas we're actually in debt for health care.\"\u00a0</p><p>Warren says voters do care, even if they don't frame it the same way.</p><p>\"What they see is power. That these big guys determine whether or not their data gets stolen. Determine what kind of stuff comes into their news feed,\" Warren told Theodore. \"People get this. They may not use the same frame in terms of the words they use - but they get the power dynamic in terms of what's happening in America, and they're sick of it.\"</p><p>Voters who are energized by Warren's crusade against tech titans\u00a0feel uncertain of how to tackle the issue, however. \"You know what to fight against if you get a horrible medical bill,\" rally attendee Mary Erickson told Theodore. \"People don't know how to fight this.\"</p><p>The holidays came early for Twitter users who have been coveting handles of other users. The company announced yesterday it would start purging accounts inactive six months or more starting sometime after Dec. 12.\u00a0</p><p>Many users celebrated the news, like the Los Angeles Times's\u00a0Johana Bhuiyan:</p><p>Other users decidedly did not want to represent their namesake. BuzzFeed's\u00a0Julia Reinstein:</p><p>Many questioned what the policy would mean for deceased users and how old tweets would be archived.

But hold your jokes about how this is just the new voicemail: Tech experts warn that the audio feature could be a new vector for harmful content that's even harder to police than text.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          The new feature could raise new problems as the upcoming 2020 election, civil unrest and coronavirus pandemic are raising the stakes in Big Tech's fight against abuse and disinformation on its platforms.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          \"Unfortunately, if the company gives users a new way to express themselves, some of those users are likely to take advantage of the situation to spew the sort of harmful content that has long been associated with Twitter,\" said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Center for Business and Human Rights.\u00a0       </p><p>Twitter's handling of disinformation, violence and hate speech is already under the microscope.\u00a0       </p><p>          Voice tweets will add \"an additional layer of complexity\" for Twitter, which has faced criticism for not doing enough to police falsehoods and other harmful content in traditional tweets, said John Redgrave, the chief executive of the start-up Sentropy, which makes content moderation tools.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"Any new medium for distribution creates additional moderation challenges,\" Redgrave said.\u00a0       </p><p>Twitter is only making it available to a limited number of people initially as it works out these issues.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"We're working to incorporate additional monitoring systems ahead of bringing this to everyone,\" said Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough. \"We'll review any reported voice tweets in line with our rules, and take action, including labeling as needed.\"       </p><p>          But Twitter has been criticized for being inconsistent about how it enforces its rules for regular tweets, and audio could be an especially challenging decision if it's coming from public figures.\u00a0       </p><p>\"If it's someone like Trump's account, it becomes harder to ascertain which of that content is legitimate,\" said Ashkan Soltani, former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.\u00a0</p><p>Twitter particularly has taken a hard line on manipulated media, at times appending labels to videos in tweets that have been doctored in certain circumstances. The new audio feature could open it up to greater audio manipulation at a time when sound-editing technology is rapidly advancing.       </p><p>             There are technical reasons why audio has also traditionally been more challenging for tech companies to monitor than text.\u00a0          </p><p>          \"Moderating audio takes more resources because it takes more manual analysis and currently has less options for applying automated tools,\" said Graham Brookie, director and managing editor of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council.\u00a0       </p><p>          To analyze audio, human moderators may have to listen to the file in full, which at 140 seconds in length could be much more time consuming than scanning a 140-character tweet. They also may rely on transcription services to convert the audio to text, which could then be reviewed by humans or algorithms, Redgrave told me.\u00a0       </p><p>          Given the current available technology, there is \"no doubt\" this will make Twitter's challenge to moderate content more difficult, Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee who recently wrote the book \"Terms of Disservice,\" told me.\u00a0       </p><p>             But this won't be an entirely new challenge for Twitter.\u00a0          </p><p>          Brookie points out that Twitter already allows video on its service, so it has dealt with similar issues with that content. And other companies that allow shared audio on their platforms are dealing with this, too.\u00a0       </p><p>          It also remains to be seen how widely the new voice tweet feature is used. Already, it's become something of a punchline on Twitter.\u00a0       </p><p>          From the Verge's Casey Newton:       </p><p>And others are still holding out for an edit button:</p><p>Have thoughts on voice tweets?

Fowler reports.\u00a0</p><p>\"We just failed to establish clear rules about corporations using big data to dig into our private lives, and those days should be behind us,\" Brown told Geoffrey. His bill, which was modeled after the same law that protects consumers' financial data, would give consumers a reset.\u00a0</p><p>\"There are a lot of proposals out there on privacy, but we think this is probably broader and deeper with some different ideas,\" Brown said. \"Fundamentally, to me, privacy is a civil rights issue.\"</p><p>             But online data is much more diverse than financial data, and regulating it is a big challenge.\u00a0 So far Congress has been unable to reach a consensus on the privacy legislation many lawmakers called for after the Cambridge Analytica scandal: there are six other pieces of legislation pending in addition to Brown's.\u00a0</p><p>And industry players will likely try to fight the bill's mission to dismantle digital targeted advertising, a system many companies argue is key to allowing them to provide their services free.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and Google are in the hot seat on disinformation today.\u00a0</p><p>Senior officials from the social media titans are expected to tell the House Intelligence Committee about the investments they've made to prevent foreign actors from manipulating their service. Lawmakers will also ask the companies about whether they've seen any foreign misinformation linked to the coronavirus pandemic or protests against racism and police brutality.\u00a0</p><p>Nick Pickles, Twitter's public Policy Strategy and Development Director, plans to tell lawmakers that the threat of foreign interference in elections is \"real and evolving,\" according to excerpts from prepared testimony shared with the Technology 202. Pickles will say that the company is watching for signs of foreign interference in conversations about the protests, after Russian actors sought to exploit U.S. racial divisions in their 2016 campaign to divide American voters.\u00a0</p><p> \"As America has responded to the death of George Floyd and cities across the country have seen protestors take to the streets, the public conversation on Twitter has highlighted the deep-rooted nature of issues related to race, justice, and equality,\" he will say. \"While we have not seen evidence of concerted foreign state-backed efforts to manipulate the public conversation in recent weeks, we remain vigilant.\" \u00a0</p><p>Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook head of security policy, intends to focus on the company's efforts to support voters, including the new Voter Information Hub the company unveiled this week. Yesterday he told reporters in a press call that he's monitoring for signs of foreign interference targeting the protests.\u00a0</p><p>\"Since the protests started at the end of May, we've seen some speculation about foreign interference targeting those protests. \u00a0We're actively looking and we haven't yet seen coordinated inauthentic behavior targeting us,\" Gleicher said. \"We have seen isolated inauthentic accounts looking to impersonate authentic activists and where we've found that, we've taken action against them.\"</p><p>Google declined to comment.\u00a0</p><p>More than 70 employees at Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's philanthropy are calling on the organization to address systemic racism.\u00a0</p><p>The dozens of employees have put forth a list of 12 changes to guide the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's investments in overhauling American education, Theodore Schleifer at Recode reports.\u00a0</p><p>The proposals include increasing the number of black leaders in CZI's management and creating a committee of individuals from marginalized backgrounds to guide the changes. It's a rare instance of bottom-up activism in the philanthropy world, Theodore writes. The letter follows a push from a group of CZI backed scientists, who challenged Zuckerberg on Facebook's content moderation. A small handful of employees also signed that letter.\u00a0</p><p>\"We welcome feedback from our team members and have worked hard to create a safe environment for employees to make their voices heard,\" CZI representative Raymonde Charles said in response to the letter. \"We're proud of the many CZI employees who have raised their hands in recent weeks to help in this new call to action.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Meanwhile, Google announced a new plan to increase black representation at the company by improving leadership representation in underrepresented groups 30 percent by 2025. The company will also introduce new anti-racism educational programs and establish new talent liaisons focused on hiring and retention, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai wrote in company-wide note.\u00a0</p><p>             Pinterest chief executive Ben Silberman told employees that the company would hire a non-white board member,Bloomberg's Sarah Frier reports. He also promised to evaluate managers on diversity hiring, and to hire outside experts to comprehensively review employee compensation and evaluate possible unfairness. His action follows employee backlash to the company's response to two former black female employees' allegations of racial discrimination at the company.\u00a0</p><p>The Justice Department proposed legislation that could punish Facebook, Google and Twitter for harmful content online.\u00a0</p><p>The proposal the agency unveiled builds on an executive order from Trump earlier this month that threatens to erode a long-standing legal shield for tech companies from liability for content on their sites, Tony Romm reports.\u00a0</p><p>It also raises the possibility that companies could lose their legal protection if their security practices hamper law enforcement, giving the department another potent tool in its war against encrypted technologies.\u00a0</p><p>But Congress would need to get behind the proposal, which is a long shot in an election year. Both parties have called in recent months to overhaul the legal shield, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Democrats tell Tony they're unlikely to line up behind the Justice Department.          </p><p>\"I've certainly been one of Congress's loudest critics of Section 230, but I have no interest in being an agent of Bill Barr's speech police,\" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), one of the authors of bipartisan legislation to change the law, said in a statement Wednesday. \"I'm deeply concerned that President Trump and Attorney General Barr are exploiting Big Tech's complicity in human misery to advance their own political agenda.\"</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment. The Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group representing those companies and other online services, sharply rebuked the Justice Department for its proposal.</p><p>\"Rolling back Section 230 protections will make it harder, not easier, for online platforms to make their platforms safe,\" Jon Berroya, interim president of the group, said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>          Trump lashed out at NBC News after the outlet reported that Google banned Zero Hedge, a far-right website, from its advertising platform due to policy violations in its comment section. The company also issued a warning to The Federalist, another outlet.       </p><p>          The tweet adds to the conservative backlash against tech, as some Republicans cheered on the Justice Department's efforts to limit tech's immunity protections.

The ex-colleague sent her personal information, including her cellphone number, to a rightwing activist group that then           \"shared my personal information on just about every dark corner of the Internet,\" Ozoma told The Technology 202.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          Aerica Shimizu Banks, who served in federal government relations for the company, said on Twitter she received \"disparaging comments about my ethnicity in front of my team.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          Banks described her tenure at Pinterest as \"marked a period of glaringly unfair pay, intense discrimination, and terrifying retaliation.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             They are taking their complaints public as Silicon Valley's support of Black Lives Matter draws broad skepticism.\u00a0          </p><p>          Pinterest is one of many tech companies that publicly voicing its solidarity with the protests against racism and police violence. But their declarations are also drawing a spotlight on tech companies' own lack of diversity and racial inequities.\u00a0       </p><p>          Ozoma and Banks tell me that the company's public comments do not match up with their personal experiences at the company.\u00a0       </p><p>          Ozoma began raising concerns about mistreatment to the company in January 2019, she said. Both Ozoma and Banks ultimately left the company in late May of this year.\u00a0       </p><p>             \"             After dealing with it for that long, then being doxxed, all while publicly representing the company and not being able to tell anyone about what was going on - to then see the absolutely hypocritical statement from them was incensing,\" Ozoma said in an interview. \"And I know that there are black employees, many of whom have reached out to me today, who were scared to say anything.\"</p><p>Banks felt a similar frustration: \"Reading their statement on Black Lives Matter felt like a slap in the face and a total insult when I literally left the company days before because they treated my Black life and the Black lives of my other colleagues like they didn't matter,\" Banks said in an email.       </p><p>          \"I am taking this personal, professional, financial, and reputational risk because if not now, in this moment, when?\" Banks said. \"So many Black people, especially Black women are silenced by these risks all the time. I want them to know that they are not alone and they are not crazy.\u00a0 We hear them, we see them, we affirm them. I'm here to support any Black woman going through this at their workplace.\"       </p><p>Pinterest says it investigated the former employees' concerns when they were raised.\u00a0</p><p>\"We took these issues seriously and conducted a thorough investigation when they were raised, and we're confident both employees were treated fairly,\" Pinterest spokeswoman Malorie Lucich said in a statement. \"We want each and every one of our employees at Pinterest to feel welcomed, valued, and respected. As we outlined in our statement on June 2nd, we're committed to advancing our work in inclusion and diversity by taking action at our company and on our platform. In areas where we, as a company, fall short, we must and will do better.\"\u00a0</p><p>          Banks said her manager made \"disparaging comments\" about her ethnicity, which she reported to human resources. A report on the incident compiled by Pinterest Human Resources, shared with The Technology 202, confirms that that Banks, who is half Japanese, reported that a supervisor \"made comments to you about the origin of ramen noodles as a result of a bias towards you.\"\u00a0</p><p>The company investigated and concluded that these comments \"do not indicate bias on their own and are not a violation of our Code of Conduct,\" according to internal emails.\u00a0</p><p>          Ozoma says the company's inadequate response to the online harassment forced her to hire social media intelligence agency Storyful and enlist the help of former coworkers at Google and Facebook to monitor and protect her information. Pinterest declined to discuss any specifics of her claims or actions it took in response.\u00a0       </p><p>The complaints could be a blow to Pinterest's reputation, which is broadly seen as a leader in diversity in the tech industry.\u00a0</p><p>The company has a reputation of being more aggressive in addressing harmful content in many instances than other social networks.\u00a0</p><p>Yet Ozoma says her recommendations for Pinterest to stamp out racist content were met with criticism. Ozoma recommended that the company stop promoting content that romanticizes weddings at former slave plantations, a move that was widely praised in the media. Yet documents shared with The Technology 202 show that her supervisor criticized her for not providing more options to consider, other than an outright ban.\u00a0</p><p>Like other Silicon Valley companies, Pinterest has struggled with diversity among its own ranks. Only 4 percent of all Pinterest employees are black, and black people make up only 1 percent of leadership at the company, according to a diversity report released in 2020.\u00a0</p><p>From Karla Monterroso, the chief executive of the diversity-focused nonprofit Code 2040:</p><p>Color of Change, a civil rights organization that has fought against discrimination in Silicon Valley, is calling on Pinterest to at a minimum provide Ozoma and Banks with \"due compensation\" and apologies.\u00a0</p><p>             Other tech experts praised the contributions that Ozoma and Banks made to the tech industry in their roles. From Kate Starbird, associate professor of human centered design and engineering at University of Washington.\u00a0</p><p>The European Union has launched two antitrust probes into the Apple's payment service and the App Store.\u00a0</p><p>If found guilty, Apple could have to pay a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual revenue and make changes to its business practices, the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Michaels and Sam Schechner report. It's the latest salvo in the bloc's long-running tensions with the smartphone maker.\u00a0</p><p>Apple rivals, including music streaming service Spotify, have filed complaints with the EU over Apple's rules for developers in the App Store. The complaint has brought attention to the company's practice of taking a 30 percent cut of sales through the store.\u00a0</p><p>Separately, others have complained that Apple has abused its position to force developers to use Apple Pay rather than other payments services. The European Commission will probe how Apple allows only its own Apple Pay service to use the no-contact payment system built into its devices.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don't want to play by the same rules as everyone else,\" Apple told the Journal.\u00a0</p><p>          Six former eBay employees were charged with cyberstalking after allegedly sending a bloody pig mask to online critics.       </p><p>          The alleged harassment campaign, which also involved sending a fetal pig, started in 2019 after a Massachusetts couple published an article about a lawsuit involving eBay on their e-commerce site,                        Rachel Lerman reports                    .       </p><p>          The eBay employees, which included\u00a0James Baugh, former senior director of safety, and David Harville, former director of global resiliency, harassed the couple at their home by sending them a\u00a0book about surviving the loss of\u00a0a spouse to the couple and posted a fake Craiglist ad with their address soliciting sex. One of the employees also sent vulgar and harassing messages to one victim and used the fake account to criticize the newsletter.\u00a0       </p><p>Ebay said in a statement it was investigating the incident and fired all of the employees charged as well as the company's chief communications officer. The company said there was no evidence that former chief executive Devin Wenig, who left the company in September, knew in advance or authorized the actions.       </p><p>Employees at Apple, Google and Microsoft raised $4 million for the wrong Black Lives Matter organization.\u00a0</p><p>It's a prime example of the confusion that the \"Black Lives Matter Foundation,\" a California-based charity working on bringing police and communities together, has caused online donors in recent weeks, Ryan Mac and Brianna Sacks at BuzzFeed News report. \u00a0Other donors found the organization searching for \"Black Lives Matter\" on GoFundMe or through the misguided tweets of equally confused donors. \u00a0</p><p>The founder of the group, Robert Ray Barnes, claims that the Black Lives Matter movement, which gained national attention during the 2014 Ferguson protests, stole his name. \u00a0A representative for Black Lives Matter told BuzzFeed the foundation is improperly using its name.</p><p>             GoFundMe says it froze donations to the California foundation earlier this month, and it will refund money to any donors who sent money to the foundation in error. Several other platforms also froze payments to the foundation after being contacted by BuzzFeed.          </p><p>Benevity, another fundraising portal used by some tech companies, also listed the foundation. The foundation was eligible for Apple's two-to-one match for the month of June and was cited in letters from chief executives at Google and DropBox as an approved charity.       </p><p>Benevity said it has not yet distributed the funds and planned to offer donors the option to reroute their funds. The company deactivated the foundation's page.</p><p>Barnes declined to share his foundation's earnings with BuzzFeed News, but public tax filings show the group's fundraising has increased with the prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement. Local police had never heard of the organization.</p><p>Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos may be willing to testify in front of Congress as part of an antitrust probe into the tech industry.\u00a0</p><p>A letter sent by Amazon's lawyers Sunday expressed that the company is open to sending Bezos under certain circumstances, Tony Romm reports. The company was formerly resistant to demands from the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an antitrust probe, that Bezos appear to testify. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>\"Of course, we will need to resolve a number of questions regarding timing, format, and outstanding document production issues, all necessarily framed by the extraordinary demands of the global pandemic,\" Amazon lawyers said in the letter obtained The Post. \"In addition, we think it bears emphasizing that other senior executives now run the businesses that are the actual subject of the Committee's investigation.\"\u00a0</p><p>Bezos has never appeared in front of Congress. But he could appear alongside a slate of tech chief executives including Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai if the demands of House lawmakers are met. It's unclear whether the other three companies have agreed to send their chief executives, and they did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The currently unscheduled hearing would cap off a year-long investigation by the committee into anti-competitive practices by tech companies. Meanwhile, European regulators are expected to issue charges against Amazon for using third-party seller data to undermine its competition as soon as this week.</p><p>T-Mobile's network went out yesterday, bumping the company to the top of Twitter's trending list.</p><p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said he wants answers about the outage:\u00a0</p><p>DDoS, which is shorthand for \"denial of service\" attack, also trended after some anonymous hackers took credit for the outages. But it's not exactly clear that's what happened. Matthew Prince, CEO of cybersecurity firm Cloudflare \u00a0and a DDoS expert, explains:</p><p>The Trump administration is preparing a $1 trillion infrastructure package that would set aside funds for 5G wireless and rural broadband.</p><p>The proposal is part of its efforts to revive the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, Bloomberg reports. Trump is scheduled to discuss rural broadband access at a White House event on Thursday.</p><p>             The Trump administration will allow U.S. companies to work with Huawei on 5G standards.\u00a0          </p><p>          Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross signed off on the change, which is essentially a carve-out from a ban on U.S. companies working with the firm that officials have accused of spying for China,\u00a0                       Reuters's Karen Freifeld and David Shepardson report.                    \u00a0       </p><p>          Last year the United States banned U.S. companies from partnering with Huawei. But the rule caused confusion over whether they could participate in international discussions setting technical standards for 5G and Artificial Intelligence with blacklisted companies such as Huawei. That gave Huawei a strong voice in discussions and put the United States at a disadvantage, companies                        and lawmakers                     argued.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"The United States will not cede leadership in global innovation,\" Ross said.       </p><p>The U.S. Transportation Department will launch an online data platform for tech companies and governments to share safety and testing data on autonomous cars.\u00a0</p><p>The effort, meant to shore up public trust in the technology, comes as legislation to regulate the technology continues to stall, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. So far nine companies, including Uber, and eight states have signed onto the voluntary initiative.</p><p>An overwhelming majority of Americans support the removal of false or misleading health information from social media platforms, a new poll finds.</p><p>Similarly, 81 percent of Americans support removing intentionally misleading information on elections or other political issues, a new report from Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight foundation finds.</p><p>             But those opinions clash with Americans' overwhelming support for freedom of expression online. Almost two-thirds of the polled Americans say they support keeping Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that shields tech platforms from liability for content posted to their sites. President Trump and some members of Congress have pushed to change the law.</p><p>Researchers also found that while 8 in 10 Americans don't trust Big Tech to moderate their content, even fewer trust the government to decide what should be removed. Instead, 81 percent of Americans favor the idea of independent content oversight boards - so long as they're diverse and transparent.</p><p>More industry news:</p><p>John Oliver explains the controversy behind facial recognition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-fe590d9ebf124137a7482347893e95a8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604Y-G311-JB4M-V1D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2499\"/><timeReceived>1:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 16, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp;

The venture capitalists only want to see the department\u00a0limit the export of\u00a0technology specific to defense -- not a whole category of technology so broad\u00a0it could include consumer products such as self-driving cars and voice assistants.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"By categorizing only those technologies that have significant defense uses - and not those that merely have broad commercial implications or incidental national security significance - as emerging technologies, the government can ensure the impact on American scientific and technological advancement is minimized while still protecting important national security interests,\"\u00a0NVCA CEO Bobby Franklin said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>The comments highlight a broader issue that's fueling tension between Silicon Valley and the Trump administration. The same technology\u00a0behind products we use everyday\u00a0is increasingly of national security interest.\u00a0AI is powering applications ranging from Netflix recommendations, to your iPhone's Siri voice assistant, to image recognition on social networks and recruiting software.\u00a0</p><p>\"Almost everything is using AI in one way or another,\" said Jeff Farrah, NVCA's general counsel. \"So then is everything subject to export controls?\"\u00a0</p><p>The government's efforts to restrict AI\u00a0could be at odds with Silicon Valley's business interests - especially in China. While artificial intelligence is now a Pentagon priority, it's also the next big thing in Silicon Valley and driving a wave of investment in new companies. Defense officials believe the U.S. is in an artificial intelligence arms race with China, but investors and industry executives are trying to make inroads into\u00a0one of the world's most lucrative markets.</p><p>Unnecessary export controls on AI would create new hurdles for businesses, NCVA\u00a0argues, potentially requiring them to go through lengthy licensing processes when they want to sell new products in other countries or work\u00a0with foreign citizens on research.\u00a0</p><p>What's more, artificial intelligence and quantum computing are evolving so quickly that even many people in the industry haven't reached a consensus on definitions for the technology. Still, the technology industry is very wary of leaving that task up to the government.</p><p>\"There's not a lot of faith from people in the industry that the government will get this right,\" Farrah said.\u00a0</p><p>Though the Trump administration appeared to want to move expediently on this rulemaking when it was announced last year, the government shutdown could derail those plans.</p><p>It's unlikely that the agency\u00a0has the staff and resources to do a substantive review of comments, said Melissa Duffy, a\u00a0partner at the Dechert law firm focused on international trade.\u00a0\"I think the shutdown has surely put a dent in the process and slowed things down,\" Duffy said.\u00a0</p><p>The Commerce Department's request for comment comes during a broader trade spat\u00a0with China and as the United States is using increasingly aggressive tactics to deter theft of intellectual property.\u00a0</p><p>Silicon Valley is already concerned about how the fallout from the trade war will affect\u00a0technology companies' bottom line.\u00a0Apple's decision to slash its quarterly revenue forecast because of a downturn in sales of iPhones in China sent jitters through the industry that a broader recession could be imminent after years of skyrocketing technology stocks.\u00a0</p><p>And\u00a0Silicon Valley investors are concerned that broader U.S. national security efforts are creating too many regulatory hurdles for companies. The Treasury Department has begun piloting a program in which a wider range of foreign investments in U.S. technology companies must undergo a review to ensure they do not pose national security risks. The process, which takes up to 45 days, is at odds with the technology industry's habit of\u00a0moving fast and the speedy pace at which start-ups often burn capital to grow.\u00a0</p><p>Duffy said the pilot program and proposed export controls are intended to work hand-in-hand to prevent foreign adversaries from accessing technology critical to national security. \"They're two different ways of doing the same thing,\" she said. \"They're both intended to make it hard.\"</p><p>             Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Jeff Farrah's title. He has been promoted to general counsel.          </p><p>             BITS: A group of Google employees plans to launch a social media campaign today as part of a push to end forced arbitration to settle workplace disputes in the tech industry, according to Recode's\u00a0Shirin Ghaffary. The group, called\u00a0Googlers for Ending Forced Arbitration, intends\u00a0to share\u00a0facts about forced arbitration on Twitter and testimonies on Instagram throughout the day to educate the public. Even though Google and other tech firms ended forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and assault, \"it's still used and enforced by many tech companies for cases related to other workplace issues like racial or religious discrimination,\" Ghaffary\u00a0reported.          </p><p>Today's planned social media campaign shows that the labor movement in tech is increasingly organizing, according to Wired's Nitasha\u00a0Tiku.\u00a0\"Thus far, most of the action has come from within Google,\" Tiku wrote.\u00a0\"But in December, the anti-arbitration group started soliciting copies of employment contracts from colleagues at Facebook, Uber, and other tech companies, as well as third-party contractors, in order to understand how tech employers convince both workers and contractors to sign arbitration agreements that inhibit their right to bring sexual harassment or discrimination claims in front of a jury.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Justice Department issued a legal\u00a0opinon on Monday that would increase restrictions on online gambling as many states have been easing their limits,\u00a0The Post's Tom Hamburger, Matt Zapotosky and Josh Dawsey reported.\u00a0\u00a0The new opinion will likely be tested in the courts. It would reverse\u00a0an Obama-era opinion that said the Wire Act, a law prohibiting interstate wagering, only applies to sports betting.\u00a0</p><p>The gambling industry was dismayed by the opinion and feared\u00a0it could stifle the growing online gambling industry. But GOP megadonor and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson\u00a0has long sought such a restriction. He and his wife gave Republicans $113 million during the 2016 election cycle. Adelson has argued online gambling could be dangerous for children and invite criminal activity.\u00a0</p><p>\"I am willing to spend whatever it takes,\" Adelson told Forbes in 2013.\u00a0 \"I don't see any compelling reason for the government to allow people to gamble on the Internet and nobody has ever explained except for the two companies whose special interest is going to be served if there is gaming on the Internet, Caesars and MGM.\"</p><p>             BYTES: House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai refused to brief the committee's staff about the disclosure of users'\u00a0location data by wireless carriers. Motherboard reported last week that\u00a0T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&amp;T sold access to their customers' location data to third-party companies.</p><p>\"There's nothing in the law that should stop the Chairman personally from meeting about this serious threat that could allow criminals to track the location of police officers on patrol, victims of domestic abuse, or foreign adversaries to track military personnel on American soil,\"\u00a0Pallone\u00a0said in a statement. \"The Committee will continue to press the FCC to prioritize public safety, national security, and protecting consumers.\"          </p><p>             The FCC said in a statement that it \"has been investigating wireless carriers' handling of location information\" and will resume the probe once the partial government shutdown\u00a0comes to an end, the Hill's Harper Neidig reported.</p><p>Huawei chief executive Ren Zhengfei said on Tuesday that his company hasn't ever spied for the Chinese government - and it never would,according to the Wall Street Journal's Dan Strumpf and Josh Chin.\u00a0\"No law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors,\" Ren Zhengfei told reporters. \"I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests.\"</p><p>Zhengfei made a rare public appearance as the companies' troubles are deepening on the world stage, following the arrest of a Huawei executive in Poland on charges of espionage. \"Mr. Ren didn't say what specifically he would do to resist requests from the Chinese government,\" the Journal reported. \"All companies doing business in China are required by law to hand over customer data to the government in cases that touch on national security. In China, national-security threats are broadly defined and can include speech critical of the Communist Party.\"</p><p>             - Elon Musk's Tesla may\u00a0face some competition from a more than 80-year-old carmaker. Volkswagen plans to invest $800 million in a project to expand a factory in\u00a0Chattanooga, Tenn., to produce electric vehicles, TechCrunch's\u00a0Kirsten Korosec reported. The production\u00a0is set to start in 2022, and the project is\u00a0expected to create 1,000 jobs. Additionally, Volkswagen is building a facility to produce electric vehicles in\u00a0Zwickau, Germany, where production is expected to start in 2019, Korosec\u00a0noted. The company also plans to add\u00a0electric vehicle\u00a0production at facilities in China in 2020 and in Germany by 2022.</p><p>\"VW's Chattanooga expansion is just a piece of the automaker's broader plan to move away from diesel in the wake of the emissions cheating scandal that erupted in 2015,\" according to TechCrunch. \"Globally, VW Group plans to commit almost $50 billion through 2023 toward the development and production of electric vehicles and digital services.\"          </p><p>             - The Giant Food Stores supermarket chain announced that it will add robots named \"Marty\" to its 172 stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, according to The Washington Post's\u00a0Peter Holley. \"The robotic rollout is part of a plan by Giant's parent company, Ahold Delhaize USA, to deploy about 500 robots to stores such as Giant, Martin's and Stop &amp; Shop,\" my colleague wrote. \"The robots will begin arriving 'in waves' over the coming months, according to Giant, which expects to have the devices fully deployed in about six months.\"</p><p>The robot's responsibilities include\u00a0spotting spills and other trip hazards on the store's floor and reporting them to human employees.\u00a0</p><p>             -\u00a0Alphabet's Wing unit as well as the drone-service\u00a0companies AirMap and Kittyhawk\u00a0said they demonstrated a new system to track different kinds of drones, according to the Wall Street Journal's Andy Pasztor. The companies said the system would make it possible to access drones'\u00a0location\u00a0and the identity of drone operators via several electronic devices simultaneously. \"With three of the burgeoning industry's leading companies backing the approach and promising to step up testing, proponents hope to persuade the Federal Aviation Administration to loosen flight restrictions before completion of full-fledged rule making expected to take years,\" the Journal reported.          </p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - A\u00a0technology policy think tank supported by\u00a0Google, Amazon\u00a0and Facebook\u00a0suggested a\u00a0\"grand bargain\" in which Congress would repeal\u00a0federal privacy laws that are specific to certain sectors or issues and replace them with a single federal data privacy law that would preempt state privacy\u00a0legislation, the Verge's\u00a0Makena Kelly reported.\u00a0The think tank, called Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, also advocated for increasing the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to fine firms that run afoul of the data privacy law.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) was unimpressed with the proposal. \"If Big Tech thinks this is a reasonable framework for privacy legislation, they should be embarrassed,\" Blumenthal said, according to Kelly. \"This proposal would protect no one - it is only a grand bargain for the companies who regularly exploit consumer data for private gain and seek to evade transparency and accountability.\" (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) ripping into Facebook at a hearing about the company's plans to launch a cryptocurrency - calling Facebook \"dangerous\" at a Senate Financial Services Committee hearing. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"Now, Facebook may not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they're playing with,\" Brown said. \"Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.\"          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hours later at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) dug into Karan Bhatia, a chief Google lobbyist. He interrogated Bhatia on a host of issues confronting the platform - from its business plans in China to the steps the company has taken to protect children from pedophiles on YouTube.\u00a0</p><p>\"Clearly trust and patience in your company and the behavior of your monopoly has run out,\" Hawley said. \"It has certainly run out with me, and I think it's time for some accountability.\"</p><p>             Tuesday was a bruising day to be a technology company in Washington, as Silicon Valley executives found they had few allies on either side of the aisle as they were grilled on a host of issues. Republicans such as Hawley sounded\u00a0the alarm about Google's business interests in China, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) blasted the search giant for allegedly censoring conservative voices online. Democrats slammed the companies' potential monopoly power and YouTube's failure to remove violent content from its platform. Meanwhile. lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism about Facebook's cryptocurrency plans.\u00a0</p><p>             For all the hand-wringing about greater regulation, there appears to be no consensus among lawmakers\u00a0about a legislative remedy. Yet\u00a0the increased public scrutiny is impacting the tech companies' business decisions. Just look at how Facebook is approaching cryptocurrency and Google is shaping its strategy in China.\u00a0          </p><p>For years, Silicon Valley companies have taken an \"ask for forgiveness, not permission\" approach when it comes to Washington regulators - keeping them at\u00a0arms-length as they develop new products. But the brouhaha over Facebook's plans to launch a digital currency underscores that's no longer possible in an era when Congress is much more closely scrutinizing the tech companies' products. In the case of Project Libra, the scrutiny is mounting months before the project even launches.\u00a0</p><p>             Underscoring that shift, Facebook executive David Marcus repeatedly promised lawmakers yesterday the company would not move forward with plans to launch its Project Libra cryptocurrency until it had complete buy-in from Washington.\u00a0          </p><p>\"Trust has been a very important of the journey for us in the last few years,\" Marcus said in an interview with my colleagues Elizabeth Dwoskin and Damian Paletta. \"We also understand that such a network cannot be controlled by one company and of course not Facebook now.\" He told my colleagues that Facebook would not launch the currency until regulator concerns were addressed - no matter how long that takes.</p><p>Some lawmakers aren't satisfied with those promises and want to ensure guardrails are in place to ensure Facebook doesn't move ahead with Project Libra, my colleague Tony Romm reports.\u00a0The Washington Post obtained a draft bill being circulated by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) to tweak financial regulations in such a way that it would effectively outlaw Project Libra.\u00a0</p><p>             Meanwhile, Facebook isn't the only company that appears to be changing its strategy\u00a0under intense political pressure.\u00a0Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) told Bloomberg Television in an interview yesterday that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai tells him the company has ended some of its partnerships in China.\u00a0</p><p>\"I do think there's some explaining that Google needs to make,\" Warner said in an interview with Emily Chang on \"Bloomberg Technology.\" \"I've met with the Google CEO. He said they are backing out of some of those partnerships, and they're willing to work with the U.S. government.\"</p><p>Warner didn't specify which projects. A spokeswoman for Warner told Bloomberg the senator and Pichai spoke about a \"range of partnerships.\"\u00a0</p><p>Google's relationship with China has been in the political spotlight for the past year. The company has received broad criticism for reportedly working on a censored version of its search engine, known as Project Dragonfly. Bhatia told senators on the Hill yesterday the company had \"terminated\" the controversial project, but he didn't rule out working on tools in China in the future.\u00a0</p><p>The company's work in China faced renewed scrutiny this week after Trump threatened to \"take a look\" at Google for its China ties. The president's tweet followed Peter Thiel's accusations that Google may have committed treason while conducting operations in China, and that it's time for the CIA and FBI to investigate. Thiel offered no specific evidence for these accusations.\u00a0</p><p>\"As we have said before, we do not work with the Chinese military,\" Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:             The European Union competition commission could open a formal investigation into Amazon's business practices as early as this week,\u00a0according to\u00a0Aoife White at Bloomberg News. European regulators would use the probe to dig into claims that \"Amazon may be unfairly using sales data to undercut smaller shops on its Marketplace platform,\" Aoife reports.       </p><p>          Representatives from Amazon and other big tech companies on Tuesday went in front of U.S. lawmakers to answer questions about the competitive nature of their businesses. But E.U. regulators have spent years cracking down on the companies. Apple, Facebook, and Google all face ongoing investigations in the E.U.; the E.U.\u00a0hit Google\u00a0with a record $5 billion antitrust fine last summer.       </p><p>          If a case against Amazon moves forward, it could face similar financial penalties or be ordered to change the way it does business in Europe. The\u00a0E.U. previously fined\u00a0Amazon about $300 million dollars for \"unfair tax advantages\" and pressured the company into\u00a0changing its e-book contracts\u00a0with publishes as a result of two former probes.       </p><p>Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.       </p><p>             NIBBLES: A dozen Democratic lawmakers sent a letter asking the Occupational and Safety Health Administration to launch an investigation into the working conditions at Amazon's warehouses. The request came a day after Amazon workers in Minnesota went on strike to protest unfair and unsafe labor practices by the company.</p><p>Amazon's work environment \"creates a high risk of physical injuries, a risk increased by Amazon's intentional disregard for the health and safety of their employees,\" lawmakers alleged, citing both OSHA data and numerous media reports. In the past five years OSHA has found \"instances of egregious injuries, including fractures and amputations,\" the lawmakers write.</p><p>Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a vocal critic of the company's labor practices, spearheaded the letter. Amazon has repeatedly denied media reports that it has a safety problem at its warehouses.</p><p>\"The allegations outlined in this letter are not an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,\" an Amazon representative\u00a0wrote in a blog post responding to the letter. \"If Rep. Omar and Sen. Sanders really want to help the American worker, they should focus on passing legislation that raises the federal minimum wage - $7.25 is too low.\" Amazon raised its minimum wage last year to $15 an hour after political pressure.\u00a0</p><p>Sanders fired back on Twitter against criticism from Amazon\u00a0that he has yet to visit a warehouse in person.</p><p>OSHA did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Apple plans to invest in exclusive, original podcasts -- escalating its competition with rivals like Spotify and Stitcher,\u00a0Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw and Mark Gurman report.\u00a0</p><p>Apple executives have apporached media companies and their executives to discuss exclusive rights to podcasts, according to Bloomberg. Apple's strategy isn't clearly defined yet, but the company plans to seek out deals it didn't make before.\u00a0</p><p>The Apple Podcast app makes up\u00a050 percent\u00a0to 70 percent\u00a0of listening for most podcasts, according to industry executives. Apple \"all but invented\" podcasting through a network that collects thousands of podcasts from around the web.\u00a0</p><p>The move pits Apple more directly in competition with Spotify.

But the government's top tech\u00a0enforcers pointed the finger right back at lawmakers.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Testifying at\u00a0a House antitrust\u00a0hearing, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons pushed back on\u00a0criticism that the agency's recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over privacy issues didn't go far enough to protect consumers.\u00a0He said the more than 100-year-old agency was not created\u00a0to tackle modern\u00a0privacy challenges, and in the absence of a federal data privacy law, it has far less authority than other global regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"If you want us to do more on the privacy front, then we need help from you,\"\u00a0Simons told lawmakers. \"We've done as much as we can do with the tools we have.\"          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The exchange highlighted the extent to which federal regulators feel hamstrung by outdated antitrust and privacy laws they believe don't give them the tools they need to adequately police the rising power of Big Tech.\u00a0But they probably shouldn't expect Congress to act anytime soon given the House impeachment\u00a0probe and the looming 2020 election, despite the charged rhetoric. Bipartisan momentum seems to have stalled on privacy and antitrust changes are still a long way off.</p><p>House lawmakers are undertaking\u00a0a bipartisan review of competition in Silicon Valley, and they're also\u00a0considering whether Congress should act to further\u00a0empower regulators. Rep. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat leading the panel's investigation, has said his committee is planning to make recommendations in the first part of 2020.</p><p>\"While ultimately it is the responsibility of the antitrust enforcement agency to enforce the law, Congress has an obligation to assess whether existing antitrust laws and competition polices - and the will to enforce those laws and policies - are adequate to address the competition issues facing our country,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the Judiciary Committee chair, said.\u00a0</p><p>Nadler suggested that lawmakers\u00a0could step in by providing regulators with more funding as he raised concerns about budget cuts in recent years despite the increasing complexity of antitrust cases. He slammed the agencies' \"lax merger enforcement\" and raised concerns that big platforms are thwarting smaller startups.\u00a0</p><p>\"Despite mounting evidence of illegal monopolization activities by some of the dominant platforms and numerous cases brought by international law enforcers, U.S. enforcers appear to be paralyzed,\" Nadler said. \"It has been decades since the [Justice] and the [FTC] has brought a significant monopolization case in the tech sector. This is not just a criticism of the current administration.\"</p><p>There are signs the tide could be turning, and Nadler said he was encouraged by recent reports agencies have opened antitrust probes into large technology companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. State attorneys general are also stepping up their oversight, launching their own investigations into Facebook and Google.\u00a0</p><p>Cicilline raised concerns that despite this increased scrutiny, Google is continuing to make major acquisitions, such as its recently announced the $2.1 billion purchase of Fitbit. Citing criticism of the proposed deal from privacy advocates, the Rhode Island Democrat asked regulators whether\u00a0there should be a moratorium on mergers at\u00a0the dominant platforms while the agencies are conducting antitrust reviews.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the top Justice Department official on antitrust issues who testified at the hearing, said there are other more appropriate solutions. He told reporters DOJ\u00a0would need congressional approval to enact such a policy, according to The Hill.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Amazon willingly turns a blind eye to fake products in the name of profit, former executives and outside consultants tell my colleague Jay Greene. The growing counterfeit problem on the site could draw scrutiny from lawmakers looking into the company's potentially anti-competitive practices.</p><p>Amazon stepped up efforts to curb its efforts to address counterfeits two years ago, Jay reports. But when product selection stagnated, the company aggressively added merchants regardless of if\u00a0they were authorized to sell the brands, the former executive told Jay.</p><p>\"Because they are allowing so much onto the site, they can't handle the manual follow up these things require,\" the former executive said. \"It tells me, they just don't want to find it. They want the selection.\"\u00a0Amazon spokeswoman Cecilia Fan disputed the executive's account and said the company goes beyond its \"legal obligations\" to detect fraud. Amazon spends nearly half a billion dollars on fraud detection a year and uses automated technology to detect counterfeits.\u00a0</p><p>While companies can ask for Amazon to take down counterfeits, the onus is on retail brands to invest the manpower to find fakes. That's why some retail groups are pushing for changes to liability laws that would hold Amazon responsible for counterfeits.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a swipe yesterday at the content moderation practices of social media rivals,my colleague Tony Romm reports. Zuckerberg called for regulation that would require social media companies to publish transparency reports about the harmful content they take down.</p><p>\"As a society we don't know how much of this harmful content is out there and which companies are making progress,\" he said. Zuckerberg added that the increase in content removals from previous quarters doesn't mean there is more harmful content on the platform. \"What it says is we're working harder to identify this and take action on it.\"</p><p>That includes ongoing removals of videos of the March shooting of a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. Facebook reports that it had removed 4.5 million pieces of content related to the attack between March 15, the day it occurred, and September 30, nearly all of which it spotted before users reported it. Facebook also highlighted improvements in its use of artificial intelligence in removing hate speech, stating that it detects 80 percent of hate speech before users report it.</p><p>             BYTES: Google will offer checking accounts beginning next year - joining rivals Facebook and Apple in the financial services arena even as regulators scrutinize\u00a0tech companies for potentially anti-competitive behavior,\u00a0my colleagues Greg Bensinger and Renae Merle report. The accounts will potentially give Google even greater insight into users' income, spending habits and other financial data.\u00a0       </p><p>          The program, named Cache, will be run through a partnership with Citigroup and Stanford University's credit union, Greg and Renae report. Tech companies including Square have taken less traditional routes by applying for banking licenses directly but have been met with sharp resistance from the banking industry.\u00a0       </p><p>          Federal regulators and lawmakers have also expressed concern with Big Tech's push into the sector. Rep.

But even though Zuckerberg left the Oval Office unscathed so far by Twitter attacks, he's not out of the woods - or Washington - yet.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, Zuckerberg will meet with House Judiciary Chairman\u00a0Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who leads the House panel conducting a broad antitrust review of Silicon Valley, Tony Romm confirmed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             It could get tense: The panel last week requested a trove of a documents about how Facebook approaches competitors - including company records of Zuckerberg's communications about rivals, like now-shuttered Vine. Cicilline has also been one of Facebook's loudest opponents in Washington, calling on the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0to investigate the company on antitrust grounds in a New York Times op-ed.</p><p>This will be one of the most significant meetings for Zuckerberg on this trip. Antitrust action could present an existential threat to Facebook's future, as lawmakers and regulators question whether Instagram and Whatsapp should be broken off from Facebook. Cicilline's subcommittee, the FTC\u00a0and several state attorneys general are\u00a0all probing\u00a0Facebook's power.\u00a0</p><p>             Zuckerberg has had to address host of political issues\u00a0over the last 18 months, including election security, privacy, the company's cryptocurrency plans and accusations of anti-conservative bias. Though lawmakers\u00a0 praised Zuckerberg for taking the time to engage in Washington, it's unlikely a few days of meetings will relieve the pressure\u00a0piling on the company over the last three years.          </p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) dined with Zuckerberg and a group of senators on Wednesday night, and he said Zuckerberg was very receptive and engaged while discussing issues including privacy legislation.</p><p>\"I welcome his engagement with us, it gives us an opportunity to better understand his positions and perspectives, but it certainly no way diminishes my concerns about privacy and antitrust in Big Tech,\" he told Tony in an interview.</p><p>Trump tweeted he had a \"nice meeting\" with the tech titan, even including a link to a Facebook post with a photo of the pair cordially shaking hands. That image stands in stark relief from some of Trump's previous comments about Facebook, such as when he said the social network is \"on the side of the Radical Left Democrats.\" From Twitter:</p><p>But based on Trump's track record with other tech chief executives, it's unlikely the president's jabs at Facebook will stop just because of one meeting with its top executive.\u00a0Trump's\u00a0infamous \"Social Media Summit\" that was essentially a roast of Big Tech took place after he had a\u00a0meeting\u00a0with Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and one that \"ended very well\" with\u00a0Google chief executive Sundar Pichai.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook confirmed the\u00a0session with Trump, telling reporters Zuckerberg had a \"good, constructive\" meeting at the White House. White House aide Jared Kushner and social media director Dan Scavino also attended, according to a report from Bloomberg.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said he had a frank discussion with Zuckerberg, where he vocalized his well-known concerns about Facebook's market concentration and data practices. Hawley challenged Zuckerberg to prove he was serious about privacy and not afraid of competition by selling off the messaging app WhatsApp and Instagram. He also discussed allegations of anti-conservative bias, and he called for Facebook to submit to an independent, third-party audit on political bias.</p><p>             \"There's a lot of words that emanate from Facebook,\" Hawley told reporters on Capitol Hill yesterday. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action. I think they could start by doing some of the things I suggested he do today.\"          </p><p>Get ready for another day of chasing Zuckerberg through the halls of Congress. In addition to meeting with House Judiciary Democrats\u00a0\u00a0Zuckerberg is also expected to huddle with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Greg Walden (R-Ore.), for a discussion about privacy, Tony confirms.\u00a0</p><p>From Politico's Cristiano Lima:</p><p>The photo of Trump shaking Zuckerberg's hand quickly turned into a caption contest on Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>From my colleague Drew Harwell:\u00a0</p><p>And my colleague Hamza Shaban:</p><p>And Twitter user 13 million made a joke about Trump's preferred social network:\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Workers at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are today expected to walk out in protest of their employers' carbon footprints as\u00a0part of a global climate strike. But even before the strikes begin, it seems like months of employee activism may be paying off at Amazon and Google.          </p><p>Amazon workers won a small victory yesterday when CEO Jeff Bezos announced\u00a0the company would sign a pact it drafted to\u00a0meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement 10 years early, my colleagues Rachel Siegel and Jay Greene report. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Amazon Employees for Climate Justice called the news \"a huge step forward,\" but said that the effort still doesn't go far enough. Workers still want the company to address additional concerns including its support of the fossil fuel industry and the\u00a0carbon footprint of its supply chain. Environmental activists have also called out Amazon for failing to meet its commitment to power its Virginia data centers with 100 percent renewable energy.</p><p>Google also made a splash yesterday when it announced the purchase of a blockbuster 18 new energy package\u00a0increasing\u00a0its renewable energy ownership by 40 percent - a move the company is calling the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.</p><p>Meanwhile at Microsoft, workers are contesting a recent decision by the company to partner with oil companies to \"accelerate creation of innovative petrotechnical and digital technologies,\" Brian Merchant at Gizmodo reports. A group of employees wrote a letter yesterday slamming the company for making them \"complicit\" in the climate crisis.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook employees will also be walking out today. Tumblr, Kickstarter, and WordPress will participate in digital efforts to spread awareness about the Global Climate Strike through banner ads and site shutdowns.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Apple is putting a greater emphasis on privacy with its newest operating system as lawmakers step up their scrutiny of Silicon Valley's privacy practices. With iOS 13,\u00a0users will receive pop-up notices every time an app seeks their location data, my colleague Heather Kelly reports. Apple also now requires apps to provide notice as to why they're requesting the data.</p><p>The feature is an important step to building user trust and placating lawmakers after growing criticism that the company mishandles user data. But as NBC News's David Ingram points out, it's also a way for the tech giant to stick it to competitors. Users with access to the new features have shared images of notifications that Facebook and Google - both Apple competitors that have launched their own privacy forgiveness tours in recent months - are seeking location data for unclear reasons, David reports.</p><p>While the feature could give users greater awareness of just how much apps are collecting about them - even when they sleep - privacy experts are skeptical. \"This is a step in the right direction, but it's still putting a lot of onus on users to understand and manage confusing settings,\" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and tech policy for Consumer Reports, told David. \"Many people just reflexively press 'okay' when prompted because they just want things to work.\"</p><p>             BYTES: While Mark Zuckerberg took meetings on the Hill yesterday, some members of Congress took action to make sure their colleagues could actually make sense of his company and a host of other technological challenges the United States faces. A bipartisan group of members of Congress, including Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) introduced legislation yesterday to fund the Office of Technology Assessment, a congressional office that has lain dormant for more than two decades.</p><p>\"A revised and reformed Office of Technology Assessment will play a crucial role in helping Congress tackle issues as diverse as data privacy, energy independence, and American innovation and entrepreneurship,\" Tillis said in a statement. \"This bicameral, bipartisan legislation will give Congress the tools, resources, and policy expertise it needs to address the most pressing technological issues facing our country.\"As my colleague Tony Romm reported last year, Takano and a handful of other lawmakers have increased efforts to revive the office in light of digital attacks on the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and mounting technological challenges beyond the expertise of most members of Congress - and their staffs.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming soon          </p><p>License plate scanners were once a law enforcement tool.

They both became vital work tools. We hunt with them, they give us access to new types of food, they provide signals and direction, and they facilitate all manner of night time activity which was previously impossible. </p><p>It isn't a stretch to imagine our ancestors walked around with a lit torch in their hands for most of their waking hours. There seems to be an eerie similarity with fire and our lithium ion-powered, handheld digital torches. They both have life-changing power and utility, but unless we learn quickly of their dangers, I fear we're going to get burnt. The problem, as I see it, is that we are allowing the technology to control us, instead of us being in charge. We haven't learned when to put it down, or out, and to let it serve us. It seems at this point we are serving it - and it is the technology companies who power the fire. I was speaking at a conference just last week when a question from the audience was, 'Do you think there will be a new technology which will help us put down the technology and get on with a little bit of humanity?' And this was my answer: 'We already have that technology - it's called self-discipline. We can choose to switch off and 'go dark' and if it is that our boss, industry or family expects us to be connected at all times, then it might just be a matter of communicating when we won't be available. Sure, there might be an emergency - but we all know there probably won't be. Besides we still catch those long flights when emergencies could happen It's really just a choice.' But in all honesty, I do think we need more regulation around digital technology and its use. At the moment technology is spreading like a wildfire which we do not have under control, and the few organizations with the power to bring it under control (our Governments and the big tech companies) are happy to let it burn - even thought it might hollow out important parts of our homes and maybe our civilisations. Humans have sadly proven again and again that we'll misuse technology unless guardrails are put in place to protect us, by those who know and care enough about the dangers. It's easy to forget that workplace health and safety didn't exist for most of the industrial revolution. We forget that road rules and safety features on cars didn't just magically appear and that air travel was reserved for crazy risk takers early last century. We may even be able to convince ourselves that the examples above are vastly different - that this time the technology is just information and can't possibly harm people the way cars and dangerous machines can. I like to think of it this way: everything physical is informational first. We must first conceive, design and communicate all physical things informationally we make before they come into being. We must also remember that anything technology companies do, happens at scale. They don't just effect a cohort of buyers or an isolated market. But it's not just the technology itself - the size and power of these firms is worth pondering.Consider the fact that the top 5 tech companies (Alphabet / Amazon / Apple / Facebook / Microsoft) now have a collective market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion. That's more than $1,000 for every person single connected to the internet.It's also more than 15% of the entire US stock market value which tracks over 3,000 corporations. Every now and again capitalism is put at risk by winner takes all technology. This is whyStandard Oil[1]andAT...]were split up into a bunch of smaller firms. It's time to tame big tech and regulate - they need to be responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of their products. And if you think regulation is bad for the economy - just remember that next time you board a plane, strap on your seatbelt or have more than one choice of product at a shelf.

Photo: Getty Images</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech companies, researchers, and regulators have their work cut out for them in the next decade. From regaining the public's trust and addressing the privacy crisis, to making digital coins viable, below are 10 of the most pressing challenges faced by the global tech industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Restoring public trust</p><p>Over the past 10 years, the public perception of tech companies has been turned upside down. From perceived saviors of society, offering freedom and efficiency, they have become despised corporates harnessing human weakness for a profit. The new decade is tech companies' chance to restore their image, which is crucial because, without the public's trust, they will find it much more difficult to operate. To start, they will be more heavily scrutinized under severe regulations that may hinder innovation. Recruiting talent will become a greater challenge, with quality employees moving toward less divisive industries. So, how can tech companies rehabilitate their image? Unfortunately, a well-funded ad campaign is not going to cut it. Tech companies will have to start implementing deep changes to the very fundamentals of their conduct. The next section is a good place to start.</p><p>Resolving the privacy crisis</p><p>If I were to ask readers what aspect of the activity of large tech companies and service providers they find most disturbing, the answer is likely to be privacy concerns. Companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Twitter, have turned infringing on users' privacy into a business model. To make money, they have to gather as much detailed information on users as possible in order to better target them for ads. One of the main problems here is that, as learned from the infamous Cambridge Analytica case, it is very difficult to keep this type of data from leaking and being misused. If companies truly want to regain the public's trust, they must establish new business models that are not rooted in massive privacy infringements.</p><p>Fighting off fake news and bot networks</p><p>Many years, if not decades, will pass before we can assess and appreciate the full extent of the misuse of social networks to affect politics and election campaigns. At the dawn of the new decade, tech companies must give their all to nip at the bud the phenomena of political intervention using fake news-spreading bot networks on social media. With the upcoming U.S. presidential election this year, Google, Facebook, and Twitter will face their biggest challenge since 2016. They better not fail.</p><p>Turning autonomous vehicles into a reality</p><p>Around halfway into the last decade, autonomous vehicles emerged as the main promise of the 2020s. As years went by, it became clear that the technological challenges may be too substantial to allow for widespread use in the foreseeable future. However, autonomous cars are already here and are even being used commercially at a very limited and experimental capacity. The challenges are not insurmountable and autonomous vehicles are crucial. Extensive use can help address an array of issues, from reducing the number of traffic fatalities, through easing congestion, to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.</p><p>Addressing the gig-economy elephant in the room</p><p>The gig-economy is responsible for some of the most devastating changes in the global job market, creating a new working class that gets the worst of both freelance and employed work\u2014it has almost none of the social benefits of employment, but also none of the freedom that comes with being your own boss. Should the current trend continue, gig economy services are likely to expand into new fields in the future, including professions requiring high skills.</p><p>Companies and especially legislators must pony up and address the issue to prevent the new status quo of underprivileged gig-economy workers from becoming the new standard. Last year, California took a first step, passing a controversial bill that would require companies like Uber and Lyft, for example, to treat their drivers as regular employees. This is not necessarily a fix-all solution, but it is a step in the right direction. This is true in Israel as well, where companies whose business model is based on gig economy employees\u2014such as on-demand food delivery company Wolt Enterprises Oy and electric scooter-sharing companies Bird Rides Inc. and Lime\u2014are expanding fast.</p><p>Cracking the VR and AR markets</p><p>One thing the past decade didn't give us is a new hardware device to disrupt the market. In 2007, the iPhone did just that, starting the smartphone revolution. There have been some notable devices\u2014the iPad in 2010, the Samsung Galaxy Note in 2011, and the Apple Watch in 2015\u2014but not one of them was a catalyst for a significant technological and cultural revolution. If there is a family of products that could be the iPhone of the next few years it would be virtual reality headsets or augmented reality glasses. In the past decade, we have seen some brave efforts in the field, including Google Glass, Facebook's Oculus Rift, Microsoft HoloLens, and Magic Leap Inc.'s AR glasses, but none of them really took off, and some even failed gloriously.</p><p>AR and VR have the potential to give birth to a revolutionary device that transforms the ways in which we communicate with each other and with our immediate and online surroundings, but no company has yet managed to create it. Quite a few players are investing a lot in this field, with Apple being most prominent, and making a viable product will be among their main challenges.</p><p>Eliminating AI's inherent bias</p><p>Artificial intelligence is already widely used, from the algorithm determining what content is displayed on your Facebook feed to biometric identification systems. Its use is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, despite some justified concern. Most important to resolve is AI systems' tendency to internalize human biases. One example is identification systems' propensity to misidentifying anyone other than white men. This and other types of bias will have an ill effect on the lives of minorities worldwide, and fixing it should be a top priority over the next decade.</p><p>One possible solution could also help resolve another tech industry malady\u2014lack of gender and ethnic diversity in the workforce. Research shows that some of the reasons AI systems are so bad at correctly identifying women and people of color have to do with the fact that the technology is being developed by teams consisting mostly of white men.</p><p>Upgrading old telecommunications infrastructure</p><p>Towards the end of 2019, several countries began deploying fifth-generation (5G) cellular infrastructure. Some countries also have optical fiber infrastructure. But both these technologies have yet to become widespread. Ultra-fast internet infrastructure is a vital component of future services such as autonomous vehicles, AR and VR, smart city systems, and IoT devices. The burden here does not fall on tech companies but on cities and countries that need this infrastructure to step into the future, instead of getting stuck in the past.</p><p>Making crypto coins mainstream</p><p>As of today, 12 years after the launch of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies remain an almost exclusively speculative tool. The technology that was meant to turn economics on its head couldn't even become a payment method at Starbucks. This technology has the potential to create a more flexible financial system, one in which people that do not have a bank account could still use free, quick, and advanced banking and money transfer services. However, a viable solution that will help it reach its potential and become widely implemented has yet to surface. The most significant attempt at this, Facebook's Libra, was met by a wall of legislators and regulators, as a result of the aforementioned mistrust in big tech companies. But the potential is still there, you just need the right company with the right solution to realize it.</p><p>Facing the climate crisis</p><p>Tech companies' part in exacerbating the environmental crisis may be small but they can still have a major role in solving it. Sectors like energy, transportation, and agriculture are all much bigger polluters, even though the fast growth in the e-commerce sector has taken its toll through the carbon footprint of online deliveries. Climate change is not at the heart of big tech companies' business models, but companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon, employ some of the most creative minds in the world and have giant research and development budgets, some of which can be allocated towards making the world greener. The climate crisis is, without a doubt, the most crucial challenge to be faced by humanity, and this includes tech companies.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/21/157837410117.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/21/157837410117.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-163931067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-HGC1-F11P-X21V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Yerepouni Daily News.

The weakened ratio of both sectors reflects a softening in investors' growth outlook.The recent sell-off in tech stocks suggests investors are thinking about growth differently. The returns of the S...00's technology sector have more than doubled the benchmark index's over the past year. In contrast, utilities \u2014 a defensive sector that investors like for its indifference to the economic cycle and regular dividend payments \u2014 fell nearly 3% over the same period. A ratio of both sectors now shows a reversal that hasn't been this sharp in years. The ratio of tech versus utilities stocks is a metric tracked by Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He told Bloomberg last week[1] that the ratio's rollover resembled the pattern seen as the dot-com bubble expanded in the late 1990s. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/this-chart-shows-worrying-dot-com-bust-deja-vu-for-james-paulsenPaulsen\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/this-chart-shows-worrying-dot-com-bust-deja-vu-for-james-paulsenPaulsen</url> observed that trading behavior was repeating itself \u2014 investors were flocking to all the popular tech stocks while shunning \"conservative alternatives\" like utilities. But that has recently switched amid a slew of news that has given investors worry about big tech companies. Notably, regulators are scrutinizing Facebook's use of private data on its platform, while Tesla's getting slammed after a downgrade from Moody's[2] and an investigation into a fatal crash involving one of its cars. Put differently, the popular momentum strategy[3] of chasing market winners on the way up has slowly started to unravel.Right on cue, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's March fund-manager survey released last week found that investors were \"stubbornly long\" global stocks, banks, and tech stocks while betting against bonds and defensives. They also said that the most crowded trade was \"long FAANG + BAT\" \u2014 betting on the growth of the largest US and Chinese tech companies (FAANG is Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, while BAT refers to Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent). Many of these funds have seen their favorite stocks[4], such as Facebook[5] and Amazon[6], get burned. Here's David Rosenberg, Gluskin Sheff's chief economist, writing on Tuesday's market action after the New York Stock Exchange's FANG+ Index suffered its largest one-day drop[7] (emphasis ours): \"The sector rotation also is very fascinating.

The weakened ratio of both sectors reflects a softening in investors' growth outlook.The recent sell-off in tech stocks suggests that investors are thinking about growth differently. The returns of the S...00's technology sector have more than doubled the benchmark index's over the past year. In contrast, utilities, a defensive sector that investors like for its indifference to the economic cycle and regular dividend payments, fell nearly 3% over the same period. A ratio of both sectors now showsa reversal that's not been this sharp in years. The ratio of tech versus utilities stocks is a metric that's tracked by Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He told Bloomberg[1] last week that the ratio's rollover resembled the pattern seen as the dotcom bubble expanded in the late 1990s.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/this-chart-shows-worrying-dot-com-bust-deja-vu-for-james-paulsenPaulsen\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/this-chart-shows-worrying-dot-com-bust-deja-vu-for-james-paulsenPaulsen</url> observed that trading behavior was repeating itself: investors were flocking to all the popular tech stocks while shunning \"conservative alternatives\" like utilities. But that's recently switched, amid a slew of news that's given investors worry about big tech companies.Notably, regulators are scrutinizing Facebook for how the private data on its platform is used, while Tesla's getting slammed after a downgrade from Moody's[2] and an investigation into a fatal crash involving one of its cars. Put differently, the popularmomentum strategy[3] of chasing market winners on the way up slowly started to unravel.Right on cue, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's March fund-manager survey released last week Tuesday showed investors were \"stubbornly long\" global stocks, banks, and tech stocks while betting against bonds and defensives. Also, they said \"long FAANG + BAT\" \u2014 betting on the growth of the largest American and Chinese tech companies \u2014 was the most crowded trade. Many of these funds have seen their favorite stocks[4] such as Facebook[5] and Amazon[6] get burned. Here's David Rosenberg, Gluskin Sheff's chief economist, writing on Tuesday's market action (emphasis ours), after the NYSE's FANG+ Index suffered its largest one-day drop[7] ever: \"The sector rotation also is very fascinating. Growth stocks are now rolling over in a material way and the forced selling out of ETFs will compound the situation. The FAANG stocks are really getting hit, as are the once high-flying semiconductor stocks. All in, the S...00 Tech sector got clobbered yesterday, the Financials slid 2% and Consumer Discretionary dropped 1.9%. But not only did the uber-defensives outperform, but were positive on an otherwise brutal day! The Utilities soared 1.5%. Telecom rallied 0.5%. And Staples eked out a a 0.1% gain. Utility stocks outperformed Transports by an incredible 320 basis points \u2014 in a clear sign that the stock market is downgrading its growth outlook. Small Caps sagged 2%. Not encouraging signposts for those trading the market from the bullish side.\"NOW WATCH: Neo-Nazi groups let a journalist in their meetings and rallies \u2014 here's what he saw[8]See Also:

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.</p><p>That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.</p><p>By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.</p><p>But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech.

What's exciting the science historian at the moment is nanotechnology and the ability to move atoms and molecules around that \u201cwill change absolutely everything\u00a0for everybody everywhere\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The machine that will change our future, he says, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://singularityhub.com/2017/12/25/the-nanofabricator-how-a-machine-that-can-make-anything-would-change-everything/\"> a nanofabricator </url>sitting in everyone's home, which can shape molecules to make anything instantly, from any food and liquid\u00a0to clothing, construction materials, electronics or even a gold bar.

Meanwhile,\u00a0 Google is investing \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d in\u00a0a joint venture with a British local newspaper\u00a0publisher, its first such project outside the US. Project Neon\u00a0will set up digital news sites in three\u00a0regions that will experiment with \u201cdifferent commercial approaches\u201d such as building direct relationships with local businesses with the aim of attracting both advertising and philanthropy.<br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Airbnb to IPO in 2020</emphasis><br/>The accommodation platform has been more cautious than its peers in pursuing an IPO, but Airbnb now says\u00a0it plans to go public next year, without offering any further details. It was\u00a0valued at $31bn in its most recent funding round and made more than $1bn in revenues in the second quarter.

Taking the temperature of the tech cold war</emphasis><br/>Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, has told the FT that the technology of the future will be built by American, European and Chinese\u00a0providers \u2014 rejecting the idea of a \u201cdecoupling\u201d or separation between the western and Chinese digital economies. He was also optimistic about the prospects for an\u00a0agreement to resolve trade tensions.

Tech of the Town    SEPTEMBER IN THE TECH WORLD \u2014 It\u2019s going to be a big month for the world\u2019s most powerful social media and software giants. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on tap:   \u2014 For Congress: House Energy and Commerce lawmakers will consider a range of tech and telecom proposals at a full committee markup Wednesday. Those include Rep. G.K. Butterfield 's (D-N.C.) Expanding Broadcast Ownership Opportunities Act, H.R. 3957 (116) , a Democratic bill that would review the FCC's minority tax certificate program and help foster more media diversity. Also on the docket? Bipartisan legislation from Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), H.R. 8132 (116) , aimed at securing American leadership ( and a leg-up on China ) in emerging technologies from artificial intelligence to quantum computing.   \u2014 For competition: The Trump administration is, as early as this month , expected to file its planned antitrust lawsuit against Google. The Justice Department and attorneys general from almost every state have been laying the groundwork for the suit for a year and had anticipated the filing itself to happen over the summer \u2014 but those plans were delayed amid partisan headwinds.   \u201cDisagreements between the department and mostly Democratic AGs are holding up the launch of what would be the biggest antitrust battle in a generation,\u201d writes POLITICO\u2019s antitrust reporter, Leah Nylen . One point of contention, she notes, \u201cis whether to push to file the suit before Election Day \u2014 assuring it as a legacy for Attorney General William Barr \u2014 or risk leaving the case's future in the hands of a Biden administration.\u201d The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is separately holding a Sept. 15 hearing examining whether Google has harmed competition in online advertising.   \u2014 Also for competition: Apple and Epic Games are set to face off in court on Sept. 28 over their Fortnite dispute. (Fortnite, the wildly popular game by Epic, is still blocked from Apple\u2019s App Store.) The game creator plans to re-up its request to have Fortnite reinstated in the App Store at the hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Epic late Friday filed its official brief for the session. More here from Leah on Apple and Epic\u2019s antitrust showdown.   One more on the topic: The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee plans to hold a Sept. 30 hearing on oversight of the enforcement of antitrust laws, featuring testimony from FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim.   \u2014 For TikTok: The deadline for an American company to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations is fast approaching. Oracle, Microsoft and Walmart remain in the running ahead of the Sept. 15 deal due date set by the Trump administration. \u201cLet the best company win,\u201d the president's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told POLITICO before the holiday.   \u2014 For Europe: Here are five things to watch this fall in European tech policy, from digital trade and cybersecurity to artificial intelligence.   BACK-TO-WORK CLIFFSNOTES: WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE HOLIDAY WEEK? \u2014 Here\u2019s what you might\u2019ve missed while you were (hopefully) unplugged.   \u2014 Microsoft: The Pentagon said Friday that Microsoft remains its top choice for the highly lucrative JEDI cloud computing contract, \u201crejecting allegations by rival Amazon that the award came about through political meddling by President Donald Trump.\u201d More from Steven .   \u2014 Facebook: The social network announced it will ban new political ads during the week before Election Day. More from Steven .   \u2014 Twitter: The platform, along with Facebook, moved to limit the reach of President Trump\u2019s recent statements encouraging supporters to cast two ballots in November. More from Cristiano .   \u2014 Apple: The company \u201cagreed to delay implementing a change to the iPhone that Facebook, news publishers and some other mobile apps said would significantly decrease the amount of money they can earn from advertising.\u201d More from Leah .   \u2014  Verizon: The telecom giant was the biggest winning bidder in the FCC\u2019s auction of 5G-friendly 3.5 GHz airwaves. More from John .   OUT TODAY: A NEW TAKE ON SECTION 230 \u2014 Congress should create a new digital regulatory agency to oversee the tech industry\u2019s online liability protections under Section 230, according to a report out today from New York University . The paper, written by law professor Paul Barrett, argues for keeping but significantly revamping the law that shields online business from lawsuits over user content, which has come under fire from officials of all political stripes in Washington.   \u2014 A new look law: The report calls for requiring platforms to take on \u201ca range of new responsibilities related to policing content\u201d to keep their Section 230 protections, including demonstrating that their algorithms don\u2019t skew towards extreme content, publicly disclosing their moderation policies and removing \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d material. \u201cOne of the central problems I think we now experience with social media is the fact that the algorithms that are used to select [and]  recommend content for users have a tendency to emphasize sensationalistic, unreliable [or] extreme material,\u201d Barrett told MT in an interview Friday.   \u2014 A fresh federal agency: Under the framework, a new digital regulatory agency led by a bipartisan group of Senate-appointed officials would enforce those standards. \u201cThe idea is not that the government is going to rule \u2018yay or nay\u2019 on each content decision, but instead would oversee whether companies themselves implement policies that would be favorable to users and society at large,\u201d Barrett said. The agency could also take on a broader mandate and tackle issues like privacy and competition, he noted \u2014 but the report focuses on Section 230.   \u2014 So what\u2019s the appetite on Capitol Hill? The NYU report notes that some aspects of the proposal have already been incorporated into ongoing efforts to reform Section 230 \u2014 and Barrett said he\u2019s already spoken to \u201ca number of congressional offices\u201d about these ideas. (Two House Democrats have separately proposed creating an agency to tackle online privacy.) But, Barrett added, the \u201cmore ambitious approach\u201d of creating an agency to oversee Section 230 \u201cis not particularly on anybody\u2019s radar right now.\u201d      Competition Corner    BOOK LOOK: \u2018COMPETITION IS KILLING US\u2019  \u2014 Climate change, worker exploitation and growing income disparity are the result of antitrust authorities\u2019 failure to check corporate power. That\u2019s the thesis of competition lawyer Michelle Meager\u2019s new book , slated for release this week, which examines how a few companies control key industries \u2014 like agriculture, energy and technology \u2014 and leverage their economic power in ways that harm workers and the environment.   \u201cCompanies make money today by cornering a market, getting a monopoly position and shifting the costs onto society,\u201d she said. In an interview with MT, Meager spoke about how to use antitrust and other regulatory tools to counter corporate power.   \u2014 On break-ups : \u201cIf companies repeatedly breach the public interest, they should be shut down. It would really concentrate the minds of lots of companies if we didn\u2019t take it as a right that they could exist forever. \u2026 Currently the model is to keep going until they are forced to stop.\u201d   \u2014  On creating \u2018countervailing power\u2019 : \u201cYou can give antitrust exemptions and encourage cooperation among smaller players in the market. We need to think about how we can create other platforms or mechanisms to counter corporate power. For citizens and consumers, how do we give them more power?\u201d   \u2014  On July\u2019s blockbuster hearing with the Big Tech CEOs : \u201cThese four human beings have an enormous amount of power and it\u2019s staggering how out of touch they are to some of the issues. It was as if they were hearing some of this for the first time. It just isn\u2019t a daily concern for them.\u201d          Transitions    John Stratton , a former longtime Verizon executive who this spring became a board observer at Frontier Communications, was selected to serve as executive chairman of Frontier\u2019s board of directors upon the company\u2019s emergence from Chapter 11, expected in 2021. \u2026 Christine Fox , former deputy executive director of the State Educational Technology Directors Association, was named the organization\u2019s interim executive director following the passing of Candice Dodson . \u2026 Richard Carrizzo , fire chief for the Southern Platte Fire Protection District in Missouri, was named vice chair of the board of the First Responder Network Authority.   Ch-ch-changes for the FCC\u2019s data team , within its Office of Economics and Analytics: Steve Rosenberg was named the agency\u2019s chief data and analytics officer; Anne Levine , deputy chief data officer; and Chelsea Fallon , chief of the data division.

For one, he predicted the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.45%[1] would rally 25%. It gained 22%. He said Brazil's equity market would come alive. The Bovespa BVSP, -0.70%[2] surged 34%. He said the S...00 SPX, +0.35%[3] would rally 15%. It easily outperformed that. Not bad. </p><p>'The most positive factor was the accommodative monetary policy provided by the U.S. and other countries, which had a favorable impact on the economy and the financial markets,' the company explained in retrospect.  And Wien, with the help of Blackstone BX, -0.18%[4] strategist Joe Zidle, neared perfection with this call: 'Growth stocks continue to provide leadership in the U.S. equity market. Technology and biotech do well as a result of continued strong earnings. Value stocks other than energy-related businesses disappoint because of the slowing economy.' So what's his take on where the market is going in 2020? 'Even though some observers believe valuations are stretched, a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the Standard and Poor's 500 above 3,500 at some point during the year,' he wrote. 'Earnings only increase 5%, and S...00 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly.' But it won't be an easy cruise higher. Wien said he expects 'several market corrections' of at least 5% in the coming year. Much of the pain, he predicts, will be felt by the FAANG stocks, long the leaders of this bull market. 'Big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback,' he said, adding that government efforts to regulate companies like Apple AAPL, +0.80%[5] , Microsoft MSFT, +0.26%[6] and IBMIBM, -0.18%[7] will be more successful than in the past because they will have widespread support from the American people. 'A millennial in New York City puts their phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non-threatening and refreshing,' Wien wrote.

Antitrust laws protect consumers by promoting fair competition and preventing businesses from taking over or manipulating a market. In the digital world, companies can use the vast amount of data shared and leverage its value for competition purposes, which then raises concerns about antitrust violations. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) have been looking into big tech's influence on competition for quite some time, particularly narrowing in on search engines, social media, and retail markets. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, how these companies are treating consumer privacy through data collection and distribution is a huge focus. The FTC's most recent probe reviewed acquisitions that several big tech giants made of smaller organizations in the last nine years.Both U.S. agencies are reviewing the situation and seeking ways to change antitrust policies to regulate big tech more tightly. Potential changes could include increasing FTC regulations on mergers and price fixing. However, there is currently nothing concrete in the works and the DOJ seems to want to avoid any major renovation of antitrust laws. The only thing that is certain is that the FTC plans to issue new guidelines on digital platform enforcements and horizontal mergers. What Actions Are Other Authorities Taking? Since other countries across the globe have started to speak out more forcefully about antitrust issues in the technology industry, many countries plan to rework their anti-competition laws and policies to account for big tech's dominant effect on data and the larger market. Some have even formally proposed changes. The primary areas of concerns that regulators are seeking to address is that tech giants will (1) gain so much power that they control big data, (2) implement anti-competition algorithms, and (3) restrict competitors through unfair terms and/or mergers. Below are a few examples of global reactions to the impending antitrust crisis in the tech industry. The European Union The EU has already used enforcement powers under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to police tech companies over consumer privacy issues. Now, the EU is taking swift action to combat competitive behavior. Germany has proposed amendments to the country's antitrust laws that would more firmly regulate big tech and focus on any business practices that would give them control over a significant amount of data. For example, the new law could prohibit a company from blocking data access to a market competitor. They are awaiting approval and, if all goes well, hope to implement the amendments later this year. Other EU member countries are making similar moves. Australia and China Australia is creating a committee specifically designed to monitor and review advertising that big tech companies use that could be deemed anti-competitive behavior.Additionally, China recently proposed changes to their Anti-Monopoly Law. These changes include increasing fines if companies act inappropriately during a merger or fail to implement binding anti-competitive agreements. What to Expect In 2020 And Beyond So, what does this all mean for big tech and antitrust issues? First, it is important to remember that matters like this can take time, even when it seems like a global crisis. History demonstrates that some countries move faster than others do when it comes to responding to regulatory issues and implementing new laws. For example, the U.S. has been contemplating a comprehensive federal privacy law for years and has yet to draft one. The DOJ has expressed this is still the way they wish to regulate big tech, so there will likely not be a big antitrust overhaul in the states like there will probably be in other countries. For now, the biggest change in the U.S. will be how the FTC investigates and levies penalties for violations. Differing Laws and Policies Regardless, the global uproar about big tech and antitrust violations will have both short-term and long-term effects. Similar to recent privacy upsets, the biggest issue will be that there is no global uniformity. Even though everyone wants to address the same behavior, each country's legal system operates differently. They will have different laws or policies that regulate the same conduct yet vary in execution. The differences in policymaking are what makes global data regulation so tricky and keeps big tech on their toes. Also, the fear that lack of uniformity will allow tech giants to continue to get away with anti-competitive actions remains present. One additional worry is that companies may pull business from nations where they think antitrust regulation is too restricting. Data Privacy The rise in big tech has also placed international data privacy in the realm of antitrust enforcement. There will be more overlap between privacy and antitrust than ever before. Privacy concerns will continue to intensify as the presence and growth of tech giants threaten market dominance. It is crucial for organizations to utilize providers that have sufficient privacy safeguards in place because of increased privacy regulations and the threat of data breaches, companies can use this to their advantage. For example, tech companies can cite consumer privacy protection as a reason not to share data with a competitor and, as a result, continue to gain advantage in the market.In the modern era, almost everyone needs access to data and the latest technology for both business and personal reasons. Because of this, individuals may continue to use certain services even if privacy is compromised. When a provider dominates the market, it has the ability to skimp on privacy protections and users will have no comparable competitors available. All of this makes policing big tech extremely difficult, as regulators have to balance privacy and competition issues. Deciding which issue should have more weight seems like an impossible task. Data Collection Global antitrust policy changes will also affect many other markets, including the legal industry. Access to data is necessary for eDiscovery compliance. Law departments must ensure they utilize providers who have a global presence. Provide must have key capabilities like the capacity to collect data anywhere in the world and distinguish between several languages. However, there may be some roadblocks to international data collection as policies change. If companies pull their business from certain countries due to tighter regulations, it will be more difficult to collect data from that provider if it originated in that country prior to the change. An action like this invokes data preservation concerns and can greatly disrupt the litigation process.Additionally, litigation and enforcement actions about data privacy may increase. If a company is not allowed to shield data from competitors because it would face antitrust violations, consumer privacy may be at risk and could then increase privacy actions or trigger a decline in business. On the other side, if a company cites consumer privacy as a reason not to disclose data to a competitor and that data becomes subject to litigation, this would interfere with collection. All of this shows that regulators will need to work towards finding a balance between privacy and antitrust issues if they want to regulate big tech successfully.[View source.[1]] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epiqglobal.com/en-us/thinking/blog/tension-between-competition-and-tech\">https://www.epiqglobal.com/en-us/thinking/blog/tension-between-competition-and-tech</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411159485735761625876100078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C7-Y6K1-F03R-N48T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1268\"/><timeReceived>11:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Do you buy that argument?</p><p>Brian Merchant: I do not. I think the tech industry got acclimated to the sense that they should be treated a certain way. When the hard questions start coming, when people really start pushing these companies on issues like boardroom diversity or policies that are negative in terms of climate change or disinformation, it does feel like a personal attack all of a sudden.I think because it's a countervailing force, and the shift happened so quickly \u2014 whereas the political press would be asking tough questions that politicians are used to getting their names dragged through the mud proverbially by the press \u2014 the tech cohort was not used to it. So it feels like they have an ax to grind, but I don't really think that's the case. I think it's harder, realer journalism happening. And it feels, all of a sudden, that they're in the crosshairs and they don't like it.Hannah Murphy:Why do we have to carve out the tech press from the wider press? There's no debate about political press, finance press, energy press. I'm doing the same thing in my role here in San Francisco as when I was back in London covering financial services \u2014 same approach. I think about crafting stories the same way, asking tough questions the same way. Nothing has changed me in terms of how I operate as a journalist.What I've found here in Silicon Valley is that the tech industry thinks and acts like it's special and it should be carved out and therefore covered in a different way. It casts itself as having this higher purpose, very sincere mission-focused. But unlike other industries, it's profit-driven. Unlike most other industries, it's very loosely regulated and pretty keen to stay that way. And also some of the livelihood of most tech, wrapped up in the stock price of the company, given there's often a stock compensation element to many of the pay deals, probably more so than in other industries.

Open Now[1]  Earlier this year, the independent research organisation of which I am the Director, London-based Ada Lovelace Institute, hosted a panel at the world's largest AI conference, CogX, called The Ethics Panel to End All Ethics Panels. The title referenced both a tongue-in-cheek effort at self-promotion, and a very real need to put to bed the seemingly endless offering of panels, think-pieces, and government reports preoccupied with ruminating on the abstract ethical questions posed by AI and new data-driven technologies. We had grown impatient with conceptual debates and high-level principles. </p><p>And we were not alone. 2020 has seen the emergence of a new wave of ethical AI - one focused on the tough questions of power[2], equity, and justice that underpin emerging technologies, and directed at bringing about actionable change. It supersedes the two waves that came before it: the first wave, defined by principles and dominated by philosophers, and the second wave, led by computer scientists and geared towards technical fixes. Third-wave ethical AI has seen a Dutch Court shut down an algorithmic fraud detection system, students in the UK take to the streets to protest against algorithmically-decided exam results, and US companies voluntarily restrict their sales of facial recognition technology. It is taking us beyond the principled and the technical, to practical mechanisms for rectifying power imbalances and achieving individual and societal justice.From philosophers to techiesBetween 2016 and 2019, 74 sets of ethical principles or guidelines for AI were published[3]. This was the first wave of ethical AI, in which we had just begun to understand the potential risks and threats of rapidly advancing machine learning and AI capabilities and were casting around for ways to contain them. In 2016, AlphaGo had just beaten Lee Sedol[4], promoting serious consideration of the likelihood that general AI was within reach. And algorithmically-curated chaos on the world's duopolistic platforms, Google and Facebook, had surrounded the two major political earthquakes of the year - Brexit, and Trump's election. In a panic for how to understand and prevent the harm that was so clearly to follow, policymakers and tech developers turned to philosophers and ethicists to develop codes and standards. These often recycled a subset of the same concepts and rarely moved beyond high-level guidance or contained the specificity of the kind needed to speak to individual use cases and applications. This first wave of the movement focused on ethics over law, neglected questions related to systemic injustice and control of infrastructures, and was unwilling to deal with what Michael Veale[5], Lecturer in Digital Rights and Regulation at University College London, calls 'the question of problem framing' - early ethical AI debates usually took as a given that AI will be helpful in solving problems. These shortcomings left the movement open to critique that it had been co-opted by the big tech companies as a means of evading greater regulatory intervention. And those who believed big tech companies were controlling the discourse around ethical AI saw the movement as 'ethics washing.' The flow of money[6] from big tech into codification initiatives, civil society, and academia advocating for an ethics-based approach only underscored the legitimacy of these critiques. At the same time, a second wave of ethical AI was emerging. It sought to promote the use of technical interventions to address ethical harms, particularly those related to fairness, bias and non-discrimination.The domain of 'fair-ML' was born out of an admirable objective on thepart of computer scientists to bake fairness metrics or hard constraints into AI models to moderate their outputs. This focus on technical mechanisms for addressing questions of fairness, bias, and discrimination addressed the clear concerns about how AI and algorithmic systems were inaccurately and unfairly treating people of color or ethnic minorities. Two specific cases contributed important evidence to this argument. The first was the Gender Shades[7] study, which established that facial recognition software deployed by Microsoft and IBM returned higher rates of false positives and false negatives for the faces of women and people ofcolor. The second was the 2016 ProPublica investigation[8] into the COMPAS sentencing algorithmic tool, whichfound that Black defendants were far more likely than White defendants to be incorrectly judged to be at a higher risk of recidivism, while White defendants were more likely than Black defendants to be incorrectly flagged as low risk. Second-wave ethical AI narrowed in on these questions of bias and fairness, and explored technical interventions to solve them. In doing so, however, it may have skewed and narrowed the discourse, moving it away from the root causes of bias and even exacerbating the position of people of color and ethnic minorities. As Julia Powles[9], Director of the Minderoo Tech and Policy Lab at the University of Western Australia, argued, alleviating the problems with dataset representativeness 'merely co-opts designers in perfecting vast instruments of surveillance and classification. When underlying systemic issues remain fundamentally untouched, the bias fighters simply render humans more machine readable, exposing minorities in particular to additional harms.' Some also saw the fair-ML discourse as a form of co-option of socially conscious computer scientists by big tech companies. By framing ethical problems as narrow issues of fairness and accuracy, companies could equate expanded data collection with investing in 'ethical AI.' The efforts of tech companies tochampion fairness-related codes illustrate this point: In January 2018, Microsoft published its 'ethical principles' for AI[10], starting with 'fairness;' in May2018, Facebook announced a tool to 'search for bias' called 'Fairness Flow;'[11] and in September2018, IBM announced a tool called 'AI Fairness 360[12],' designed to 'check for unwanted bias in datasets and machine learning models.' What was missing from second-wave ethical AI was an acknowledgement that technical systems are, in fact, sociotechnical systems \u2014 they cannot be understood outside of the social context in which they are deployed, and they cannot be optimised for societally beneficial and acceptable outcomes through technical tweaks alone. As Ruha Benjamin, Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, argued in her seminal text, Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code, 'the road to inequity is paved with technical fixes.' The narrow focus on technical fairness is insufficient to help us grapple with all of the complex tradeoffs, opportunities, and risks of an AI-driven future; it confines us to thinking only about whether something works, but doesn't permit us to ask whether it should work. That is, it supports an approach that asks, 'What can we do?' rather than 'What should we do?'Ethical AI for a new decadeOn the eve of the new decade, MIT Technology Review's Karen Hao published an article entitled 'In 2020, let's stop AI ethics-washing and actually do something[13].' Weeks later, the AI ethics community ushered in 2020 clustered in conference rooms at Barcelona, for the annual ACM Fairness, Accountability and Transparency conference. Among the many papers that had tongues wagging was written by Elettra Bietti[14], Kennedy Sinclair Scholar Affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. It called for a move beyond the 'ethics-washing' and 'ethics-bashing' that had come to dominate the discipline. Those two pieces heralded a cascade of interventions that saw the community reorienting around a new way of talking about ethical AI, one defined by justice \u2014 social justice, racial justice, economic justice, and environmental justice. It has seen some eschew the term 'ethical AI' in favor of 'just AI.' As the wild and unpredicted events of 2020 have unfurled, alongside them third-wave ethical AI has begun to take hold, strengthened by the immense reckoning that the Black Lives Matter movement has catalysed. Third-wave ethical AI is less conceptual than first-wave ethical AI, and is interested in understanding applications and use cases. It is much more concerned with power, alive to vested interests, and preoccupied with structural issues, including the importance of decolonising AI[15].An article published by Pratyusha Kalluri,[16] founder of the Radical AI Network, in Nature in July 2020, has epitomized the approach, arguing that 'When the field of AI believes it is neutral, it both fails to notice biased data and builds systems that sanctify the status quo and advance the interests of the powerful. What is needed is a field that exposes and critiques systems that concentrate power, while co-creating new systems with impacted communities: AI by and for the people.' What has this meant in practice? We have seen courts begin to grapple with, and political and private sector players admit to, the real power and potential of algorithmic systems. In the UK alone, the Court of Appeal found the use by police of facial recognition systems unlawful[17] and called for a new legal framework; a government department ceased its use of AI for visa application sorting[18]; the West Midlands police ethics advisory committee[19] argued for the discontinuation of a violence-prediction tool; and high school students across the country protested after tens of thousands of school leavers had their marks downgraded by an algorithmic system[20] used by the education regulator, Ofqual. New Zealand published an Algorithm Charter[21] and France's Etalab[22] - a government task force for open data, data policy, and open government - has been working to map the algorithmic systems in use across public sector entities and to provide guidance. The shift in gaze of ethical AI studies away from the technical towards the socio-technical[23] has brought more issues into view, such as the anti-competitive practices of big tech companies, platform labor practices, parity in negotiating power in public sector procurement of predictive analytics, and the climate impact of training AI models. It has seen the Overton window contract in terms of what is reputationally acceptable from tech companies; after years of campaigning by researchers like Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru, companies such as Amazon and IBM have finally adopted voluntary moratoria on their sales of facial recognition technology. The COVID crisis has been instrumental, surfacing technical advancements that have helped to fix the power imbalances that exacerbate the risks of AI and algorithmic systems. The availability of the Google/Apple decentralised protocol[24] for enabling exposure notification prevented dozens of governments from launching invasive digital contact tracing apps. At the same time, governments' response to the pandemic has inevitably catalysed new risks, as public health surveillance has segued into population surveillance, facial recognition systems have been enhanced to work around masks, and the threat of future pandemics is leveraged to justify social media analysis. The UK's attempt to operationalize a weak Ethics Advisory Board to oversee its failed attempt at launching a centralized contact-tracing app was the death knell for toothless ethical figureheads. Research institutes, activists, and campaigners united by the third-wave approach to ethical AI continue to work to address these risks, with a focus on practical tools for accountability (we at the Ada Lovelace Institute, and others such as AI Now, are working on developing audit and assessment tools[25] for AI; and the Omidyar Network has published itsEthical Explorer[26] toolkit for developers and product managers), litigation, protest and campaigning for moratoria, and bans. Researchers are interrogating what justice means in data-driven societies, and institutes such as Data &amp;#38; Society, the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University, JUST DATA Lab at Princeton, and the Global Data Justice project at the Tilberg Institute for Law, Technology and Society in the Netherlands are churning out some of the most novel thinking. The Mindaroo Foundation has just launched its new 'future says'[27] initiative with a $3.5 million grant, with aims to tackle lawlessness, empower workers, and reimagine the tech sector. The initiative will build on the critical contribution of tech workers themselves to the third wave of ethical AI, from AI Now co-founder Meredith Whittaker's organizing work at Google before her departure last year, to walk outs and strikes performed by Amazon logistic workers[28]and Uber and Lyft drivers. But the approach of third-wave ethical AI is by no means accepted across the tech sector yet, as evidenced by the recent acrimonious exchange between AI researchers Yann LeCun and Timnit Gebru about whether the harms of AI should be reduced to a focus on bias. Gebru not only reasserted well established arguments against a narrow focus on dataset bias but also made the case for a more inclusive community of AI scholarship. Mobilized by social pressure, the boundaries of acceptability are shifting fast, and not a moment too soon. But even those of us within the ethical AI community have a long way to go. A case in point: Although we'd programmed diverse speakers across the event, the Ethics Panel to End All Ethics Panels we hosted earlier this year failed to include a person of color, an omission for which we were rightly criticized and hugely regretful. It was a reminder that as long as the domain of AI ethics continues to platform certain types of research approaches, practitioners, and ethical perspectives to the exclusion of others, real change will elude us. 'Ethical AI' can not only be defined from the position of European and North American actors; we need to work concertedly to surface other perspectives, other ways of thinking about these issues, if we truly want to find a way to make data and AI work for people and societies across the world.

Amazon that, under Pennsylvania products liability law, Amazon could be found liable for a third party vendor's sale of a defective product via Amazon Marketplace. This ruling comes in the context of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[3], which is broadly understood as immunizing platforms against liability for harmful conduct posted to their platforms by third parties (Section 230 purists may object to myu use of 'platform' as approximation for the statute's term of 'interactive computer services'; I address this concern by acknowledging it with this parenthetical). This immunity has long been a bedrock principle of Internet law; it has also long been controversial; and those controversies are very much at the fore of discussion today.The response to the opinion has been mixed, to say the least. Eric Goldman, for instance, has asked[4] 'are we at the end of online marketplaces?,' suggesting that they 'might in the future look like a quaint artifact of the early 21st century.' </p><p>Kate Klonick, on the other hand, calls the opinion[5] 'a brilliant way of both holding tech responsible for harms they perpetuate ...king sure we preserve free speech online.'My own inclination is that both Eric and Kate overstate their respective positions - though neither without reason. The facts of Oberdorf cabin the effects of the holding both to Pennsylvania law and to situations where the platform cannot identify the seller. This suggests that the effects will be relatively limited.But, and what I explore in this post, the opinion does elucidate a particular and problematic feature of section 230: that it can be used as a liability shield for harmful conduct. The judges in Oberdorf seem ill-inclined to extend Section 230's protections to a platform that can easily be used by bad actors as a liability shield. Riffing on this concern, I argue below that Section 230 immunity be proportional to platforms' ability to reasonably identify speakers using their platforms to engage in harmful speech or conduct. This idea is developed in more detail in the last section of this post - including responding to the obvious (and overwrought) objections to it. But first it offers some background on Section 230, the Oberdorf and related cases, the Third Circuit's analysis in Oberdorf, and the recent debates about Section 230.Section 230'Section 230' refers to a portion of the Communications Decency Act that was added to the Communications Act by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, codified at 47 U.S.C. 230[6]. (NB: that's a sentence that only a communications lawyer could love!) It is widely recognized as - and discussed even by those who disagree with this view as - having been critical to the growth of the modern Internet. As Jeff Kosseff labels it in his recent book[7], the key provision of section 230 comprises the '26 words that created the Internet.' That section, 230(c)(1), states that 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' (For those not familiar with it, Kosseff's book is worth a read - or for the Cliff's Notes version see here[8], here[9], here[10], here[11], here[12], or here[13].)Section 230 was enacted to do two things. First, section (c)(1) makes clear that platforms are not liable for user-generated content. In other words, if a user of Facebook, Amazon, the comments section of a Washington Post article, a restaurant review site, a blog that focuses on the knitting of cat-themed sweaters, or any other 'interactive computer service,' posts something for which that user may face legal liability, the platform hosting that user's speech does not face liability for that speech.And second, section (c)(2) makes clear that platforms are free to moderate content uploaded by their users, and that they face no liability for doing so. This section was added precisely to repudiate a case[14] that had held that once a platform (in that case, Prodigy) decided to moderate user-generated content, it undertook an obligation to do so. That case meant that platforms faced a Hobson's choice: either don't moderate content and don't risk liability, or moderate all content and face liability for failure to do so well. There was no middle ground: a platform couldn't say, for instance, 'this one post is particularly problematic, so we are going to take it down - but this doesn't mean that we are going to pervasively moderate content.'Together, these two provisions stand generally for the proposition that online platforms are not liable for content created by their users, but they are free to moderate that content without facing liability for doing so. It recognized, on the one hand, that it was impractical (i.e., the Internet economy could not function) to require that platforms moderate all user-generated content, so section (c)(1) says that they don't need to; but, on the other hand, it recognizes that it is desirable for platforms to moderate problematic content to the best of their ability, so section (c)(2) says that they won't be punished (i.e., lose the immunity granted by section (c)(1) if they voluntarily elect to moderate content).Section 230 is written in broad - and has been interpreted by the courts in even broader - terms. Section (c)(1) says that platforms cannot be held liable for the content generated by their users, full stop. The only exceptions are for copyrighted content and content that violates federal criminal law. There is no 'unless it is really bad' exception, or a 'the platform may be liable if the user-generated content causes significant tangible harm' exception, or an 'unless the platform knows about it' exception, or even an 'unless the platform makes money off of and actively facilitates harmful content' exception. So long as the content is generated by the user (not by the platform itself), Section 230 shields the platform from liability.Oberdorf v. AmazonThis background leads us to the Third Circuit's opinion in Oberdorf v. Amazon. The opinion is remarkable because it is one of only a few cases in which a court has, despite Section 230, found a platform liable for the conduct of a third party facilitated through the use of that platform.Prior to the Third Circuit's recent opinion, the best known previous case is the 9th Circuit's Model Mayhem opinion[15]. In that case, the court found that Model Mayhem, a website that helps match models with modeling jobs, had a duty to warn models about individuals who were known to be using the website to find women to sexually assault.It is worth spending another moment on the Model Mayhem opinion before returning to the Third Circuit's Oberdorf opinion. The crux of the 9th Circuit's opinion in the Model Mayhem case was that the state of Florida (where the assaults occurred) has a duty-to-warn law, which creates a duty between the platform and the user. This duty to warn was triggered by the case-specific fact that the platform had actual knowledge that two of its users were predatorily using the site to find women to assault. Once triggered, this duty to warn exists between the platform and the user. Because the platform faces liability directly for its failure to warn, it is not shielded by section 230 (which only shields the platform from liability for the conduct of the third parties using the platform to engage in harmful conduct).In its opinion, the Third Circuit offered a similar analysis - but in a much broader context.The Oberdorf case involves a defective dog leash sold to Ms. Oberdorf by a seller doing business as The Furry Gang on Amazon Marketplace. The leash malfunctioned, hitting Ms. Oberdorf in the face and causing permanent blindness in one eye. When she attempted to sue The Furry Gang, she discovered that they were no longer doing business on Amazon Marketplace - and that Amazon did not have sufficient information about their identity for Ms. Oberdorf to bring suit against them.Undeterred, Ms. Oberdorf sued Amazon under Pennsylvania product liability law, arguing that Amazon was the seller of the defective leash, so was liable for her injuries. Part of Amazon's defense was that the actual seller, The Furry Gang, was a user of their Marketplace platform - the sale resulted from the storefront generated by The Furry Gang and merely hosted by Amazon Marketplace. Under this theory, Section 230 would bar Amazon from liability for the sale that resulted from the seller's user-generated storefront.The Third Circuit judges had none of that argument. All three judges agreed that under Pennsylvania law, the products liability relationship existed between Ms. Oberdorf and Amazon, so Section 230 did not apply. The two-judge majority found Amazon liable to Ms. Oberford under this law - the dissenting judge would have found Amazon's conduct insufficient as a basis for liability.This opinion, in other words, follows in the footsteps of the Ninth Circuit's Model Mayhem opinion in holding that state law creates a duty directly between the harmed user and the platform, and that that duty isn't affected by Section 230. But Oberdorf is potentially much broader in impact than Model Mayhem. States are more likely to have broader product liability laws than duty to warn laws. Even more impactful, product liability laws are generally strict liability laws, whereas duty to warn laws are generally triggered by an actual knowledge requirement.The Third Circuit's Focus on Agency and Liability ShieldsThe understanding of Oberdorf described above is that it is the latest in a developing line of cases holding that claims based on state law duties that require platforms to protect users from third party harms can survive Section 230 defenses.But there is another, critical, issue in the background of the case that appears to have affected the court's thinking - and that, I argue, should be a path forward for Section 230. The judges writing for the Third Circuit majority draw attention tothe extensive record evidence that Amazon fails to vet third-party vendors for amenability to legal process. The first factor [of analysis for application of the state's products liability law] weighs in favor of strict liability not because The Furry Gang cannot be located and/or may be insolvent, but rather because Amazon enables third-party vendors such as The Furry Gang to structure and/or conceal themselves from liability altogether.This is important for analysis under the Pennsylvania product liability law, which has a marketing chain provision that allows injured consumers to seek redress up the marketing chain if the direct seller of a defective product is insolvent or otherwise unavailable for suit. But the court's language focuses on Amazon's design of Marketplace and the ease with which Marketplace can be used by merchants as a liability shield.This focus is unsurprising: the law generally does not allow one party to shield another from liability without assuming liability for the shielded party's conduct. Indeed, this is pretty basic vicarious liability, agency, first-year law school kind of stuff. It is unsurprising that judges would balk at an argument that Amazon could design its platform in a way that makes it impossible for harmed parties to sue a tortfeasor without Amazon in turn assuming liability for any potentially tortious conduct.Section 230 is having a bad dayAs most who have read this far are almost certainly aware, Section 230 is a big, controversial, political mess right now. Politicians from Josh Hawley[16] to Nancy Pelosi[17] have suggested curtailing Section 230. President Trump just held his 'Social Media Summit[18].' And countries around the world[19] are imposing near-impossible obligations on platforms to remove or otherwise moderate potentially problematic content - obligations that are anathema to Section 230[20] as they increasingly reflect and influence discussions in the United States.To be clear, almost all of the ideas floating around about how to change Section 230 are bad. That is an understatement: they are potentially devastating to the Internet - both to the economic ecosystem and the social ecosystem that have developed and thrived largely because of Section 230.To be clear, there is also a lot of really, disgustingly, problematic content online - and social media platforms, in particular, have facilitated a great deal of legitimately problematic conduct. But deputizing them to police that conduct and to make real-time decisions about speech that is impossible to evaluate in real time is not a solution to these problems. And to the extent that some platforms may be able to do these things, the novel capabilities of a few platforms to obligations for all would only serve to create entry barriers for smaller platforms and to stifle innovation.This is why a group of 50 academics and 27 organizations released a statement of principles[21] last week to inform lawmakers about key considerations to take into account when discussing how Section 230 may be changed. The purpose of these principles is to acknowledge that some change to Section 230 may be appropriate - may even be needed at this juncture - but that such changes should be careful and modest, carefully considered so as to not disrupt the vast benefits for society that Section 230 has made possible and is needed to keep vital. The Third Circuit offers a Third Way on 230The Third Circuit's opinion offers a modest way that Section 230 could be changed - and, I would say, improved - to address some of the real harms that it enables without undermining the important purposes that it serves. To wit, Section 230's immunity could be attenuated by an obligation to facilitate the identification of users on that platform, subject to legal process, in proportion to the size and resources available to the platform, the technological feasibility of such identification, the foreseeability of the platform being used to facilitate harmful speech or conduct, and the expected importance (as defined from a First Amendment perspective) of speech on that platform.In other words, if there are readily available ways to establish some form of identify for users - for instance, by email addresses on widely-used platforms, social media accounts, logs of IP addresses - and there is reason to expect that users of the platform could be subject to suit - for instance, because they're engaged in commercial activities or the purpose of the platform is to provide a forum for speech that is likely to legally actionable - then the platform needs to be reasonably able to provide reasonable information about speakers subject to legal action in order to avail itself of any Section 230 defense. Stated otherwise, platforms need to be able to reasonably comply with so-called unmasking subpoenas issued in the civil context to the extent such compliance is feasible for the platform's size, sophistication, resources, #38;c.An obligation such as this would have been at best meaningless and at worst devastating at the time Section 230 was adopted. But 25 years later, the Internet is a very different place. Most users have online accounts - email addresses, social media profiles, ... that can serve as some form of online identification.More important, we now have evidence of a growing range of harmful conduct and speech that can occur online, and of platforms that use Section 230 as a shield to protect those engaging in such speech or conduct from litigation. Such speakers are clear bad actors who are clearly abusing Section 230 facilitate bad conduct. They should not be able to do so.Many of the traditional proponents of Section 230 will argue that this idea is a non-starter. Two of the obvious objections are that it would place a disastrous burden on platforms especially start-ups and smaller platforms, and that it would stifle socially valuable anonymous speech. Both are valid concerns, but also accommodated by this proposal. The concern that modest user-identification requirements would be disastrous to platforms made a great deal of sense in the early years of the Internet, both the law and technology around user identification were less developed. Today, there is a wide-range of low-cost, off-the-shelf, techniques to establish a user's identity to some level of precision - from logging of IP addresses, to requiring a valid email address to an established provider, registration with an established social media identity, or even SMS-authentication. None of these is perfect; they present a range of cost and sophistication to implement and a range of offer a range of ease of identification. The proposal offered here is not that platforms be able to identify their speaker - it's better described as that they not deliberately act as a liability shield. It's requirement is that platforms implement reasonable identity technology in proportion to their size, sophistication, and the likelihood of harmful speech on their platforms. A small platform for exchanging bread recipes would be fine to maintain a log of usernames and IP addresses. A large, well-resourced, platform hosting commercial activity (such as Amazon Marketplace) may be expected to establish a verified identity for the merchants it hosts. A forum known for hosting hate speech would be expected to have better identification records - it is entirely foreseeable that its users would be subject to legal action. A forum of support groups for marginalized and disadvantaged communities would face a lower obligation than a forum of similar size and sophistication known for hosting legally-actionable speech. This proportionality approach also addresses the anonymous speech concern. Anonymous speech is often of great social and political value. But anonymity can also be used for, and as made amply clear in contemporary online discussion can bring out the worst of, speech that is socially and politically destructive. Tying Section 230's immunity to the nature of speech on a platform gives platforms an incentive to moderate speech - to make sure that anonymous speech is used for its good purposes while working to prevent its use for its lesser purposes. This is in line with one of the defining goals of Section 230.The challenge, of course, has been how to do this without exposing platforms to potentially crippling liability if they fail to effectively moderate speech. This is why Section 230 took the approach that it did, allowing but not requiring moderation. This proposal's user-identification requirement shifts that balance from 'allowing but not requiring' to 'encouraging but not requiring.' Platforms are under no legal obligation to moderate speech, but if they elect not to, they need to make reasonable efforts to ensure that their users engaging in problematic speech can be identified by parties harmed by their speech or conduct. In an era in which sites like 8chan expressly don't maintain user logs in order to shield themselves from known harmful speech, and Amazon Marketplace allows sellers into the market who cannot be sued by injured consumers, this is a common-sense change to the law.It would also likely have substantially the same effect as other proposals for Section 230 reform, but without the significant challenges those suggestions face. For instance, Danielle Citron ...n Wittes have proposed[22] that courts should give substantive meaning to Section 230's 'Good Samaritan' language in section (c)(2)'s subheading, or, in the alternative, that section (c)(1)'s immunity require that platforms 'take[] reasonable steps to prevent unlawful uses of its services.' This approach is problematic on both First Amendment and process grounds, because it requires courts to evaluate the substantive content and speech decisions that platforms engage in. It effectively tasks platforms with undertaking the task of the courts in developing a (potentially platform-specific) law of content moderations - and threatens them with a loss of Section 230 immunity is they fail effectively to do so.By contrast, this proposal would allow, and even encourage, platforms to engage in such moderation, but offers them a gentler, more binary, and procedurally-focused safety valve to maintain their Section 230 immunity. If a user engages in harmful speech or conduct and the platform can assist plaintiffs and courts in bringing legal action against the user in the courts, then the 'moderation' process occurs in the courts through ordinary civil litigation.To be sure, there are still some uncomfortable and difficult substantive questions - has a platform implemented reasonable identification technologies, is the speech on the platform of the sort that would be viewed as requiring (or otherwise justifying protection of the speaker's) anonymity, and the like. But these are questions of a type that courts are accustomed to, if somewhat uncomfortable with, addressing. They are, for instance, the sort of issues that courts address in the context of civil unmasking subpoenas.This distinction is demonstrated in the comparison between Sections 230 and 512. Section 512 is an exception to 230 for copyrighted materials that was put into place by the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It takes copyrighted materials outside of the scope of Section 230 and requires platforms to put in place a 'notice and takedown' regime in order to be immunized for hosting copyrighted content uploaded by users. This regime has proved controversial, among other reasons, because it effectively requires platforms to act as courts in deciding whether a given piece of content is subject to a valid copyright claim. The Citron/Wittes proposal effectively subjects platforms to a similar requirement in order to maintain Section 230 immunity; the identity-technology proposal, on the other hand, offers an intermediate requirement.Indeed, the principal effect of this intermediate requirement is to maintain the pre-platform status quo. IRL, if one person says or does something harmful to another person, their recourse is in court. This is true in public and in private; it's true if the harmful speech occurs on the street, in a store, in a public building, or a private home. If Donny defames Peggy in Hank's house, Peggy sues Donny in court; she doesn't sue Hank, and she doesn't sue Donny in the court of Hank. To the extent that we think of platforms as the fora where people interact online - as the 'place' of the Internet - this proposal is intended to ensure that those engaging in harmful speech or conduct online can be hauled into court by the aggrieved parties, and to facilitate the continued development of platforms without disrupting the functioning of this system of adjudication. ConclusionSection 230 is, and has long been, the most important and one of the most controversial laws of the Internet. It is increasingly under attack today from a disparate range of voices across the political and geographic spectrum \u2014 voices that would overwhelming reject Section 230's pro-innovation treatment of platforms and in its place attempt to co-opt those platforms as government-compelled (and, therefore, controlled) content moderators.In light of these demands, academics and organizations that understand the importance of Section 230, but also recognize the increasing pressures to amend it, have recently released a statement of principles[23] for legislators to consider as they think about changes to Section 230.Into this fray, the Third Circuit's opinion in Oberdorf offers a potential change: making Section 230's immunity for platforms proportional to their ability to reasonably identify speakers that use the platform to engage in harmful speech or conduct. This would restore the status quo ante, under which intermediaries and agents cannot be used as litigation shields without themselves assuming responsibility for any harmful conduct. This shielding effect was not an intended goal of Section 230, and it has been the cause of Section 230's worst abuses. It was allowed at the time Section 230 was adopted because the used-identity requirements such as proposed here would not have been technologically reasonable at the time Section 230 was adopted. But technology has changed and, today, these requirements would impose only a moderate burden on platforms todayThe post The Third Circuit's Oberdorf v.

The first is a story of extraordinary success: the company has regained most of the losses that followed the Cambridge Analytica data abuse allegations, on the back of record first-quarter results, a media offensive and a bullish performance last week at their annual developer conference, F8.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The second is a story of existential crisis at a company beleaguered by ongoing concerns over data protection and privacy: last week saw a further series of damaging developments.</p><p>On Sunday, RT\u00c9 revealed they had discovered a fake news report on abortion, purporting to be an RT\u00c9 report, being disseminated on Facebook in a paid-for post. Facebook removed the report, but refused to sanction the user who had paid for it.</p><p>On Monday, Whatsapp co-founder Jan Koum quit Facebook following disagreements over privacy policy. The same day, the EU\u2019s data protection tsar, Giovanni Buttarelli, criticised Facebook\u2019s attitude to data protection and warned of attempts by social media companies to \u201cgame the system\u201d in advance of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force on May 25.</p><p>On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica announced it was closing down, and the High Court refused a request by Facebook to delay the referral of key data-privacy questions to the European Court of Justice.</p><p>So which narrative will win out? And what are the implications for us, both as individual users of Facebook and as hosts of its international headquarters?</p><p>Facebook is fighting the data protection narrative on three fronts: developing new features in a bid to assuage user concerns; welcoming regulation (in principle if not in practice); and refuting the most basic charge against it, that it sells data.</p><p>\u201cWe do not sell data,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg told the US Congress last month. \u201cWe do not sell people\u2019s data,\u201d Facebook\u2019s vice-president of global policy, Joel Kaplan, echoed at the Oireachtas communications committee more recently.</p><p>This is true, but disingenuous - akin to Brexiteers claiming it was true to say Britain sends \u00a3350 million weekly to Brussels because the rebate is accounted for separately.</p><p>Whether the data actually leaves Facebook or not is irrelevant: what matters is the net effect. Facebook sells the ad space alongside that data; the data is what gives that space value.</p><p>The data is what makes advertising on Facebook effective; the effectiveness of that advertising is what makes Facebook, based on usage and growth, the most successful media company in history.</p><p>(In this sense, the Cambridge Analytica story was always a distraction: Cambridge Analytica did nothing with Facebook\u2019s data that Facebook cannot do itself. The threat to privacy comes as much, or more, from how that data can be used by Facebook as from the selling of it.)</p><p>The other crucial component in Facebook\u2019s success is costs. Facebook is valued at $510 billion and has 25,000 staff; Disney is valued at less than a third of that, but has eight times as many staff. No media company has ever achieved so much on the backs of so few staff.</p><p>This is what makes the RT\u00c9 abortion fake news story significant: it is emblematic of the problem with Facebook. It has become a giant media company without the quality controls that media companies require; it can monetise fake news without taking responsibility for it.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot become arbiters of truth ourselves,\u201d said the man responsible for Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed, Adam Mosseri, last year. But this is precisely what every traditional media company does; the only reason Facebook can\u2019t is because it would radically challenge its business model.</p><p>As I have written here before, I think the greater threat to our wellbeing from Big Tech - and, ultimately, to Big Tech itself - may come not from data protection issues, or from fake news, but from social media addiction and, in particular, inadequate protection against misuse or overuse by children.</p><p>But the data protection narrative chimes with the zeitgeist of neurosis about a coming dystopia. It is this new concern with data protection that has Big Tech under siege. If data protection proves to be the Trojan horse that allows governments and regulators greater leverage over the most powerful media companies the world has ever seen, then all for the good.</p><p>This issue carries both threat and opportunity for Ireland Inc and for Ireland\u2019s public realm. The threat comes from the fact that Big Tech is not merely inextricable from our social and professional lives, but also plays an outsize role in our economy.</p><p>This makes our Office of the Data Protection Commissioner look wildly under-resourced. Staffing has increased from 30 to 100, and is envisaged to grow to 120 in the wake of GDPR. The junior minister responsible, Pat Breen, has said this puts Ireland \u201cin the top tier\u201d of EU data protection authorities.</p><p>But Ireland is in a tier all of its own in terms of its exposure to Big Tech and its responsibility for regulating it.</p><p>Tech sector exports, at \u20ac35 billion, are worth three times as much as agri-food and drink exports. Yet, as Green TD Eamon Ryan noted recently, the staffing of the Data Protection Commissioner pales beside the 5,000 civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>This over-reliance on the tech sector and undercapacity of regulation could inhibit the kind of regulatory innovation that may be necessary to protect against the ills and abuses of social media that have infected the public realm elsewhere.</p><p>And this is precisely where the opportunity lies. As popular awareness of data protection grows, it becomes not merely a regulatory issue, but a technical challenge and economic opportunity.</p><p>An array of upstart social networks are already positioning themselves as safer and healthier alternatives to Facebook; Facebook itself has accepted that a new era of regulation is coming and used last week\u2019s F8 conference to showcase its own data-protection innovations.</p><p>In finance, Celtic Tiger Ireland championed a light-touch regulatory model that would lead to the IFSC being branded the \u201cWild West\u201d and ultimately do immense damage both to our economy and our reputation.</p><p>In tech, Ireland has an opportunity to get ahead of the curve: become a model of innovation and best practice in emerging regulation. The model for regulation of Big Tech should be a smart touch, not a light one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUBUPO-415949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUBUPO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S84-F1T1-F0B4-80FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315448</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Post Publications Ltd.

The book is a riveting explanation of how a huge cultural shift can ultimately spring from faint stirrings in the undergrowth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Professor Greenblatt is probably not interested in the giant corporations that now dominate our world, but I am, and in the spirit of The Swerve I've been looking for signs that big changes might be on the way. You don't have to dig very deep to find them.</p><p>Some are pretty obvious. In 2014, for example, the European Court of Justice decided that EU citizens had the so-called \"right to be forgotten\" and that Google would have to comply if it wanted to continue to do business in Europe. In May this year, the European commission fined Facebook (EURO)110m for \"providing misleading information\" about its takeover of WhatsApp. And in June the commission levied a whopping (EURO)2.4bn fine on Google for abusing its monopoly in search.</p><p>These companies have inadvertently acquired the ability to shape our politics</p><p>Since the European commission is the only regulator in the world that seems to have the muscle and inclination to take on the internet giants, these developments were relatively predictable. What's more interesting are various straws in the wind that show how digital behemoths are losing their shine. Many of these relate to Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and to the dawning of a realisation that Google and Facebook in particular may have played some role in these political earthquakes.</p><p>This was not because the leadership of the two companies actively sought these outcomes, but because people began to realise that the infrastructure they had built for their core business of extracting users' data and selling it to companies for ad-targeting purposes could be - and was - \"weaponised\" by political actors in order to achieve political goals.</p><p>Public concern about these discoveries was not exactly mollified by the responses of the companies' bosses - which were variously dismissive, evasive (\"it's just the algorithms - nothing to do with us\"), disingenuous, inept and politically naive. They had to be like that, because a franker response would reveal that taking responsibility for what happens on their platforms would vaporise the business model that has made them so rich and powerful.</p><p>The tech industry, wrote Buzzfeed's editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, in a perceptive recent essay, \"has had a remarkable run. The companies at its centre are beloved by consumers, truly global, dominant in the markets. They have also been able to coast on their popularity and their amazing products while largely getting a pass on politics at its higher levels.\"</p><p>Suddenly, though, the wind is changing. The companies, says Smith, have \"never had to fight for their identity against political tides that have defined other major American industries. It's easy to forget that oil prospectors and junk bond traders had their moments of glory too; now Wall Street and the oil industries are resigned to a defensive crouch.\"</p><p> Related:  Silicon Valley has been humbled. But its schemes are as dangerous as ever | Evgeny Morozov</p><p>What we've come to understand over the last two years is that, to coin a slogan, the technical is political. When Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, famously exhorted his software engineers to \"move fast and break things\" he didn't realise that one of the things that might get broken was democracy. And when Google's search team added autocomplete as a way of helping users formulate search queries, they didn't realise that the resulting algorithms could be gamed by Holocaust deniers.</p><p>The tech giants may not have set out to acquire political power, but it turns out that they have inadvertently acquired the ability to shape our politics. This is akin to, but also different from, the power that Rupert Murdoch has. And with it come responsibilities that the tech moguls are as desperate as Murdoch to avoid shouldering.</p><p>At the moment they shelter behind a clause in the 1996 Communications Decency Act that absolves them from responsibility for what passes through their servers. For two decades, that was the end of the matter. But suddenly that bulwark is beginning to look fragile as US lawmakers unite to chip away at it. In 2014, Ben Smith wrote a piece entitled The Facebook Election, in which he predicted that the social network would \"replace television advertising as the place where American elections are fought and won\". Looks like he was right: the technical has indeed become political.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-37772082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJH-73V1-F021-641D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 24, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Communications Decency Act</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZFRThGRDIyOERDNDRBNzlCRUMzNkNBMDIzRDU5NTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkEyQUE3Q0ZGNTBBNDZBQkI4Qjg5MjlFREFGQjZENDM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

(NYSE: TIF[2]) announced their engagement, Reuters reported that the formal tie-up will be pushed back three months. Tiffany decided to exercise its right to move the deadline to November 24. As a reminder, LVMH will pay $16.9 Billionincluding net debt, equivalent to nearly four years' sales at Tiffany, its biggest and most expensive deal to date. But this is more than a prolonged engagement, it is a snapshot of a new economy where the list of priorities is being rewritten.Could This \"Marriage\" End Up Not Taking Place?</p><p>Tiffany's shareholders said yes to the proposal in February. But, at least a few key regulatory bodies, including the relevant entities in the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan, have not yet approved the transaction. If its prior Bulgari approval is any indication, it seems feasible that the European Commission will approve the Tiffany deal. However, the pandemic is adding up to a sobering challenge for U.S. antitrust enforcers. It is worsening the already burning problems of rising concentration and declining competition that regulators were already trying to address before the outbreak. The big ones are only getting bigger and the small ones are fighting for dear life.COVID-19 Altered Consumer BehaviorLike with any crisis, the pandemic is playing to the strengths of the biggest players. In the case of COVID-19, the winners are the digital players. Their victory was clearly reflected in their earnings reports. Big Tech saw its stock reach new highs and exceeded top-line expectations. Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ: AMZN[3]) even did the impossible as it topped profit expectations. Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ: MSFT[4]) and Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM[5]) saw engagement skyrocket to unprecedented highs. New trends are being made. Altogether, the pandemic could reshape the American economy in myriad ways as companies begin to wobble, and corporate defaults begin to soar. Moreover, just like COVID-19 relentlessly marched across the globe, the fallout won't be limited to the U.S. economy. Jean-Paul Agon, the chairman of French cosmetics giant L'Oral SA (OTC: LRLCY[6])(OTC: LRLCF[7]), warned of that possibility back in April, saying it is simply the Darwinian side of business. But rest assured, L'Oral is one of those which can survive this storm and adopt to a new definition of beauty. Even the lipstick index that survived the Great Depression and the 2008 Financial Crisis met its match. Masks turned skincare into a blockbuster as quarantines provided more time for self-care. With COVID-19 still around, beauty is being redefined as \"clean\" and \"antibacterial\" become the desired adjectives.COVID Or No COVID, Industry Consolidation Is In The CardsSuch consolidation was well-underway within the fashion industry even before COVID put the world to a stop. The trend was heightened largely by the fact that titans were only gaining in size and power, making it increasingly difficult for anyone else to compete. A pattern of smaller players or more precisely, single-brand players, coming together to seek refuge from the giants could be observed even before the pandemic. This has ultimately prompted the general consensus that it is better to be big. The Economist even defined it last year by saying that brands can simply do better with a conglomerate behind them.COVID-19 Will Reshape The Luxury IndustryThe iconic American marque which is much more than a luxury jeweler will become the 76th Maison of the Parisian group which holds Louis Vuitton, Dior and Veuve Clicquot champagne under its umbrella. With LVMH being the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, the only question is how many more can fit under the corporate umbrella of Bernard Arnault, its CEO and biggest shareholder? But even the mightiest fell under the sword of COVID-19 as international tourism is largely halted and potential buyers are cutting back on luxury purchases. Its revenue fell 38% in the three months up to the end of June. Just like with Richemont and Burberry, it was the worst ever quarter that was eaten up by the pandemic. But, the giant's revenue showed relative resilience during the first half of the year with improvements expected since July. The biggest potential problem for the industry is its reliance on physical stores as it has been notoriously slow in picking up on the online buying trend.Gloomy OutlookWelcome to the post-pandemic U.S. economy. The biggest companies are getting even bigger. Midsize players are running on fumes. Brick-and-mortar stores are struggling just to make ends meet. Startups are disappearing. It can be argued that they are even more important than luxury \"Gods,\"considering they are the building blocks of a competitive economy.
