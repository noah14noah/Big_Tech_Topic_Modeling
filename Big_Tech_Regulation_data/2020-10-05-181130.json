Before that he was the chief technology officer at Microsoft. Nathan, I know these are the kinds of issues you give a lot of thought to. I'm curious what your take has been as you've watched the big tech companies testify before Washington, and where you believe their responsibilities start and stop when it comes to these issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MYHRVOLD</emphasis>: Well I think we have an evolution of what's happened online. The early days of the internet, people just typed pretty much whatever they wanted, and there was no money involved, so that worked out, well, as well as it did.  </p><p>      Now you have the situation where social media makes billions of dollars a year for these companies, advertisements also do, and they're having to do something they didn't do before, which is to look inside what they're making all those billions of dollars on.  </p><p>      I think it's pretty unreasonable to expect that they have no level of responsibility. Historically other forms of media have cared, they have checked to make sure that ads are basically truthful and fair, at least to some minimal level standard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>: So Nathan, you know, what do you think these companies then should actually do? I mean their answer is look, we're tech companies. We are not media companies. But how much farther should they go to police what is happening on their platforms?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MYHRVOLD</emphasis>: Well if you're charging for ads, then  and those ads all come from the Russian government or somebody else, and that matters in that context, sorry, you're charging for the ads, I think it's your responsibility to look into it to some degree.  </p><p>      With respect to the individual speech of people who post things to their Facebook page, or tweet them, or whatever, there's always a First Amendment issue, and people want to be able to be heard, people have the right to be heard, and of course I support freedom of speech.  </p><p>      But saying they're not media companies doesn't really sound right to me. They are making a tremendous amount of money on sharing that content very, very broadly, and even though they're not paying for the content, the content comes from average citizens, I think they have some responsibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>: Now talking about your former stomping ground, Microsoft, I recently sat down with Satya Nadella and we talked about regulation. We've got big tech companies facing more regulation in Europe. There's a threat of more regulation here in the United States. Take a listen to what Nadella told me about how impending regulation should impact company operations.  </p><p>      (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SATYA NADELLA, CEO, MICROSOFT</emphasis>: I mean I think the most important thing for tech companies is not to worry about any impending regulation.  </p><p>      (END AUDIO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>: Nathan, how big a threat do you think increased regulation is, potentially putting up some boundaries around these companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MYHRVOLD</emphasis>: Well you have the irony that many big tech companies make billions of dollars on information that its users share with them. And so they're very paranoid about anything that would stop that from occurring, or that would increase their costs.  </p><p>      And to some degree, that's because it used to be all really cheap and free, so they think well, why should we offer extra costs now? So I think some of it is waning, just to be blunt. Some of it is more in the nature of saying well boy, if we allow this little step to occur, then oh my god, they might actually kill the goose that's laying the golden egg for us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>: Right. So before I let you go, you have a new cookbook out about modern bread, \"Modernist Bread\". You've been fascinated by food technology for a very long time. What do we need to know about the technology behind bread today?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MYHRVOLD</emphasis>: Well bread is one of the oldest foods of mankind. It's full of enormous lore and legend, and belief that some things are correct and other things aren't, for example that you must knead your bread. It turns out you don't need to knead. And a lot of the other traditional ideas about bread turn out not to be true. So that's what we filled the 2,600 pages of this book with, is history, science, and recipes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>: Any interesting high-tech or low-tech trends, food trends, this holiday season?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MYHRVOLD</emphasis>: Well I think there will be more sous-vided turkey and sous-vided other things this Thanksgiving than ever before. So some of these modern cooking techniques are penetrating out to enormous numbers of people.  </p><p>      You know, the age-old question with turkey is how do you keep the breasts from drying out, and yet still have the dark meat cooked well, and the best way is separate them. Don't cook them together. That's true whether you do it sous-vide or you do it any other way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KELLER</emphasis>: All right. I'm hungry already. May not need to knead bread, but I do need my bread. Nathan Myhrvold, co-founder of Intellectual Ventures and author of a new book out, \"Modernist Bread\".

Before that he was the chief technology officer at  Microsoft. Nathan, I know these are the kinds of issues you give a lot of  thought to. I'm curious what your take has been as you've watched the big  tech companies testify before Washington, and where you believe their  responsibilities start and stop when it comes to these issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NATHAN MYHRVOLD, FOUNDER, INTELLECTUAL VENTURES: Well I think we have an  evolution of what's happened online. The early days of the internet, people  just typed pretty much whatever they wanted, and there was no money  involved, so that worked out, well, as well as it did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now you have the situation where social media makes billions of dollars a  year for these companies, advertisements also do, and they're having to do  something they didn't do before, which is to look inside what they're  making all those billions of dollars on.</p><p>I think it's pretty unreasonable to expect that they have no level of  responsibility. Historically other forms of media have cared, they have  checked to make sure that ads are basically truthful and fair, at least to  some minimal level standard.</p><p>KELLER: So Nathan, you know, what do you think these companies then should  actually do? I mean their answer is look, we're tech companies. We are not  media companies. But how much farther should they go to police what is  happening on their platforms?</p><p>MYHRVOLD: Well if you're charging for ads, then - and those ads all come  from the Russian government or somebody else, and that matters in that  context, sorry, you're charging for the ads, I think it's your  responsibility to look into it to some degree.</p><p>With respect to the individual speech of people who post things to their  Facebook page, or tweet them, or whatever, there's always a First Amendment  issue, and people want to be able to be heard, people have the right to be  heard, and of course I support freedom of speech.</p><p>But saying they're not media companies doesn't really sound right to me.  They are making a tremendous amount of money on sharing that content very,  very broadly, and even though they're not paying for the content, the  content comes from average citizens, I think they have some responsibility.</p><p>KELLER: Now talking about your former stomping ground, Microsoft, I  recently sat down with Satya Nadella and we talked about regulation. We've  got big tech companies facing more regulation in Europe. There's a threat  of more regulation here in the United States. Take a listen to what Nadella  told me about how impending regulation should impact company operations.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SATYA NADELLA, CEO, MICROSOFT: I mean I think the most important thing for  tech companies is not to worry about any impending regulation.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>KELLER: Nathan, how big a threat do you think increased regulation is,  potentially putting up some boundaries around these companies?</p><p>MYHRVOLD: Well you have the irony that many big tech companies make  billions of dollars on information that its users share with them. And so  they're very paranoid about anything that would stop that from occurring,  or that would increase their costs.</p><p>And to some degree, that's because it used to be all really cheap and free,  so they think well, why should we offer extra costs now? So I think some of  it is waning, just to be blunt. Some of it is more in the nature of saying  well boy, if we allow this little step to occur, then oh my god, they might  actually kill the goose that's laying the golden egg for us.</p><p>KELLER: Right. So before I let you go, you have a new cookbook out about  modern bread, \"Modernist Bread\". You've been fascinated by food technology  for a very long time. What do we need to know about the technology behind  bread today?</p><p>MYHRVOLD: Well bread is one of the oldest foods of mankind. It's full of  enormous lore and legend, and belief that some things are correct and other  things aren't, for example that you must knead your bread. It turns out you  don't need to knead. And a lot of the other traditional ideas about bread  turn out not to be true. So that's what we filled the 2,600 pages of this  book with, is history, science, and recipes.</p><p>KELLER: Any interesting high-tech or low-tech trends, food trends, this  holiday season?</p><p>MYHRVOLD: Well I think there will be more sous-vided turkey and sous-vided  other things this Thanksgiving than ever before. So some of these modern  cooking techniques are penetrating out to enormous numbers of people.</p><p>You know, the age-old question with turkey is how do you keep the breasts  from drying out, and yet still have the dark meat cooked well, and the best  way is separate them. Don't cook them together. That's true whether you do  it sous-vide or you do it any other way.</p><p>KELLER: All right. I'm hungry already. May not need to knead bread, but I  do need my bread. Nathan Myhrvold, co-founder of Intellectual Ventures and  author of a new book out, \"Modernist Bread\". Nathan, always great to have  you here on the show.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Before that he was the chief technology officer at  Microsoft. Nathan, I know these are the kinds of issues you give a lot of  thought to. I'm curious what your take has been as you've watched the big  tech companies testify before Washington, and where you believe their  responsibilities start and stop when it comes to these issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> NATHAN MYHRVOLD, FOUNDER, INTELLECTUAL VENTURES: Well I think we have an  evolution of what's happened online. The early days of the internet, people  just typed pretty much whatever they wanted, and there was no money  involved, so that worked out, well, as well as it did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now you have the situation where social media makes billions of dollars a  year for these companies, advertisements also do, and they're having to do  something they didn't do before, which is to look inside what they're  making all those billions of dollars on.</p><p> I think it's pretty unreasonable to expect that they have no level of  responsibility. Historically other forms of media have cared, they have  checked to make sure that ads are basically truthful and fair, at least to  some minimal level standard.</p><p> KELLER: So Nathan, you know, what do you think these companies then should  actually do? I mean their answer is look, we're tech companies. We are not  media companies. But how much farther should they go to police what is  happening on their platforms?</p><p> MYHRVOLD: Well if you're charging for ads, then - and those ads all come  from the Russian government or somebody else, and that matters in that  context, sorry, you're charging for the ads, I think it's your  responsibility to look into it to some degree.</p><p> With respect to the individual speech of people who post things to their  Facebook page, or tweet them, or whatever, there's always a First Amendment  issue, and people want to be able to be heard, people have the right to be  heard, and of course I support freedom of speech.</p><p> But saying they're not media companies doesn't really sound right to me.  They are making a tremendous amount of money on sharing that content very,  very broadly, and even though they're not paying for the content, the  content comes from average citizens, I think they have some responsibility.</p><p> KELLER: Now talking about your former stomping ground, Microsoft, I  recently sat down with Satya Nadella and we talked about regulation. We've  got big tech companies facing more regulation in Europe. There's a threat  of more regulation here in the United States. Take a listen to what Nadella  told me about how impending regulation should impact company operations.</p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> SATYA NADELLA, CEO, MICROSOFT: I mean I think the most important thing for  tech companies is not to worry about any impending regulation.</p><p> (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p> KELLER: Nathan, how big a threat do you think increased regulation is,  potentially putting up some boundaries around these companies?</p><p> MYHRVOLD: Well you have the irony that many big tech companies make  billions of dollars on information that its users share with them. And so  they're very paranoid about anything that would stop that from occurring,  or that would increase their costs.</p><p> And to some degree, that's because it used to be all really cheap and free,  so they think well, why should we offer extra costs now? So I think some of  it is waning, just to be blunt. Some of it is more in the nature of saying  well boy, if we allow this little step to occur, then oh my god, they might  actually kill the goose that's laying the golden egg for us.</p><p> KELLER: Right. So before I let you go, you have a new cookbook out about  modern bread, \"Modernist Bread\". You've been fascinated by food technology  for a very long time. What do we need to know about the technology behind  bread today?</p><p> MYHRVOLD: Well bread is one of the oldest foods of mankind. It's full of  enormous lore and legend, and belief that some things are correct and other  things aren't, for example that you must knead your bread. It turns out you  don't need to knead. And a lot of the other traditional ideas about bread  turn out not to be true. So that's what we filled the 2,600 pages of this  book with, is history, science, and recipes.</p><p> KELLER: Any interesting high-tech or low-tech trends, food trends, this  holiday season?</p><p> MYHRVOLD: Well I think there will be more sous-vided turkey and sous-vided  other things this Thanksgiving than ever before. So some of these modern  cooking techniques are penetrating out to enormous numbers of people.</p><p> You know, the age-old question with turkey is how do you keep the breasts  from drying out, and yet still have the dark meat cooked well, and the best  way is separate them. Don't cook them together. That's true whether you do  it sous-vide or you do it any other way.</p><p> KELLER: All right. I'm hungry already. May not need to knead bread, but I  do need my bread. Nathan Myhrvold, co-founder of Intellectual Ventures and  author of a new book out, \"Modernist Bread\". Nathan, always great to have  you here on the show.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

It is brutal realpolitik in action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The finance ministers from the world's richest democracies are wrestling with a deeply disruptive two-headed beast that is actively undermining the established global order, in the form of increasingly powerful and pervasive Big Tech as well as the unpredictable and vengeful Donald Trump.</p><p>Morneau's approach is to keep his head down and look for a global alliance to come to the rescue.</p><p>In the current circumstances, while it's not very satisfying, that's probably the best we can do.</p><p>It has come to this.</p><p>France, in contrast, is not leaving anything to chance. The French government has just passed a 3-per-cent tax on revenues of large tech companies.</p><p>And since France is hosting the finance ministers this week, as well as the subsequent summit of G7 leaders next month in Biarritz, the move is deliberately provocative.</p><p>The Americans vowed immediately to unleash trade retaliation against France in response. And Canada, according to unnamed French officials quoted by international media covering the Chantilly meeting, has tried to avoid getting caught up in the trans-Atlantic tiff, pleading an inability to act decisively due to the coming election.</p><p>Publicly, and not surprisingly, that's not how Morneau puts it.</p><p>France, he says, will stand down with its unilateral measures as soon as global powers can come together and figure out how to deal with corporate powerhouses that don't pay tax in many countries despite reaping profits there.</p><p>\"That approach won't prevail if we can get to an international agreement.</p><p>\"I have a high level of confidence that we're moving towards an international agreement that can make sense,\" Morneau said in a phone interview from Chantilly.</p><p>Unilateral action by some countries could prompt others to race to the bottom, he said, and defeat the purpose of forcing digital giants to pay their fair share of tax. Instead, the G7 will drive the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to quickly establish digital tax rules for all. And then Canada can move ahead.</p><p>\"We do need to make sure that the large digital companies - as well as any other company for that matter - are paying their fair share of tax,\" Morneau said.</p><p>\"What we want to make sure of is that companies pay their fair share of tax in the place where they create their value. So, if a company is getting value out of the Canadian economy, we don't want them to be paying tax somewhere else. We want them paying tax in Canada.\"</p><p>He has a similar approach to Libra, Facebook's proposal for a cryptocurrency that has alarmed financial regulators and privacy advocates around the world. Morneau says he sees eye to eye with the G7 that Libra raises serious questions, and he agrees regulators need to protect consumer safety. But in a hat tip to the American penchant for free markets, he adds that Canada would never stand in the way of technological advances.</p><p>\"What we're walking away with here is that we have significant concerns over how this has been put forward right now. We're obviously never going to say that we shouldn't have technological progress,\" Morneau said.</p><p>\u00ca</p><p>The G7's main preoccupation these days, however, is to boost global growth - which is in the doldrums, lately, especially in advanced economies that are dealing internally with aging workforces and are also exposed to international trade.</p><p>The trade war between the United States and China has crushed supply chains for many companies and injected massive amounts of uncertainty into business decision-making, slowing economic activity everywhere.</p><p>Canada's cautious approach means no tirade against destructive protectionism. Morneau's interventions at the G7 meetings will focus on domestic measures his government has taken to promote the middle class and use fiscal policy for inclusive growth.</p><p>\"We have to realize that trade, global trade, is in fact an issue that is presenting some challenges to global growth. That's the environment we find ourselves in. We need to recognize the challenge,\" he said.</p><p>\"In the absence of making immediate progress, which is very much a U.S.-China discussion, we need to be focusing on investing (in) the future for Canadians.\"</p><p>The strategy - focus on what you can control; look for help from global alliances; and be ever vigilant not to poke the bear called Trump - has meant Canada has been able to keep the door mostly open with the United States.</p><p>On the diplomatic front, Morneau met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday and had a frank discussion with him about Buy America. The two countries' governments are still talking frequently.</p><p>On the trade front, Canadian exports to the United States were at a record high in May, fuelling growth in the Canadian economy almost against all odds.</p><p>While global diplomacy these days is not all whipping cream and lace, for Canada at least, it could be a lot worse.</p><p>\u00ca</p><p>Twitter: @hscoffield</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBCHRN-395934053TBCJ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-CJT1-JCT9-G4P0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437301</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Chronicle Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Chronicle Journal</publicationName><edition>Web Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>national,affairs,canada,seeks,consensus,taxation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Yes. Now that`s the sort of gavel you expect from The Met that`s brought trading to a close.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, it`s the 27th of March. A sudden selloff on Wall Street late in the day. The Dow has plunged more than 300 points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A CNN exclusive: Facebook`s Mark Zuckerberg will testify on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And Angela Merkel and Donald Trump promised to team up against China on trade. We`ll analyze what that means.</p><p>I`m Richard Quest, live from the world`s financial capital, New York City, where, even on a down day for the Dow, I mean business.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Good evening. The Dow has plunged more than 300 points during the last hour of trade. The Dow is now officially at a correction. And you look at what happened, it was a tech selloff that took the market lower.</p><p>But look closely, all day it`s been pretty much up by several hundred points. In the early afternoon, that dwindled. You get a couple of bumps and then late, just before 3 o`clock, the selloff begins. Investors are worried about regulation and the technology and the huge amount of government borrowing.</p><p>Facebook closed down nearly 5 percent on worries of what`s happening to the stock. We`ll talk about Mark Zuckerberg giving testimony.</p><p>Tesla fell by 8 percent over worries over what is happening there. The Vida (ph) by a similar amount and Twitter closed down 11 percent after an investor shorted the stock, believing its short price was $25 a share.</p><p>Alison Kosik is at the New York Stock Exchange for us at the moment.</p><p>Alison, we look at the graph of what happened to the Dow and it really is a simple question to begin with.</p><p>What happened just before 3 o`clock that turned the market sour?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I think what you`re seeing is a market, Richard, that`s really being headline driven. And I think all of the things that were bothering the market over the past several weeks, all of those things haven`t gone away.</p><p>Trade fears, yes, an all-out trade war, those fears have rested. But the reality is the situation isn`t over yet. Facebook still has its credibility issue despite Zuckerberg going and saying that he`s going to go testify to Congress.</p><p>Those rising interest rates, rising inflation, that is heavy on investors` minds, especially because the government is looking to borrow $300 billion this weekend as it would have to pay a lot more money for it.</p><p>So the reality is an already anxious market is made to feel more anxious when you have these big names, big companies coming out with bad headlines.</p><p>I haven`t even mentioned Nvidia.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But the interesting thing about this, Alison, is that the market has spent all session higher and then it is the suddenness -- which I understand is the volatility that we expect at the moment.</p><p>But that suddenness can put investors firmly on the wrong side of the trade.</p><p>KOSIK: Right. So if you look at how the trade happened today, we saw that - - let`s talk about the Dow. The Dow`s not -- the S&amp;P but let`s talk about the Dow. The Dow got as high as 200 points but it couldn`t hold there. We saw it sort of churn and move lower and lower.</p><p>And then it just hit a level and there you go, sentiment over Facebook really rattled the market. Tech stocks across the board were hit. It was sort of sudden and it really is a tech sector issue today that really moved the market lower as a whole -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, Alison Kosik, thank you.</p><p>Before we move on to our next story, let`s look again at that chart of the Dow 30 because earlier in the session, it was a complete reversal. It was all green except and then as the day moved on, it completely turned around to the point.</p><p>Some statistics to give you an idea of just what a day it was. The point swing was 737 points. It was as much high as 243 higher, down as much as 493 with a similar point swing, obviously at the lower levels on the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Facebook shares were down even before the broader market turned red. Facebook closed off 5 percent on Tuesday and it brings the losses over the last month to 18 percent. The steepness of the decline is what is disconcerting.</p><p>Now sources are telling CNN that Facebook`s --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>QUEST: -- chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has decided to testify before Congress in the next few weeks. The same sources believed this willingness will put pressure on the chief execs of Google and Twitter to do the same.</p><p>Zuckerberg won`t, though, be going to the U.K. to speak to Parliament. Facebook plans to send two senior executives instead. All as we learn about the scandal.</p><p>Chris Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says his firm gave other companies access to Facebook`s user data. Clamantier (ph), one of the companies Wylie named, has denied this.</p><p>So coming developments on both sides of the Atlantic. Dylan Byers is in Los Angeles; Samuel Burke is in London.</p><p>Dylan, to your first. On the decision to testify before the Judiciary Committee or whichever committee, trade and commerce committee, whichever one it turns out to be, did Zuckerberg really have any choice?</p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No. By the time this scandal metastasized to the point it has gotten to, absolutely not. There was a hope by Zuckerberg and by other executives at Facebook that by going out and addressing the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as he did in an interview with CNN last week, that maybe he could stem the tide.</p><p>He said at the time, you know, if needed, I will come forward and testify but he was hoping that that would have been enough to stem the damage. Obviously it is not. The calls from lawmakers, the media, the public to get Mark Zuckerberg to go to Capitol Hill, to appear before Congress and to account for all of the abuse of user data, that has happened over the course of recent weeks, that we now know about, that pressure became too much for Mark Zuckerberg to ignore this problem.</p><p>QUEST: So, Samuel Burke in London, I hesitate to use the word but I will -- snubbing or shunning Parliament in favor of Congress.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For now. Right now, we`re just a few hours before Dylan broke the news that Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress, he did snub the U.K. Parliament but the head of the committee that has been investigating all this has been very persistent, time and time again, coming back to these executives, coming back to these companies, not letting go.</p><p>Let us just take a listen to what this MP, Damian Collins (ph), said after Mark Zuckerberg had rejected his invitation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH MP: We believe, given the serious nature of the allegations that have been made around the access and use of Facebook user data that is it appropriate that Mark Zuckerberg should give evidence to the committee.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: After everything that Christopher Wylie told that committee today, even more pressure for Zuckerberg to testify, I think it is less likely the whole pond to separate him here. I do not think that they are not going to give up and trying to make him do it here as well.</p><p>QUEST: But Dylan, surely -- obviously Facebook, U.S. company registered in the U.S., only U.S. markets, it makes sense to testify before Congress because, if you go down the road of the Parliament and the French parliament wants you, the Australian parliament wants you, the bundestag wants you, and before long, everybody is saying, well, you did them, why aren`t you are talking to us?</p><p>BYERS: Richard, what you are saying is exactly what Facebook sources were telling me this morning and last night. That is the issue. At the end of the day, Facebook is a California company. If Mark Zuckerberg is going to come forward anywhere, he is going to come forward here in the United States.</p><p>Once he goes to London, he opens himself up to going everywhere. There is also a feeling here that any of the questions that U.S. regulators will have, U.S. lawmakers will have, will satisfy the demands of London, of others. Obviously, Sam Burke knows a lot more about that. I would --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKE: -- if you let me jump in there, Richard, I just have to say they are so much more stringent about data restriction on this side of the Atlantic that they would certainly say we have many more questions for Mark Zuckerberg than they ever could over on your guys` side of the pond.</p><p>QUEST: Quick answer, in a sentence from both of you, Samuel first, then to you, Dylan.</p><p>Samuel, how much -- how much further has this scandal got to go?</p><p>How much more does the tech community believe is out there waiting to be discovered?</p><p>Samuel first, then Dylan.</p><p>BURKE: A lot more and Twitter might be much more vulnerable than Facebook. That is why their stock went down 12 percent today. They sell a lot of data.</p><p>BYERS: Richard, I would just say and I mean this sincerely, this is a never-ending problem for Facebook, for Google, for Twitter and the reason is simple. Data sharing, harvesting user data and passing it onto others is caked into the DNA of what these companies do.</p><p>This is a never-ending problem for these companies. The second they stop having this problem is the second they stop being companies.</p><p>QUEST: Gentlemen in the Pacific and in London, thank you.</p><p>And you ought to subscribe --</p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>QUEST: to Dylan`s newsletter and there`s absolutely no reason why you wouldn`t want to -- cnnpacific.com, Pacific with Dylan Byers, absolutely it must be read.</p><p>You saw in the markets today the data scandal is catching up with Silicon Valley`s biggest companies. Samuel was just talking about it. Now let`s just remind ourselves about the gravity and the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>You`ve got Facebook, which has been sued by civil rights groups. It claims Facebook used data to target ads and discriminate. You`ve then got, if you get rid of Facebook and you look at Twitter, Twitter, as we`re talking about, the shares down 12 percent partly because they could be vulnerable as well.</p><p>But then the research companies that Twitter is most vulnerable to privacy regulation as Samuel was saying and you`ve got the shorting of the stock because of the idea of it being $25.</p><p>So there`s a lot -- there`s a short out there, a sizable short out there that is weighing down on the market.</p><p>So who takes advantage of this? Well, arguably, Apple takes advantage of this. Apple takes advantage with the execs highlighting Facebook`s weakness, trying to show Apple as ethical. Today it`s unveiled education tools. It is a highly risky strategy when you stop playing yourself off as being white to the white against the others because you never know what comes next.</p><p>Scott Galloway is the marketing professor at the New York University and the author of \"The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\"</p><p>Good to see you, Scott, as always. And the machinations now of the situation we are in with these four and with this situation, how much worse does it get?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, NYU: Oh, we know that is the only thing we know for certain, Richard, is that it`s going to get worse. This is the underlying business model of the Internet and that`s to gather data as seamlessly as possible and then to distribute it to advertisers so that they can understand how to target you better.</p><p>This is -- this is the underlying business of the Internet. When you get a product for free, it means you are the product.</p><p>QUEST: And when we`re talking about the data -- I understand people get very het up about this. But if you are just talking about your name, your age, where you happen to live or log in from, isn`t that just a given that we all expect that to be bandied around?</p><p>Or are we talking about a much deeper level of information?</p><p>GALLOWAY: That is the correct point, Richard, because basically consumers have voted with their activities by saying we are willing to give up privacy for utility. But there are some nuance here.</p><p>If you`re served an ad for an Adele album because you are at an Adele concert and the Facebook ambient noise listening technology is taking advantage of that and serving you a relevant ad, that might be a little bit creepy but you do not mind.</p><p>But when it comes to things such as religion or politics or health or sexual orientation, we are not comfortable with our data or our friends` data being mined such that it can be used.</p><p>And even more than that, we`re really uncomfortable that Facebook especially seems to put -- have put up no safeguards, no guardrails whatsoever, such that their platform, which is now a community greater than the -- greater than the size of Christianity can be weaponized by bad actors.</p><p>QUEST: So who is most vulnerable?</p><p>Facebook is clearly in an existential crisis at the moment.</p><p>But what about Twitter?</p><p>Instagram?</p><p>What about, for example, Google, which, if anybody has marketed to perfection and developed to perfection the amortization of material and data, it has to be Alphabet and Google.</p><p>GALLOWAY: The top three most vulnerable are Facebook, Facebook and Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg has become the unwitting poster boy for everything bad about the attack; they are -- we are in the midst of a textbook case study in how not to handle a crisis.</p><p>They have refused to acknowledge the issue; the top guy or gal seem to be allergic to preparing. They`ve retreated to what appear to be the caves of Kandahar when this crisis broke out and the key to any crisis is overcorrecting.</p><p>You talk about Uber, that the terrible death down in Arizona, the CEO immediately stopped all self-test -- self-driving tests. Facebook has really said nothing but the platform will continue to be weaponized by bad actors.</p><p>We`re in the midst of what will go down as the worst handled crisis in history.</p><p>QUEST: So let me postulate you that there actually is not much they could do. The speed with which this has grown, the nature, $2 billion in just a decade or so, no organization, no government would be able to be put in place the systems necessary for the full protection of information --</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: -- advertising, the monitoring of advertising that goes on the site. It is just not possible.</p><p>GALLOWAY: I think you are exactly carrying the narrative the Big Techs want you to carry, Richard. If CNN can protect us from being weaponized by the intelligence unit of the Russian government with a few hundred million in free cash flow, then Facebook can figure it out with 20 billion in free cash flow.</p><p>The argument that we are so profitable and have so many advertisers, 5 million, and there`s so much free content being served up that we can run those ads against, make it impossible for us to regulate or screen this content, is nonsense.</p><p>Every media company in the world has figured this out except for Big Tech, which for some reason we provide the mother of all hall passes to. This isn`t the world we live in. This is the world we make of it.</p><p>And for some reason, we have decided that these innovators are not subject to the same scrutiny. It is just not true that they could not stop this.</p><p>QUEST: Scott, next time you`re around, we want you here, talk more about it on the set. Thank you very much, sir. Good to see you.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Later in the program we are going to talk about the Uber story and what has happened with that. And you`re also going to hear from the Weymouth (ph) chief executive, who is pressing on with drivers technology despite recent scares in that sector. Before Wall Street`s world got turned upside down, there was, as you saw from the chart, a surging of stocks. And investors think a trade war might be averted.</p><p>The former German economy minister is not so sure. It`s after the break. It`s QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live from New York.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Welcome back.</p><p>Markets in Europe plowed high on Tuesday. Now they fed off the Monday rally and they had seen arguably the best of the New York opening session. Look at the best gains in London and in Zurich.</p><p>And the reason was of course talk of a trade war appear to be diminishing. President Trump`s tariffs look like they`ll be applied more with a scalpel than a sledgehammer. Speaking of Beijing, Blackstone`s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman (ph), who`s close to the president, told Chinese television nobody wants a trade war.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, BLACKSTONE CEO: It`s not in anyone`s long-term interest and I think there is a lot of opportunity to do something that`s productive. I like to have win-win outcomes. And I believe you can have this in this scenario.</p><p>I think you have to look through sort of the current noise and concentrate on what does it take to reset in a productive way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There are (INAUDIBLE) at work in the White House under President Obama, Bush 43 and the senior counsel to the U.S. trade representative. He joins me from London.</p><p>Good to see you, sir. The reality is so far it`s a promise or a hope --</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>QUEST: -- or the prospect that there won`t be a trade war.</p><p>For example, the conversations that have taken place between the U.S. and China, or between the U.S., Germany and France, but nobody suggested that the U.S. is going to roll back on the Chinese sanctions or tariffs.</p><p>ROD HUNTER, FORMER SENIOR COUNSEL, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: Well, that is right we are still very early in this process. We had last year, where it was essentially a phony war, the president, the administration said a lot of things about trade, often very critical.</p><p>And only the last couple of months have we actually had concrete measures with real effect on private individuals.</p><p>And this past week was perhaps the most dramatic.</p><p>QUEST: But there is an acceptance by all seemingly except the Chinese that the Chinese have cheated, the Chinese have dumped steel and aluminum, hence the tariffs there, and that they`ve stolen I.P;, hence the tariffs there.</p><p>The issue is not what they have done but the measures necessary to remedy it.</p><p>HUNTER: All that is right, of course. The Chinese, perhaps, have a different view of their situation and this administration and indeed even the Obama administration began to raise serious concerns about the Chinese practices.</p><p>I think what is unusual here with this administration -- I am sorry?</p><p>QUEST: No, no, no, I was just going to jump in on that. But they need to remember --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUNTER: I think what is unusual about this administration -- I am sorry. I can`t hear you.</p><p>QUEST: Fine, so forgive me; it`s me. I jumped in there. I thought you`d finished. But let me ask the next question.</p><p>I think what is interesting about this administration is that they need to also ensure that the Chinese continue to purchase U.S. government bonds.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: We appear to have lost the line to London there and we`ll come back to Rod in just a moment. I thought he -- difficulties there, some difficulties. We`ll sort that out.</p><p>Now when they first met last March, President Trump refused to shake Angela Merkel`s hand. Now relations between president and the Bundeskanzler appear to be warming. They`ve been speaking on the phone today. And both sides that they wanted a cooperative relationship.</p><p>The White House says the pair discussed joining forces to counter China`s unfair trade practices, including the stealing of intellectual property.</p><p>On tariffs, they talked about leveling the playing field. Germany says Ms. Merkel called for dialogue and wants new trade rules. They also discussed North Korea and Russia.</p><p>Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is former economy minister of Germany and defense minister, joins me now.</p><p>Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KARL-THEODOR ZU GUTTENBERG, FORMER GERMANY ECONOMY MINISTER: Lovely to see you.</p><p>QUEST: Is there really common ground between Germany and the U.S. on this?</p><p>GUTTENBERG: Isn`t it bizarre that we have to talk about this after so many years of cooperation and actually friendship and it`s not but a corporate relationship.</p><p>So there is some common ground when it comes to China. This is what I think. We have a shared interest here. And if this administration starts to understand that it is worthwhile to align forces and to be more efficient if you work together with Germany or the European Union on China, that`s really a step forward.</p><p>I am still very cautious on the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: How can they all work together when, in the one breath -- and we`ll come to Rod Hunter, who`s in London, to join in this discussions in just a second, if we have him back -- how can -- how can you have common cause when you`ve threatened the Germans only two weeks previously on steel and aluminum?</p><p>GUTTENBERG: And that, Richard, is exactly why I still have my serious doubt that this president overnight more or less got rid of his zero-sum mentality he has shown for so many weeks and months.</p><p>On the other hand he is obviously approaching some kind of a deadlock here. He`s not coming further with what he has promised to his electorate and he needs partners. And he might have understood, to a certain extent, that the Chinese only win if they separate and if they diverge the so-called Western unity.</p><p>And they have exactly done.</p><p>But Rod Hunter in London, the question I ask you is how can you have an agreement with China but at the same time you do require China to continue funding your debt, your ever growing deficit, through the purchase of bonds?</p><p>HUNTER: Well, the United States is China`s biggest customer and so China has an interest in finding a solution that works. And though cooperating with Europeans, of course, would be very important to a sitting thing that happened is in fact as a consequence of these steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>QUEST: The reality is -- I`m pausing just to collect my thoughts -- in the space of three months gone from tariffs on steel and aluminum, tariffs on intellectual property. We have got the WTO --</p><p>[16:25:00]</p><p>QUEST: -- almost on its last legs. We`ve got NAFTA breathing its last over renegotiation. The TPP has been refashioned.</p><p>GUTTENBERG: Right. TTIP is buried.</p><p>QUEST: TTIP, I`d forgotten about that. That never got out the gate.</p><p>The reality is, what does Germany want from this administration?</p><p>GUTTENBERG: Well, I think it was a quite clever approach by the chancellor after six months of being entirely silent, trying to form a coalition in Germany, to step up. Somehow (INAUDIBLE) step up, reach out now to President Trump and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>You need to work with us, otherwise you will not achieve what you would like to achieve with China, first point.</p><p>Second point, it is an entry gate for us, Germany, to renegotiate with you what we would like to see on the horizon on trade issues coming together with Europe.</p><p>So she might even push him into some kind of renegotiating TTIP approach. And I think -- yes, of course, I would do the same thing since I would be from the U.K. in that regard.</p><p>But I think that is behind the whole thing.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>But, Rod, is there strategy behind this or is this, as the -- as you see -- as you see, is there strategy behind any of this?</p><p>Or is this just making it up as they go along?</p><p>We`ll put it to you.</p><p>GUTTENBERG: Well, I rarely see anything that comes close to strategy coming from the White House. The only strategy is more or less tweeted ever single morning and then retweeted maybe at this or that point.</p><p>From a German different perspective, I do see a strategy. The strategy is not to slide entirely into a trade war scenario but actually keep talking to someone, to someone who still somehow listens at least to the German chancellor.</p><p>QUEST: But how damaged -- not damaged, wrong word -- weakened is the chancellor?</p><p>She has got her fourth term but it is her last term to all intents and purposes, you are smiling. It is her last term --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTTENBERG: -- will be a surprise, yes.</p><p>QUEST: And she is not in full command.</p><p>GUTTENBERG: She would at least pretend to be in full command and I see her in command of a another grand coalition, of struggling with the term \"grand,\" of course, in this context.</p><p>But she is one of the few in Europe who still has some leverage around the globe. Do not forget that. And there are still some Americans who believe she is the last woman standing in this regard.</p><p>Is she damaged after last year to a certain extent, yes.</p><p>QUEST: Good to have you on this side, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much.</p><p>So General Electric was one of the first companies to be put on the Dow Jones Industrial Average that still has its same name and its same form. It`ll lucky to remain there much longer even with a 6 percent gain today.</p><p>[16:30:00] RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: I am Richard Quest. And there`s a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS of course in just a moment. When the crumbling tech is not only Facebook, we`ll show you why Tesla lost 7 percent and the media shared almost 10 percent, we`ll discuss that in a moment.</p><p>And all of a sudden, while civilized cricket is rocked by a cheating scandal that really beg us belief. You`re watching Cnn, and on this network, we guarantee you that the facts will always come first.</p><p>Wednesday is a day of national mourning in Russia as the country remembers the victims of Sunday`s deadly mall fire in Siberia. The fire at the shopping center killed at least 64 people, 41 of them were children.</p><p>President of Russia, Vladimir Putin blames criminal negligence and carelessness for the fire. Four people have so far being detained after serious violations have been discovered including locked doors and fire alarms that didn`t work.</p><p>South Korea and officials says it`s extremely or highly likely that the mysterious train that left Beijing on Tuesday carried Kim Jong-un. China won`t confirm that, but if true, will be the North Korean leader`s first trip abroad since taking power.</p><p>It`s believed he may be consulting China about possible talks with President Trump. Authorities in Paris are investigating the murder of a holocaust survivor as a suspected anti-Semitic attack. Police found the body of 85-year-old Mireille Knoll on Friday, she was dead in her apartment, she had been stabbed 11 times and her home had been set on fire.</p><p>Two suspects had been arrested and the attack has triggered cause for protests. Israel`s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has been admitted to a hospital because of a high fever and a bad cough.</p><p>The Prime Minister fell ill with the flu two weeks ago, a statement from his office says his doctors think Mr. Netanyahu did not get enough rest to fully recover.</p><p>And we told you earlier how many videos shares dropped as it suspended self-driving car tests, now one of Uber`s rivals is pressing ahead with new driver`s technology. Waymo is Alphabet`s autonomous car division.</p><p>Waymo plans to turn the Jaguar I-PACE into a self-driving luxury taxi. Testing is due to begin this year, Waymo and CEO insists it will go ahead even after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KRAFCIK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WAYMO INCORPORATED: Well, it was a tragic accident, and you know, it`s sort of when you think about it, one of the reasons that we`re here, and why we`ve been working on this technology for so long.</p><p>We`ve been at it for more than nine years, we started as the Google self- driving car project, we`ve now driven over 5 million miles on autonomous road -- in autonomous mode on public roads, and we`ve tested our software and our sensing through lots of different scenario testing and are proven.</p><p>We have over 20,000 challenging tasks that we put our cars and our technology through, and we validate all that through the virtual world, 5 billion miles of simulation where we test the cars in a really challenging environment just to make sure everything is safe.</p><p>Our confidence springs from the fact that we`ve been working on this for so long, and we`ve been focused throughout this mission on ensuring the safety of the cars and the technology.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Arguably we would say the same thing. Waymo testing its services in Arizona, Clare Sebastian is here. Remind us what happened in the Uber case.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN: Well, sir, 18th of March, there was the first, what we know to be the first fatal accident involving a pedestrian with one of Uber`s cars. And last night, the governor of Arizona sent a letter to Uber CEO which he shared with the media where he said, basically, you know, you can`t do it anymore.</p><p>Just Uber, that is not Waymo, not GM, not any of the other ones, he said you can`t test your autonomous cars on the roads of Arizona anymore.</p><p>QUEST: What have they discovered about Uber that leads them to that conclusion other than the fact that something did happen that went wrong. I mean, you know, is this the case, is this believed to be a case that Uber has done something wrong or is it all of them?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, again, it`s just -- it`s just Uber that Arizona is specifically targeting. Uber`s response was that we proactively pull all of autonomous cars out of all the cities where we`ve been testing. And that`s four cities in North America.</p><p>But I actually -- I wanted to find out -- to answer that question myself, so I went back to the governor of Arizona`s office, and I said, well, what precipitated this? You know, it`s a week or so or more, more than now since the crash happened.</p><p>The latter seems to suggest that it was the police video that was dash-cam video showing the moment when this happened. But they simply said, you know, the governor has been consistent in his view that public safety should be a top priority.</p><p>And he -- you know, the accident raises questions about Uber`s ability to continue testing. Now, let`s say he called it an unquestionable failure by Uber to comply with his expectation that public safety should be at the forefront of this.</p><p>[16:35:00] But this is a huge turnaround --</p><p>QUEST: Right, so now Uber has been banned in this way or at least suspended. Other companies have done what?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, so they -- as you saw with the CEO --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Of Waymo, very dramatically distancing himself from this. Playing on the idea that they have more experience, they`ve got more testing -- that`s the same thing we`ve heard from a company called Mobile-i which is owned by Intel.</p><p>They also do a driverless car technology. They came out and informed press and said, look, you know, the new players and listen, you need to watch them, we are the experienced players.</p><p>So this is an industry in transition, you know, and --</p><p>QUEST: But it`s going to happen. Autonomous vehicles -- you know, I mean, I feel sympathy in terms of the dreadfulness of what took place. But we are at the beginning of a nation`s revolution in transportation.</p><p>I`m sure when people started flying, there were these sort of incidents, but it didn`t stop us moving forward to build aeroplanes, rockets and go to the moon.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: No, but it`s still very important how the companies handle it. As we get particularly a company like Uber which is under so much scrutiny for the way it`s handled, you know, scandals in the past.</p><p>So I think that is the key --</p><p>QUEST: But Clare, is there any suggestion at the moment that Uber has done something wrong or done something different other than the natural vicissitudes of this testing that when something failed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: We don`t know. The NTSB which is the body that investigates air crash is investigating this, so is the National Highway Transportation Authority, so is the police in Tempe, Arizona.</p><p>That -- the result of that investigation or what everyone is waiting for, including the governor of Arizona or to reinstate testing.</p><p>QUEST: Here we go, thank you. Now, as we move on. The company, the slogan used to be, we bring good things to life, GE`s stock finally came back to life. I wish we would perhaps have had a drum roll today.</p><p>Remember yesterday when the market was up 600 and something points, and GE was the only stock that was down -- so fast, tiger, we`re going up here. There we go because GE is -- was the best performer amongst the Dow.</p><p>The stock rose 4 percent, it had actually been up some 6.5 percent earlier in the session after being the only loser on a huge rally. Rumor has it, as a buyer, possibly Warren Buffett who could start hovering up shares at a discount.</p><p>Now the stock has been cut in half in the last year. And it was one of the drops of the Dow, and even in the beginning of this year, when it looked like it might be about to benefit from having -- but now, but no, it went down even further, and it`s down at 30, now 44.</p><p>We haven`t seen these prices since 2008 and `09. Time to look forward to New York Stock Exchange, GE has left traders scratching their heads.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At some point, you know, you can`t kick a dead horse anymore. But I think the question for GE is how much patience do you have and how long will it take?</p><p>You know, even if broken clock is right twice a day, and sooner or later, the stock probably should stabilize and do better. Let`s hope. Let`s hope.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jim Corridore is the director of Industrials Equity Research at CFRA, he joins me from New York. No matter what GE does, the stock goes down arguably with exception of today. What`s gone wrong?</p><p>JIM CORRIDORE, DIRECTOR, INDUSTRIALS EQUITY RESEARCH, CFRA: Well, GE has had transformation after transformation, restructuring charge after charge. And there`s been a lot of shoes to drop on the company.</p><p>Every time they have an earnings call, they announce a new charge, most recently, the $6.5 billion insurance write-offs and the $15 billion reserve that they had set up for future claims against -- and a business that they haven`t been in 20 years.</p><p>So every time that investors start to think that maybe this stock is bottomed-out and things are going to start to improve, there seems to be another charge --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CORRIDORE: And that it`s gotten in the way of the stock.</p><p>QUEST: All right, but if we look at the core businesses of GE, now they got rid of so many of them, but it`s now medical services, high tech type of stuff, they moved to research, they moved to headquarters.</p><p>Is the firm fundamentally solid on its product base?</p><p>CORRIDORE: We think that they are the leader in many of its business segments like you mentioned aerospace, they`re great in oil and gas, they`re great in medical, they have very good technological advantages in a lot of businesses they operate in.</p><p>But the problem is the balance sheet is at risk, these charges that keep happening make investors very weary, and there has to be some issue as to what kind of violation do you attach to a stock that hasn`t risen earnings in a generation.</p><p>QUEST: OK, in that situation, all we -- and I know that this -- the new CEO has said that a full review of the portfolio is warranted.</p><p>[16:40:00] Do you see the breakup value being greater than some of the polls?</p><p>CORRIDORE: No, it`s our view that the company is more valuable as a conglomerate, that these pieces do share a common R&amp;D, common sourcing of materials and common customers that you may not expect, that does allow it to generate synergies from being together that would not be there if they were apart.</p><p>Also if you broke up a company, it`s important to note that the capital division, the financial services arm of the company, a lot of debt that is attached to that division would go to the individual units, making those units less valuable than they appear to be.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but if you`re right, sir, then eventually, the balance sheet woes of the capital and then the insurance losses will dwindle out and the company does have a strong, sustainable profitable business.</p><p>But we`re just not seeing any evidence of that.</p><p>CORRIDORE: Well, Wall Street is very impatient right, so the new CEO John Flannery came into place in August, in November, he announces latest restructuring action. These things take some time to work.</p><p>So he is the new CEO, he needs a little bit of time in fact to do it. So we need to see a year or so. Wall Street is interested in the next quarter, in the next day, they keep -- starting it`s not been the stock, and obviously as things don`t come to fruition, the stock goes lower each time.</p><p>QUEST: All right --</p><p>CORRIDORE: So we need to see one to two quarters of the company hitting targets, media expectations and then the stock can move from there.</p><p>QUEST: The rumor today was that Warren Buffett is taking a stake, and that`s what raised -- talking about 6 percent. The other story of course is that if it carries on like this, the ratio of the stock price for the rest of the Dow components means it gets kicked out of the Dow.</p><p>So take either of those two rumors, which one do you like and which one don`t you? Warren Buffett or kicked out the Dow.</p><p>CORRIDORE: Yes, first of all, I would be very surprised if Warren Buffett wants to wade into the complexity that is GE. I could certainly see him being interested in buying one of the assets, GE has many fine divisions that`s running profitably.</p><p>If GE is interested in divesting, I think Buffett would be a big player there. But to buy the entire company, I think that`s a false --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CORRIDORE: Rumor. In terms of being kicked out of the Dow, I think that`s more likely.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you for joining us, I appreciate it, thank you.</p><p>CORRIDORE: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: As it prepares to go public, Spotify is making big promises about user growth after online pirating nearly killed the music industry streaming, breathing new life into it. I`ll be speaking to the chief executive of SoundCloud coming up next.</p><p>QUEST: The music streaming service Spotify is closing in on a 100 million paid subscribers. Those who listen to the free version could reach double less number by the end of the year. And it comes as music sales are enjoying a renaissance.</p><p>Sales in the U.S. grew by 17 percent, nearly $9 billion according to the Recording Industry Association of America. It`s streaming and downloads that are the driving force of growth.</p><p>[16:45:00] Kerry Trainor of the SoundCloud which calls itself the world`s largest music and audio platform. It`s really good to see you, sir.</p><p>KERRY TRAINOR, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SOUNDCLOUD: Likewise, thanks so much for having me.</p><p>QUEST: Every -- you have watched others come --</p><p>TRAINOR: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: And go.</p><p>TRAINOR: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: You have watched the MySpaces rise and fall, the Spotifys be challenged by the Googles and the Apples and stuff. But you continue to stick to what you do, which is both firmly designed around the music industry.</p><p>Is that the secret of the success?</p><p>TRAINOR: It is, and you know, for SoundCloud, we focus on the creator first. Right, we are -- we are an open consistent where any creator can use our tools to share their work with the world. That gives us a very unique catalogue of content that creates a great experience for listeners.</p><p>But for us, the focus is on the creators outward. Right, we are not just a one-way system delivering streaming, we are a platform for creators to use, where they come first to upload their work, build their audience and because of that, we have over 175 million tracks in our catalogue.</p><p>As compared with less than 50, even less than 40 or some of the major services.</p><p>QUEST: OK, but the risk and the danger is always -- you`ve been asked this a gazillion times, is that somebody else tries and succeeds in doing a me too and it takes off.</p><p>Because you only have one string to pull from the barn(ph) to the bow.</p><p>TRAINOR: Well, no, actually, I think that we uniquely have both strings to the bow as you say, which is that because we just come out of it from the creator first. Right, because we serve the creator so well, we have a differentiated catalogue of content.</p><p>In fact, we are the only streaming service with de facto exclusive content becoming -- coming directly from creators, in addition to that, it comes from major labels.</p><p>QUEST: Now tell me, you`ve had your fair bit of old copyright issues and difficulties which creates a byzantine complexity which the only people who seem to make money out of are your lawyers.</p><p>TRAINOR: Well, but the music industry is historically quite complex in terms of the way the rights were, and you know, now the exciting thing is, there is a model for the consumption of music and that uses our pain from music again, I think puts us in an exciting place to rebase line.</p><p>But for us, who we focus on most again is that creator who wants to share their work directly with the world.</p><p>QUEST: It would be remissive if I didn`t take you straight into the depths of the current issue over privacy.</p><p>TRAINOR: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Now, you talk about the creators are your starting and finish line. You also have a lot of data on people --</p><p>TRAINOR: We do --</p><p>QUEST: And you will in no doubt tell me as Mark Zuckerberg would have told me six weeks ago, nothing more important than protecting the data, and look where we are with Facebook.</p><p>Do you -- what do you take from the Facebook fiasco of a data?</p><p>TRAINOR: Look, I think data absolutely must be taken seriously and we do as a company, and I think the consumers are out demanding more of the services they use. We as a company that ultimately, it was incubated and grew up in the EU.</p><p>We -- our headquarters remains in Berlin, so as you may know, there`s a new standard that`s rolling out, the GDP our standard, which we will of course be adhering to. And so it`s something that we take seriously and we`ll continue to take seriously.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think that difference, the new European standard which is extremely tight, very difficult and arguably exceptionally complicated --</p><p>TRAINOR: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: To follow them. Do you think that creates a different mindset for tech companies in Europe versus those here in the United States?</p><p>TRAINOR: Look, I think it potentially does, and this is one of those areas, it`s just -- we`re seeing this evolve in real time, right? And I think that now people`s expectations are going to be catching up to the realities of how far the technology`s come.</p><p>And I think we`re going to see government in the EU and it sounds like likely in the United States potentially take a firmer hand here.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you sir --</p><p>TRAINOR: Likewise --</p><p>QUEST: I visited the SoundCloud offices in Berlin, an extremely --</p><p>TRAINOR: Well, we`d love to have you back, then come on --</p><p>QUEST: No, that`s an invitation --</p><p>TRAINOR: Will you?</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much. As we continue tonight, it`s QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A bull-tampering scandal has left Australia`s cricket sponsors scratching their heads. Just from everyone, from the prime minister downwards has attacked the national team because it was the most extraordinary plot to cheat.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Welcome back. As you`re getting the view of the day as you can see, it`s truly been a very busy day, and we do need to update you on some business -- on the move.</p><p>All right, so if we take a look at those -- starting off with GSK and Nevada steel, it`s a $13 billion deal where pills have been put together and makes for all a great deal of interest.</p><p>Heineken has a sex scandal that has been brewing for the beer company, the company says but it didn`t mean to appeal against a racism route when it came forward with the kind of beer.</p><p>And to Australia where the cricket scandal, the sponsor Qantas, now says it is bemused and can`t quite understand exactly what happened when the cricket ball was described as terribly disappointing. Fast business on the move.</p><p>Jim Callinan from \"Fox Sports\", he`s Australian, joins me for more on the cheating scandal form Sydney. It does beg a belief what happened and the way it happened. And arguably, the brazenness of what happened.</p><p>JIM CALLINAN, FOX SPORTS, AUSTRALIA: Just extraordinary is it, we`re all trying to get our heads around it on this side of the globe as well as you would well know from your background, Richard.</p><p>This is how true national sport where you hold the position of captain of the Australian cricket saying it`s high if not perhaps high than that about Prime Minister. So when they`re involved in something of this nature, it is gravest of scenes when it comes to the sporting world.</p><p>As we now know, the captain or former captain, should I say, he`s deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft are on the next flight back to Australia to really face the music. They are going to face significant sanctions after they were found to and admitted to tampering the ball.</p><p>Which as you and I both know, in the world of cricket, it`s tantamount to out-loud cheating.</p><p>QUEST: It is out-loud cheating, why do they do it? That`s the key point. I mean, it was brazen, it was obvious, it was clearly against the rules and it was cheating. Every time somebody has tampered with the ball in such a pattern, they usually get caught out, why do they do it?</p><p>CALLINAN: You`re getting comical to that, wasn`t it? The scenes that we saw in Cape Town were just extraordinary after yes, they had some suspicions over what they were doing in previous tests and therefore were heavily scrutinized by cameras.</p><p>And then it was -- they were playing to see exactly what played that. Just exactly why did they do it, Richard? Well, that is the million-dollar question. Until we hear from those three again now with the cold blood of day, and no really no desperation --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CALLINAN: Cheating. I think they had the three probably points behind it all, and now, they are facing reputations tarnished for the rest of their careers, and now you would have imagined lengthy suspensions that are also going to hit them firmly in the heat pockets.</p><p>Dave, Smith and thus --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>CALLINAN: Warner both play in the IPO on 2.4 million deals, safe to say both those deals now very much in question.</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: Good to see you sir, thank you very much indeed. Extraordinary story, one of cheating. As we continue on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we`ll have our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight`s profitable moment, it`s worth just pausing for a moment and just looking at the way the market moved throughout the course of the day. And as we consider what it is that took place and how a market that had gone up maybe 300 points then suddenly fell 300 at the close.</p><p>Volatility, yes, is back, but let`s also go underneath this and look at the undercurrents. You`ve got the aluminium and steel tariffs issue. You`ve got the China and the intellectual property tariffs on the horizon.</p><p>You`ve got a president that is mired in a sex scandal over who did what, when and why? You`ve got trade talks that may or may not be taking place. You`ve got extremely difficult issues of growth in some part of the world, rising interest rates in the United States.</p><p>The withdrawal of QE in Europe. Let`s be clear about this, what we have shown you tonight is that there are many strands at the moment, difficult, complicated and anyone of which can derail the market.</p><p>The only thing that we can say with any degree of certainty is that the volatility that we saw in February has returned and there were 100-point moves by the minute during the course of the day.</p><p>And one economists say that it won`t continue for the foreseeable future. And that`s QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I`m Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you`re up to in the hours ahead, hope it`s profitable. We`ll do it again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032701cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S00-8VY1-DXH2-61VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded and to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Without objection, it is so ordered. Justice In Policing Act Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, Americans are demanding an end to the persistent racial injustice and violence that inflicts our country. Protestors have gathered outside of the White House and the Capitol. New Mexicans from our biggest city to our smallest communities are marching for meaningful change. I have joined these protests in Emancipation Hall, in the streets of Washington, DC, and now I am joining them from the U.S Senate floor. The systemic racism being called out is real, and it is all around us all of the time. Within law enforcement, we have seen it in the horrific videos documenting the racist violence that took the lives of Black men and women at the hands of police officers and extrajudicial killers. As a father raising two sons, my heart aches for the parents whose sons' and daughters' names we now chant loudly in the streets. It is unacceptable for any American to live in fear of violent encounters when they enter public spaces or retail stores or just go out for a walk. The very fact that painful experiences with law enforcement are ubiquitous among so many in our Nation should be evidence enough that our current model of policing is not working. That is why I am proud to support my colleagues Senator Booker and Senator Harris to cosponsor the Justice in Policing Act. This sweeping legislation reforms the police system as Americans across the country demand an end to police violence that is disproportionately targeting communities of color. It would address qualified immunity standards in Federal law which currently stand in the way of police officers being held accountable in court when they violate constitutional rights. It would improve transparency in police departments by creating a national police misconduct registry, requiring accurate data reporting on misconduct and use-of-force incidents and ensuring problematic officers cannot avoid accountability by simply changing departments. It would also institute a real national ban on choke holds and other deadly, restrictive airway holds. We have seen this use of lethal force kill George Floyd and Eric Garner before him and earlier this year, in Las Cruces, NM, when a police officer killed Antonio Valenzuela with a vascular neck restraint. While I hope that justice will be served for Mr. Floyd's and Mr. Valenzuela's families, I know that these men should never have died in the first place. This lethal and unnecessary type of force should not be allowed anywhere in America. The Justice in Policing Act would put an end to the injudicious use of no-knock warrants that led to the murder of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, KY. In order to prevent future extrajudicial killings like the murder of Ahmaud Arbery earlier this year by vigilantes in Georgia, the Justice in Policing Act would also finally designate lynching as a Federal crime. The legislation would also make broad improvements in training for police officers. That includes implicit bias training to confront the prejudice that contributes to racial profiling and confrontational treatment of people of color. We must also make deescalation and crisis intervention techniques standard operating procedures in encounters and make the use of lethal force the absolute last resort. In my State, we have seen far too many incidents in which police have killed people of color with lethal tactics or responded to New Mexicans experiencing mental illness or addiction with unnecessary force that resulted in death. Nearly a decade ago, the Department of Justice began an investigation into the Albuquerque Police Department after numerous such fatal police encounters In 2014, the Department of Justice released its report that cited chronic abuses of civil rights, widespread community distrust, and a pattern of excessive force across the department. For these past 6 years, the Albuquerque Police Department has been under a federally enforced consent decree that has brought much needed changes in hiring, training, and use-of-force policies. This ongoing process of changing just this one police department's culture is far from complete. Court hearings continue, and a federally appointed monitor continues to oversee the yearslong process of completing all of the reforms in the federally mandated, court-approved settlement agreement. We have still seen multiple fatal police shootings each year since reforms began. That includes one case from just this March in which the response to a welfare check on Valente Acosta-Bustillos, a man with documented behavioral health challenges, ended with officers fatally shooting him after he wielded a shovel that he had been using to do yard work. This is not an isolated incident. The evidence is everywhere that systemic reform is needed for law enforcement, not just in Albuquerque but all across my State and all across this country. Since the beginning of 2015, since the Nation reeled over the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, there have been more than 5,000--5,000--fatal police shootings. It pains me to say that in that time period, New Mexico has had the highest rate of these shootings in the entire country on a per capita basis. While our overall nationwide statistics on deaths in police custody are incomplete--which is a problem in and of itself--the data we do have makes it clear that police in the United States are killing people at a rate much higher than our peer nations. A review of media-reported, arrest-related deaths in the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that more than 1,300 people died in police custody in the 10 months from June 2015 to March 2016. During that same period, only 13 people in the United Kingdom died in or after being in police custody. While we are a much larger country, even on a per capita basis, that means that Americans are being killed at a rate of approximately six times higher than in the UK. Many, if not most, of these deaths fall or are deemed ``justified'' by law enforcement, but I want to say in the strongest possible terms: We can't keep accepting a system that justifies this level of deadly violence. The House of Representatives demonstrated last week that we can take action to address this system. Answering the calls of Americans all across our country, the House voted to pass the Justice in Policing Act. The Senate needs to do the same because no one should be above the law--no one, including those in law enforcement. While I believe these last weeks and months of Americans calling for justice have changed many hearts and minds, I am not naive enough to believe the current administration is either willing or capable of bringing the level of change that Americans are demanding. Unfortunately, in the last 3\\1/2\\ years, President Trump and his Justice Department have either turned a blind eye, excused, or even openly encouraged a more violent police culture. Starting under Attorney General Jeff Sessions and certainly continuing under Attorney General Bill Barr today, this administration has spent much more time and Department of Justice resources aiding the President's own political battles and implementing even harsher penalties on Americans than on holding police departments accountable for guaranteeing equal justice under the law.[[Page S4104]] None of this excuses us in the U.S Senate from our own responsibility to lead. We have a moral obligation, as Senators, to grapple with how we can bring about necessary Federal changes with better Federal policies. That should start with passing the accountability measures, the meaningful improvements to police training, and the bans on excessive lethal force tactics that are in the Justice in Policing Act. We also need to encourage the changes that will necessarily need to come at the local government level. Advocates are calling on local governments to reassess their budgets and how much they have prioritized policing and prisons over education and housing. They are also calling on their local leaders to reimagine a world where armed police officers are not the responders dispatched to all crisis situations. Last week, the mayor of Albuquerque, Tim Keller, announced a proposal to create an entirely new public safety department that would dispatch social workers, housing and homelessness specialists, and violence prevention and diversion program experts instead of police officers to homelessness, so-called down-and-out calls, and behavioral health crises. This is the scale of systemic change that we need to be thinking about and devoting real resources toward implementing in all of our communities. We all need to carefully assess the effectiveness of continuing a status quo in law enforcement that is clearly not keeping all of us safe. It will not be easy to dismantle the ``us versus them'' warrior mentality that is so pervasive in far too many of our law enforcement agencies. If you treat the communities that you police like they are war zones, you create a relationship that dehumanizes the very people you are charged to protect, and you fuel more of the very violence and crime that you are supposed to prevent. Our streets in American communities should never be treated like battlefields. Our local law enforcement officers should not be armed with military-grade equipment or AR-15s or MRAP armored vehicles. They should not be meeting peaceful protesters or demonstrators with teargas, flash grenades, or rubber bullets. Police officers should not be treating any of us--whatever our race and regardless of the reason we are encountering them--as if we are enemy combatants. This militarized version of policing is simply not the way to keep the peace or create a sense of public safety in our communities. It has created a distrust in police and perpetuated trauma and inequities in communities across our country. I believe that we must transform this dangerous warrior mentality into a guardian and neighborhood support mentality that looks to serve all members of our communities. We should remember that police officers are supposed to be officers of the peace. Now, I want to be careful to emphasize that the responsibility for changing this mentality must not fall entirely on the shoulders of our law enforcement officers because we also recognize that our law enforcement officers, too, are being impacted and harmed by this broken system. We, as a society, have asked them to treat the symptoms and respond to the deficiencies that all of us have allowed to persist in education, in healthcare, in addiction treatment, and in housing. On a daily basis, police officers address the most acute impacts of our not solving those other issues. I would argue that this is because the same wrongheaded ``us versus them'' warrior mentality that I have been describing has long resided within this very institution and has been baked into our country as a whole. It is the same warrior mentality that has fueled the Federal Government's ineffective and racist War on Drugs and War on Crime over the course of the last 50 years. Intentionally or not, these policies helped build what advocates label the ``school-to-prison pipeline'' and the ``New Jim Crow.'' ``New Jim Crow'' may sound harsh, but in my estimation, it is an astonishingly accurate way to describe the unequal society we have created across our entire country. More than half a century since the marchers in the civil rights movement called on us to create an America where we were all judged by the content of our character rather than the color of our skin, we find ourselves facing the same challenges as 50 years ago, with implicit bias and structural inequities ravaging our communities of color. That is what you get after combining militarized policing with overly harsh sentencing laws, mass incarceration, private prisons, continued institutional racial discrimination, and a decades-long disinvestment in public education, affordable housing, food assistance, addiction treatment, and healthcare resources. That is the system we are talking about when we talk about systemic racism. It will take more than nice words and kind wishes in a fleeting period of weeks to dismantle that system that has been built up in the 400 years since the first slaves were brought to our shores and in the last 50 years of rapidly growing mass incarceration. The sooner we finally recognize this, the sooner we can try to envision and implement effective, comprehensive reforms on the scale necessary to create institutions that look out for all of us. Over the last months, as we have all confronted the health and economic crises brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, I have often heard that we need to get back to normal. But that version of normal was not working for all of us. Rather than hoping to get back to that unequal and unjust normal of before, I would offer this challenge to all of us. We have an opportunity--an opportunity to rebuild our country in the months and years ahead. Let's rebuild our country to create an America that includes all of us. Let's rebuild our country in a way that respects the human dignity of Black lives and provides safety and opportunity to all of us. Let's rebuild America to become the place we all want it to be: a nation where we see each other as fellow human beings, equally deserving of life and liberty. There is still so much more hard work ahead of us. Passing the Justice in Policing Act is a first meaningful step on a long path forward I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BLACKBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Free Speech Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, over the past few months, we have all watched the power that the digital community has to make someone's passing thought go viral and the power that the digital mob has to make controversial voices completely disappear. Well, who is the ``digital mob'' exactly, because right now we are hearing a lot about mob rule. Sometimes it is hard to tell who the mob actually is. Is it the millions of users who swarm social media platforms at the very first hint of a controversy, or is it the professional activists who provoke many of these attacks? They seem to know just when to pitch a thought, a word, or an idea. Could it be the platforms themselves that cave to the pressure and police speech when they don't agree with that speech? So let's drill down on this just a little bit. Today I want to focus on the Googles and the Facebooks of the world because, when it comes down to it, they are the ones that are in the driver's seat. They are the ones that end up calling the shots. For years, tech companies have waged a very public war against platform users who speak out against the popular narrative, and the executives charged with defending these calls routinely struggle to explain the arbitrary nature of their content-moderation policies. Every time moderators remove a post for what is called shocking content or cause a moral panic by placing a warning label on satire, Big Tech asks us to just, oh, write it off: It was a mistake. We really didn't mean to do it. Move on. But we haven't moved on because the platforms themselves have provided plenty of evidence to confirm that Big Tech's employees bring their bias to the workplace. Bear in mind, all of these employees who are developing the search models--the algorithms that are prioritizing your search, that are mining your data, that are policing[[Page S4105]]your speech--are bringing their bias and their prejudice to the workplace. These fears were confirmed back in 2017 when the New York Times reported that a Twitter employee intentionally--intentionally--deleted President Trump's account, not because of any violation but because the employee had an ax to grind. They did not like President Donald Trump. This May, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Facebook set up a multistep approval process for changes to its ``integrity ranking initiative'' due to ``reasonable concerns that overzealous engineers might let their politics influence the platform.'' Think about that. Facebook set up a multistep approval process for changes to its integrity ranking initiative due to reasonable concerns that overzealous engineers might let their politics influence the platform. Do you think? Of course they were. Of course they were. The problem: They have been doing it all along and trying to say it is just your imagination when, actually, it is not. I don't think anyone anticipated that digital platforms would become powerful enough to act as judge and jury over what information Americans should be allowed to access online. Congress certainly didn't anticipate it when drafting legislation to keep those companies in check. But they have overstepped their bounds. They continue to misbehave until we come along and slap their hand, and then they try to act as if they are going to solve their problems, which leads us to our current debate over section 230 reform. Big Tech relies on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to shield themselves from content-based litigation. The statute also acts as a sword that platforms can engage to remove content they judge to be obscene, violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable. In the section 230 world, then, the users--the users--are responsible for what they post, not the platform that hosts the content. The platforms, however, have the right to set their own content guidelines within limits without being sued. That sounds reasonable. Section 230 is important, specifically, because of what it doesn't do. It does not force companies to choose between moderating every piece of content they host and letting their websites turn into the Wild West. But, as I said, no legislation could have anticipated our current digital landscape. Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook now have the power to ruin content creators who step out of line. And it is their line. Even if those creators manage to stay on the right side of the moderators, they know their online presence--and many times this is also their livelihood--lives or dies at the hands of employees given the near-impossible task of remaining completely neutral 100 percent of the time. The dynamic between users and platforms has changed. And now, Congress must change the law that guides that dynamic. Here is the problem. This country has become so polarized, I am not sure Big Tech understands what a healthy dynamic would actually look like. No longer do their choices seem to make sense to many Americans. The compulsion to flag and report and threaten has become a reflex. When the digital mob chooses to attack on any given day, then, their choices are going to change with every news cycle. As we have seen, this heavily influences how Big Tech chooses to police content on their platforms. You may have been saying or posting something for years--no problem. But then one day, that digital mob--because of the news cycle--will choose to attack you. Conservatives have suffered under this mob rule. There is no denying it. There is no denying that there is a digital mob. But reform can happen without overextending the heavy hand of Federal regulation over the entire tech industry. As someone who knows what it feels like to be censored, I get it. I absolutely understand why we need these reforms and why Congress needs to act now, this year. But I also know that the more you rely on threats to motivate good corporate behavior, the more likely you will be to find reasons to follow through on them. We must find stronger ways to rein in tech firms seeking to become the new speech police. We know for a fact that Big Tech's biases are the problem. But when did more government become the solution? We already tried that approach. We called it the fairness doctrine. Guess what. It did not work. Instead of encouraging free and fair discourse, powerful parties use those rigid standards as leverage to control speech. And, I will tell you, I can think of few things more dangerous than allowing lawmakers and bureaucrats to weaponize the full force of the Federal Government against the private exchange of information. What we do know is this. Big Tech's era of self-regulation is over. It no longer works. Big Tech is not a group of infant companies. They are referred to as Big Tech because they have grown. This self-regulation is over. It is time for Congress to take an action. But punitive, one-size-fits-all standards will put these tech companies in a straitjacket. It would hamper innovation, and, eventually, it would collapse the industry. Instead, we should set up and give Big Tech guidance that will encourage growth and will encourage innovation, while also making it abundantly clear that Congress will not allow Big Tech's political bias to determine what information Americans are allowed to access online. We will not allow Big Tech and their political bias to determine how information is prioritized through your search engine. We are not going to allow Big Tech and their political bias to data-mine every email, every text, and every search, and then use that to access your information online. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the previously referenced articles from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [Nov. 2, 2017] Rogue Twitter Employee Briefly Shuts Down Trump's Account (By Maggie Astor) This is the way the world ends: not with a bang but a deleted Twitter account. At least, so it appeared for 11 minutes Thursday evening, when visitors to President Trump's personal account, @realDonaldTrump, were informed that there was no such thing. The error message on some devices was even more dire: ``@realDonaldTrump does not exist.'' Amid a presidency that has seemed, at times, to be conducted primarily in 140-character pieces, this was a seismic event--and what was left of Twitter erupted. It was a raucous, modern-day town-square gathering of the sort not seen since . . . well, since five months ago, when Mr. Trump coined a new word in the middle of the night. It was just before 7 p.m Thursday, and the internet was in an uproar. Time stopped. The sun rose in the west and set in the east. What, the watchers wondered, was going on? Had Twitter closed the president's account? Had a White House aide snatched the phone from Mr. Trump's tweeting hands? Had Robert Mueller chosen this moment to rifle through the president's direct messages? Had Mr. Trump himself--could it be?--decided he'd had enough of his favorite medium? The answer, revealed three hours later, was something straight out of ``Office Space.'' After saying in an initial statement that the account had been ``inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee,'' Twitter announced that a rogue customer support worker had done it on his or her last day at the company. Many of Mr. Trump's supporters were incensed, with some saying the incident showed a disregard for free speech. His opponents, on the other hand, were gleeful. ``America: Hire this person,'' former Representative John Dingell of Michigan tweeted. Even before Twitter confirmed that the deactivation had been deliberate, some were speculating about it. In the tech world, the statement raised more questions than it answered. Twitter has never said how many employees have access to Mr. Trump's account, or described the safeguards it has in place for its highest-profile users. And the company is already under the microscope in Washington, where Congress is investigating how technology giants might have shaped the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump was locked out for just 11 minutes, and then, just as suddenly, he was back. Those watching found themselves unscathed--though some could not quite shake a sense of dread. The president himself got back to business as if nothing had happened, tweeting at 8:05 p.m : ``Great Tax Cut rollout today. The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is[[Page S4106]] right for America!'' He then fired off four more tweets, denouncing the Democratic National Committee and James B. Comey before inviting viewers to watch his interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News. And so, back in the offices and homes of the nation, the people of Twitter could only sit back and reflect. For better or for worse, the world seemed predictable again, and one user made his prediction bold. ``Man,'' Alex Zalben wrote, ``in like nine months there's gonna be a ton of Trump Twitter blackout babies.'' ____ [May 26, 2020] Facebook Executives Shut Down Efforts To Make the Site Less Divisive (By Jeff Horwitz and Deepa Seetharaman) A Facebook Inc. FB 0.35% team had a blunt message for senior executives. The company's algorithms weren't bringing people together. They were driving people apart. ``Our algorithms exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness,'' read a slide from a 2018 presentation. ``If left unchecked,'' it warned, Facebook would feed users ``more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention &amp; increase time on the platform.'' That presentation went to the heart of a question dogging Facebook almost since its founding: Does its platform aggravate polarization and tribal behavior? The answer it found, in some cases, was yes. Facebook had kicked off an internal effort to understand how its platform shaped user behavior and how the company might address potential harms. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had in public and private expressed concern about ``sensationalism and polarization.'' But in the end, Facebook's interest was fleeting. Mr. Zuckerberg and other senior executives largely shelved the basic research, according to previously unreported internal documents and people familiar with the effort, and weakened or blocked efforts to apply its conclusions to Facebook products. Facebook policy chief Joel Kaplan, who played a central role in vetting--proposed changes, argued at the time that efforts to make conversations on the platform more civil were ``paternalistic,'' said people familiar with his comments. Another concern, they and others said, was that some proposed changes would have disproportionately affected conservative users and publishers, at a time when the company faced accusations from the right of political bias. Facebook revealed few details about the effort and has divulged little about what became of it. In 2020, the questions the effort sought to address are even more acute, as a charged presidential election looms and Facebook has been a conduit for conspiracy theories and partisan sparring about the coronavirus pandemic. In essence, Facebook is under fire for making the world more divided. Many of its own experts appeared to agree--and to believe Facebook could mitigate many of the problems. The company chose not to. Mr. Kaplan in a recent interview said he and other executives had approved certain changes meant to improve civic discussion. In other cases where proposals were blocked, he said, he was trying to ``instill some discipline, rigor and responsibility into the process'' as he vetted the effectiveness and potential unintended consequences of changes to how the platform operated. Internally, the vetting process earned a nickname: ``Eat Your Veggies.'' Americans were drifting apart on fundamental societal issues well before the creation of social media, decades of Pew Research Center surveys have shown. But 60% of Americans think the country's biggest tech companies are helping further divide the country, while only 11% believe they are uniting it, according to a Gallup-Knight survey in March. At Facebook, ``There was this soul-searching period after 2016 that seemed to me this period of really sincere, `Oh man, what if we really did mess up the world?' '' said Eli Pariser, co-director of Civic Signals, a project that aims to build healthier digital spaces, and who has spoken to Facebook officials about polarization. Mr. Pariser said that started to change after March 2018, when Facebook got in hot water after disclosing that Cambridge Analytica, the political-analytics startup, improperly obtained Facebook data about tens of millions of people. The shift has gained momentum since, he said: ``The internal pendulum swung really hard to `the media hates us no matter what we do, so let's just batten down the hatches.' '' In a sign of how far the company has moved, Mr. Zuckerberg in January said he would stand up ``against those who say that new types of communities forming on social media are dividing us.'' People who have heard him speak privately said he argues social media bears little responsibility for polarization. He argues the platform is in fact a guardian of free speech, even when the content is objectionable--a position that drove Facebook's decision not to fact-check political advertising ahead of the 2020 election. INTEGRITY TEAMS Facebook launched its research on divisive content and behavior at a moment when it was grappling with whether its mission to ``connect the world'' was good for society. Fixing the polarization problem would be difficult, requiring Facebook to rethink some of its core products. Most notably, the project forced Facebook to consider how it prioritized ``user engagement''--a metric involving time spent, likes, shares and comments that for years had been the lodestar of its system. Championed by Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer at the time and a top deputy to Mr. Zuckerberg, the work was carried out over much of 2017 and 2018 by engineers and researchers assigned to a cross-jurisdictional task force dubbed ``Common Ground'' and employees in newly created ``Integrity Teams'' embedded around the company. Even before the teams' 2017 creation, Facebook researchers had found signs of trouble. A 2016 presentation that names as author a Facebook researcher and sociologist, Monica Lee, found extremist content thriving in more than one-third of large German political groups on the platform. Swamped with racist, conspiracy-minded and pro-Russian content, the groups were disproportionately influenced by a subset of hyperactive users, the presentation notes. Most of them were private or secret. The high number of extremist groups was concerning, the presentation says. Worse was Facebook's realization that its algorithms were responsible for their growth. The 2016 presentation states that ``64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools'' and that most of the activity came from the platform's ``Groups You Should Join'' and ``Discover'' algorithms: ``Our recommendation systems grow the problem.'' Ms. Lee, who remains at Facebook, didn't respond to inquiries. Facebook declined to respond to questions about how it addressed the problem in the presentation, which other employees said weren't unique to Germany or the Groups product. In a presentation at an international security conference in February, Mr. Zuckerberg said the company tries not to recommend groups that break its rules or are polarizing. ``We've learned a lot since 2016 and are not the same company today,'' a Facebook spokeswoman said. ``We've built a robust integrity team, strengthened our policies and practices to limit harmful content, and used research to understand our platform's impact on society so we continue to improve.'' Facebook in February announced $2 million in funding for independent research proposals on polarization. The Common Ground team sought to tackle the polarization problem directly, said people familiar with the team. Data scientists involved with the effort found some interest groups--often hobby-based groups with no explicit ideological alignment--brought people from different backgrounds together constructively. Other groups appeared to incubate impulses to fight, spread falsehoods or demonize a population of outsiders. In keeping with Facebook's commitment to neutrality, the teams decided Facebook shouldn't police people's opinions, stop conflict on the platform, or prevent people from forming communities. The vilification of one's opponents was the problem, according to one internal document from the team. ``We're explicitly not going to build products that attempt to change people's beliefs,'' one 2018 document states. ``We're focused on products that increase empathy, understanding, and humanization of the `other side.' '' hot-button issues One proposal sought to salvage conversations in groups derailed by hot-button issues, according to the people familiar with the team and internal documents. If two members of a Facebook group devoted to parenting fought about vaccinations, the moderators could establish a temporary subgroup to host the argument or limit the frequency of posting on the topic to avoid a public flame war. Another idea, documents show, was to tweak recommendation algorithms to suggest a wider range of Facebook groups than people would ordinarily encounter. Building these features and combating polarization might come at a cost of lower engagement, the Common Ground team warned in a mid-2018 document, describing some of its own proposals as ``antigrowth'' and requiring Facebook to ``take a moral stance.'' Taking action would require Facebook to form partnerships with academics and nonprofits to give credibility to changes affecting public conversation, the document says. This was becoming difficult as the company slogged through controversies after the 2016 presidential election. ``People don't trust us,'' said a presentation created in the summer of 2018. The engineers and data scientists on Facebook's Integrity Teams--chief among them, scientists who worked on newsfeed, the stream of posts and photos that greet users when they visit Facebook--arrived at the polarization problem indirectly, according to people familiar with the teams. Asked to combat fake news, spam, clickbait and inauthentic users, the employees looked for ways to diminish the reach of such ills. One early discovery: Bad behavior came disproportionately from a small pool of hyperpartisan users. A second finding in the U.S saw a larger infrastructure of accounts and publishers on the far right than on the far left. Outside observers were documenting the same phenomenon. The gap meant even seemingly[[Page S4107]] apolitical actions such as reducing the spread of clickbait headlines--along the lines of ``You Won't Believe What Happened Next''--affected conservative speech more than liberal content in aggregate. That was a tough sell to Mr. Kaplan, said people who heard him discuss Common Ground and Integrity proposals. A former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush, Mr. Kaplan became more involved in content-ranking decisions after 2016 allegations Facebook had suppressed trending news stories from conservative outlets. An internal review didn't substantiate the claims of bias, Facebook's then-general counsel Colin Stretch told Congress, but the damage to Facebook's reputation among conservatives had been done. Every significant new integrity-ranking initiative had to seek the approval of not just engineering managers but also representatives of the public policy, legal, marketing and public-relations departments. Lindsey Shepard, a former Facebook product-marketing director who helped set up the Eat Your Veggies process, said it arose from what she believed were reasonable concerns that overzealous engineers might let their politics influence the platform. ``Engineers that were used to having autonomy maybe over- rotated a bit'' after the 2016 election to address Facebook's perceived flaws, she said. The meetings helped keep that in check. ``At the end of the day, if we didn't reach consensus, we'd frame up the different points of view, and then they'd be raised up to Mark.'' Scuttled projects Disapproval from Mr. Kaplan's team or Facebook's communications department could scuttle a project, said people familiar with the effort. Negative policy-team reviews killed efforts to build a classification system for hyperpolarized content. Likewise, the Eat Your Veggies process shut down efforts to suppress clickbait about politics more than on other topics. Initiatives that survived were often weakened. Mr. Cox wooed Carlos Gomez Uribe, former head of Netflix Inc.'s recommendation system, to lead the newsfeed Integrity Team in January 2017. Within a few months, Mr. Uribe began pushing to reduce the outsize impact hyperactive users had. Under Facebook's engagement-based metrics, a user who likes, shares or comments on 1,500 pieces of content has more influence on the platform and its algorithms than one who interacts with just 15 posts, allowing ``super-sharers'' to drown out less-active users. Accounts with hyperactive engagement were far more partisan on average than normal Facebook users, and they were more likely to behave suspiciously, sometimes appearing on the platform as much as 20 hours a day and engaging in spam-like behavior. The behavior suggested some were either people working in shifts or bots. One proposal Mr. Uribe's team championed, called ``Sparing Sharing,'' would have reduced the spread of content disproportionately favored by hyperactive users, according to people familiar with it. Its effects would be heaviest on content favored by users on the far right and left. Middle- of-the road users would gain influence. Mr. Uribe called it ``the happy face,'' said some of the people. Facebook's data scientists believed it could bolster the platform's defenses against spam and coordinated manipulation efforts of the sort Russia undertook during the 2016 election. Mr. Kaplan and other senior Facebook executives pushed back on the grounds it might harm a hypothetical Girl Scout troop, said people familiar with his comments. Suppose, Mr. Kaplan asked them, that the girls became Facebook super-sharers to promote cookies? Mitigating the reach of the platform's most dedicated users would unfairly thwart them, he said. Mr. Kaplan in the recent interview said he didn't remember raising the Girl Scout example but was concerned about the effect on publishers who happened to have enthusiastic followings. The debate got kicked up to Mr. Zuckerberg, who heard out both sides in a short meeting, said people briefed on it. His response: Do it, but cut the weighting by 80%. Mr. Zuckerberg also signaled he was losing interest in the effort to recalibrate the platform in the name of social good, they said, asking that they not bring him something like that again. Mr. Uribe left Facebook and the tech industry within the year. He declined to discuss his work at Facebook in detail but confirmed his advocacy for the Sparing Sharing proposal. He said he left Facebook because of his frustration with company executives and their narrow focus on how integrity changes would affect American politics. While proposals like his did disproportionately affect conservatives in the U.S , he said, in other countries the opposite was true. Other projects met Sparing Sharing's fate: weakened, not killed. Partial victories included efforts to promote news stories garnering engagement from a broad user base, not just partisans, and penalties for publishers that repeatedly shared false news or directed users to ad-choked pages. The tug of war was resolved in part by the growing furor over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In a September 2018 reorganization of Facebook's newsfeed team, managers told employees the company's priorities were shifting ``away from societal good to individual value,'' said people present for the discussion. If users wanted to routinely view or post hostile content about groups they didn't like, Facebook wouldn't suppress it if the content didn't specifically violate the company's rules. Mr. Cox left the company several months later after disagreements regarding Facebook's pivot toward private encrypted messaging. He hadn't won most fights he had engaged in on integrity ranking and Common Ground product changes, people involved in the effort said, and his departure left the remaining staffers working on such projects without a high-level advocate. The Common Ground team disbanded. The Integrity Teams still exist, though many senior staffers left the company or headed to Facebook's Instagram platform. Mr. Zuckerberg announced in 2019 that Facebook would take down content violating specific standards but where possible take a hands-off approach to policing material not clearly violating its standards. ``You can't impose tolerance top-down,'' he said in an October speech at Georgetown University. ``It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a shared story for society that we all feel we're a part of. That's how we make progress together.'' END Child Exploitation Act Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham for adding the bipartisan and critically important END Exploitation Act to the EARN It Act, which is set for markup on Thursday. This bill, which I introduced with Senator Cortez Masto, would lengthen evidence preservation time in online child exploitation cases and assist law enforcement in prosecuting child predators. Once passed, the law will double the length of time we require tech firms like Facebook and Snapchat to preserve evidence and reports of online child exploitation. In 2018, tech companies reported over 45 million--45 million--photos and videos of children being sexually abused. Unfortunately, that was double the number of reports in 2017. This legislation will give the police more time to investigate these horrific crimes. It will put child predators in jail where they belong. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Blackburn). Without objection, it is so ordered. Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3685 Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today is July 1. For millions of Americans, the rent is due. Utility bills don't stop, either. But too many New York families and too many American families will be unable to make the payments amid the pandemic that has already hurt my city and its people. The first of the month should not be the end of the financial line for working families, and that is why we are here. We must continue to put real pressure on Leader McConnell to pass the COVID 4 legislation that would include critical rent relief to families who desperately need the help. Our working families--many of color and other minority groups--are in desperate need of this basic assistance so they can continue working, feeding their families, making ends meet. That is our push today. Enact the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act--which has a $100 billion promise to renters across the country--and the promise is real help during the real and unprecedented crisis. Let me give you some background. The Heroes Act would authorize $100 billion for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program led by Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Banking and Housing Committee, who has just done a great job letting people know the crisis and now acting on it. What it does is it helps families and individuals pay their rent and utility bills and remain in their homes during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The bill was already included in the House-passed and bipartisan Heroes Act, but, unfortunately, once again--as he does with so many other important issues--Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to bring it to the floor, so Senator Brown has come to ask the unanimous consent. Without basic assistance, even those renters who are currently shielded by temporary Federal and local eviction[[Page S4108]]bans may still face eviction. Let me tell you, once someone is evicted and homeless, they regress. The kids can't go to school. Healthcare becomes even more remote. Getting to a job through public transportation is so difficult. This actually is a stitch in time that saves nine. If people can stay in their homes because they can't pay the rent through no fault of their own, they have a better chance of reestablishing their lives and maybe even climbing up that American ladder. If they are kicked out of their homes because they can't pay the rent, through no fault of their own, it is very, very difficult. They are in a deep, deep hole. We must, must do something for them. Senator Brown, with his persistence and passion, has put together the right plan. We talk about numbers, sure, but behind those numbers are the faces of countless New Yorkers we see each and every day on mass transit, walking the streets, working among us. These folks are fine, hard-working people. All they want is a little dignity in their lives and ability to keep a roof over their heads. They need help now more than ever. We need action on this now, and that is the message to our friends on the other side of the aisle. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Democratic leader. I have a prepared speech I want to make, but I heard Senator Schumer talk about this. These are human beings. We in this body are Senators. We go back and forth to our States. We have the privilege of working pretty safe. We are paid. We aren't exposed to the virus all that much, mostly because we are pretty careful because we can be, and we have jobs where we can be. Think about this. You work in a grocery store, and you are exposed to the coronavirus. A grocery store worker told me one day: They tell me I am essential, but I feel expendable because I am not very safe in this job, and they don't pay me much. What if she gets laid off--that wouldn't happen so much in a grocery store because they are hiring--but in another job, they get laid off. They have to worry about potential eviction. Their unemployment will run out at the end of July. We have done nothing to help them What happens with all these people who get evicted? They end up on the streets or they go to homeless shelters that are too crowded. They go to live on their cousin's couch in the basement. What are the chances of them getting coronavirus? These are human beings in New York and Ohio and Idaho and Tennessee and all over. I can't believe we are not about to do something about this. I thank the leader for his involvement on this issue that is so important. We are in the middle of a crisis, unlike anything any of us have ever lived through. That goes without saying. Every single day we hear about hundreds and hundreds more Americans dying. Back in March, South Korea had 90 cases. We had 90 cases. The capital of South Korea is 800 miles from Wuhan where this virus started. They have had fewer than 300 people die. We have had 120,000. They don't have better doctors. They don't have better public health. They don't have better medical scientists. They have better leaders than we do, obviously. Their unemployment rate is under 4 percent and fewer than 300 people have died. The people who have died are our sisters, our brothers, our parents, our friends, and neighbors. The President of the United States and the Republican leader down the hall--who occasionally goes in and out of his office--have stopped pretending to care. They rarely talk about the coronavirus. The President rarely extends any sympathy to our brothers and our sisters and our parents and our friends and our neighbors who have been sick and who have died. It is not the President's rich friends who are dying; it is our grandparents. They are the people in nursing homes. They are disproportionately the Black and Brown workers who caught the virus on the job. The Trump administration and Senator McConnell, essentially, have just given up. We can't. We have to do our jobs. We need to show leadership where the President has failed and where the majority leader--the most powerful person in this body, the top elected official in the Senate, says: ``I see no urgency.'' He sees no urgency because he is not out talking to people who are about to be foreclosed on or evicted from their home. Imagine being evicted in the middle of a pandemic. Imagine the fear and anxiety a family have when they are in that position. We need to fight the health crisis and economic crisis. We can't do one without the other. Millions of Americans are in danger of being evicted and having their homes foreclosed on. The last thing we need to do is turn them out on the streets. We have a housing crisis. Many know this. Senator Menendez has joined us, who is one of the best advocates for these issues of anybody in the Senate. We knew there was a housing crisis before the coronavirus set. We know that one-fourth of renters in this country, before the coronavirus, paid more than half of their income in housing. One thing happens in their life, just one thing. Their car breaks down. Their child gets sick. They get in a car accident, and they are out of work for a week. They get evicted. They don't have any kind of margin there. We know that professions we are recognizing as essential don't pay enough to afford housing. We are seeing millions of people have these emergencies. The ones they had before, many people have now. Millions have them all at once. They face impossible choices between rent and groceries, or prescriptions, or draining their savings, or going to a payday lender, and you never go to a payday lender once. You keep going back and back, and the interest you pay is more than you originally borrowed. In essence, they have no choice at all. It is not a choice between prescriptions and groceries and draining their savings. It is no choice at all. Far too often, it ends up being eviction. In the CARES Act, we passed emergency expansion of unemployment insurance. I appreciate my friend Senator Crapo, chairman of this committee, who supported that and so much of what is in this package. We provided funding for the most immediate needs of housing and organizations that put a temporary moratorium on evictions and foreclosures for some--not all renters and not nearly all homeowners. It is an important step but not enough. We face two huge cliffs. This is July 1. On July 31, the $600 a month that has kept people in their homes and kept food on their table and kept clothes on the backs of their kids--that $600 a month ends come July 31. At the end, in many cases, the eviction moratorium ends. The President and Leader McConnell don't seem to notice. They don't seem to care. For all those renters who have been protected, back rent will suddenly be due. You may have gotten a moratorium on your rent for 3 months, but now you will owe for 4 months. The same goes for millions who aren't protected under the CARES Act but got relief from a temporary State or local moratorium or because their eviction courts were closed in many States. With tens of millions of people filing for unemployment, the President is still refusing to lead and do something about this virus to get it under control. We know people still need help. They still need help paying the rent. They still need help making mortgage payments. They still need help protecting themselves from evictions and foreclosures. Forty percent of Black and Latinx renters report they are unlikely able to make their next payment--40 percent. It is not because they are not working hard. They got laid off and are in low-wage jobs. That is why Senator Menendez and I and Senator Schumer and others cosponsored and introduced--39 of my fellow colleagues--introduced the Emergency Rental Assistance Stabilization Act. It would provide $100 billion for emergency rental assistance, including help with missed rent and utility bills. It already passed the House twice. It is included in the Heroes Act that they passed a month ago, but it is sitting on the majority leader's desk because he doesn't seem to notice. For millions of families, the bills keep[[Page S4109]]coming and the clock keeps ticking and the stress keeps mounting. Now a second round of layoffs are starting because this President refuses to lead and get this virus under control. Two weeks ago, they reopened eviction courts in Columbus. They opened the Convention Center to process evictions. Think of the heartache in that building. People go to court and find out they are evicted. The judge brings down a gavel, and their lives turn upside down. Reflect on that. Tens of millions of people lose their jobs. We are not using arenas to play basketball or to play indoor soccer. We are not doing that now. We are using arenas as eviction courts. Before this pandemic, President Trump and his wealthy Cabinet Members didn't realize or didn't care that behind the rosy stock market data this economy was already broken for millions of workers--especially for Black and Brown workers for whom it never worked to begin. Now the Trump administration--sort of like what happened with the Russians paying to kill American troops--the administration either doesn't know it or doesn't care that the bottom is falling out for these families. Without emergency rental assistance, these families find themselves on the street with their lives turned upside down in the middle of a pandemic. People are tired of the lack of action and lack of accountability. They are tired of being betrayed by a leader who is supposed to look out for them. They are tired of feeling like no one is on their side. We are the greatest country on the Earth, and we should act like it. American people should not always have to fend for themselves because we have an indifferent majority leader and a President who doesn't know or doesn't care in the middle of this once-in-a-generation crisis. It is time to step up. It is time to lead. It is time to think about what it would be like to face an eviction, knowing your two small children and you don't know where you are going to live. It is probably going to be in a homeless shelter or in a cousin's basement. You know your chances of getting infected with the coronavirus go up. Just think about those people when we make these decisions. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3685, the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act of 2020. I ask that the bill be considered read three times and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Idaho. Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, reserving the right to object. To date, Congress has appropriated nearly $3 trillion to protect, strengthen, and support Americans in all walks of life, to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and to stabilize the infrastructure and our economic system. Senator Brown and I worked on a big part of that package together on a team which was put together by Senator McConnell to try to make sure we addressed, in a bipartisan fashion, the way to respond to this pandemic. The CARES Act has been central to the effort and includes measures to help families directly, to provide aid to small businesses, to assist those in the medical field and on the frontlines of our response effort, and to stabilize our markets. Soon after, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act--or CARES Act--codifying and extending these protections and providing financial relief to renters--yes, to renters. Title IV of the CARES Act contains three housing provisions. Section 4022 imposes a 60-day eviction and foreclosure moratorium for single-family borrowers with federally backed mortgage loans. It allows struggling homeowners 1 year of loan forbearance. Section 4023 extends similar relief to multifamily borrowers who are current on their mortgage payments. They can request up to 90-days forbearance as long as they do not evict the tenant or charge late fees during the pandemic. Section 4024 imposes a 120-day moratorium on evictions, fees, and penalties. That moratorium will not expire until August 31. As with much of the CARES Act, the provisions dealing with stabilizing our economy and helping to support and sustain workers, small business owners, homeowners, and home renters are all playing out right now as we speak. Yet the real objection here is that Senator McConnell and the Republicans have said we want to work on looking at the next package of support, but we want to see how this one is playing out first and identify those places where we need to target the relief most. The objection is that there is a desire, once again, to go rapidly into passing the House bill and not having regular order follow in the Senate as we work to approach this issue as the existing CARES Act plays out. All of our housing agencies have extended this eviction and foreclosure moratorium and are working to help address the issues relating to tenants. HUD has expanded issuer assistance to include Pass-Through Assistance Program support, which allows servicers to apply for assistance in meeting principal and interest payments, and the FHFA has announced that no mortgage servicer will be responsible for advancing more than 4 months of missed principal and interest payments on a loan. All of these things have been done to stabilize the housing markets and to assist low-income home ownership and home construction and assistance. While I am open to looking at the question of whether additional assistance is needed for renters, homeowners, and others in our society, I am not willing to simply bypass the process in the Senate--ignore the considerations that our leadership has called for as we look to see how our current support programs are playing out--and simply jam the House bill through the Senate without having any debate or process. This was the biggest rescue package in the history of Congress, and we included a variety of oversight mechanisms in the legislation to ensure that the dollars and programs associated with it reached their intended marks. Many of the provisions in the CARES Act and those appropriated dollars are still making their way to these individuals and families and businesses and markets across the country. So we must work together to address these critical issues rather than simply try to jam one party's or one side of this Congress's approach to the solution without going through regular order. I would say the arguments that are being made that we or any of us are somehow turning a blind eye to the problems that exist could not be further from the truth. As I said earlier, the reality is that we passed the largest relief program in the history of this country. We are working to provide liquidity, as well as actual dollar relief, in the amount of trillions of dollars, and those programs are still playing out. We need to work together rather than, by unanimous consent request after unanimous consent request after unanimous consent request, try to jam down one side's approach without looking to find the cooperative solutions that I know we can. Like I said, I am open to working on these very issues, but the way to do it is not to come to the floor with a unanimous consent request--take it or leave it. We need to let proper, regular working order operate in the Senate, and we have time to do so. For that reason, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, before turning to Senators Menendez, Cortez Masto, Wyden, Klobuchar, Reed, Schatz, and Van Hollen, who all want to speak, I appreciate the comments from my friend--and he really is my friend--from Idaho. We work well together. We want to do regular order. This last bill was passed in March. Then there was April, May, June. Now we are in July. It is not a question of regular order. We would love to sit down with Senator McConnell and start negotiating as to what is next. We have wanted that really from about April 1. No April Fools' joke there; we really wanted to do that. Instead, Senator McConnell just seemed to ignore this. I mean, go back to the human side. What happens when somebody is unemployed? We will be leaving now for 2[[Page S4110]]weeks. That is why we are doing these unanimous consent requests now. It is because we want to see action. We have asked and asked and begged and begged and pleaded and pleaded. So what happens? We will go back home for 2 more weeks. Right now, if you can't find a job, if you are unemployed and are getting that $600 a week, you start paying attention online or you read the papers or however you get your information, and you find out that this is going to expire at the end of July. You don't know what you are going to do, but you know that you haven't paid rent in 3 months because you have had an eviction moratorium. Senator Crapo talked about the moratorium. Only half of the people who pay mortgages are subject to that moratorium and are protected, and only a third of people who rent are. So, for most people, that is simply not the case. Now that the eviction courts are open and the evictions are starting, what happens to those people? Are we just going to say: Well, let's see it play out. We know what will happen. If you don't have rental assistance, if you lose your unemployment and don't get that $1,200 check, which is basically 1 month's rent for most people, we know what is going to happen to you. Your life is going to turn upside down. That is why we need to move. That is why we need to pass this. I am disappointed that Senator McConnell has shown no interest in doing anything on this other than just sitting tight and hoping that the money he raises from special interests--from tobacco, the gun lobby, banks, and insurance companies--can help his candidates get reelected and he can be majority leader again I yield the floor to Senator Menendez. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, let me thank my colleague, the ranking Democrat--the senior Democrat--on the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, for his passion and his commitment. He has really elevated housing within the jurisdiction of the committee, which is something I am passionate about. Very often, everyone refers to the committee as the Banking Committee, but housing is a critical element of what it does. He has elevated it, and I really appreciate his passion on behalf of the millions who rent or who are fortunate enough to own homes and want to keep them to try to be able to do so. I would just say to my distinguished chairman of the committee that I do have the highest respect for him. Look, with the CARES package, we lumped in trillions of dollars, but overwhelmingly that money went to businesses. Of course, I support that, but it went to businesses. It went to sustain businesses. It went to ultimately help small, midsized, and even large businesses. It went to sustain sectors of our economy like the airline industry and others. What we are talking about goes to the very essence of what it is to have a home. ``Home'' is one of the most important American concepts. It is where we are taken when we are born. It is where we are nurtured while we are young. It is where we are schooled. It is where good times and bad times take place. Ultimately, it is where we build a life around our families if we are fortunate to have a home. Then, in a pandemic, we have learned that it is also a place in which to shelter. I come to the floor today to warn of an impending storm that is brewing, and it is headed our way. When the funds for the PPP--for the business program--ran out, we didn't have regular order to see if the PPP had been working well. No. There was a rush to put more billions in it. It was only when we said ``Wait a minute, this isn't working so well for small and midsized businesses'' that we made some reforms. So there was a rush then. There was no regular order. We have a storm that is brewing and is headed our way. It will bring with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It will make fighting the pandemic that much harder, and it will set back our Nation's economic recovery. If the Senate fails to respond to this looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer; families will be displaced; personal fortunes will be wiped out; and the scars will run so deep that it could take decades to heal the wounds. As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, the one saving grace most of us had--the one place we could take refuge to protect ourselves and our families--was our home. Our leading medical experts all urged us to stay home. If you are sick, stay home. If you have an underlying condition or are immunocompromised, stay home. If you are elderly or otherwise at risk, stay home. If you can, work from home. If you are a student, go online and learn from home. If we have learned anything from this pandemic, it is that staying home can help to contain the virus, flatten the curve, and save lives. What if you don't have a home? As we speak, millions of our fellow Americans are asking themselves that very same question. At a time when COVID-19 cases are spiking across the country, the provisions that we passed in the CARES Act to help renters and homeowners stay in their homes are about to run out. If we do nothing, we could face a foreclosure and eviction crisis far greater than that which we encountered during the great recession. There is a storm on the horizon. Americans shouldn't have to fear being thrown out on the street if they miss their next rent or mortgage payments through, really, no fault of their own. They shouldn't have to fear losing their greatest personal assets or that one safe place in the middle of a pandemic, further exposing themselves and others to the virus. The Senate can stop this if it wants to. We can make sure that every American has a safe and healthy place to call home. That is why I joined my Democratic colleagues on the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in introducing two bills last month that will provide assistance to homeowners and renters. The Housing Assistance Fund, led by Senator Reed, provides $75 billion in targeted assistance to keep people in their homes while they search for new employment or a way to get back to work. This money can go toward mortgage payments or utilities or as other support to prevent eviction, delinquency, or foreclosure. The Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, led by Senator Brown, would provide $100 billion in rental assistance to help families pay rent and help property owners maintain safe and healthy housing. It will help the economic recovery by stabilizing the rental market overall. We also have to empower Americans to make informed financial decisions--to help them navigate the maze of lenders, landlords, government agencies--to find a sustainable path to stay in their homes. We all know there is a housing affordability crisis in this country that jeopardizes the aspirations of millions of Americans who hope to join the middle class, and just as they have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic, low-income and minority Americans will disproportionately suffer during economic downturns. The provisions that the chairman talked about in the law that we passed in order to help are going to be expiring. To the extent that you know about it, you might invoke it to protect yourself against an eviction or a mortgage foreclosure, but if you don't know about it and either the financial institution or your landlord looks the other way and doesn't follow the law, well then, you won't get the protection. That is why I and 19 of my Democratic colleagues introduced a bill on Monday to provide $700 million in housing counseling assistance. Research shows that homeowners who receive housing counseling have better outcomes than those who don't, and that evidence is overwhelming. Their risk of default goes down, and they are more likely to see their credit scores rise and their debt levels fall. In rough times like we are in right now, these borrowers are more likely to get sustainable mortgage modifications and are less likely to end up in default. The benefits of housing counseling flow to the community at large because when a family is able to buy a home, pay their mortgage, build equity, and ultimately achieve the American dream, our towns and cities thrive. And during a pandemic, having[[Page S4111]]a safe and affordable place to live could mean the difference between life and death. It is also especially important for senior citizens, who are more susceptible to COVID-19. So tomorrow I will introduce legislation to provide $1.2 billion in aid for older adults living in federally assisted housing. This bill provides additional rental assistance for senior housing, personal protective gear, and staffing to help maintain a healthy community. So the forecasts are in. The storm is coming. The question is, What are we going to do about it? The Fourth of July is Independence Day. It is nice to have independence from the fear that I will lose the place that I call home. That would be a tremendous gift on the Fourth of July. Are we going to help our most vulnerable citizens during this pandemic or are we going to just watch them suffer, lose everything, and exacerbate this public health crisis? Today is July 1. The rent is due. Mortgage payments are due. The Senate's work is due. I remember--and I will close with this personal anecdote--when I was growing up poor in a tenement in New Jersey, the son of an itinerant carpenter and a seamstress, there wasn't always work, which meant that sometimes paying the rent was a real tough choice. And it was a choice of paying the rent or putting food on the table. I saw the anxiety in my mother's eyes. I saw the fear in my siblings not knowing whether that apartment in that tenement was something we were even going to be able to keep. That wasn't in a pandemic. That was just in normal times. Imagine in a pandemic, you are told to stay home, and there is no place to call home. We can do much better than that. We can do much better than that. July 1, the rent is due. The mortgage payment is due. The Senate's work is due. Let's pass this bill today and make sure every American can weather the pandemic in a safe and affordable place to call home. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Because a lot of my colleagues have been so thoughtful, I will have some brief remarks, and then I would ask unanimous consent that Senator Cortez Masto could follow me because she is facing a tight schedule as well. I know all of my colleagues are. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I join my colleagues this afternoon in appreciation of Senator Brown, who has been relentless--absolutely relentless--in prosecuting this cause of trying to get a fair shake for millions of Americans who are walking on an economic tightrope. Every single month, they balance the food bill against the rent bill against the energy bill, and Senator Brown--whether it is supercharged unemployment benefits, whether it is housing, whether it is taking on the big pharmaceutical companies--is there again and again and again to stand up for people who don't have power and don't have clout, and I want to thank him especially for giving us this opportunity to focus on the avalanche of evictions that I believe will be headed in our direction in weeks if the Senate doesn't act. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci talked about soon possibly seeing as many as 100,000 new coronavirus cases a day. You simply cannot have a healthy economy in a country suffering from mass illness and death. There are already tens of millions of Americans out of work as a result of a pandemic that is only continuing to spread, and it has hit the whole affordability of rent for millions of Americans like a powerful storm. According to the Census Bureau, 40 percent of Black and Latino renters are worried they will not be able to make the rent this summer due to the pandemic. That in and of itself is an outrage and an injustice. My question for our Republican colleagues today involves this frightening day at the beginning of the month--the frightening day when families sit around a kitchen table, all across the country, and you can see the anguish in their faces when you talk to them because, around that kitchen table, they are saying to themselves: What am I going to spend our scarce dollars on this month? Is it going to be the rent? Is it going to be groceries? What about that big pile of medical bills that is off in the corner that we have to pay? It is July 1, and the rent is due. Our question for our Republican colleagues is, What is your plan? Senator Brown has been leading us every day--day in, day out--with a set of sensible policies that respond to what those families are saying around their kitchen tables. We fought for the moratorium on evictions that was included in the CARES Act, but it goes poof in a few weeks. Already this week my Republican colleagues have blocked funding for State and local governments that could have been used to help people who are walking that economic tightrope. This morning, Leader Schumer and I laid out a plan that I think is a path to a dependable safety net in America and, specifically, an extension of supercharged unemployment benefits, which ties the benefit to economic conditions on the ground. It will be a financial lifeline for millions and millions of people. Republicans have been opposed to that. Those benefits are going to expire in a matter of weeks, and as I said to colleagues: Better know what you are going to be looking at when you go home in August if there hasn't been action on our legislation to make sure that there are supercharged unemployment benefits so that people can pay the rent and buy groceries. If they are home all August long, in the heat with families, and they are going to have nowhere to turn in terms of paying for a roof over their heads and groceries, this is going to be a long, long, hot summer that will never be forgotten. So let's be clear what is at stake. Long before the pandemic hit, housing cost too much. Homelessness was way too common, and, in my view, the rate of homelessness among children is a true national scandal. In the wealthiest Nation on Earth, no child should be without a home. But even before the COVID crisis, 1.5 million children were experiencing homelessness--1.5 million youngsters living outside, living in cars, sleeping on floors, sleeping on the ground. Colleagues, in my home State, they have said that school buses have had to go to the parks. They have had to go to the parks to pick up kids who are living outside with their families. It rains once in a while in Oregon. It is cold in Oregon. And to think that kids in the richest country on Earth are spending the night in the parks and the school buses have to come and get them while we have huge tax cuts for those who are powerful and have lobbyists shows that things are really out of whack. What I describe as it relates to those kids living in the parks--those kinds of conditions exist for youngsters all over America, and that was before the joblessness crisis hit and threw so many more working families into economic hardship. If the Senate doesn't step up to help families stay in their homes, it is going to get much, much worse because there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of kids facing this recipe for disaster. They are out of school. They are isolated, and they are more exposed to neglect and abuse. I am so pleased that my friend from Nevada has been talking about those families and talking about those kids. They are hungry. Their families are facing the threat of eviction. If the Senate just sits back and allows these children to fall into homelessness, they may never have a chance to get ahead. So what it comes down to is that the Senate has an obligation to help, and Senator Brown is on target in saying that this is the time to pass his Emergency Rental Assistance Act. I am with him. I think we have a lot of colleagues here in the queue because they, too, want to speak up for the radical idea--what a radical proposition--that in the richest country on Earth, the vulnerable ought to have a roof over their head. Senator Brown's proposal is a vital step forward. I think we all agree that much more needs to be done. I am very interested in the proposal I call the DASH Act, the Decent, Affordable and Safe Housing for All Act. I hope we will be able to get serious about that in 2021. The step to take today is to pass Senator Brown's bill, and I look forward to[[Page S4112]]being back with our colleagues day in, day out, focusing on this crisis and making sure that nobody thinks we are going to skip away until the Republicans act. This country faces a truly horrific eviction nightmare if action is not taken soon, and I am very pleased that my friend from Nevada is here I yield the floor to her. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada. Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam President, I am here today to support my colleagues and our cause to keep Americans in their homes. It is very simple. The House has already passed a number of bills to do just that, and the Senate needs to do the same thing. In this pandemic, housing is healthcare. I know that a lot of Americans have had their lives upended by this coronavirus pandemic, but I would like you to imagine for a moment how much more chaotic your life would feel if you found out that tomorrow you are going to be evicted. Imagine trying to make sure you are washing your hands while you are living in your car. We are in the middle of a public health crisis where we need people to be socially distancing, and that means they simply must have a safe, stable place to be at the end of the day. We realized this months ago in my State, and that is why Governor Sisolak put a hold on evicting residents through August 31 of this year. And Congress? Well, we passed the CARES Act to provide unemployment benefits and one-time relief. Those funds, plus the ban on evictions, were intended to help keep families in their homes. We are 60 days away from resuming evictions in Nevada. In my State and across the country, the wave of evictions we have been holding off for a month is going to come crashing down if we do not act now. Nevada has the highest unemployment rate in the entire country. In May, it was over 25 percent--as high as the national rate during the worst of the Great Depression. On top of that, some Nevadans haven't yet received their unemployment benefits or their pandemic unemployment benefits. Across the country, almost half of workers earning under $40,000 a year have lost income. Some people just don't have the ability to fully pay for the rent or mortgage, particularly when we are asking them to shelter in place. The thing is, in Nevada, we were already in the midst of a housing crisis even before this pandemic hit us. Almost half of Nevadans are renters. That is 45 percent. Of those renters, half are cost-burdened in some way, meaning that they pay more than 30 percent of their income in rent. Now, the Silver State has the biggest shortage in the country of affordable housing for the very lowest income Nevadans. We have just 19 units for every 100 that we need. Eviction isn't just a matter of spending a few days scrambling to find a new place. The financial consequences can follow families for years, and as for the effects on children's physical and mental health, well, there is no way to undo that. Believe me. I know. The foreclosure crisis hit Nevada in 2008, and I saw up close the pain that caused throughout my State when people were evicted from their homes. Lenders took the homes of more than 219,000 Nevada families during that period of time. That is why it is so vital that we pass legislation now to help Nevadans and people all across the country pay their rent and utility bills when they cannot safely go to work. I support Senator Brown's Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, as well as other bills introduced by my colleagues to keep homeowners in their homes. These bills provide essential stability to the rental and mortgage market. We can't expect landlords to keep shouldering the burden of missed payments. Landlords have bills to pay, as well--mortgages, taxes, insurance, and staff. Without assistance from us, many of them may go bankrupt or can be forced to sell their properties. Experts estimate that Nevada is going to need nearly $1 billion in rental assistance to keep families housed this year. Landlords can't lift the load and neither can State budgets that are already stretched too thin. So let's focus here on the essentials, the basic need for things like shelter. Let's keep people safe and off the streets. Let's pass Senator Brown's rental assistance bill, Senator Reed's housing assistance fund bill to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, and Senator Menendez's housing counseling bill, and the others we need to prevent an epidemic of homelessness. Across the Nation people are responding to the pandemic by staying at home because we asked them to do so. Now the Senate needs to do its part by making sure those homes are safe and stable so that Nevadans can continue to teach their children, care for loved ones who are ill, and avoid spreading coronavirus to others. In the midst of a global pandemic, housing is healthcare, and we owe this to each other. So let's act now on behalf of the American public and American families. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to support efforts by my Democratic colleagues to pass much needed and delayed economic measures by unanimous consent. It is painfully obvious that the economy is in bad shape. Families and small businesses continue to struggle and there is a real need for further Federal assistance. In order to get our economy back on track, this body must take action in crafting another comprehensive, bipartisan COVID relief package, and it must include additional help for families and communities including eviction and foreclosure prevention assistance, as well as additional help for State and local governments. Last night the Senate unanimously extended the PPP application window. This was a tiny but needed step in recognizing the depth of the economic crisis Americans are facing. Now the question before us is, will Republican leaders allow this body to work its will and provide needed, targeted, and effective rescue assistance, or will it continue to delay and deny assistance which will only prolong the pandemic, deepen the financial hole, and make the remedy costlier and recovery steeper? Strong State and local governments are critical to our economy. Indeed, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, State and local governments provide about 20 million jobs and contributed 8.5 percent to the national GDP in 2019. They did so by not only serving as customers and clients for our local and national businesses, but also by providing the essential services, such as public infrastructure, a strong education system, and other necessary functions that provide the business certainty that make our country attractive to businesses and investors throughout the world. We should do everything possible to maintain our country's comparative advantage relative to other countries. But today, as a result of the tremendous economic shock created by the coronavirus and the lack of a coherent public health strategy from the Trump administration, estimated State revenue shortfalls will total about $615 billion over the next 3 fiscal years, not including the added costs of fighting COVID-19. This is just for the States--$615 billion. This is why I initially fought for $750 billion in the Coronavirus Relief Fund when negotiating the CARES Act and introduced S. 3671, the State &amp; Local Emergency Stabilization Fund Act, which would provide an additional $600 billion to State and local governments to supplement the $150 billion in coronavirus relief funds I secured in the CARES Act. Madam President, would it surprise you to learn that the Trump Treasury Department has needlessly created a bureaucratic regulation that makes it difficult for States to use these coronavirus relief funds? And that this regulation is standing in the way of what should have been an immediate $150 billion boost to our economy, which even the Chamber of Commerce thinks is burdensome. Because of this onerous Trump rule, States can't use the coronavirus relief funds to replace lost or delayed tax revenues in order to maintain public services. That is what Neil Bradley, the U.S Chamber's chief policy officer said in an interview, ``Part of our conversation with Republicans on Capitol Hill is[[Page S4113]]that, ironically, if your concern is big State government, then the last thing you need to do is force States to replace one-time lost revenue with permanent tax increases.'' As the primary author of the Coronavirus Relief Fund, I can tell you that it is fully within the Treasury Secretary's authority and the intent of the CARES Act for these funds to be used to replace lost or delayed tax revenues and maintain public services. To prevent the flexible use of these relief funds is a choice that is neither required nor intended by law. Unfortunately, this completely unnecessary choice has already created avoidable economic harm. Since February, State and local governments have cut a total of 1.5 million jobs, an 8-percent drop that is twice the decline seen during and after the 2007-2009 recession. In addition, the Center for Economic and Policy Research reports that ``job losses forced on State and local governments by pandemic-related shortfalls will disproportionately impact the African American workforce . . . 14 percent of state and local employees were African American compared to 11.7 percent of private sector employees, a margin of 20 percent.'' As the Wall Street Journal reported in a May 24, 2020, article titled ``State and Local Budget Woes Create Drag for Economic Recovery Prospects': Based on evidence from the last recession, Mr. Chodorow- Reich, a Harvard economics professor, estimates that every dollar in cuts costs the economy $1.50 to $2. He also said every additional dollar in spending adds $1.50 to $2 to the economy. Of all the regulations that this administration seeks to cut, it should start with this one if it really wants a healthy economy. With just one stroke of the Treasury Secretary's pen, our economy can receive a direct multibillion dollar jolt today. But to be clear, this administrative fix is by no means sufficient because of the massive revenue shortfalls our State and local governments are facing. Congress still needs to provide additional and flexible fiscal relief to our State and local governments as part of its next fiscal package, and it is my hope that S. 3671, the State &amp; Local Stabilization Fund Act, is included. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, keeping families in their homes also must be included in the next package. According to Nicholas Chiumenti, with the New England Public Policy Center in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston: If current economic activity does not improve substantially, without an extension of the CARES Act, unemployment insurance or additional stimulus money or other fiscal relief, up to 13 percent of homeowners and 33 percent of renters in Rhode Island are at the risk of being unable to pay their mortgage or rent payments. This represents over 80,000 Rhode Island households. Nationally, according to census survey data, 23 percent of all adults reported being housing insecure in mid-June, meaning that they had missed last month's rent or mortgage payment or had slight or no confidence that their household could pay next month's rent or mortgage on time. We know that behind each one of these numbers is a family that can be homeless at the worst possible time in the middle of a public health emergency. For some, given their current health situations and age, there will be an additional human toll that we surely should strive to avoid. We implore our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with us to keep our constituents in their homes so that they too can make it to the other side of this public health emergency. In that spirit, I draw your attention to S. 3620, the Housing Assistance Fund. This legislation expands the existing ``Hardest Hit Fund'' model and provides it with additional resources for each State to keep families in their homes, the utilities on, the internet connected, and the property taxes paid. As a result, landlords who are also struggling to pay their own bills would receive some assistance. Madam President, it is not every day that the Independent Community Bankers of America and the Credit Union National Association support the same legislation with consumer rights and affordable housing organizations, such as the National Housing Conference, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the Center for Responsible Lending, and the National Consumer Law Center, among others. As we work toward this next fiscal relief package, I hope you and our colleagues will consider joining with us in enacting S. 3620, the Housing Assistance Fund. But we can't stop there. We must also immediately, among other needs, increase SNAP benefits to help the almost 150,000 Rhode Islanders who are food insecure during this crisis; boost public health efforts to help keep the virus at bay, from more testing and contact tracing to supporting our healthcare providers, to developing effective vaccine deployment systems; help childcare centers, public schools, and college campuses to safely reopen and support libraries in keeping our communities connected; provide relief for the hardest hit small and mid-sized businesses, many of which will continue to be shut down for the foreseeable future; and safeguard our election infrastructure, as Russia and other foreign actors seek again to use voter suppression, hacking, and disinformation in the 2020 elections. What exactly are we waiting for? Is it not enough that, according to a June 29 CNBC article, ``the employment-population ratio--the number of employed people as a percentage of the U.S adult population--plunged to 52.8 percent in May, meaning 47.2 percent of Americans are jobless, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics? Is it not enough that 46 percent of Business Roundtable CEOs expect employment at their companies to decrease in the next 6 months? We don't need to inflict any further unnecessary economic pain and suffering. I would also urge my colleagues to consider the costs of inaction. Indeed, during an April 29, 2020, press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell stated: I have long-time been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the Federal level. We have not been on such a path for some time, which . . . just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy. This is not the time to act on those concerns. This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible. This week we are also considering the National Defense Authorization Act, and every year for the last 59 years, Democrats and Republicans have come together to strengthen our national security and to help all Americans. We have proven that we are more than capable of working together productively on the most complex and controversial issues in service of our constituents, and we would like to continue that not just in the context of national defense but in the context of economic prosperity and security. One final point. We also need to extend unemployment compensation insurance because we know it will run out, and everyone has told us that unemployment rates will not drop dramatically. They will stay persistently high. People will need this assistance going forward. We must do more, and I hope we can do much more going forward. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cramer). The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a motion to be made, but before making it, I yield 3 minutes each to Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota and Senator Schatz from Hawaii. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe so much for his allowing me to say a few words. I know it is his time. And I thank my friend Jack Reed. Today is July 1, which means that rent and mortgage payments are due, and as I speak today, so many families across this country are being forced to make the difficult decision about how they will make this month's payment to stay in their homes. Even before the pandemic began, almost one-fourth of all renters, or 11 million households, were forced to pay more than half of their income for housing--half of their income. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, more than half a million people experienced homelessness on a[[Page S4114]]given night before the pandemic, and that has just gotten worse. That is why I am a strong supporter of Senator Brown's Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which will provide $100 billion in emergency funding. I am also proud to support Senator Reed's bill as well as the work of Senator Menendez. The pandemic, as we know, has wide and longstanding racial disparities in housing. We had a 30-percent gap in Black and White ownership rates before the pandemic due to discriminatory practices, and it has only made it worse. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, a leader and a good friend, has repeatedly reminded us that this means investing in programs like section 8 housing, which still remains unavailable to so many families. Yes, we need to address this shortage of affordable housing. We need to take action now. I thank my colleagues. We have an opportunity. The Fourth of July is at the beginning of July, but by the end of July, we had better have gotten something done, and that means help our State and local governments; that means funding for elections; and that means making sure we are responding to the crisis in housing. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today is the 1st of the month, and that means the rent is due, but for the 9 million renters who have lost their jobs, they may not be able to pay. Now, in March, we made sure that the CARES Act included cash assistance, unemployment benefits, and suspensions on evictions and mortgage forbearance to help the people who have been hurt the most by this pandemic. Lots of States and counties have set up their own programs, either subsidies or prohibitions on evictions themselves, but we are now 3 months later, and unemployment benefits stand to expire at the end of this month and moratoriums that allowed families to stay in their homes are ending. Eviction courts are reopening. Think about that. Eviction courts are reopening. So what we are facing is a ticking timebomb. We are facing the fact that it is true that people got forbearance on their rent or forbearance on their mortgage, but I remember very well in March and April, as I explained to the people of Hawaii, you are getting forbearance not forgiveness, which means you just simply don't have to pay your mortgage or your rent this month. You do have to eventually pay your mortgage or your rent. So what is going to happen is, for the most economically challenged among us in the United States, they are going to face a huge backpayment at the beginning of August or the beginning of September, and they are going to lose the place they live in. Now, I am very, very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and that we will intervene in July and incorporate the legislation Senator Brown is leading because the rent is going to be due, and we are going to--just as we faced this pandemic square in the eyes, we are going to be facing a massive eviction crisis. We have to take action. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. Inhofe. Mr. President, while we continue negotiating an agreement on amendments, I think we need to move forward and start voting on some of the amendments we know need votes. Therefore, in just a minute, I will call up the Paul amendment regarding the withdrawing of troops from Afghanistan. While I disagree with the substance of the amendment, I think the Senate should vote on it. So, at 5:30 today, I will move to table the amendment. We have talked to Senator Paul's office about this. Amendment No. 2011 Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I call up the Paul amendment No. 2011 to the text proposed to be stricken. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. INHOFE], for Mr. Paul, proposes an amendment numbered 2011. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows (Purpose: To withdraw all United States Armed Forces from Afghanistan) At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following: SEC. 1216. WITHDRAWAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM AFGHANISTAN. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Joint Resolution to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the attacks launched against the United States (Public Law 107-40) states, ``That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001''. (2) Since 2001, more than 3,002,635 men and women of the United States Armed Forces have deployed in support of the Global War on Terrorism, with more than 1,400,000 of them deploying more than once, and these Americans who volunteered in a time of war have served their country honorably and with distinction. (3) In November 2009 there were fewer than 100 Al-Qaeda members remaining in Afghanistan. (4) On May 2, 2011, Osama Bin Laden, the founder of Al- Qaeda, was killed by United States Armed Forces in Pakistan. (5) United States Armed Forces have successfully routed Al- Qaeda from the battlefield in Afghanistan, thus fulfilling the original intent of Public Law 107-40 and the justification for the invasion of Afghanistan, but public support for United States continued presence in Afghanistan has waned in recent years. (6) An October 2018 poll found that 57 percent of Americans, including 69 percent of United States veterans, believe that all United States troops should be removed from Afghanistan. (7) In June 2018, the Department of Defense reported, ``The al-Qa'ida threat to the United States and its allies and partners has decreased and the few remaining al-Qa'ida core members are focused on their own survival''. (b) Plan Required.--Not later than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, or designee, in cooperation with the heads of all other relevant Federal agencies involved in the conflict in Afghanistan shall-- (1)(A) formulate a plan for the orderly drawdown and withdrawal of all soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines from Afghanistan who were involved in operations intended to provide security to the people of Afghanistan, including policing action, or military actions against paramilitary organizations inside Afghanistan, excluding members of the military assigned to support United States embassies or consulates, or intelligence operations authorized by Congress; and (B) appear before the relevant congressional committees to explain the proposed implementation of the plan formulated under subparagraph (A); and (2)(A) formulate a framework for political reconciliation and popular democratic elections independent of United States involvement in Afghanistan, which may be used by the Government of Afghanistan to ensure that any political party that meets the requirements under Article 35 of the Constitution of Afghanistan is permitted to participate in general elections; and (B) appear before the relevant congressional committees to explain the proposed implementation of the framework formulated under subparagraph (A). (c) Removal and Bonuses.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act-- (1) all United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan as of such date of enactment shall be withdrawn and removed from Afghanistan; and (2) the Secretary of Defense shall provide all members of the United States Armed Forces who were deployed in support of the Global War on Terror with a $2,500 bonus to recognize that these Americans have served in the Global War On Terrorism exclusively on a volunteer basis and to demonstrate the heartfelt gratitude of our Nation. (d) Repeal of Authorization for Use of Military Force.--The Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) is repealed effective on the earlier of-- (1) the date that is 395 days after the date of the enactment of this Act: or (2) the date on which the Secretary of Defense certifies that all United States Armed Forces involved in operations or military actions in Afghanistan (as described in subsection (b)(1)(A)) have departed from Afghanistan. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I will move to table the Paul amendment at 5:30 today, and Senators should expect a rollcall vote at that time. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.[[Page S4115]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Coronavirus Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Congress has taken action in response to the coronavirus pandemic and its significant effects on workers, families, and the economy. It is because the State, Federal, and local governments shut down the U.S economy for the first time in the 240-year history of our country. We enacted four laws in March and April, which CBO says has increased the deficit by at least $2.4 trillion, but that doesn't measure the entirety of the relief. If you add in support from programs initiated by the Fed and the Treasury, you would add trillions more of relief. One of the recent pieces of legislation, the CARES Act, devoted $150 billion of direct Federal relief to governments of the States, localities, territories, the District of Columbia, and Tribes. That is around 16 percent of the total fiscal year 2020 State general fund expenditures enacted prior to the public emergency. In addition to the $150 billion, CBO has identified hundreds of billions more from the various relief programs that are directed to State and local governments. From the $340 billion of emergency funding in the CARES Act alone, the Senate appropriators have told me that more than 80 percent, or roughly $275 billion, goes to States and localities. So, you can see, the CARES Act alone provided $150 billion of direct aid to State and local governments, and the emergency funding added $275 billion. That means that $425 billion in the CARES Act is directed to governments of the States, localities, territories, Tribes, and the District of Columbia. That happens to be 47 percent of the total State general revenue expenditures enacted prior to the public emergency for fiscal year 2020 and about the same percentage of enacted total State revenue. On top of that, the Fed has allowed use of municipal securities as collateral for bank lending to help ease borrowing costs for local and State governments. Treasury and the Fed also established a Municipal Liquidity Facility. The purpose of it is to ``help state and local governments better manage cash flow pressures.'' The Fed will buy up to $500 billion of debt from State, counties, and cities. As others have noted here on this very floor, a significant amount of the funding directed to States and localities and the like are still in the pipeline and remain unspent or even unallocated. Some States, as I understand it, have not even allocated any money downstream to their own local governments from the $150 billion of direct aid provided under the CARES Act. Despite all that, we have heard a number of calls for massive amounts of additional spending. The reason, according to most people asking for more, is that the direct aid for States and localities in the CARES Act is too restrictive and cannot be used to replace lost revenue. I am sympathetic to the idea of giving States and localities more flexibility in how to use $150 billion of direct relief provided in the CARES Act if it is not needed for the virus health issues. Beyond that, I want you to know I am more skeptical, until we get more solid numbers on unrealized State and local revenue and the impact of the CARES dollars not yet allowed. I recently heard the minority leader here on the floor attempting to scold us Republicans for not doing exactly what he wants, exactly when he wants it, and saying we need to immediately spend more, including more direct aid to States. Of course, in his partisan political analysis, Republicans are blamed for not wanting massive amounts of additional aid for State and local governments because what he believes is ideological opposition to government in general. Now, that is quite a stretch, even for the minority leader. Republicans supported four pieces of legislation in recent months providing hundreds of billions of dollars in relief to State and local governments in various ways. I heard the Governor of California instruct Congress on moral and ethical grounds, saying that it is our duty to give more funding to States and localities or else first responders will be the first ones laid off by cities and counties. It is almost like the first argument when we were just about ready to shut down the Federal Government, if we don't finance everything, first thing we are going to do is shut down the Washington Monument. While that may have been a subtle threat from the Governor of California to use as leverage to pressure Congress to provide more funds to California, it is unfortunate that State and local governments laid off so many of their workers in recent months. That doesn't seem to be much dedication by government to its workforce. I heard from associations of Governors, associations of counties, cities, and other municipal governments that they need between a half a trillion and a trillion more in direct aid from the Federal Government. Usually, they cite a need to ``replace lost revenue.'' Many have asked for funds to cover lost revenue as far out as two additional fiscal years beyond fiscal year 2020. Most of those requests are based on forecasts of what the pandemic and the economy will look like for the rest of the year and even in coming years. I think you have to take those forecasts with a grain of salt. Just look at what the last employment report looked like relative to the forecasts, and you can tell how cloudy people's crystal balls are right now. I heard from some here on the floor that Moody's thinks States and localities may need hundreds of billions more in direct relief. People haven't been very careful, though, in reading the Moody's reports that are the basis of their arguments. Moody's Analytics, which makes very clear in the report that it is not an arm of Moody's that rates bonds--though, I am not sure everyone is clear on that--Moody's Analytics said in April that under their most severely adverse assumptions about the future, State and local governments would have a budget shortfall of around $172 billion over the next 15 months and more than $450 billion if you extend out to cover the years 2022. Again, this is all based on shaky forecasts, and it is not at all clear that the ratings on municipal bonds done by the Moody's ratings agency align with the forecasts of Moody's Analytics. More recently, Moody's Analytics' chief economist, Mark Zandi, who is a regular proponent of Keynesian stimulus for the Democratic Party, upped the estimate of the needs to about $500 billion. That number remarkably matches what we heard from the National Governors Association about 6 weeks ago. Dr. Zandi promises so-called bang-for-the-buck magic to save States and localities, but the government will have to pony up perhaps a half a trillion more just to start that magic. So I am skeptical, to put it mildly. If you remember, it was that kind of reasoning that led to the Obama stimulus promising vague and relatively quick unemployment deductions following the financial crisis but failed to come even close to these promised results. Finally, regarding funding requests, there is the Heroes Act over at the House. State and local aid in that act provides nearly $1 trillion to States and localities inside a liberal wish list in their bill. That, along with what we have already done, would put State and local relief at more than 75 percent of all combined State and local tax collections for a year, depending how you measure things. That is more of a Federal bailout than the partnership that we are asked to finance. I have heard a lot of calls for massive amounts of additional direct aid to our States, funded by Federal debt. Yet there still is a lot of money in the pipeline that hasn't even been used yet. And future needs of States and localities are highly uncertain--too uncertain, in my view--to commit the Federal Government today to half a trillion dollars or $1 trillion more to States and localities, on top of the $425 billion or more of funding already in play and up to $500 billion of credit support. I am highly skeptical of schemes to index future aid to measures of the incidence of COVID-19 cases, since we already have had controversies surrounding those measures, and some of them are political controversies. Of course, I do understand budget rules that States and localities operate[[Page S4116]]under. They do provide constraints. I also believe that proponents of massive amounts of additional Federal aid to States and localities overstate the severity of those constraints. I think State budgets are more flexible and fungible, for example, than some would have us believe. We have seen that flexibility recently in legislators' consideration of altering police funding or using taxpayers' funds to erect barriers in occupied zones of lawlessness as just one example of that flexibility. There are also many issues about incentives associated with massive new amounts of direct Federal funding of State and local governments. Sending massive amounts of additional Federal funds to States that were responsible in good times and built up rainy day funds means that they are treated the same as States that didn't build much, if any, in rainy day funds, as I said, Illinois and New Jersey, for examples. Those States that acted irresponsibly then get rewarded. Since funds in State and local governments are fungible, sending massive amounts of additional Federal dollars to States and localities means that hard-earned Federal tax dollars coming from Iowa, as an example, can end up helping financially unsustainable pension promises of fiscally irresponsible States, and it means that Federal tax revenues get channeled to States run by politicians who will not even enforce existing Federal laws and who use taxpayer resources on lawless occupied zones or sanctuary cities to provide benefits to undocumented residents. There are many of my constituents in Iowa who do not support those uses of Federal funds. So, as I wind down here, I am highly skeptical of sending massive amounts of additional funds to States and localities, since future needs are so highly uncertain and there is still unspent money in the pipelines. I am, however, sympathetic to providing additional flexibility for funds we have already provided in the CARES Act so that State and local communities can make broader uses of those funds. And I believe that if the pandemic and the economy worsens, under those circumstances, future needs can be addressed when needed. I understand that there are a range of views regarding additional funds for States and localities. At this point, I believe it may be useful to entertain more flexibility in what has already been approved, and there may be a need to make sure that States get shares of money they have received to counties and cities. There may even be a reasoned case for limited additional funding to States and localities in the near term, although, as I said, I am a bit skeptical. But approving half a trillion dollars to $1 trillion of additional funds for uncertain future needs right now to cover unknown State and local needs as far out as 2 years down the road just isn't the responsible or prudent action to take. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to complete my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2011 Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, Senator Udall and I are pleased to present a bipartisan amendment that will finally end America's longest war. Our amendment will finally and completely end the war in Afghanistan. Over 4,000 Americans have died in Afghanistan, and over 20,000 have been wounded. It is time to bring our soldiers home. I supported going into Afghanistan originally. Had I been in Congress at that time, I would have voted in favor of it. But the people who attacked us on 9/11 have all been killed or captured. Most of the people fighting us today are their successors or children or the children of their children. In fact, we now have soldiers who were born after 9/11 serving in Afghanistan. The cycle shows no sign of ending. The war shows no sign of ending. It is not sustainable to keep fighting in Afghanistan generation after generation. We have been fighting in Afghanistan for so long that our youngest soldiers fighting there weren't even born at the time. We have spent about $1 trillion to establish an Afghan Government--a government that is rife with corruption and dysfunction. We spent more to rebuild Afghanistan than the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. We have built infrastructure in Afghanistan and then watched it deteriorate and watched the Afghans be unable to even maintain the infrastructure we built for them, and then they ask us for more money to maintain the structure. Meanwhile, our roads and our bridges crumble here at home as we rebuild the infrastructure in Afghanistan. One example is, several years ago, we reportedly hired a local security consultant to help secure the roads at a cost of $1 million per year. But according to the report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, American officials came to suspect that the money was being funneled to insurgents to stage attacks on our infrastructure to justify the security contract. So our money was going to a guy who was paying insurgents to pretend to attack him so he could provide security for their infrastructure. It is crazy. We spent $43 million on a natural gas gas station. Guess how many vehicles in Afghanistan run on natural gas. Zero. You can't even find the gas station. My staff went there to see if the money had been spent, and they couldn't go there because it was too unsafe. Now the report is that the gas station has been abandoned--$43 million. We spent nearly $80 million on a luxury hotel. Why is the American taxpayer building luxury hotels in Kabul? Guess what. A contractor ran off with the money. It is a skeleton. The Taliban are now said to climb up into the structure and shoot down at our Embassy. What kind of foolhardy nature of government are we that we continue to stay there? These are just a few of the many examples that have had us spend more than we spent in Europe on the Marshall Plan. We continue to pour good money after bad into Afghanistan, hoping that the outcome will somehow change, hoping that maybe the first 20 years will produce better results than the last 20 years did. This NDAA, this defense authorization that we are debating here in the Senate, even has the sense of the Senate in it opposing a precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan. We have been there for 20 years. How can we characterize withdrawal after 20 years, after we defeated the enemy, as precipitous? It is crazy. The American people say ``Come home,'' and this is your chance. Many people have said that we should end the war. Today, you get to vote. Are you for staying in Afghanistan for another generation? Are you for continuing a war that has lost its purpose? Today, we get to vote up or down: Are you for the war or against the war? Does the war still have a mission? The American people know better. They are ready to declare victory and come home. It is why President Trump's message resonated with so many. He said ``It is time to come home,'' and the people agreed. Not only is it time to end the war and focus on our needs at home, but it is time to reward those who fought the battle. We are spending $50 billion a year over there. From the savings in the first year, in our amendment, Senator Udall and I will provide a $2,500 bonus for anyone who has been deployed in the long War on Terror. That is a pretty good bonus. Our soldiers deserve it, and they also deserve to come home because there is no military mission left. Instead of spending another $50 billion in Afghanistan next year, let's give some of that money to our soldiers who fought the war, and let's begin saving some money from the massive deficit we face here at home. This is the Senate's chance to show that it is time to declare victory. It is time to come home. I urge support for my amendment, and I also remind Senators this is your chance to vote to end a war. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition, and I thank Senator Inhofe. I talked to him.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3489295</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608P-MW11-JDG9-Y3PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"19985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The comment was written on March 13, 2020, and posted on March 17, 2020:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Employment Law Project (\"NELP\") submits these comments in response to the Request for Information (\"RFI\") \"Improving and/or reforming regulatory enforcement and adjudication\" submitted by the Office of Management and Budget./1</p><p>NELP is a non-profit organization with over 50 years of experience advocating on behalf of low-wage workers. We seek to advance the interests of American workers, especially low-wage workers with an emphasis on workers of color, women, part-time employees, immigrant workers, and other groups that face significant barriers to employment and government systems of support. These groups depend, in large part, on regulatory enforcement to protect their rights, either because there is no private enforcement mechanism, or because private enforcement is often beyond their means.</p><p>NELP opposes any weakening of the enforcement system implementing federal laws protecting workers from financial exploitation, injury or death, or discrimination. Since much of NELP's experience and expertise relates to activities of the Department of Labor (\"DOL\"), this response will focus most of its examples on those arising from DOL issues. However, it should be stressed the issues raised by this response to the RFI apply across the entire range of the Federal Government's civil enforcement.</p><p>NELP writes to raise three concerns raised by the RFI, and then responds to the listed questions in the RFI.</p><p>1. The RFI fails to recognize the critical role that regulatory enforcement and adjudication play.</p><p>2. Due process only pertains to adjudication, not investigation.</p><p>3. Investigations by the USDOL are extremely rare.</p><p>I. Regulatory enforcement is key to protecting the health and safety and economic security of America's workers and their families.</p><p>NELP has significant concerns that the RFI suggests an overall bias against regulatory enforcement, and fails to recognize the crucial role that regulatory enforcement and adjudication play in protecting the health, safety and financial stability of all Americans. The RFI fails to even acknowledge the possibility that regulatory enforcement needs to be strengthened in today's economy, to ensure the protection of protected individuals and groups. Noteworthy by its absence is any solicitation of responses suggesting that regulatory enforcement should be strengthened.</p><p>The RFI says that it premised on the importance of protection against \"unjust or arbitrary exercise of government power,\"/2 and yet it totally fails to recognize the significant protections afforded by the health, safety and financial regulatory laws enacted by Congress, often in response to disasters such as mine explosions or financial crises, caused by the lack of an adequate regulatory structure or enforcement. Far more harm has been caused to American workers by the underregulated private sector than by the \"unjust or arbitrary exercise of government power.\"/3</p><p>II. Due process is not applicable to regulatory investigations, and the RFI conflates enforcement with adjudication.</p><p>As a threshold matter, it is important to point out a basic misperception and unsupported assumption present throughout the RFI; namely that, \"OMB solicits input on regulatory reform that will better safeguard due process in the regulatory enforcement and adjudication settings.\" (emphasis added). Investigation and adjudication are two entirely different settings to which different legal rules and policy considerations apply.</p><p>It is clear that due process rights attach to adjudication settings, whether in civil or criminal courts or before administrative tribunals. However, it is equally clear that while certain Constitutional rights do govern the initiation or conduct of civil investigations (constraints against discrimination or search and seizure for example), full due process rights do not attach to the initiation or conduct of regulatory investigations. A review of the origins and nature of due process rights clearly demonstrates this mistaken assumption that infects the entirety of the RFI.</p><p>The concept of due process arose in 1215 in clause 39 of the original version of the Magna Carta issued by King John./4</p><p>This principle was carried through in various iterations of English law for centuries and was eventually adopted into our Constitution by enactment of the Fifth Amendment (and later extended by adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment). With the enactment of the Fifth Amendment, the right not to \"be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\" was added to the Constitution. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976) (\"Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of 'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.\")</p><p>More recently, the Supreme Court again explained that \"[u]nder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'\"Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2597 (2015). (emphasis added). Clearly no decision merely to initiate or conduct an investigation will deprive any person or entity of life, liberty or property. Any such deprivation would only come through the mechanism of an administrative adjudication, to which due process rights would attach.</p><p>Any claim for reckless investigation would have to be premised on some right other than that set forth in the Due Process Clause. See Geness v. Cox, 902 F.3d 344 (3rd Cir. 2018) (\"Although Geness purports to state a claim for reckless investigation under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, such a claim, if cognizable, could only arise under the Fourth Amendment.\"); Sarfo v. State, 429 P.3d 650 (Nev. 2018) (\"In fact, due process protections \"need not be made available in proceedings that merely involve fact-finding or investigatory exercises by the government agency.\" Id. at 587, 287 P.3d at 311 (citing Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 442, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960).</p><p>III. Investigations of employers by the DOL are extremely rare.</p><p>While enforcement of such basic protections as provided, for example, by the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") or the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"OSH Act\") are crucially important to those covered by such laws, the actual likelihood of any individual or business being investigated by the Federal Government is minuscule. While death and taxes are inevitable, being the subject of a Federal Government regulatory enforcement investigation lies at the other end of the spectrum.</p><p>For example, there are over nine million workplaces under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s jurisdiction. According to numbers just released, Federal OSHA now has a total of 862 inspectors on staff to cover millions of workplaces. This is the lowest number of inspectors in 45 years./5</p><p>In FY 2018, there were only 1,815 inspectors (752 federal and 1,063 state) to inspect the 9.8 million workplaces under OSHA jurisdiction. Given these limited and inadequate resources, federal OSHA has enough inspectors to inspect workplaces only once every 165 years, while state OSHA plans have enough inspectors to inspect workplaces once every 108 years./6</p><p>Enforcement of wage and hour laws is another example. 143 million of America's workers in more than 9.8 million establishments are covered by the various wage laws./7</p><p>At the end of Fiscal Year 2019, DOL's Wage and Hour Division (\"WHD\") employed only 780 investigators for the entire country, far less than the over 1,000 inspectors employed during Fiscal Years 2010 to 2013.</p><p>According to a 2018 investigation and report by Politico:</p><p>The federal Department of Labor has 894 investigators -- vastly more than any state agency. By historic measures, though, its investigative workforce isn't particularly large. In 1948, when the United States had 23 million workers, the division had 1,000 investigators. Today, the U.S. has seven times as many workers, but slightly fewer federal wage-and-hour investigators than it had 70 years ago./8</p><p>Looking at Wage and Hour enforcement from another perspective, in Fiscal Year 2019 the WHD concluded 26,876 cases./9</p><p>Even in the unlikely event that each case involved a separate workplace, those case involved only a small fraction of the almost ten million establishments covered by the Wage and Hour law. Thus, the chance of a particular workplace being the subject of a Federal Government regulatory enforcement investigation is quite limited.</p><p>NELP's comments on the specific questions asked by the RFI are set forth below.</p><p>1. Prior to the initiation of an adjudication, what would ensure a speedy and/or fair investigation?</p><p>By far the most significant obstacle to providing a speedy resolution of any regulatory enforcement investigation is lack of staffing. The OSHA and WHD staffing numbers referenced above makes clear that the number of inspectors in these two very crucial programs designed to protect the health, safety and fair pay of covered workers is simply not sufficient to provide a speedy and/or fair inspection or enforcement process.</p><p>Staffing inadequacies are present across the federal government as the population of the United States has grown and the number of federal employees has not kept pace. As one study put it, \"[s]pecifically, with the exception of some brief upticks, the percentage of the nation's population working for the federal government has declined by almost half since about 1970.\"/10</p><p>The only fair inspection is one that has been undertaken by inspectors who have the resources to thoroughly complete an investigation, by gathering all the information necessary and then carefully reviewing it to determine if it has any merit. Inadequate staffing and pressure to perform more investigations in less time is more likely to result in delays to the employer and a failure to uncover wrongdoing than an unjustified finding of wrongdoing./11</p><p>Both workers and law-abiding employers benefit from investigations that are carefully and completely undertaken. Furthermore, insufficient staffing that allows employers to violate safety and/or wage and hour laws provides a competitive advantage to employers not following those laws, and penalizes employers that do adhere to all legal requirements. 29 U.S.C. 202 (a)(violations of the FLSA constitute an unfair method of competition). Thus, increased staffing to adequate levels in regulatory enforcement is the most efficient and market-oriented mechanism to prevent a race to the bottom by employers that jeopardizes and penalizes workers, and disadvantages law-abiding employers.</p><p>This question also asks about the possibility of requiring agencies to \"show cause\" on order \"to continue an investigation.\" It is not clear at what stage of an investigation such a process is contemplated. However, this suggestion unreasonably would require government agencies to have the evidence in hand before undertaking or continuing an investigation, whose purpose is to obtain just that evidence.</p><p>Investigations take varying amounts of time, and building in an artificial point to determine whether one should continue is inconsistent with the way that investigations are conducted. Requiring investigators to meet some undefined showing though an unspecified process before an unmentioned adjudicator will build in more delay for the company and the worker(s), more burden on the subject of the investigation, and further strain already inadequate investigatory resources. This process also has the potential to subject employers to the burden of participating in, and possibly being the subject of negative publicity about, potential regulatory violations that the investigation could ultimately find to be without merit. Absent the \"show cause\" process, these investigations will not impose those additional transaction and publicity costs on employers who are found to not violate any regulatory requirements.</p><p>The most efficient way to determine whether investigations should continue is the sound judgment of investigators and their superiors determining how to allocate scarce investigative resources, and this happens in the DOL right now. Whether triggered by complaints from individuals or organizations or based on well-reasoned targeting of workplaces that have historically had violations present, regulatory enforcement investigations are initiated according to a robust and time-tested internal revue processes inside agencies. While the effectiveness of those review processes is subject to review, criticism and suggested improvements, to the extent problems have emerged, the solution is improvement in management practices rather than a meddlesome and inefficient insertion of an adjudication process that may or may not change an outcome. To do otherwise would risk terminating investigations of actual violations simply because more fact-finding investigation is needed.</p><p>2. When do multiple agencies investigate the same (or related) conduct and then force Americans to contest liability in different proceedings across multiple agencies?</p><p>There are occasions when coordination occurs between different government agencies. For instance, at DOL, OSHA has responsibility for investigating allegations that an employer has retaliated against an employee because the worker engaged in protected activity relating to a wide variety of areas, including, but not limited to, workplace safety or health, consumer products, environmental issues, food issues, or airline safety. However, if such activity by an employee is taken in concert with other employees, this activity also falls within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\"), which protects concerted activity by employees. OSHA and the NLRB already have procedures in place to coordinate their respective responsibilities./12</p><p>Similarly, DOL's Office of Federal Contract Compliance (\"OFCCP\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") share enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws. Thus, OFCCP and EEOC have established procedures to coordinate their responsibilities in this area, and these procedures provide for sharing of information, Compliance Coordination Committees, and transfer of complaints incorrectly filed with one agency to the other agency./13</p><p>Other such overlaps and coordination occur across the government. The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") shares responsibility for civil enforcement of the antitrust laws with the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), though only DOJ can bring criminal charges. There is a formal agreement between DOJ and the FTC that sets forth procedures to determine which agency will be responsible for particular matters./14</p><p>The suggestion in the RFI to avoid overlap by adjudicating overlapping matters \"in a single proceeding before a single adjudicator\" fails to recognize the complexity of factual settings where different agencies have responsibility over the same or similar facts but apply different laws to each. Thus, while both OSHA and the NLRB have responsibility to protect workers from retaliation, each agency is doing so by enforcing a different law that has different standards, different processes and different penalties. It would not be possible to adjudicate the legal protections enforced by OSHA and the NLRB before a single adjudicator.</p><p>It is also important to note that a finding, either for or against a party to a regulatory proceeding under one statute does not and should not determine the results under another statute judging whether the same or similar conduct violated a different set of rules. The same action that violates one statute might not be a violation of another. It is also possible that a claimant might have his or her claim dismissed as untimely under one regulatory scheme while being timely under another. For instance, an employee might have an untimely claim alleging violation of section 11(c) of the OSH Act involving retaliation for protected safety-related whistleblower activities, which allows only a thirty-day period to file a complaint. However, that employee might have a timely claim of a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, which has a six-month statute of limitations./15</p><p>In the rare instance of two agencies enforcing the same law, the kind of clearance procedure that the DOJ and the FTC have established already provides for a single adjudication suggested by this question. NELP is not aware of any situation where such an overlap exists without coordination procedures already in place.</p><p>3. Would applying the principle of res judicata in the regulatory context reduce duplicative proceedings?</p><p>NELP is not aware of any context in which applying res judicata would arise in the context of regulatory enforcement investigations as opposed to in adjudications. Since application of res judicata requires an adjudicatory decision, this question appears relevant only to situations where an adjudication has been completed and then another investigation by the same or another agency is undertaken. To the extent that this question suggests that actions by individual federal employees in the course of their duties could bind the agency, such as by not citing a violation, that is clearly inconsistent with any of the premises underlying the concept of res judicata and more basically with the agency obligation to enforce all laws within its jurisdiction.</p><p>NELP is not aware of any DOL enforcement activities where more than one agency in DOL or elsewhere could investigate the same facts to determine anew whether a violation of the same law occurred. While a DOL investigation of possible FLSA or OSH Act violations might well turn up evidence of violations of other laws, ranging from tax evasion to human trafficking, res judicata principles would have no relevance in that circumstance. Of course, once an administrative adjudication takes place, the principles of res judicata do apply.</p><p>4. [W]hat reforms would ensure an American never has to prove the absence of liability.</p><p>NELP is not aware of any situation, at DOL or elsewhere, that requires an individual or business \"to prove an absence of legal liability\" as asked in this question. Any regulatory enforcement proceeding is required to follow the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267 (1994), interpreting section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), which states that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof.\" In that case, the Supreme Court, in interpreting the APA, decided that the proponent in a proceeding-- the Government in any regulatory enforcement proceeding brought against an individual entity-- has the burden of persuading the trier of fact.</p><p>Consistent with this obligation, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\"OSHRC\"), for example, explains in its website discussion of \"How OSHRC Works\" that \"[t]he Secretary of Labor, OSHA's representative, is represented by a government attorney who bears the burden of proving the violation(s).\"/16</p><p>Similarly, the rules of the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (\"MSHRC\") provide that \"[t]he proponent of an order has the burden of proof\"./17</p><p>The standard applied by OSHRC is preponderance of evidence. See Master Construction Co., Inc., OSHRC Docket No. 18-0170, January 27, 2020. (\"The Secretary must establish his prima facie case by preponderance of the evidence. See Hartford Roofing Co., 17 BNA OSHC 1361 (No. 92-3855, 1995\"). That is typically the standard applied in both administrative adjudication and most civil court litigation. Even though that is the least burdensome standard of proof (as opposed to for example a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard or the beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard found in criminal cases, it clearly puts the burden on the government rather than requiring an individual or business \"to prove an absence of legal liability.\" While the DOL Office of Administrative Law Judge Rules of Practice and Procedure, 29 C.F.R. Part 18, do not contain a similar specific requirement, those proceedings are bound by the Supreme Court's interpretation of section 7(c) of the APA in Greenwich Collieries, which places the burden of persuading the ALJ on the government in any regulatory enforcement proceeding before a DOL ALJ. Simply put, the answer to the question posed \"[w]hat reforms would ensure an American prove never has to prove the absence of liability\" is that none are needed because in regulatory enforcement proceedings, the Government always bears the burden of establishing the violation.</p><p>5. What evidentiary rules apply in regulatory proceedings to guard against hearsay and/or weigh reliability and relevance? Would the application of some of the Federal Rules of Evidence create a fairer evidentiary framework, and if so, which Rules?</p><p>Across regulatory enforcement adjudications, no consistent set of evidentiary rules has been applied. For instance, OSHRC follows the Federal Rules of Evidence in its adjudications./18</p><p>See 29 CFR 2200.71 (\"The Federal Rules of Evidence are applicable.\") MSHRC takes a different approach. See 29 CFR 700.63(a) (\"Relevant evidence, including hearsay evidence, that is not unduly repetitious or cumulative is admissible.\") It does not seem advisable to attempt to proclaim any uniform set of evidentiary rules applicable to all administrative adjudications.</p><p>Allowing each adjudicatory body the flexibility to adopt its rules to its circumstances and its stakeholders seems preferable to assuming that the same rules fit every circumstance. At times the formality of the Federal Rules of Evidence might work best, while at other times more informal proceedings might allow the subjects of the proceedings to make their case more effectively and reduce their legal costs. In some cases, it might even allow them to successfully appear without imposing costs of legal representation by providing a liberal regimen concerning introduction of evidence. Consistent with this view, the Administrative Conference of the United States has recommended that Congress not require Federal Agencies to adopt the Federal Rules of Evidence./19</p><p>6. Should agencies be required to produce all evidence favorable to the respondent?</p><p>This question seems to echo the criminal law requirements imposed on prosecutors by the Supreme Court in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). This approach simply does not fit into the adjudicatory scheme of administrative regulatory processes, where there is unlikely to be an incriminating statement by another individual that he or she committed the offense, or evidence that the defendant was present somewhere else at the time of the crime. The requirements imposed by Brady also reflect the limited amount of discovery available in criminal proceedings. In contrast, administrative adjudication typically allows for broad-ranging discovery that does have the ability to disclose \"all evidence favorable to the respondent.\" OSHRC rules provide for discovery through interrogatories, requests for admission, production of documents and depositions. See 29 CFR 2200.52. MSHRC rules also provide for similar expansive discovery. See 29 CFR 2700.56. The rules governing proceeding before administrative law judges (\"ALJ\") in DOL's Office of Administrative Law Judges also provide a broad range of discovery tools. See 29 CFR 18.50-65.</p><p>To the extent that any particular administrative proceeding does not allow necessary and reasonable discovery, the rules involving that proceeding could be revised to allow it. Thus, there is no need to protect litigants by imposing an open-ended requirement imported from criminal law into civil administrative proceedings.</p><p>7. Do adjudicators sometimes lack independence from the enforcement arm of the agency?</p><p>Since the decision of the Supreme Court in Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018) finding that an ALJ employed by the Security &amp; Exchange Commission was an \"inferior officer\" subject to the Appointments Clause of the Constitution and thus can only be appointed by the President, \"Courts of Law,\" or \"Heads of Departments,\" there has been a significant diminishment in the impartiality of many agency adjudicators.</p><p>Subsequent to Lucia, the President issued Executive Order 13843 (July 10, 2018), which placed administrative law judges in the excepted service and gave agencies \"greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in ALJ candidates,\" thus clearly reducing the independence of ALJs. While several important DOL programs have administrative schemes featuring both a trial before an ALJ and appeal to a tribunal, both of which are independent of the Secretary of Labor, (OSHRC and MSHRC) other DOL ALJs are now appointed by the Secretary of Labor./20</p><p>Shortly after the issuance of Executive Order13843, then-Secretary of Labor Acosta ratified the appointment of the existing DOL ALJs./21</p><p>He then issued Secretary's Order 07-2018./22</p><p>which set out procedures for the Secretary of Labor to appoint DOL ALJs. Similar actions have been taken by other federal agencies in response to Lucia and Executive Order 13843. Furthermore, recently DOL has published a Direct Final Rule in the Federal Register providing discretion for the Secretary to \"to assert his decision-making prerogatives\" over the Administrative Review Board and the Board of Alien Labor Certification./23</p><p>This Direct Final Rule will make these ALJ's even less independent.</p><p>Overall, the net effect of these developments is to reduce the independence of adjudicators in the regulatory enforcement world. In a forthcoming law review article \"Regulating Impartiality In Agency Adjudication\" 69 DUKE L.J. ___ (forthcoming 2020) by Professor Kent Barnett, Associate Professor of Law, University of Georgia School of Law, the author proposes what he calls \"impartiality regulations\" giving increased protection to agency adjudicators. Without adopting either the analysis or the specific proposals in this article, NELP endorses the principle that further action to protect the independence of agency adjudicators is necessary in light of recent developments.</p><p>8. Do agencies provide enough transparency regarding penalties and</p><p>fines?</p><p>Statutory authority, which is of course public, is necessary for any agency to have the authority to impose penalties. Furthermore, the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, Public Law 114-74, requires annual adjustment of penalties to adjust for inflation, which is done by Federal Register notice./24</p><p>These are also likely to be publicly available, as with OSHA./25</p><p>Thus, transparency does not seem to be a significant issue in regard to administrative penalties.</p><p>However, adequacy of penalties may well be an item of concern. NELP proposes that each administrative agency with the statutory authority to impose penalties should periodically review the adequacy of its penalties by reviewing whether they are sufficiently severe to deter the prohibited conduct within the agency's jurisdiction. A report of that review should then be furnished to relevant committees of Congress.</p><p>9. When do regulatory investigations and/or adjudications coerce Americans into resolutions/settlements?</p><p>Clearly the vast majority of cases, both in the civil and criminal courts and before administrative tribunals, are settled. This should be not viewed in a negative light, as litigation is time-consuming and expensive and not generally in the interest of either party as an alternative to a reasonable settlement. While there has been justifiable criticism of coercive resolutions in criminal cases where defendants are faced with years of incarceration, or even imposition of the death penalty, and are often defended by under-resourced public defenders, regulatory enforcement is generally applicable to adequately-represented business entities who are in a position to make a reasoned business judgment that balances the cost in time, money and distraction as well as the uncertain prospects of any litigation, against the costs and benefits of settlements.</p><p>Rather than coercive settlements being the principal problem with the penalty regime in most systems of regulatory enforcement, inadequate penalty levels are a far more consequential problem. Many civil penalty systems are the opposite of the criminal justice world where, until recently, the trend was for legislatures to consistently increase the severity of possible sentences. For example, the National Labor Relations Act does not provide for civil fines, punitive damages or awards of attorney's fees to opposing counsel in cases where employers are found guilty of wrongdoing. Last year the Federal Trade Commission settled a case against YouTube for \"repeated, knowing violations of children's privacy laws\" under which a $170 million fine was imposed. As noted by a press account, \"[f]or YouTube's parent company, Alphabet, that works out to roughly two days' worth of profit.\"/26</p><p>10. Are agencies and agency staff accountable to the public in the context of enforcement and adjudications?</p><p>Every Federal agency is headed by a political appointee appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Thus, accountability for actions or inactions of that agency is provided by the political process. In these times, every day provides evidence that the administration of federal programs and responsibilities across the Federal government is the subject of discussion and contention. Furthermore, the Constitution's separation of powers design provides further accountability through Congressional oversight. Accountability could be significantly improved if the administration and individual federal agencies and officials would promptly and completely respond to Congressional requests for information, documents and/or testimony. This is clearly one area where agencies can create greater accountability by promptly responding to Congressional requests, and refraining from asserting unjustified claims of confidentiality or privilege.</p><p>More generally, accountability can be increased and fostered by an increase in transparency. Public pressure cannot be brought to bear on agencies when the public is kept in the dark. While Justice Brandeis noted that sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants, secrecy concerning the operation of government operates as a toxic mold deteriorating faith in government by allowing actions and inactions of government agencies to avoid scrutiny and the accountability that results from such scrutiny.</p><p>One significant tool to promote accountability is the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"). The promise and benefit of that Act is, however, severely hindered by lack of staffing and low priority given to FOIA requests that delay responses. While justice delayed is justice denied, disclosure delayed is accountability denied. The FOIA backlog is a government-wide problem that varies among agencies. According to the DOL Freedom of Information Act Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2019, the agency had 1729 pending requests, of which almost 73 percent involved requests to OSHA and MSHA./27</p><p>One of the most effective ways for the administration to increase accountability would be to mandate increased staffing and priority for FOIA requests, as well as a establishing a strong preference for public disclosure to the extent possible.</p><p>Another area where accountability can be increased through increased transparency is in the area of access to pleadings and other documents filed before administrative tribunals. The proceedings of many of these tribunals are open to the public and many of their decisions are available online, sometimes through agency postings but other times only through paid subscription services. What is not available, however, is access to the entire docket to understand the progress of the case and access to any documents filed in the case other than decisions. This kind of access is available for Federal courts through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (\"PACER\") system./28</p><p>PACER provides access to dockets and filings in federal trial and appellate, civil and criminal courts. While issues concerning the extent of the fees charged by PACER are currently being litigated,/29 PACER clearly provides a superior model for providing access to information concerning administrative tribunals. NELP suggests that the government move to foster accountability by creating a PACER-like system for access to the proceedings of administrative tribunals and that, ideally, it should be free as an exercise in allowing the public access to the working of these bodies.</p><p>11. Are there certain types of proceedings that, due to exigency or other causes, warrant fewer procedural protections than others?</p><p>It has been a longstanding and well-reasoned policy in a wide variety of situations that exigent circumstances often require immediate action and less procedural protection. To use one recent example, the Centers for Disease Control recently issued an order quarantining almost 200 U.S. citizens who were flown back from Wuhan China in late January./30</p><p>In other, perhaps less dramatic but equally justified situations, the federal government has authority to take swift action in the face of imminent threats. For example, MSHA inspectors are required to issue an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 when it discovers a hazard. MSHA requires that:</p><p>Because the purpose of Section 107(a) orders is to immediately remove miners from exposure to serious hazards and to prevent miners from entering such hazardous areas, an imminent danger must be impending at the time an order is issued. Therefore, when an imminent danger is observed, the inspector must, as soon as possible and at the time the imminent danger is being observed, either issue a written or an oral Section 107(a) order./31</p><p>Nothing less immediate would be reasonable. Similarly, across the federal government there are situations ranging from the Federal Aviation Administration barring commercial flights near Iran,/32 to the Department of Agriculture requiring a quarantine of livestock affected with brucellosis, a serious and contagious livestock disease. (\"All cattle and/or bison, except steers and spayed heifers, must be confined to the premises until the herd is free of brucellosis or sold for slaughter . . .\" Brucellosis Eradication: Uniform Methods and Rules)./33</p><p>Thus, the answer to the question whether certain proceedings require less procedural protections has repeatedly been answered in the affirmative by Congress and numerous federal agencies based on wellreasoned and well-accepted policy determinations. NELP concurs with those longstanding determinations.</p><p>In conclusion, NELP asserts its concern about the one-sided nature of this RFI, and cautions against imposing any policies that hinder enforcement and reduce the protections afforded to the public by our nation's critical regulatory systems that promote safety and health, fair pay, and a wide range of public benefits.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>/s/ Rebecca Dixon</p><p>Rebecca Dixon</p><p>Executive Director</p><p>National Employment Law Project</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1/ 85 FR 5483</p><p>2/

They also lead to data breaches and loss of individuals' control over personal information. Existing enforcement mechanisms fail to hold data processors accountable and provide little-to-no relief for privacy violations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The privacy principles outline four concepts that any meaningful data protection legislation should incorporate at a minimum:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Privacy protections must be strong, meaningful, and comprehensive.</p><p>* Data practices must protect civil rights, prevent unlawful discrimination, and advance equal opportunity.</p><p>* Governments at all levels should play a role in protecting and enforcing privacy rights.</p><p>* Legislation should provide redress for privacy violations.</p><p>These public interest privacy principles include a framework providing guidelines for policymakers considering how to protect the privacy of all Americans effectively while also offering meaningful redress. They follow three days of Federal Trade Commission hearings about big data, competition, and privacy as well as the comment deadline on \"Developing the Administration's Approach to Privacy,\" a request for comment from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as the agency works to develop privacy policy recommendations for the Trump Administration, and ongoing work at the National Institute for Standards and Technology to develop a privacy risk framework.</p><p>The groups urge members of Congress to pass privacy legislation that ensures fairness, prevents discrimination, advances equal opportunity, protects free expression, and facilitates trust between the public and companies that collect their personal data.</p><p>New America's Open Technology Institute, Public Knowledge, Access Humboldt, Access Now, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology, Center for Digital Democracy, Center for Media Justice, Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology at Georgetown Law, Color of Change, Common Cause, Common Sense Kids Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Customer Commons, Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Media Alliance, Media Mobilizing Project, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Consumer Law Center, National Consumers League, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Oakland Privacy, Open MIC (Open Media and Information Companies Initiative), Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, and United Church of Christ, OC Inc. signed the principles. Additional local and national privacy advocates are encouraged to sign on.</p><p>The following can be attributed to Eric Null, Senior Policy Counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute:</p><p>\"For decades, privacy regulation has favored the company over the user -- companies set their own rules and users are left to fend for themselves. Worse, companies have even discriminated based on protected classes through algorithmic decision-making. Comprehensive privacy legislation must disrupt this status quo. Legislation that follows the public interest privacy principles will better protect users and give users more control over their data.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Allie Bohm, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge:</p><p>\"It is imperative that any comprehensive privacy legislation reflect the concerns, interests, and priorities of actual human beings. Today, consumer protection, privacy, and civil rights groups come together to articulate those interests, priorities, and concerns. Importantly, these principles address the many harms people can experience from privacy violations and misuse of personal data, including enabling unfair price discrimination; limiting awareness of opportunities; and contributing to employment, housing, health care, and other forms of discrimination.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Amie Stepanovich, U.S. Policy Manager at Access Now:</p><p>\"From Europe to India to Brazil, data privacy legislation is becoming the norm around the world, and people in the United States are getting left behind. It is long past time that our legislators acted to protect people across the country from opaque data practices that can result in its misuse and abuse, and any acceptable package must start with these principles.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Josh Golin, Executive Director at Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood:</p><p>\"What big tech offers for 'free' actually comes at a high cost -- our privacy. Worst of all is how vulnerable kids are tracked online and then targeted with manipulative marketing. This has to stop. We need laws that will empower parents to protect their children's privacy.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Joseph Jerome, Policy Counsel at Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology:</p><p>\"Debates about national privacy laws focus on how companies should implement Fair Information Practices. The operative word is 'fair.' When it comes to how companies collect, use, and share our data, too many business practices are simply unfair. Federal law must go beyond giving consumers more notices and choices about their privacy, and we think it is time for legislators in Congress to flip the privacy presumption and declare some data practices unfair.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katharina Kopp, Director of Policy at Center for Digital Democracy:</p><p>\"To this day, U.S. citizens have had to live without effective privacy safeguards. Commercial data practices have grown ever more intrusive, ubiquitous and harmful. It is high time to provide Americans with effective safeguards against commercial surveillance. Any legislation must not only effectively protect individual privacy, it must advance equitable, just and fair data uses, and must protect the most vulnerable among us, including children. In other words, they must bring about real changes in corporate practices. We have waited long enough; the time is now.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Laura Moy, Executive Director at Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology at Georgetown Law:</p><p>\"Americans want their data to be respected, protected, and used in ways that are consistent with their expectations. Any new legislation governing commercial data practices must advance these goals, and also protect us from data-driven activities that are harmful to society. We need privacy to protect us from uses of data that exclude communities from important opportunities, enable faceless brokers to secretly build ever-more-detailed profiles of us, and amplify political polarization and hate speech.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Yosef Getachew, Director of Media and Democracy Program at Common Cause:</p><p>\"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe they have lost control over how their personal information is collected and used across the internet ecosystem. Numerous data breaches and abuses in data sharing practices, which have jeopardized the personal information of millions of Americans, have validated these fears. Our current privacy framework no longer works, and the lack of meaningful privacy protections poses a serious threat to our democracy. Companies can easily manipulate data to politically influence voters or engage in discriminatory practices. These principles should serve as a baseline for any comprehensive privacy legislation that guarantees all Americans control over their data.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to James P. Steyer, CEO and Founder, at Common Sense:</p><p>\"Any federal legislation should provide for strong baseline protections, particularly for the most surveilled and vulnerable generation ever -- our kids. These principles reflect that as privacy, consumer, and civil rights advocates, we only want federal legislation that will move the ball forward in terms of protecting kids, families, and all of us.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action:</p><p>\"Our country has floundered far too long without strong federal regulations governing data collection, retention, use and sharing. These privacy principles, developed by a coalition of leading consumer, civil rights and privacy organizations, are offered as a framework to guide Congress in protecting consumers from the many harms that can befall them when they are given little or no choice in safeguarding their data, and companies have few, if any, restrictions on how they use that information.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Susan Grant, Director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at Consumer Federation of America:</p><p>\"We need to move forward on data protection in the United States, from a default that allows companies to do what they want with Americans' personal information as long as they don't lie about it, to one in which their business practices are aligned with respect for privacy rights and the responsibility to keep people's data secure.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports:</p><p>\"As new data breaches are announced at an alarming rate, now is the time to protect consumers with strong privacy laws. We need laws that do more than just address broad transparency and access rights. Consumers deserve practical controls and robust enforcement to ensure all of their personal information is sufficiently protected.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Gaurav Laroia, Policy Counsel at Free Press Action Fund:</p><p>\"The public has lost faith in technology companies' interest and ability to police their own privacy and data usage practices. It's past time for Congress to pass a strong law that empowers people to make meaningful choices about their data, protects them from discrimination and undue manipulation, and holds companies accountable for those practices.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to David Brody, Counsel &amp;#38; Senior Fellow for Privacy and Technology at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law:</p><p>\"Protecting the right to privacy is essential to protecting civil rights and advancing racial equity in a modern, Internet-focused society. Privacy rights are civil rights. Invasive profiling of online activity enables discrimination in employment, housing, credit, and education; helps bad actors target voter suppression and misinformation; assists biased law enforcement surveillance; chills the free association of advocates; and creates connections between hateful extremists exacerbating racial tensions.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Tracy Rosenberg, Executive Director at Media Alliance:</p><p>\"After a flood of data breaches and privacy violations, Americans overwhelmingly support meaningful protections for their personal information that are not written by, for and in the interests of the data collection industry. These principles start to define what that looks like.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Francella Ochillo, Vice President of Policy &amp;#38; General Counsel at National Hispanic Media Coalition:</p><p>\"For years, tech platforms have been allowed to monetize personal data without oversight or consequence, losing sight of the fact that personal data belongs to the user. Meanwhile, Latinos and other marginalized communities continue to be exposed to the greatest risk of harm and have the fewest opportunities for redress. The National Hispanic Media Coalition joins the chorus of advocates calling for a comprehensive regulatory framework that protects a user's right to privacy and access as well as the right to be forgotten.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to JP Massar, Organizer at Oakland Privacy:</p><p>\"We must not only watch the watchers, and regulate the sellers of our information. We must begin to unravel the information panopticon that has already formed. This is a start.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Robert Weissman, President at Public Citizen:</p><p>\"Internet privacy means control. Either we get to control our own lives as lived through the Internet, or the Big Tech companies do. That's what is at stake in whether the U.S. adopts real privacy protections.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Ed Mierzwinski, Senior Director for Consumer Programs at U.S. PIRG:</p><p>\"The big banks and the big tech companies all say that they want a federal privacy law, but the law that their phalanx of lobbyists seeks isn't designed to protect consumers. Instead, it's designed to protect their business models that treat consumers as commodities for sale; it fails to guarantee that their secret sauce big data algorithms don't discriminate; it eliminates stronger and innovative state laws forever and it denies consumers any real, enforceable rights when harmed. We can't allow that.\"</p><p>You may view the privacy principles for more information.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6515854 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6515854</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR7-D761-DYG2-R415-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2206\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is essential. It is imperative that the investigation is done right and done right the first time and that is what we are going to do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This has been a rapidly evolving situation. We first learned of it in the early morning hours of Tuesday. The FBI reached out directly to me and we had been working on this case nonstop since we were notified.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We understand the severity of this situation unfolding. It breaks my heart to see what is going on in our streets in Minneapolis and in Saint Paul and in some of our suburbs. And I am pleading, I am pleading with individuals to remain calm and to let us conduct this investigation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Give it just a minute before I blow over.</p><p>We share with the FBI and we share with our state partners who are conducting parallel, but independent investigation, so that is clear. We have two different investigations and conclusions and recommendations that will come from those to each of our respective offices. But we share an unwavering commitment to see that this investigation is done right, that it's sent forthwith, that we act with dispatch and that we live up to the standards the community demands.</p><p>Our highest priority is that justice will be served. With that, I am going to close my comments and turn it over to special agent in charge Rainer Drolshagen, from the FBI.</p><p>RAINER DROLSHAGEN, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon. My name is Rainer Drolshagen. I'm the special agent in charge of the Minneapolis Field Office. Echoing U.S. attorney's comments, I'd like to say I express my complete condolences to the Floyd family. I'd also like to express my sympathy to the citizens of Minnesota, as there is extreme frustration, anger, and sadness.</p><p>I also want to thank Chief Arradondo, of Minneapolis Police Department. He reached out to me in the middle of the night and requested our assistance. His call enabled me to immediately reach out to the U.S. Attorney's Office to enlist their assistance. And as such, we were able to open an investigation in a matter of a few hours after the incident.</p><p>Our role in this investigation is to investigate allegations of willful violations of federal civil rights. The FBI team is following the path where the facts will lead us. We are conducting a swift, yet meticulous investigation.</p><p>In less than 72 hours, much work has been done, but I assure you there's much more to be accomplished. I want you to ensure that you understand we respond to cases like these as quickly as possible.</p><p>We will follow the case to conclusion in partnership with our state partner, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The FBI is a fact-gathering agency. We collect facts and we need your help. We're asking everyone that was present before, during, and after the incident to come forward to help us build the best picture of what occurred.</p><p>Each little piece of the puzzle helps us complete the big picture. If you have any information or if you have any videos or you know of anyone who can help us with this, I encourage you to ask them to contact 1-800-CALL- FBI. Again, I'm encouraging you to reach out to 1-800-CALL-FBI. No tip is too small. Thank you.</p><p>MIKE FREEMAN, HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY, MINNESOTA: Good afternoon. I'm Mike Freeman, Hennepin County attorney. We are the principal prosecuting agency for the state and the criminal side. Initially, I want to say that my thoughts and those of my office continue to be with a family and the friends of George Floyd. They know they are hurting over this senseless death.</p><p>The manager of our Victim Services Division has been in touch with George Floyd's family on several occasions and is keeping them updated on what is happening in this case. They're aware that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, better known as the BCA, the Hennepin County medical examiner and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office are moving as quickly and thoroughly as possible.</p><p>I've also been in direct consultations with Governor Tim Walz, with the Attorney General Keith Ellison, and others in the state, the city, and the county to discussions on this case. As many of you know, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office is one of very few prosecution offices in the United States who have successfully charged and convicted and obtained a guilty verdict against a police officer for unreasonable use of deadly force.</p><p>We have developed a detailed plan for that prosecution and with the BCA, a detailed plan for investigation.</p><p>Our office has been flooded with calls, many as a thousand a day, as well as e-mail and social media from people in this jurisdiction, in this state and throughout the country. The main question is what are you going to do about the murder of George Floyd? Well, I've just described what we're going to do. We are going to investigate it as expeditiously, as thoroughly and completely as justice demands. Sometimes that takes a little time and we ask people to be patient. We have to do this right and that's what we'll do.</p><p>I also want to tell you that our office has led the nation in openness on these types of cases. When we decide to charge an officer, we put the criminal complaint on our web site.</p><p>If we decide that the evidence does not support a criminal charge, we put our report and all our evidence on the web site for all to see. When we make the decision, in this case, we will do the same. What I can assure the citizens of Minnesota, we will do it as quickly as we can do it as possible. We'll do it as quickly as possible.</p><p>I think Drew Evans from the BCA is next. Drew.</p><p>DREW EVANS, SUPERINTENDENT, MINNESOTA BUREAU OF CRIMINAL APPREHENSION: Thank you, County Attorney Freeman. My name is Drew Evans. I am the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. First, I'd like to share with my colleagues here in expressing my deepest thoughts and sympathies to the family of George Floyd, that heartbreak that they're going through and the community as a whole. This is a difficult time for our entire community as they mourn his death.</p><p>The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension began this investigation immediately after this incident occurred when we were contacted by the Minneapolis Police Department. Agents were deployed, including our crime scene immediately began gathering evidence, talking to witnesses, and then working immediately with the county attorney's office discussing our findings and what we had at that time.</p><p>Next, over the night, as was indicated, the FBI was contacted. I spoke to Chief Arradondo. He informed me he was contacting them, and that was a contact we all welcome in this process.</p><p>We're working very collaboratively together through this process. Our agents are working closely together. We've deployed numerous resources. We brought in agents from all over the state, recognizing the importance of an expeditious, quick investigation that is still thorough, independent, and unbiased by all of our organizations.</p><p>Those findings will be turned over to the county attorney on the stateside, and on the federal side as noted to the United States attorney's office.</p><p>The same thing we share as the FBI did, we want any citizen, anybody who was there that witnessed this event, that has information that would be helpful to our investigation to either call the FBI tips line or (651) 793- 7000, which is the B.C. operation center.</p><p>My perspective is we want citizens to go wherever they are most comfortable, whichever line they are so that we get all of the information in this case, so we can conduct the most thorough investigation possible.</p><p>And with that, I think we'll turn it over to the U.S. attorney and county attorney for questions.</p><p>MACDONALD: And so, at this point, we're going to open it up for questions. I can tell you I'll start by saying, we've got questions too and we're getting answers to those. We're doing our best. We're digging in, but we do and I want to echo what my law enforcement partners said. We need the community's help.</p><p>There were folks there on the scene, not folks that we couldn't identify necessarily at the time. We need to know who they are. Come forward. If you have a video, please share it. We want to do, as quickly as we can, a thorough investigation to get answers to those questions.</p><p>And I know that I saw the first hand going up was in front of me, ma'am, you had a question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I'm sorry. What do -- I mean, tonight, (INAUDIBLE) is already saying what you guys are announcing today. You know, they were hoping for maybe charges. And you guys stepped out and say because we're not getting charges, are worried that that's going to ignite more riots tonight?</p><p>MACDONALD: My hope is that getting it out through you, that the community will understand that we are taking this seriously, that we're working as quickly as possible. So, the community understands we don't -- we don't announce investigations typically. As you in the media knows, it's unusual for us to come forward and tell you about the investigation.</p><p>As a United States attorney, we're counseled that we are not to talk about that until the time of the conviction typically, or in some cases, perhaps charges. It was really -- it's really imperative that the community understands how seriously we're taking this and how quickly and swiftly we are moving on this.</p><p>And so, my hope with that is, is that people will understand peaceful protests are always acceptable. That is the cornerstone of our justice system. Is that people have the right to say how they feel and to talk about their feelings and to protest peacefully.</p><p>But the obstruction and the destruction of property and harm to individuals has got to stop. We are one Minnesota, we're at our best we're not at our worst, we've got to come together and stop the needless and unnecessary destruction of property and harm to human life. Sir.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mike, can you address that? Mike, can you address that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Can I have something?</p><p>MACDONALD: You meant --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. This state is well known and it has a strong reputation for firm and thorough first amendment advocation. We support peaceful demonstrations. I had a long talk today with Reverend Jesse Jackson, who came at the request of Attorney General Keith Ellison and the governor. And I believe Reverend Jackson will be speaking and asking for peaceful protest today.</p><p>Peaceful protest is good, it advocates our rights and it also calls forth the witnesses that the United States attorney wants us to come forward. Violence is not. Violence hampers our case, it takes valuable police resources away from our investigation, and it also harms innocent people who had nothing to do with that.</p><p>It gets in the way of our work. So, we're asking please, please, say what you need to say, demonstrate how you need to do, that is in our constitution and all of us believe in that. But please, don't destroy an innocent person's property who had nothing to do with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think part of the problem is sir, the video goes on for seven minutes. He is clearly struggling to breathe during that time. And I think people will be hard-pressed to understand how you can't bring charges, at least, I guess to the officer who had his knee on that man's neck?</p><p>FREEMAN: It's a violation of my ethics to talk and evaluate evidence before we announce our charging decision, and I will not do that. I will say this, that, that video is graphic and horrific, and terrible, and no person should do that.</p><p>But my job, in the end, is to prove that he violated a criminal statute. And there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge. We need to wait through all of that evidence and to come through with a meaningful determination. And we are doing that to the best of our ability.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mike, (INAUDIBLE) can you guys give (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. To say --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When it comes to the African American community, and you got -- and where do you -- a lot of a playing down and that's you call for peace. What you guys (INAUDIBLE) George Floyd, when he begged (INAUDIBLE) life. What message can you give us to take back to the African American community to bring peace and to assure them that justice is going to be served?</p><p>FREEMAN: I bring them the same message that African American Attorney General of the State of Minnesota Keith Ellison is bringing. I'm bringing the same message of the Reverend Jesse Jackson. We have to do this right. We have to prove it in a court of law.</p><p>And I will just point to you the comparison to what happened in Billy in Baltimore, in the Gray case. It was a rush to charge, it was a rush to justice, and all of those people were found not guilty. I will not rush to justice. I'm going to do this right.</p><p>And those folks who know me in the African community know I will do my very level best but I will not rush justice because justice cannot be rushed.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you for that. It was wonderful to hear you say that you came down with other members of the community to ask for peace. And that is the most -- that's probably the most positive thing I've heard here all day.</p><p>So, I cannot begin to thank you enough for that. And to the extent, you can share that, and you can share the integrity and honesty of what we're doing and trying to tell you what's going on, please do, because we need you. We need the community.</p><p>But it's really important that we emphasize that everybody, everybody in the United States is entitled to due process of law. And due process of law requires us as prosecutors, as law enforcement officers, to make sure that we've done a careful investigation.</p><p>And it requires us, as I told you, I tried as a judge, I presided over hundreds of cases, including first-degree murder cases. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that all your ducks are in a row before you make that charging decision.</p><p>But you can't -- you can't undo what you've done if you rush. But if you take that time, you're going to do it right the first time, and you're going to get it done the first time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have a question about National Guard (INAUDIBLE). I think there is -- there is something (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, first off, the decision to call the National Guard is the governor's decision and I support his decision. Second, you know, I -- since I'd been Hennepin County attorney, I tried to do be the best prosecutor I can be and run the best office. And I try to stay out of other people's business. OK?</p><p>So, on the streets and the law enforcement is not my business directly. I do encourage people not to do dangerous things and to harm other people or property. But I could say to you that we just can't rush this.</p><p>I've been involved in a number of these investigations. The BCA has got their most veteran people and they are good. I have leading the prosecution team, the two prosecutors that brought justice in the Justine Damond case.</p><p>And as I said to you earlier, it's one of the few successful murder convictions of a police officer overusing force in the country. And I had a lot of pressure to hurry that and to do it quickly. You can't do that. These need to be done right. Please, give me and give United States attorney the time to do this right and we will bring you justice. I promise.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN: As many as you know from covering these kinds of cases for a long time, each of the facts are different and each of them have to be addressed differently. I assure you that if the person who had committed the act, and I do not condone or respect the act done by the police officer to Mr. Floyd. That was excessive and that was wrong.</p><p>The question in my business is, is it criminal? That's what I have to prove. And, you know, if there are cases that you could quickly and easily evaluate. Most of the cases, particularly, cop use of force cases are specifically more complex and have to be done right, and we're committed to doing it right. Sir, you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are the police officers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Mike, I want to --</p><p>FREEMAN: Sure.</p><p>MACDONALD: I want to answer that question as well, if I may. You know, it's important for -- I, 100 percent agree with you. That is the question, right. It is the question that people in my office are asking. It's a question. We were all feeling the pain of watching that.</p><p>But this is -- this is what the needs to be understood is -- and I know you all understand this, but to the extent, I'm speaking to the community. Police officers, by the nature of their job, have the authority to use a certain amount of force when they're executing their duties faithfully and honestly, and in accordance with their policies.</p><p>And so, a lot of police officer, a law enforcement officer, has within the latitude of their scope of duty, the ability to use the right amount of force, but not excessive force, not excessive force as defined by the law.</p><p>And so that is what we are looking at with respect to any federal criminal violation of civil rights, is that issue of the excessive force.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One more question. One more --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) and your office in particular (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MACDONALD: I can tell you that every United States attorney of all the -- all my colleagues that are out there, we are vested with doing what's right for our state at the time.</p><p>Of course, we're part of the Department of Justice. William Barr, I report to the DAG, who then reports to -- Deputy Attorney General, who then reports to the attorney general.</p><p>But every United States attorney is given the discretion in their community to pursue the charges and to follow the leads where they are, and to pursue the case as they deem appropriate.</p><p>I am however keeping my boss in communication, in briefing, so that he understands the investigation that's going on here in the State of Minnesota.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are people who (INAUDIBLE) coming from Minneapolis prepare already?</p><p>MACDONALD: I should've made clear to one thing, and I know it was in our statement that we issued last night. But on our team of experienced trial attorneys, which are the most experienced in my office, I can tell you, I've been in viewing the evidence with my criminal chief, with my first assistant, United States Attorney Anders Folk, with my deputy criminal chiefs, we're all in there together.</p><p>But we're also partnering with the Civil Rights Division from Department of Justice. The Civil Rights Division has an experience of doing these cases nationally. They bring with that expertise of understanding the requirements of, you know, 18 USC 242, which is the violation of law that we're specifically addressing.</p><p>And so, yes, we are partnering with Department of Justice to use their expertise and their resources, but we are leading the investigation and we are working collaboratively with our state and local partners and federal partners.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you spoken to the president about this?</p><p>MACDONALD: The president is actively monitoring the situation, but I have not spoken to the president directly. No.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) what the wait was about?</p><p>MACDONALD: I cannot. I can only ask you to trust me that it mattered and that I hope that I can fill you in on that at the appropriate time, which I hope is soon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) down here. You guys (INAUDIBLE) detail what you were holding --</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm going to say the same thing again, but I appreciate the tenacity of asking the question again. I would not have needlessly wasted your time. It was important that the community understand that we are actively involved in this investigation. We are working round the clock. We have been for the last 72 hours and we'll continue to do so to see that justice is done.</p><p>Again, we're going to do it right, but we will act with dispatch and I will keep all of you informed as soon as there's another development, and I will make sure that you, I promise, do not have to wait. Again, we'll have it timed right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, thanks, everybody. I appreciate you coming. Thank you, (INAUDIBLE) attorney.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We've been watching live in Minneapolis. Good evening, I'm Bret Baier, this is SPECIAL REPORT, interrupted by that news conference.</p><p>The U.S. attorney in that district talking about the case of George Floyd and what will or won't happen to the police officers involved there. You heard from the U.S. attorney, also the county attorney, the Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, he was asked why hasn't this officer been charged after seeing that video with his knee on his neck for seven minutes.</p><p>And Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, says that video is graphic and horrific, but I will not rush.</p><p>This as a concern about possible more unrest in the streets of Minneapolis after riots and looting last night. We'll continue to follow this story and bring you the latest throughout here on Fox News .</p><p>Other news today though, President Trump making good on his threat to do something about social media companies he feels are biased against him. The president signing an executive order today, but exactly how much it will matter is a big question.</p><p>Right now, chief White House correspondent John Roberts has that, exactly what this measure is designed to accomplish. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Bret. We should also point out that President Trump is monitoring the developments in Minneapolis. They're very closely -- in fact, the president says it was he who instructed the FBI to open up an investigation of what happened to George Floyd there.</p><p>Now, on the other issue of social media, this is one that's been bubbling up for some time now but it hit a rolling boil earlier this week when Twitter put a fact check on a couple of the president's tweets, leaving the president to say today that social media platforms, many of them, are no longer neutral public forums, and should not be treated as such.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: Flanked by Attorney General Bill Barr, President Trump in an executive order today, taking aim at social media companies and the relative immunity they enjoy in censoring or removing content on their platforms.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist shadow, ban, are editorial decisions, pure and simple, their editorial decisions.</p><p>ROBERTS: At the center of the action, Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which indemnifies companies like Twitter, Facebook, Google, and others for, \"any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\"</p><p>The president and attorney general arguing that provision has been stretched far beyond its original intent. The executive order will give the Federal Trade Commission the power to regulate that law.</p><p>TRUMP: Social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield. That's a big deal.</p><p>ROBERTS: In a tweet, President Trump claimed conservative voices are being unfairly censored on social media platforms, warning, \"we will strongly regulate or close them down.\"</p><p>In an exclusive interview, Fox's Dana Perino asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about that.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Well, I mean, look, I have to understand what they actually would intend to do. But in -- but in general, I think, a government choosing to just censor a platform because they're worried about censorship doesn't exactly strike me as the right reflex there.</p><p>ROBERTS: The American Civil Liberties Union weighing in on the White House action. In a statement, saying, \"Much as he might wish otherwise, Donald Trump is not the president of Twitter. This order, if issued, would be a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.\"</p><p>The idea even drawing fire from members of the president's own party.</p><p>REP. PAUL MITCHELL (R-MI): So, you don't like the platform, then don't use the platform. But to start deciding whether or not someone censoring properly or not or the labeling something is so doing totally truthful or not, it's government control of communication.</p><p>ROBERTS: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accusing the president and social media platforms of being in cahoots with each other, saying, both have profited off distorting the truth.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): But what the president is doing is a silly -- it's silly. But, let's say this, it's a distraction.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump said today, he fully expects a legal challenge. The White House will also send up to Capitol Hill very soon an outline for legislation to either rewrite or repeal Section 230.</p><p>And on that front, the president gets support from an unlikely corner. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who said back in January that, that section should be revoked immediately. Bret.</p><p>BAIER: John Roberts, live in the North Lawn. John, thank you.</p><p>Stocks down today. The Dow lost 148. The S&amp;P 500 fell six. The NASDAQ dropped 43.</p><p>The House passed revisions to the Paycheck Protection Program, PPP today. It's being extended from eight to 24 weeks. The amount that has to be spent on salaries by businesses is being reduced, and businesses are being allowed to defer payroll taxes.</p><p>Also, tonight, the Treasury Department is setting aside $10 billion of the fund to be used solely for businesses in low-income communities.</p><p>Speaking of that, another 2.1 million people applied for first-time jobless benefits over the past week. Another big number we brought you last night, 100,000 dead in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Noted by President Trump today, he tweeted his \"heartfelt sympathy to family and friends.\"</p><p>This comes as more businesses reopened across the country and the economy struggles to recover from the lockdown. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie has tonight's update from Atlanta.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: As coronavirus deaths, top 100,000, unemployment claims have surpassed 40 million, with over 2 million new filings just last week. Each number representing a life or livelihood shattered. Both a stark reminder that the nation's mayors and governors walk a difficult line between protecting economies and public health.</p><p>GOV. KIM REYNOLDS (R-IA): We can't prioritize one over the other. We must prioritize both to move forward.</p><p>SERRIE: Iowa is allowing bars, wineries, and breweries to reopen today. While Mississippi plans to allow all businesses to reopen Monday. Both states requiring social distancing. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo went a step further issuing an executive order, authorizing businesses to deny entry to anyone not wearing a face covering. And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio outlined his plan to bring 200 to 400,000 people back to work during a phase one reopening sometime in the first half of June.</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: We have to make sure this virus isn't checked. We've come a long way. We're not going to blow it now.</p><p>SERRIE: The impact of reopening on public health remains unclear. In Arkansas, only one percent of residents currently sick with COVID-19, say they visited a barbershop within the 14 days prior to showing symptoms. And even less than one percent went to a restaurant, church, daycare center, hotel or gym.</p><p>DR. NATE SMITH, ARKANSAS HEALTH DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR: We are seeing an upswing in cases. These don't seem to be associated with newly opened businesses.</p><p>SERRIE: Although the TSA is screening 88 percent fewer passengers than the same time last year, the agency says the average over the past seven days is triple its mid-April lows. Open Table reports inside dining at restaurants is the highest it's been since March 17. And the temporary hospital that opened at the D.C. Convention Center to handle overflows of COVID-19 patients as a last resort has not had to treat a single one, officials tell FOX News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SERRIE: Another bright spot, hotel occupancy has risen for six consecutive weeks according to the data firm STR. Right now the occupancy rate is just above 35 percent. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.</p><p>One of the industries trying desperately to salvage something in this pandemic era is the sports business. NASCAR is back without fans. Golf has a schedule of events without fans this summer. Major League Baseball, the NBA talking about resuming play. The National Hockey League wants to begin the Stanley Cup playoffs as soon as possible. Here to talk about that tonight is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. Mr. Commissioner, thanks for being here.</p><p>GARY BETTMAN, NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE COMMISSIONER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BAIER: How do you envision this?</p><p>BETTMAN: We announced the comprehensive plan that set up a framework for our players to resume their personal training to then and move into a training camp phase, and then we are going to have a 2014 tournament, if you will, a playing round, and then our usual four rounds of playoffs. But everything we have been focused on starts with the health and well-being of our players, our other personnel, and the communities in which we play. But we believe we'll be playing over the summer, and that we will be able to award a champion for the 19-20 season.</p><p>BAIER: That would be great. I'm a big hockey fan. What are your concerns? Testing of players? Being able to play? How's that all going to work?</p><p>BETTMAN: From a health standpoint, obviously for the players we're worried about COVID-19, and I'll talk about more about it in a second, but testing will be an important part of what we are doing. But also our players haven't been working out and skating for a longer than they're used to, probably ever since they were little children for most of them. And so we've got to make sure that they have an opportunity to get back in game shape because we don't want anybody risking an injury by playing when they are not ready.</p><p>With respect to testing, as the players come back, and we have players all over the place, only 44 percent of our players are in the markets in which they play. We have 17 percent of our players who are outside of North America. We've got to get them back. We've got to get them working out in safe facilities. To the extent that quarantining is required, we've got to do that. And once everybody starts to get reassembled and started to get back in shape, then we can move into a training camp phase.</p><p>With respect to testing, once we are really playing games, and we plan on playing in two centralized hubs, because obviously in all likelihood we are playing without fans. But when we bring the players into the hubs and they are playing games, they are going to be tested if not every day, at least every other day. And we are considering nine or ten locations because we want to, in real time -- it's not a decision we have to make for a few weeks -- in real time we want to go to a place that is as COVID free as possible and where there's availability of testing so that we're not interfering with the medical needs of testing in that community, although I am being told by the medical people that by this summer there should be an abundance of testing, and what we need for our purposes will infinitesimal compared to the availability.</p><p>BAIER: So you're looking at two hub cities. I saw list -- Vancouver, Los Angeles, Edmonton, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Dallas, Chicago, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and Columbus. One of those, picking two out of that?</p><p>BETTMAN: Probably two out of that. They all have the infrastructure because, again, playing tournament style, we'll be playing multiple games in a facility at a time. But we also want to try to create a bit of a bubble. And there will be issues. So for example, there is now a two-week quarantine moving into Canada. We don't expect the Canadian government to change the policies for us. But on some basis, what we're doing needs to comply or we're not going to be able to use one of the Canadian cities as a hub news we can't finish training camp, move players to a central location, and then have them quarantine for two weeks.</p><p>So it's a logistical issue, but we have about three weeks to make that decision before we start finalizing our plans. And again, having multiple options I think helps us make us make the best possible decision in real time.</p><p>BAIER: This isn't locked in yet, right? You haven't negotiated at all with the Players Association.</p><p>BETTMAN: We do. We have signoff from our Players Association. We have had a very collaborative process with our players and our Players Association. We had a Return to Play committee that included players because we wanted to understand and be sensitive to the issues that were going to be important to the players, and we think in large measure we have done that.</p><p>Listen, when you're trying to deal with an extraordinary, unusual circumstance, and you have very competitive people, whether it's the players or the teams, you're going to come up with a solution that somebody will find something that they wish was different. But on balance, this holds together and will provide for the integrity that the competition for the Stanley Cup deserves.</p><p>BAIER: I know I speak for every hockey fan, we can't wait, and good luck. Mr. Commissioner, we appreciate the time.</p><p>BETTMAN: Thank you. Be safe. Be healthy.</p><p>BAIER: Now overseas. The Trump administration looking at a long list of options to register its displeasure with China over its planned crackdown on Hong Kong. President Trump plans to hold a press conference about China Friday. That affected the markets today. The administration also taking action relating to the North Korean nuclear weapons effort. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson has specifics tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The Justice Department is jumping in on East Asian geopolitics, accusing five Chinese and 28 North Korean citizens of laundering $2.5 billion to fund Kim Jong-un's nuclear weapons program. Hours earlier, China's National People's Congress approved a security law giving Beijing new authority over Hong Kong -- 2,878 votes to one.</p><p>LI KEQIANG, CHINESE PREMIER (through translator): The decision adapted by the NPC session is designed for steady implementation, one country, two systems, and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.</p><p>EDSON: Outside Beijing, a far different perspective. The United States and three of its closest allies say China's new law is in direct conflict with its responsibility to allow Hong Kong significant autonomy. The allies warned, quote, \"Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.\"</p><p>In Hong Kong, more dissent. A handful of pro-democracy lawmakers were ejected from Hong Kong's legislature for throwing rotten plants on the chamber floor, representing, they say, the decay of the political system there.</p><p>CLAUDIA MO, PRO-DEMOCRACY LAWMAKER: This marks the beginning of a sad and traumatizing era for Hong Kong.</p><p>EDSON: Along China's border with India, Chinese and Indian military forces are massing in a growing border dispute. Both sides claim the other occupies tens of thousands of square miles of its territory. President Trump has offered to mediate.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EDSON: U.S. officials say the president is reviewing options to respond to China's national security law, including possible visa restrictions for government officials involved in the crackdown in China and Hong Kong and cutting visas for Chinese students in the U.S. The president says he will have an announcement on China tomorrow. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Rich Edson live at the State Department. Rich, thank you.</p><p>Up next, we do not know who, but we do know when Joe Biden plans to name a running mate. That's next.</p><p>BAIER: The murder suspect who was the subject of a multi-state, multi-day manhunt is in custody tonight. Peter Manfredonia made his first court appearance by video this afternoon in Maryland. He will not fight extradition to Connecticut. He's accused of killing two people and wounding another in that state.</p><p>Supporters of surveillance reform legislation are regrouping tonight after Democrats pulled the measure from the House floor today. President Trump and Republicans rejected the FISA bill yesterday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says there will be a new round of negotiations with the Senate over the expired powers, and the FBI considers those vital in fighting terrorism. She named lawmakers to a conference committee to negotiate with the Senate.</p><p>In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, Joe Biden puts himself on the clock for announcing a running mate. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee says he should make up his mind in about two months. Correspondent Peter Doocy looks at the possibilities tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: If you haven't been interviewed by the Biden vetting committee already, then you're not going to be his running mate, because every woman under consideration has gotten a call, as the 77- year-old says he'll make the big announcement around August 1st, telling donors, quote, \"I think that I need somebody who, in fact, is simpatico with me both in terms of personality as well as substance. That means that they don't have to agree with me on everything, but they have to have the same basic approach to how we handle the economy and how we handle everything.\"</p><p>Some women have been openly campaigning for the job, like Stacey Abrams.</p><p>STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm now getting the question a lot from folks, and the answer is, of course I would be honored to run for vice president with the nominee.</p><p>DOOCY: But she's not the contender best suited to help Biden beat Trump, according to data presented to the Biden campaign by prominent pollster Stan Greenberg, who concludes according to \"Politico,\" \"The biggest threat to Democrats in 2020 is a lack of support and disengagement of millennials and the fragmentation of non-Biden primary voters.\" He thinks the person who solves that problem is Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: If he asked you to be his running mate, would you say yes?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D-MA): Yes.</p><p>DOOCY: The next few months are impossible to predict as Republicans don't even know which swing state will host their convention. If North Carolina won't allow a huge gathering, other states say they will, including Florida and Georgia.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS, (R-GA): If they want to come here, if North Carolina doesn't want it, come on down to Georgia. We've got plenty for you.</p><p>DOOCY: Democrats are hinting at a mostly virtual convention which would deprive Democrats of the opportunity to unite in person if a former rival like Warren is on the ticket.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's go get those things straight.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D-MA): I am deeply grateful to President Obama.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: Biden is not going to name Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada as his running mate because she just announced she's withdrawing her name from consideration on the short-list. We know that Biden is, however, going to address the Texas Democrats' virtual convention next month. That's going to give party leaders a sneak peek at what a fully virtual DNC would look like. But the Biden campaign as a plan to capitalize on an in-person event if that is the way that they want to go. They started selling \"Biden for President\" facemasks, $20 bucks a pop. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: There you go. Peter, thank you.</p><p>Next up, the panel looks of the politics of the president's social media executive order. Plus, what is next with China?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow ban, are editorial decisions pure and simple. My executive order calls for new regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it that social media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield.</p><p>I think this, if Twitter were not honorable, I think you shut it down as far as I'm concerned. But I'd have to go through a legal process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The president today signing an executive order on social media. What comes of this, where does it go? Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Julie, raised some eyebrows when the president said that he'd have to go through legal process. But I guess the biggest question is the legal side of this and the challenge that potentially it brings.</p><p>JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS: And it will bring legal challenges. Certainly what the president is talking about in the most extreme, something like shutting down Twitter or another social media company is not within his power, but even some of these steps that are short of that, trying to take away -- or trying to make these platforms legally liable for their content doesn't appear to be something that he can do on his own. So I do think that this is more for politics right now. This is more for the president voicing his anger and trying to rally conservatives who have also shared some of his concerns about these platforms then it is about the practical consequences of this executive order.</p><p>BAIER: Matthew, how does it play politically?</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I think it feeds into a growing bipartisan coalition, Bret, that is zeroing in on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 which allows the tech giants to kind of exploit this ambiguity. Are they publishers or are they platforms? And the truth is it's not just senators like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley. It's also people like Elizabeth Warren and even Joe Biden who have said that Section 230 needs to be repealed. And so I think we can look at this executive order as just another step along the path.</p><p>BAIER: It does come, Byron, obviously as Twitter fact-checked one of the president's tweets.</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes. Look, I think all conservatives can understand the president's frustration about this. They all believe, I think correctly, that the leadership of the big tech companies leans left, and there is a real debate about whether these tech companies are publishers or not.</p><p>But it was kind of a weird executive order, one paragraph, and it actually denounced Twitter for allowing Adam Schiff's tweets about the Russian hoax to continue. You usually don't see that in executive orders. I think maybe the president would have been better off trying to encourage tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, who's come out very openly and said it's not the tech companies' job to edit and censor this political material, might've been better to encourage that than to go after Twitter.</p><p>BAIER: He said that today on Dana Perino's show.</p><p>Turning now to China, the president is going to do something on China, announcement tomorrow. Here is the State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: This is just a complete rejection of the basic law that China agreed to, not only to Hong Kong in 1997, but I would remind everyone that this was a U.N. agreement that the Chinese Communist Party agreed to as well. They are breaking their word 27 years early.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The president announced late this afternoon that he's having some kind of announcement, and the Dow took a real hit late in the afternoon. You don't see where it hit, but it really took a downturn once the news came that something was happening. Julie, do we know what's happening sanction-wise or otherwise against China?</p><p>PACE: There's a lot of speculation right now. It could be something related to economic measures. It could also be something that the administration has been considering for a while that is much more restrained, which actually just focuses on visas for some Chinese students who are at U.S. universities.</p><p>But to your point about the Dow, any time we are talking about the U.S.- China relationship, we're talking about a massive economic relationship, and I think you have a lot of people who are pretty spooked by the possibility of a tough action when we're in this moment when the economy globally and certainly here in the U.S. does feel so fragile.</p><p>BAIER: Add it to the list of tensions between the U.S. and China. There are more. Panel, thank you. Sorry for the shortened panel tonight.</p><p>When we come back, the brighter side of things, some good news.</p><p>BAIER: Finally, tonight, the brighter side, some good news. A San Diego community showed its support for World War II veteran Eldon Garretson who turned 100-years-old yesterday. Garretson spent much of his career as an airplane mechanic in the Air Force. His crew would drop supplies to prisoner of war camps, helping to feed servicemen in captivity. He is the only surviving member of his 11-man crew, received a celebration fit for a hero. Thank you for your service, sir.</p><p>And a Chick-fil-A in San Antonio, Texas, celebrating the high school graduation of five employees with a socially distanced commencement ceremony. Each senior student walked down a red carpet, received a stole and a gift basket, and posed for a photo with the chain's cow mascot, who was dressed for the occasion. Congrats.</p><p>Of course, the brighter side from earlier in the show, Stanley Cup playoffs back this summer. Can't wait.</p><p>Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020052801cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-BVT1-DXH2-635H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EDMONTON OILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>DALLAS STARS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

A panel of expert judges from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University selected all winners. Medill's Ceci Rodgers chaired the panel.NAREE's 2019 winners with judges' comments:SECTION I: INDIVIDUAL AWARDS, ALL MEDIA Single BylinePLATINUM WINNER - BEST OVERALL INDIVIDUAL ENTRY:PRASHANT GOPAL,Bloomberg News. Collection includes: 'Small Time Bankers Make Millions Peddling Mortgages to the Poor'Judges' comment: Anyone who has ever disparaged business stories as dull hasn't read a story by Prashant Gopal. </p><p>The Bloomberg Businessweek journalist distinguishes himself through stylish writing, in-depth reporting and quotes that are gems. Gopal explored little-known corners of the mortgage market that exhibit troubling signs of fraud, some of which are reminiscent of the practices leading up to the housing crisis. Even without photographs, readers can picture each of his characters, such as a financier whose 'dark widow's peak is slicked high with gel,' and who 'has a Lamborghini on order to go with his Mercedes.' He reaches top experts, gets all the right statistics and writes impactfully on important topics, but it's these extra touches that make him worthy of the platinum prize.PRESIDENT'S AWARD - BEST FREELANCE COLLECTION:JON GOREY, Boston Globe ...hersJudges' Comment: Gorey's work is impressive and wide-ranging - from economic analysis to reader service stories that give homeowners valuable and actionable advice. His deftly written and deeply reported stories most often appear in the Boston Globe. Gorey shines most with his unique angles on mundane topics, such as his story about home tax breaks and how they have shaped architectural trends over the centuries. He writes conversationally and with humor when appropriate, such as in his stories and blog posts about do-it-yourself projects in old homes - including his.RUTH RYON AWARD - BEST YOUNG JOURNALIST:MAX DE HALDEVANG,QuartzJudges' comment: Max de Haldevang impressed the judges with his story about the search for the true owners of Sherlock Holmes' residence. The twist is that it wasn't really a historical story about Holmes, but a crime mystery about corrupt money flowing into Britain. A gifted writer and dogged investigative reporter on the global economy and geopolitics, de Haldevang seems able to quickly master the intricacies of many complicated issues.Category 1: Best Collection of Work by an Individual Covering Residential Real EstateGOLD WINNER: NANCY SARNOFF, Houston Chronicle, 'In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey'Judges' comment: The well-reported trio of stories about the effects of Harvey on various neighborhoods detailed what the natural disaster means for sales, prices and rents in those areas. The stories used data to convey and explain what happened, as well as maps that made it easier for the reader to get a sense of the scope of the disaster.SILVER WINNER (TIE):STEFANOS CHEN, The New York Times, 'To Understand New York Real Estate, Follow Fido'Judges' comment: Chen surprises his readers with stories they haven't seen elsewhere. He also comes up with unique ways to look at the real-estate market. For example, for his piece on understanding New York real estate, he 'follows Fido' and looks up every canine registration in the city. The top dog: the Yorkie, followed by the Shi Tzu. In all the stories in this collection, he writes with flair.SILVER WINNER (TIE):JON GOREY, Freelancer, The Boston Globe, 'Borderline Behavior'Judges' comment: This collection of thoroughly reported and well-written stories both entertains and informs the reader on topics, particularly two of them (weird borders and what real-estate agents do when they're in the middle of a family dispute during a sale), that aren't typically covered. All three stories are well sourced.BRONZE WINNER (TIE):MICHELE LERNER, Freelancer, The Washington Post, 'The New Boomtowns'Judges' comment: This collection of stories addresses what happens when home price gains outstrip incomes, from where to live (think Sacramento and Nashville) to downsizing baby boomers calculating whether to rent or buy. Data-driven but tied to real people, these stories compellingly reflect the zeitgeist of the day.BRONZE WINNER (TIE):JASON HIDALGO, The Reno Gazette-Journal, 'Rock wall failures in Reno'Judges' comment: Hidalgo dives into data and neighborhoods to provide well-written and in-depth stories that reveal the motivations and consequences of poorly conceived laws. Detailed, thorough and important watch-dog reporting.HONORABLE MENTION:DEVON THORNSBY, U.S. News ...rld Report, 'What Limits Can Your Landlord Put on Gun Possession?'Judges' comment: The story collection tackles two subjects often written about - pets and what to do when your rent is raised - but takes a fresh angle on both. The story about what limits landlords can and can't put on renters who possess guns was insightful, with information not seen in other stories.Category 2: Best Collection of Work by an Individual Covering Commercial Real Estate$250 - GOLD WINNER:JONATHAN O'CONNELL, The Washington Post, 'Do posh waterfronts make a city world-class? D.C. is betting hundreds of millions on it,' 'The unspoken factor in Amazon's HQ2 hunt,' and 'Trump's interest slows FBI HQ project.'Judges' comment: O'Connell's collection of stories includes some unique angles on widely reported stories, such as an in-depth and nuanced exploration of the waterfront project in SW Washington, D.C., that traced the evolution over more than two decades and remains controversial. Beautifully written and deeply reported.SILVER WINNER: NOAH BUHAYAR, Bloomberg News, 'Opportunity Zones'Judges' comment: This collection shines a light on the fine print in IRS rules for the Trump administration's opportunity zones, including that the biggest breaks go to Goldman Sachs and other large investors, while the intended recipients of the breaks \u2014 investors in disadvantaged neighborhoods - get frozen out. Colorful maps vividly drive the point home.BRONZE WINNER:JACOB ADELMAN, Philadelphia Inquirer, 'Malls of Vacant Halls'Judges' comment: A trio of informative and entertaining stories, with the best of the bunch being how Namadar Realty Group in New York is buying dying malls and making them worse instead of improving them. This collection includes original data and analysis from the Inquirer, making it all the more unique.HONORABLE MENTION:LORETTA CLODFELTER, Institutional Real Estate Americas, 'All about that bass'Judges' comment: Data and well-placed sources drive these three stories about how real estate investment is and can be used in today's 401(k)s; the use of technology in the real estate industry; and how investors can make money and do well by investing in affordable housing.Category 3: Best Real Estate ColumnGOLD WINNER:BECKIE STRUM, Dow Jones / Mansion Global, 'Over-Customizing a Home May Lead to Trouble Selling it.'Judges' comment: Strum uses vivid examples to make her point about homeowners' eccentric touches hurting resale value. Guns 'n' Roses guitarist Slash added a stripper pole and a 36-foot skateboard ramp to his home (and ended up needing to cut his price by $2.3 million), and Bulls star Michael Jordan built a mansion with 15 bathrooms and a regulation-size basketball court. Strum's wealthy readers learn good lessons from her 'show, don't tell' efforts.SILVER WINNER:LOIS WEISS, Freelancer, Bisnow, 'The HQ2 Search Is a Sham. Jeff Bezos Already Knows the Winner.'Judges' comment: Weiss is either clairvoyant - or a veteran real-estate journalist who admirably knows her turf. In her January 2018 piece, she declared (correctly, as it turns out) that Jeff Bezos already planned to choose the D.C. area for his second headquarters. She uses numbers to make her point, citing the Amazon chief's $23 million purchase of two side-by-side mansions there in October 2016. Coincidence? She thinks not.BRONZE WINNER:RONDA KAYSEN, Freelancer, The New York Times, 'Right at Home - Confessions of an Open House Addict'Judges' comment: Kaysen turned her 'addiction' into a fun, engaging column about the appeal of open houses. Charmingly, she divides her compatriots into three categories \u2014 snoopers, confirmation seekers and aspirational buyers. It's easy to cheer for and identify with Kaysen, who shuns multimillion-dollar mansions and instead likes to walk into a place where she can imagine a life 'about one paygrade' above her own.HONORABLE MENTION: LEW SICHELMAN, 'The Housing Scene - On Zillow, Some Listings Are MIA'Judges' comment: The veteran real-estate journalist reveals that Zillow, in what some agents see as a 'money grab,' now requires builders to pay a fee if they want to be listed. He also uses statistics and anecdotes to back up his arguments.Category 4: Best Economic Analysis - Real EstateGOLD WINNER:BLANCA TORRES, San Francisco Business Times, 'The 7 big ways Prop. 13 has reshaped California'Judges' comment: Torres writes compellingly about Proposition 13 and its obvious and not-so-obvious impact on California real estate. This thoroughly engaging analysis includes meticulous data reporting that documents the impact on real estate prices and the coffers of state and local governments, as well as the narratives of impacted homeowners and renters. It's the kind of analysis that should give voters and lawmakers pause.SILVER WINNER:LORRAINE WOELLERT, POLITICO, 'We know how lucky we are: What happens to the country if the only young people who can buy houses are already wealthy?'Judges' comment: Woellert gains unusual access to a well-connected D.C. couple whose famous father's help ensures they will not be shut out of the American dream of homeownership. In this timely, well-written analysis, Woellert uses their story to connect to the larger economic problem of widening disparities in income and access in the U.S.BRONZE WINNER:JON GOREY, Freelancer, The Boston Globe, 'Economists Predict Recession by 2020'Judges' comment: Gorey surveys top housing economists and collects local and national data to produce an insightful story about a slowing economy and why it's not hurting Boston's housing market. This is a smart analysis that serves the business reader.HONORABLE MENTION:PATRICK KEARNS, Inman News, 'The essential guide to thriving in a turning market'Judges' Comment: This clear-eyed analysis of a slowing housing economy provided readers with the context and practical knowledge to help them make decisions. A well-written and thorough piece that served the publication's audience of brokers and investors.Category 5: Best Interior Design StoryGOLD WINNER:CANDACE TAYLOR, The Wall Street Journal, 'Home Shark Tanks Are In. Just One Problem: Sharks Make Terrible Pets.'Judges' comment: In this jaw-dropping and 'Jaws'-evoking piece, Taylor answers the question: Who would install a home shark tank? She tracks down the answer: Lil' Wayne, Tracy Morgan, 'Real Housewives' stars and other rich people with $15,000 to $1 million and room for up to 16,000 gallons of water. It's an unusual and fun story that raises the larger issue of what kinds of creatures should - and should not - be pets.SILVER WINNER:JURA KONCIUS,Washington Post Magazine, 'Inside Blair House, Where the Presidents' Guests Get VIP Treatment'Judges' comment: Koncius gives her readers an exclusive look inside the 1942 presidential guest house, which doesn't offer official tours. Charles de Gaulle and Queen Elizabeth II stayed here. So did Donald Trump, the night before his inauguration. The piece is thoroughly researched and reported, with lots of little nuggets: Tiffany gave 150 place settings of its silver flatware; foreign visitors are allowed to smoke indoors. The result is a feast for history lovers.BRONZE:MIMI O'CONNOR, Brick Underground, 'We asked actual children to test-drive some of NYC's fanciest playrooms.'Judges' comment: Who better than 5- and 6-year-olds to test out swanky playrooms? No one. O'Connor comes up with a creative way to tell her story and pulls it off in an example-filled piece. One play spot even includes a mini-electric BMW convertible.HONORABLE MENTION:VERONIKA BONDARENKO, Inman News, 'Latest Fad? Tossing Out the Furniture'Judges' comment: Proponents of furniture-free living think it promotes being less sedentary, among other things. There's even a #furniturefree hashtag. The author, whose family sleeps on floor beds that require more exercise than high beds when it comes to getting up, coaches readers on how to get by with little more than a couch.Category 6: Best Real Estate E-Newsletter by an Individual JournalistGOLD WINNER: JOHN ELLIOT, Dow Jones / Mansion Global DailyJudges' comment: This e-newsletter knows what its wealthy readers want to know. It runs Mansion Global stories and highlights from other places. Interestingly, as one of its stories points out, changes in the less liquid, more volatile luxury real-estate market, which slows down sooner, can be a sign of what's to come for the rest of the market. It also uses data to let its readers know key trends: Wilmington, Delaware, and Rochester, New York, are heating up. Who knew?SILVER WINNER:KATHERINE FESER, Prime Property, Houston ChronicleJudges' comment: This e-newsletter tells its local readers what they want to know, such as how prices stack up in Houston compared to elsewhere, how a four-year renovation on a monster house is frustrating residents and how one in five Houston millennials is living at home with mom.BRONZE WINNER:EILEEN WOODS,Real Estate Address, The Boston GlobeJudges' comment: This e-newsletter gives its readers snapshots of what they need to know about open houses and listings but also includes special tidbits about properties in this historic town. (A woman accused of witchcraft in 1692 lived in one restored home.)Category 7: Best Architecture StoryGOLD WINNER:MARK ELLWOOD, Bloomberg News, 'Forget Tiny Houses: The design-obsessed now want homes in miniature'Judge's comment: This story about dollhouse-like houses \u2014 replicas of wealthy homeowners' full-size ones \u2014 is a 'Wow! I didn't know that!' piece. Ellwood tracks down the people who make and order these miniatures, helping readers understand how they're created and why they're commissioned. (Sometimes they're even thank you gifts for major museum donors.)SILVER WINNER:ALISON STATEMAN, Commercial Observer, 'Rethinking School Design in the Age of the Mass Shooter'Judges' comment: Two decades after Columbine, the author explains simple, and sometimes surprising, ways architects are re-imagining school design. Floor-to-ceiling windows are safer than solid walls because students and staff can see and be aware of danger earlier. Planters can create an attractive environment \u2014 and a good place to hide. This piece is well reported and explained.BRONZE WINNER:JON GOREY,Freelancer, The Boston Globe, 'Tax Shelters: As the Filing Deadline Looms, We Look at Uncle Sam's Hidden Contributions to Architecture'Judges' comment: In a story full of historical gems, Gorey lays out the case for people designing and decorating their houses to avoid paying extra taxes. For example, from 1712 to 1836, there was a tax on printed wallpaper \u2014 so families used stencils instead. And Gorey and his wife installed rooftop solar panels and got a 30 percent tax credit.HONORABLE MENTION:JOSH BARBANEL, The Wall Street Journal, 'What's 8 Feet Wide and Has an Elevator?'Judges' comment: This story about fancy, ultra-narrow homes in New York City offers plenty of surprises.

(Margaret Mead lived in a Greenwich Village place just over 9 feet wide.)SECTION 2: INDIVIDUAL AWARDS- NEWSPAPERS, PRINT OR DIGITAL, SINGLE BYLINECategory 8: Best Residential Real Estate Story - Daily NewspaperGOLD WINNER:MARK COLLETTE, Houston Chronicle, 'Flood Games: Manipulation of Flood Insurance Leads to Repeat Disasters'Judges' comment: This investigation and analysis found that because officials weren't honest with Houston-area residents about how much their properties had been damaged by floods in financial terms, people and homes were allowed back in vulnerable places where homes could flood again.

The story includes current customers and data from the Urban Institute and other sources, showing that Quontic isn't a flash in the pan and is worthy of the story.BRONZE WINNER:ROBYN FRIEDMAN, Freelancer, The Wall Street Journal, 'Time to Revisit Jumbo Reverse MortgagesJudges' comment: Friedman makes a compelling argument as to why jumbo reverse mortgages, which have taken a fair share of criticism, might actually be the right product for certain individuals, such as older individuals with equity in their homes and who don't want to take on additional debt. Friedman includes tips to consider when looking at these types of mortgages.Category 10: Best Commercial Real Estate Story - Daily NewspaperGOLD WINNER:ALISTAIR GRAY, Financial Times, 'Rental Powerhouses'Judges' comment: An insightful, well written and well sourced story about how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are investing in commercial real estate, which generates higher income that they say they need to offset affordable housing.

It's an example of journalism shining a light on a very dark corner.SILVER WINNER:ARIELLE KASS, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 'GDOT work meets ancient Jewish law'Judges' comment: An insightful, well-written story about an eruv, a boundary that symbolically encloses a Jewish community and allows them to carry things on the sabbath they normally wouldn't be allowed to carry.

He uses plenty of numbers, pointing out (somewhat alarmingly) that borrowers are on average spending 43 percent of their income on debt payments and (somewhat reassuringly) that only 3.5 percent of new loans today are to people with credit scores below 620, compared with 15 percent in 2008.SILVER WINNER: EUGENE MEYER, Freelancer, Bethesda Magazine, 'Why Marriott Stayed'Judges' comment: This account of why Marriott chose to build new headquarters in Bethesda rather than relocate outside the area gives local readers extensive reporting and inside information.

SOLOMONT, The Real Deal, 'Death of the Brokerage'Judges' comment: Solomont uses the demise of splashy Town Residential, which once employed 600 agents, to tell her story about how star agents, open data and venture capital are hurting traditional brokerages.

Says one highly wooed star agent: 'I feel like LeBron heading into free agency.'SILVER WINNER:ALEX NITKIN, The Real Deal, 'Is @properties scaling up or selling out?'Judges' comment: @properties remains the sales-volume market leader in residential real estate in Chicago's Cook County, but Nitkin uses strong reporting and figures to question how long it can remain at the top. In 2018 its founders \u2014 facing competition from Compass and others \u2014 sold a significant share of their business to a venture-capital firm. Though Nitkin couldn't get the duo to comment for this story, he works around that problem by interviewing other key players.BRONZE WINNER:RONDA KAYSEN, Freelancer, Architectural Record, 'The Housing Crisis in America'Judge's comment: Kaysen skillfully tells her audience of architects and designers about the affordability crisis in New York City, with its 'insatiable' demand for housing. Despite the best efforts of the nation's biggest public housing landlord, it remains a place with 77,000 homeless residents.

To make her points clear, she uses examples like a property owner paying $300 for a light fixture that cost just half that much money or a subcontractor charging for seven Dumpsters for a demolition when only four were needed. There's no single villain or explanation. In fact, a couple of 'rogue' employees can contribute a great deal to bribery, extortion and bid-rigging schemes. Brenzel's thorough reporting and easy-to-understand examples make a complicated topic understandable.BRONZE WINNER:JOHN NELSON, Southeast Real Estate Business, 'Off the Beaten Path'Judge's comment: In the United States, rails-to-trails projects span more than 22,000 miles.

Service stories give readers easy-to-understand information about everything from whether they're legally allowed to buy property abroad to whether they'll be able to rent out the place.BRONZE WINNER:ARLENE GROSS, MICHAEL GAVIN, TARIG KAMAL, DESIRE KEEGAN, ...ECIAL TO NEWSDAY: JAMES KINDALL, ...E LI HOME, Newsday StaffJudges' comment: Editors and writers know what their Long Island buyers, sellers and renters want to know, whether it's where surfers might want to live or what's available in Stony Brook (best known for its hospital and university). They also include the expected listings and other good service information.Category 32: Best Real Estate WebsiteGOLD WINNER: TERI ROGERS, Brick UndergroundJudges' comment: This site gives New York City buyers, sellers, renters and renovators of all ages and income levels useful information about everything from how to kick out a roommate to how to find the best right-after-college neighborhood. (Check out Washington Heights!)SILVER WINNER:MAE CHENG ...E MANSION GLOBAL TEAM\u2014 Dow Jones / Mansion GlobalJudges' comment: This digital publication thoroughly covers the high-end global real-estate market. It delivers what its audience apparently wants to know, including hearing from elite designers about how to decorate with velvet and finding out that a 19th-century Manhattan brownstone just a block from Central Park sold for $21.5 million (at a $2 million loss) and that a Central Park duplex where Barbra Streisand lived for 30 years is on the market for $11.25 million.BRONZE WINNER: CARL FRANZEN, Inman NewsJudges' comment: This residential real-estate industry trade publication quickly gives its readers \u2014 agents, brokers, team leaders, business owners, executives, investors, mortgage and title officers, software engineers \u2014 what they need to know. A breaking news story, for example, reveals that Zillow is suing rival Compass over poaching employees and stealing intellectual property. Inman News also excels at giving its readers news they can use through service stories on contract terms every agent should be able to easily explain and on how to keep buyers with human real-estate agents.HONORABLE MENTION: ELAINE MISONZHNIK, National Real Estate InvestorJudges' comment:NREIonline.com[5]thoroughly covers what the commercial real-estate industry needs to know. It runs good interviews with leaders, such as the CEO of the 2019 AFIRE International Investor Survey. Note: The 10 must-read stories for the day link to pieces in places like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, with paywalls, which may frustrate readers who don't subscribe to them.HONORABLE MENTION: EILEEN WOODS,RealEstateBostonGlobe.com[6]Judges' comment: This site,bostonglobe.com[7]includes standard stories about new listings and homes of the week. But it goes beyond just the basics, with interesting pieces about how Airbnb is working to increase the diversity of its hosts and good 'ask the expert' pieces about, among other things, the best ways to tend a garden.

At the two social media companies, white workers constitute 49 percent while the search engine giant's workforce is 56 percent white. The makeup is hardly different from what Google reported in 2014, when it became the first big tech company to <url normalizedValue=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html\">publicly disclose workforce diversity details</url>.</p><p>Compare that with Comcast's latest numbers on employment diversity. In 2017, 70 percent of those hired by Comcast and NBC Universal were diverse, according to new data provided by the company. Of its total 164,000 employees, 61 percent classified themselves as diverse at the end of last year, the same percentage <url normalizedValue=\"http://diversity.comcast.com/2017/connecting-our-people\">as the year prior when 21 percent of the total workforce was African-American</url>.</p><p>\"It demonstrates that where there is intentionality with diversity, you can get results,\" Morial said.</p><p>\"There's much more to the digital divide and digital inclusion than that digital access,\" added Valerie Rawlston Wilson of the Economic Policy Institute.</p><p>Aligning one's workforce to more closely mirror the country's demographics is important because it can drive upward mobility within minority groups that have under-earned their white counterparts, even when controlling for other factors like education level.</p><p>\"The tech sector is a fast growing one in which people with high school degrees are averaging annual salaries in excess of $80,000,\" Morial wrote in the State of Black America's executive summary. \"This represents an opportunity for advancing the workforce participation of women and people of color and reducing the income inequality gap.\"</p><p>Explaining that the nation is \"doomed to repeat history\" if a concerted effort is not made, Morial said, \"The great promise of the digital age to right the historical wrongs visted on African Americans during previous industrial eras will be an empty one until our private, government and corporate sectors focus on minority ownership, workforce hiring, management positions, and increased racial and gender representation in C-suites and on boards of directors.\"</p><p>Comcast's board of directors had two African-American members since 2011, according to documents filed with the SEC. The 40 percent total diversity of the board (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia CEO Madeline Bell is also a member) will remain if the replacement for Johnathan A. Rodgers, who has reached mandatory retirement age, is elected by shareholders. SEC filings show Comcast nominated\u00a0Maritza G. Montiel, once an executive with Deloitte LLP, for the vacant seat.</p><p>Facebook, on the other hand, added the first African-American member to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/18/facebook-names-american-express-ceo-kenneth-chenault-first-african-american-all-white-board/1043015001/\">its all-white board earlier</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-kenneth-chenault-board-of-directors/\">this year</url>. Twitter's board is 22 percent people of color, while Google parent company Alphabet's 11-member board has at least three persons of color, SEC documents show.</p><p>The MoU also compelled Comcast to make inroads related to diversity in other segments of the business. For instance, the Philadelphia company had a fourfold increase in its spending with diverse vendors from the end of 2010 compared with the end of 2017. Last year, Comcast spent $3.6 billion with diverse vendors. On the programming side, it offered 15 times as much diverse content available to its cable subscribers at the end of last year compared with seven years prior. In the MoU, Comcast agreed to add at least eight independent, Hispanic or African-American owned- and operated-networks to its lineup. Six have been added so far with the final two slated to debut in January 2019.</p><p>\"We have a simple priority; we want Comcast NBCUniversal to be one of the best companies for diversity and inclusion in corporate America,\" Comcast Executive Vice President David L. Cohen said in a statement that credited the creation of a joint diversity council (JDC), part of the MoU, with helping the company stay on track with its goals. \"The JDC has been very valuable to us, bringing unique experiences and ideas to the table and offering sound advice and insight as we strive to improve our diversity performance.\u00a0We consider diversity to be a driver for business growth and innovation, and we've made it a part of our corporate strategy with complete support at the highest levels of our company across all of our businesses.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Facebook didn't - and its failure to act may do more harm to its cause than Twitter's display of backbone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That's because Facebook's fecklessness will only feed into the mounting pressure on policymakers to regulate how social media networks police themselves, and to deny them a crucial liability shield if they fail to meet some new government standard for evenhandedness. Both of those options are fraught with unintended consequences and potentially bad outcomes.</p><p> Trump himself is one of the leading proponents of regulating social media. The misbegotten executive order he released Thursday seeks to have the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission determine when those companies are misleading the public about their policies toward speech and concealing some kind of bias.</p><p> Later that day, Trump tweeted and posted a 102-word attack on Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, saying he needed to get his city \"under control\" or Trump would send in the military. \"Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump wrote, quoting (consciously or not) a racist and brutal Miami police chief from 1967.</p><p> Although Trump later contended that he was trying to warn people about the consequences of looting, his original words run clearly afoul of both social media companies' guidelines against glorifying or inciting violence. Twitter responded by hiding the tweet behind a notice that Trump's words had violated the company's rules, forcing anyone who wanted to read the tweet to click on the link provided. Facebook responded by ... doing nothing.</p><p>Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg later explained that \"although the post had a troubling historical reference, we decided to leave it up because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force.\" He stood by that decision even as hundreds of Facebook employees protested.</p><p> Granted, moderating the torrential flow of content on a site as popular as Facebook is a huge challenge. And there's necessarily some subjectivity involved. But lax moderation led Facebook to become a hotbed for fakery, hate speech and other damaging uses of the network. It has responded with some better rules and procedures, but they're meaningless if they're not enforced.</p><p> The more exceptions Zuckerberg carves out for powerful people, the more inconsistent and ineffective his rules will appear - boosting the case for orders like Trump's, which would give political appointees the power to shape how social media companies compete.</p><p> Washington would be far better off focusing on ways to protect Facebook users and their privacy, particularly from the manipulation that the company empowers its advertisers to do by exploiting their personal information. Lawmakers, including Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), have introduced bills to stop Facebook and its ilk from micro-targeting political ads without users' permission, preventing campaigns from tailoring their messages to play on the susceptibilities of small groups in ways that avoid detection.</p><p> But Congress has been just as leery of protecting internet users' privacy as Zuckerberg has been of enforcing Facebook's rules against Trump. They both need to change course.</p><p>           Los Angeles Times    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-5186197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897DB50F347E1 NWBKMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6035-7SF1-JBCN-40XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Milford Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Frank[1] Just because cell phone and wireless[2] WiFi technology seems to be everywhere doesn't mean exposure to it is safe for humans, animals[3], or nature. In fact - decades of research has proven that exposure is biologically and environmentally harmful. Outdated laws and guidelines[4] protect wireless technology - not science. </p><p>It's that simple. Unfortunately, the installation of 5G[5] small cell wireless technology is currently being forced in the U.S[6]. and around the world[7] - even though the Telecom Industry can't even say it's safe[8]. 5G is risky for many reasons[9]. It's also not necessary and people everywhere are fighting[10] it. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to regulate the Telecom Industry and protect the public from harmful technology[11]. For many years already, the agency has been doing the exact opposite[12]. Right now they are being investigated for collusion[13] regarding 5G.Thanks to everyone who is fighting to stop the installation of harmful technology including the Natural Resources Defense Council[14] (NRDC). Here are excerpts from their latest efforts[15] in regard to 5G:3) The next generation of wireless technology\u20145G\u2014is dramatically different from previous versions. Telecommunication is possible through use of the electromagnetic spectrum. 6) In March 2018, the FCC eliminated environmental and historical review for siting certain cell towers and other wireless facilities (FCC Order 18-30[16]). Despite the license needed to provide wireless services, the FCC determined that there was no federal role in the construction of facilities needed to provide these services. In addition to NRDC[17], 19 tribes have challenged the FCC's action along with the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear oral argument in the case on March 15, 2019. 7) In Order 18-30, the FCC restricted fees tribes charge Sprint and other telecom companies for reviewing the impacts on historic and cultural resources. 8 ) In September 2018, the FCC restricted fees cities charge Sprint and other telecom companies for siting towers and other wireless infrastructure in their communities. (FCC Order 18-133[18]). Several lawsuits challenging the FCC's action have been consolidated before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. (Case No.19-70146[19]) 9) In addition to restricting fees that cities can charge for building new wireless networks, Order 18-133 limited the time allowed for review of the proposed construction. The FCC imposed a so-called 'shot clock'[20] on cities and towns. If the local government has not acted within as few as 60 days on a construction permit, the project is deemed approved.Download Your First Issue Free!

The Commission's standards date from the 1990's. In 2012, the General Accountability Office[21] found that the existing standards may not reflect current knowledge and recommended that the FCC formally reassess its standards. The FCC's standards address only one aspect of potential harm from electromagnetic radiation\u2014heat. The current standards do not address other ways in which exposure to increasing electromagnetic radiation from wireless communications can harm human health, as well as the natural systems around us on which all life depends. The U.S. National Toxicology Program conducted rodent studies to help clarify the potential health hazards of radio frequency radiation (RFR). According to my NRDC colleague, Dr. Jennifer Sass[22], the results (which have been subjected to expert peer review and public comment) show that long-term high exposures to RFR used by 2G and 3G cell phones are associated with an elevated risk of cancer, particularly in heart and brain cells (NTP 2018[23]). This is consistent with the previous hazard assessment of the World Health Organization's cancer experts, which concluded that there was a possible link (Group 2B) to brain cancer in people with RFR exposures (IARC 2011[24]). Both government agencies warn that the public should take pragmatic steps to reduce exposures (IARC Director[25], May 2011; NTP Fact Sheet[26], Nov 2018).[embedded content] [embedded content]Activist

Frank[1] Over the last year, state[2] and federal legislation[3] was passed that allows dangerous 4G and 5G[4] small cell towers and infrastructure to be installed throughout American communities and rural areas - even in front of homes[5] in residential neighborhoods. Many American communities and organizations have already taken legal action against this. Last summer, NRDC joined several American tribal groups[6] in doing the same. </p><p>NRDC is still fighting this - along with many other Americans - now including some elected officials. See 1[7], 2[8], 3[9], 4[10], 5[11], 6[12], 7[13] NRDC is having a conference call today, Thursday, Jan 31 3-4pm EST.

Also, a meme, suggesting a girl whose \"first crush is a little negro boy\" should have her head held under water, was left on the site despite complaints. </p><p>Mr Naughten said: \"The programme raises serious questions for the company in respect of the manner in which it handles reports of harmful or illegal content; the internal procedures it has in place to moderate harmful or illegal content; and the systems the company has in place to report instances of abuse, suspected abuse or other illegal activity to the appropriate authorities, including An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.\"</p><h>Offensive material </h><p>The programme also led to renewed calls for legislation governing how internet service providers respond to disturbing, offensive or dangerous material posted by users, and for the urgent appointment of a digital safety commissioner.  </p><p>The Children's Rights Alliance, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and CyberSafe Ireland all said the programme underlined the need for legislation to regulate internet service providers, saying self-regulation was insufficient. </p><p>However, legislation has been rejected by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. </p><p>At an event last week, Mr Varadkar said: \"I think in fairness to the big tech companies, when I meet them they are very attuned to this issue. They know that failing to act when it comes to online safety is damaging their reputation and potentially damaging their shareholder value in the longer term.</p><p>\"When [offensive or dangerous] content is reported, they take it down very quickly. Some don't, but that's the kind of work they need to be doing. You can pass any law you like but the internet by its nature is the worldwide web, so companies have a global reach that domestic laws don't have.\"</p><p>Facebook's public policy manager of content, Siobh\u00e1n Cummiskey, said yesterday that she knew people were \"upset and concerned\" by the revelations, adding the company had taken \"immediate steps\" to address the issues raised. </p><h>Covert filming The documentary involved </h><p>covert filming over seven weeks at the company's European headquarters in Dublin. In it, trainees were told the video of the small boy being beaten should be \"marked as disturbing\" (Mad) but not taken down. </p><p>One moderator said: \"If you start censoring too much then people stop using the platform. It's all about money at the end of the day.\" </p><p>Ms Cummiskey said Facebook was \"concerned\" about what was shown in the documentary. \"I'm the lead of the content policy team that serves Europe, the Middle East and Africa so my team is dedicated to keeping people on our platform safe.\" </p><p>Martin Collins, co-director of Pavee Point, said his organisation \"regularly\" had to report \"hate speech\" to Facebook. </p><p>\"As far as we're concerned the link between hate speech and hate crime is there. About three years ago a Roma family were intimidated in their home by a crowd of up to 100 people. This was preceded by hate speech on Facebook such as 'petrol bomb them all' and 'burn the cockroaches out'.\"</p><p>Retail Excellence Ireland, the largest retail representative body in the State, suspended its relationship with the social network. </p><p>\"We will not be working with Facebook until we are satisfied its policies have been overhauled,\" chief executive Lorraine Higgins said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3569962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV1-1TB1-DYS1-03JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But if you really want to grow your brand and maximize returns on your efforts, you'll need to take those digital goods offshore and target users in other countries with content that's adapted for their unique culture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For most, abandoning this proven playbook is folly. Consider, for example, Disney's blockbuster Black Panther movie. In its first week, the film grossed more than $277 million domestically and more than $228 million in foreign markets (the latter representing 45% of the flick's total intake), per Box Office Mojo. But imagine if the studio decided not to release this juggernaut internationally because it didn't want to go to the trouble of dubbing the dialogue for various foreign languages and making and distributing extra release prints.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But globalizing your mobile content often involves more heavy lifting than many companies realize. Customizing your digital content for foreign audiences and localizing your app or site requires careful planning. Cutting corners, ignoring the preferences of a given country, and making insular assumptions can backfire. But the right strategies can pay major dividends.</p><p>BREAKING BOUNDARIES AND BRIDGING CULTURES</p><p>Why is globalizing your mobile content worth it? Ask founder and lead analyst at MobileGroove, Peggy Anne Salz, and she'll tell you that it's a no-brainer. \"If it's possible to put your digital content asset on as many digital shelves as possible, then why wouldn't you do that? Today, this isn't just possible-it's essential,\" Salz says. \"It's smart business to take advantage of uncontested markets and adapt your content to the region, local preferences, tastes, and cultural sensitivities of different audiences.\"</p><p>Juliana Pereira, VP of marketing for the translation management platform Smartling, agrees. \"More and more consumers in global markets are discovering and interacting with brands on their smartphones. But if your brand doesn't create content for them or localize that content to resonate with them, you are effectively leaving money on the table or, worse, giving your competition a leg up in that market,\" says Pereira.</p><p>Put another way, if content is restricted by boundaries, so is the brand behind it, insists Allon Caidar, CEO and founder of TVPage, which manages and localizes video commerce experiences for global retailers. \"Content today must drive the ongoing engagement point between brand and consumer,\" notes Caidar. \"In order to maintain and scale consumer loyalty, a brand must ensure that there is an ongoing stream of content that continues to connect and resonate with new consumers everywhere.\"</p><p>TODAY MOBILE, TOMORROW THE WORLD</p><p>Make no mistake: While content optimized for desktop experiences is important, mobile is the mode of choice for most consumers today, especially when it comes to apps. That is why a globalizing effort should give first priority to small screen users. Note that mobile now represents 69% of digital media time spent versus about 31% on desktop, according to comScore's \"2017 U.S. Cross-Platform Future in Focus\" report. Additionally, 57% of all digital media usage is commanded by mobile apps, and smartphone apps alone account for more than half of digital media time spent, based on \"The 2017 U.S. Mobile App Report\" from comScore.</p><p>In its 2017 \"Mobile's Hierarchy of Needs\" report, comScore revealed that Indonesia and India are the most mobile-focused over desktop, with approximately 90% and 55% of digital media time spent on mobile devices, respectively. Mexico, Spain, and Brazil are also particularly mobile-first.</p><p>The prospects and opportunities in many of these markets are tantalizing for companies aiming to globalize their content. Consider that the fastest-growing mobile market on the planet is currently sub-Saharan Africa, where half of all the mobile money services are located and which is expected to have 500 million cellphone subscribers by 2020, per the GSM Association. Counterpoint Research reveals that, with around 650 million mobile device users, India commands a larger smartphone market than America, but 1 billion Indians still lack a smartphone. And smartphone penetration is anticipated to hit more than 62% in the Asia-Pacific region by 2021, according to eMarketer's 2017 \"Internet and Mobile Users in Asia-Pacific\" report.</p><p>\"For many people around the world, their smartphone is the first and only digital device they own. And many people have reduced their usage of desktop computers and laptops, opting for smartphones,\" says Dmytro Moroz, digital marketing strategist at Kanbanize, a software publisher based in Bulgaria, which has recently translated its website and expert content into additional languages after expanding into Spanish-speaking and Germanspeaking regions.</p><p>\"Outside of the U.S. and Europe, it's a mobile-first world, especially in Asia and Africa. From an awareness perspective, brands will have more reach if they build their content in mobile-first formats,\" says Robb Hecht, adjunct marketing professor at Baruch College in New York City.</p><p>Pereira says many markets are so mobile-dependent for a simple reason: \"Mobile devices are significantly cheaper than desktops and tablets in these markets.\" Consequently, \"people in developing countries coming online every day are doing so through mobile instead of desktop.\"</p><p>Thomas Kriebernegg, CEO at App Radar, an app management and translation solutions provider, says the biggest mobile market of all is China, where \"there was no desktop or PC age. This technology was mostly skipped, so mobile was adopted directly.\"</p><p>Hecht insists that in Africa and Asia, desktop is practically dead. \"Desktops are more expensive, and so is paying for an internet connection. Wireless service is more costeffective.\"</p><p>But prioritizing mobile over desktop for a particular market will require a different approach to the content you're seeking to globalize. \"Experiences are often more transactional and layered on mobile but slightly less immersive than desktop. In other words, there's more real estate on desktop, so [there's] more room for multiple elements to interact,\" says Pereira. \"Mobile relies on a series of smaller interactions since space is limited. Some companies even scale back the amount of content within their mobile app compared to their website to prevent endless scrolling and clicking, which can exhaust or detract from the mobile experience. For some traditional or big tech businesses, it may make more sense to design for desktop first while remembering to apply responsive design best practices for the mobile version.\"</p><p>Another challenge is lack of available real estate on and designing a user-friendly layout for a mobile screen. \"Different languages require different layouts. Some languages read right to left, like Arabic and Hebrew, while others are characterbased, such as Japanese and Chinese, and others, like Hindi and Russian, use different alphabets,\" Pereira adds. \"Some languages can take up more space than others on a screen, and in the case of a mobile device, this can cause more scrolling because less of the key content is visible when the user loads the page. For example, Arabic not only has the challenge of reading right to left, but it is also a lengthy language that requires a lot more words than English to express most phrases. With less room on mobile, it's important to think about how the language will look in the context of the screen so that the translated text doesn't break the design or layout of the mobile site or app.\"</p><p>THE PREPLANNING STAGE</p><p>Many factors need to be considered carefully and challenges overcome before embarking on a content globalization effort for your mobile app or site. For example, think about how the content you create for one market may get shared elsewhere.</p><p>\"Today's consumed content gets shared endlessly and crosses traditional geographic boundaries. Although content can still originate in a single market, once it goes viral, everyone knows about it. So content creators should try to design and originate content that can be consumed across the globe,\" says Gal Oppenheimer, senior solution architect at Contentstack, a headless CMS provider.</p><p>A one-size-fits-all global approach will only go so far. You'll also need to determine which particular foreign markets to customize content for. \"To help, figure out where your users are most active on different social platforms-Instagram,Twitter,WhatsApp, etc.-and start building your following there,\" Oppenheimer suggests.</p><p>For starters, it's smart to target three to five key markets for your app, recommends Salz. \"Anything less and you might be leaving money on the table.\" Kriebernegg suggests translating some of your content or app into a foreign language that you want to test drive. \"Release it and have a look at how it impacts your downloads. If you are getting good traction, think of also translating the complete content of the app to really unleash its power,\" says Kriebernegg.</p><p>Look to analytics for guidance too. \"Crunch your data to help find your audiences. Maybe you're seeing some downloads coming from users in Malaysia, where English is spoken but not the national language. It's a signal there is some interest-and to really get more users onboard, you should make your app discoverable in their native language and on a local app store,\" says Salz.</p><p>Using tools such as smart analytics systems is wise, Caidar says. \"These tools can provide insights into global and regional activity and deep data intelligence capabilities that optimize experiences by leveraging critical data.\" Consider, also, how consumers overseas access content and pay for data on their mobile devices. \"The speeds and bandwidth of internet connections vary a lot around the world, as do the capabilities of mobile devices. So you'll need to re-evaluate things like images and layouts and make sure every element works fine on both high- and low-end devices. Your video might make it harder for certain users to download the page. And screen resolution and the ability to run scripts and special extensions have to be carefully evaluated,\" says Moroz.</p><p>Keep in mind that many global markets charge more for data, as well. \"Users in the Philippines, for example, pay almost five times the cost of data over the United States,\" notes David Hewitt, group VP at SapientRazorfish. \"Subsidizing data costs to reach household scale can be a worthwhile strategy here.\" After performing your due diligence, don't be surprised if you determine that content globalization for a particular audience isn't worth it. \"While globalizing content can seem like a good strategy, often times it's not. The topics that resonate in one market may not in another,\" Hecht says.</p><p>LOCALIZATION PRIORITIZATION</p><p>One of the most important steps in globalizing content is localization-the process of translating your app or site into various languages and making it authentic to that region via native dialects, cultural phrases, and content. This is where things can get tricky.</p><p>\"One mistake many make is to rely solely on Google Translate. This is a good tool, but it can miss nuances that could wreck your business model,\" says Salz. \"The better answer is to hire an interpreter or at least a native person from that country who is attuned to the cultural sensitivities and inherent nuances of where you want to offer your content.\" Another challenge is deciding exactly what you need to translate and for which audiences. \"If most of your site or app is translated but none of its ancillary content is, ask yourself if you're providing that user a good experience with your brand,\" says Pereira.</p><p>In addition to, or in lieu of, hiring a human interpreter, consider leveraging translation technology and specialized tools, which can streamline the manual processes involved in the localization process. \"We all know that automated translation isn't ready for prime time, but the right platform will make your human translators more productive by speeding up the process and autotranslating words and phrases it understands,\" says Oppenheimer.</p><p>Relying on a translation management tool is also smart; it can handle your translation files and assets natively and can facilitate rapid and accurate translation, whether the work is done internally or through a language service or machine translation, Pereira says. \"Tools such as customizable workflows, style guides, glossaries, context, translation memory, and collaboration and communication with translators and project managers can help improve localization efficiency.\"</p><p>And localizing your app store presence is just as important as localizing the app itself. \"There's more to the world than Google Play and the Apple App Store,\" Salz says. \"Don't forget about the Amazon Appstore, the Opera Mobile Store, Tencent, and around 350 alternative Android app stores available globally.\"</p><p>When it comes to mobile, simplicity is your friend in terms of design. \"Turn to lightweight, clean design and styles that don't require too much processing power or bandwidth, and make sure all interface elements scale properly in all your localized versions,\" says Moroz. Additionally, partner with influencers when possible. \"When communicating with a brand's audience in France, for example, the only way to bridge language and cultural barriers is to have a local voice. This can be achieved by embracing influencers and content creators who are localized to specific languages and cultures,\" says Caidar. \"Take the recent Winter Olympics, for example. Brands actively partnered on social with athletes from different countries to create interest around behind-thescenes content.\"</p><p>Remember to check local regulations. Salz says, \"You want to be sure that the countries you're targeting in your globalization campaign will allow you to launch.\" \u0428\u0417</p><p>ERIK J.

For best results, Juliana Pereira, VP of marketing for the translation management platform Smartling, recommends the following tips:</p><p>* Code your app or site for easy translation. Separate translatable content from executable code, which eliminates the need to recode the entire app/site for each language.</p><p>* Adhere to platform best practices. Follow platform-specific best coding practices related to translation provided by the relevant platform. In iOS, for instance, resource files to be translated are referred to as .strings files with a \"key\"=\"value\" format. Note that, as app/site language changes, objects such as drop-down menus and labels may need adjustments to size and position to fit the new text.</p><p>* Localize key aspects such as dates, currency, measures, times, and design for a truly native experience in each region.</p><p>* Harmonize design with your copy. Aim to keep the elements simple, and keep your content relatively brief and digestible.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECNTNT-2075490819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECNTNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWH-VTX1-JBHT-D51F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313134</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Information Today, Inc.

More than a real plan for regulation, the document is a statement of principles, a glimpse of a future Liberal campaign plank.</p><p>It is not hard to imagine Trudeau campaigning on this issue - he is young enough to be conversant in online issues.</p><p>Remember the praise and adulation in 2016, when he stood in front of a chalkboard covered in math equations and handily explained quantum computing to an adoring media?</p><p>But he is not alone. His NDP counterpart Jagmeet Singh, who is himself a savvy user of Snapchat, could outflank him by calling for the immediate regulation of tech giants, like Facebook or Amazon.</p><p>Across the Western world, leftist political parties are following the lead of the Europeans in regulating tech companies, riding a public \"techlash\" driven by scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and an endless parade of hacks and data breaches.</p><p>In the United States, Democrats jostling for the 2020 presidential nomination are racing to outdo each other in their plans to trust-bust Facebook, the same way Teddy Roosevelt did Standard Oil or Clinton did Microsoft.</p><p>There is an audience for all of this because the public believes when it comes to privacy-protecting regulations, government is chronically running three steps behind the biggest, most advanced tech companies.</p><p>Consequently, governments now face the same challenge they did in regulating Bay Street. Those who really have the know-how and technical understanding to draft regulations find it much more enticing to work for industry than for government.</p><p>In his speech announcing the digital charter, Trudeau referred to the digital sphere as a \"Wild West, \" a fitting descriptor both because it can be a dangerous place - Trudeau's remarks were delivered at a conference devoted to combating hate speech online - but also because there exists enormous financial opportunity.</p><p>The challenge with the digital charter is thus to strike the right balance between preserving the nascent but lucrative technology ecosystem (a $100 billion industry in Canada) and addressing the public's sudden concerns.</p><p>To do so, the charter includes a number of principles about consumer protections. In addition to obvious privacy and safety rights, users should have control over what data to share, and the ability to transfer it from one company to another without \"undue burden.\"</p><p>This last idea, known as \"data portability, \" will be a boon to both users, and to startups, by making it easier to transfer personal information away from legacy companies.</p><p>The fact of the matter is most companies, operating in a sphere without strict borders, already comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and realize more stringent regulation is on the horizon.</p><p>The digital charter is simply the opening salvo in a long war to come over the governance of technology in Canada.</p><p>Jaime Watt is the executive chairman of Navigator Ltd. and a Conservative strategist.

More than a real plan for regulation, the document is a statement of principles, a glimpse of a future Liberal campaign plank.</p><p>It is not hard to imagine Trudeau campaigning on this issue - he is young enough to be conversant in online issues.</p><p>Remember the praise and adulation in 2016, when he stood in front of a chalkboard covered in math equations and handily explained quantum computing to an adoring media?</p><p>But he is not alone. His NDP counterpart Jagmeet Singh, who is himself a savvy user of Snapchat, could outflank him by calling for the immediate regulation of tech giants, like Facebook or Amazon.</p><p>Across the Western world, leftist political parties are following the lead of the Europeans in regulating tech companies, riding a public \"techlash\" driven by scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and an endless parade of hacks and data breaches.</p><p>In the United States, Democrats jostling for the 2020 presidential nomination are racing to outdo each other in their plans to trust-bust Facebook, the same way Teddy Roosevelt did Standard Oil or Clinton did Microsoft.</p><p>There is an audience for all of this because the public believes when it comes to privacy-protecting regulations, government is chronically running three steps behind the biggest, most advanced tech companies.</p><p>Consequently, governments now face the same challenge they did in regulating Bay Street. Those who have the know-how and technical understanding to draft regulations find it much more enticing to work for industry than for government.</p><p>In his speech announcing the digital charter, Trudeau referred to the digital sphere as a \"Wild West, \" a fitting descriptor both because it can be a dangerous place - Trudeau's remarks were delivered at a conference devoted to combating hate speech online - but also because there exists enormous financial opportunity.</p><p>The challenge with the digital charter is thus to strike the right balance between preserving the nascent but lucrative technology ecosystem (a $100 billion industry in Canada) and addressing the public's sudden concerns.</p><p>To do so, the charter includes a number of principles about consumer protections. In addition to obvious privacy and safety rights, users should have control over what data to share, and the ability to transfer it from one company to another without \"undue burden.\"</p><p>This last idea, known as \"data portability, \" will be a boon to both users, and to startups, by making it easier to transfer personal information away from legacy companies.</p><p>The fact of the matter is most companies, operating in a sphere without strict borders, already comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and realize more stringent regulation is on the horizon.</p><p>The digital charter is simply the opening salvo in a long war to come over the governance of technology in Canada.</p><p>Jaime Watt is the executive chairman of Navigator Ltd. and a Conservative strategist.

It's MEET THE PRESS.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, this is MEET THE PRESS WITH CHUCK TODD.</p><p>TODD:  Good Sunday morning.  </p><p>Right now, President Trump has an opportunity for one of those leadership moments on the issue of guns.  But once again, he seems distracted by the Russia investigation.  Apparently rattled by the release of a Democratic memo challenging Republican allegations of misconduct in the FBI's Russia probe, Mr. Trump sent out five tweets yesterday and felt the need to call into Fox News late last night to insist once again that there was no collusion, once again, that he did nothing wrong, and to once again, blame the election interference on President Obama.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Because everybody's looking, there is no collusion.  No phone calls, I had no phone calls, no meetings, no nothing.  There is no collusion.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Phone calls, by the way, is a new denial for the president, as far as the specifics are concerned.  The president may have reason to be rattled.  In the last ten days, the Mueller probe has intensified with more indictments and more guilty pleas, plural.  </p><p>But the national conversation right now is on guns and the NRA is the one in the hot seat, with more than a dozen companies cutting ties this weekend with the gun lobby.</p><p>The NRA has lashed out at the boycott, calling it a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.</p><p>Still, you have a president with an A-plus rating from the NRA who says he's open to new gun restrictions, including one that the NRA opposes.</p><p>And you have a Republican governor with an A-plus rating from the NRA defying the gun lobby and going further on gun control than Republicans went after Sandy Hook.  </p><p>There are few things more polarizing in this country than the gun debate.  And both parties must now decide what, if anything, their bases can support or stomach.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP:  They want to do things that you wouldn't even believe, including taking your Second Amendment rights away.</p><p>TODD:  President Trump caught between a growing movement of grieving parents and students --</p><p>SAMUEL ZEIF, DOUGLAS STONEMAN STUDENT:  How have we not stopped this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook?</p><p>TODD:  -- and its conservative base.</p><p>TRUMP:  The NRA, they're friends of mine, they backed us all.  They're great people.</p><p>TODD:  This week, Mr. Trump appeared open to modest gun reforms, including a bill that would reward states that improve reporting to the FBI's background check system, a ban on bump stocks, though that would likely be challenged in court, and raising the minimum age to buy an AR-15.</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to work on getting the age up to 21 instead of 18.</p><p>TODD:  The NRA opposes that change.  But faced with protests and boycotts --</p><p>STUDENT PROTESTORS:  Hey, hey, NRA, you can't beat the PTA (ph)!</p><p>TODD:  -- several Republican lawmakers, including Florida's governor, are bucking the gun lobby.</p><p>SCOTT:  We will require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older.</p><p>TODD:  But just like on immigration, where a long White House listening session produced little action, the devil is in the details.  And Mr. Trump has so far refused to talk legislative specifics.  Instead, pivoting the debate to arming teachers.</p><p>TRUMP:  The teacher would've shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.</p><p>TODD:  And that's not the only talking point Mr. Trump has borrowed from the NRA.</p><p>WAYNE LAPIERRE, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION:  We must immediately harden our schools.</p><p>TRUMP:  And I want to harden the school too.  Harden.  Into a hardened, hardened, hardened, a hardened school.</p><p>TODD:  According to a Pew poll last year, twice as many gun owners said they had contacted a public official on the issue of guns than non-gun owners.  But there are signals Republicans in suburban districts may sense a change in the political climate.  A Florida congressman, whose district Mr. Trump won by nine points, came out in favor of an assault weapons ban on Friday.</p><p>REP. BRIAN MAST (R), FLORIDA:  I spent my life trying to defend this country and I can't stand to see the weapon that I carried, in order to -- in defense of this country, used to kill -- used to kill kids.</p><p>TODD:  Still, most red state and rural Democrats are wary of the gun issue, worrying it will energize the Republican base.  Five senators who caucus with the Democrats voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013.  And they're on the ballot this year.  And Democrat Conor Lamb, running in the Pennsylvania special election, where voters go to the polls in just over two weeks, made it clear he does not want to run on gun control.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So the majority of Americans who tell Pew and other pollsters that they're in favor of banning assault weapons, you do not support that?</p><p>CONOR LAMB (D-PA), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  I do not support that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  Joining me now is Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.  He was the Republican leader of the last bipartisan effort in Congress in an attempt to reform gun laws.  That, of course, didn't pass.  </p><p>Senator Toomey, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, sir.</p><p>SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  Good morning, Chuck.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>TODD:  Let me start with your bill and what we know about the shooter down in south Florida.  There was a lot of information the school system had.  There was a lot of information that were called into authorities about the mental stability or instability of this young man.</p><p>TOOMEY:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  But there's no part of the law that would have mandated that information make it into the background check system.  How would your bill deal with that?</p><p>TOOMEY:  It wouldn't.  You know, the fact is the bill that Joe Manchin and I introduced and that we still support, Chuck, it's not going to solve all the problems and we never suggest that it would.  </p><p>And one of the challenges that we face is what to do about someone who is clearly mentally deranged, but they haven't acted out yet in a way that allows you to adjudicate them as dangerously mentally ill or they haven't committed a crime.  Clearly, in this case, there were all kinds of warning signs that were advertised, right?  That were communicated.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>TOOMEY:  And nothing was done.  That's a problem.  </p><p>I think there's an important discussion to be had about a temporary restraining order on somebody who's evidencing some serious dangerous behavior.  There would have to be due process --  </p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>TOOMEY:  -- so that that couldn't be used as a weapon against someone inappropriately.  </p><p>But, look, our legislation I think would be very constructive.  I still support it.  But I'm not going to suggest it would solve all problems.</p><p>TODD:  No I understand that.  I guess the question then is, should school information be temporarily put in the system.  So for instance, he was expelled.  Does the fact that he was expelled -- do you put that in the system say for a five-year period, so that, you know, he could be caught in the system, an extra -- maybe an extra interview by the FBI?  Or an extra interview by authorities if he attempts to purchase a weapon?</p><p>TOOMEY:  Yes, I'm not sure that expulsion from school is sufficient.  I imagine there could be all kinds of -- cheating on a test, for instance --  </p><p>TODD:  Sure.</p><p>TOOMEY:  -- you know, I don't know what kind of circumstances might cause an expulsion.  That really doesn't suggest that this is a dangerous person who shouldn't have Second Amendment rights.  So I'm not sure that's the right criteria.  </p><p>But look, we have a lot of gun sales in America today, for which there is no background check whatsoever.  And this is one of the things that Senator Manchin and I are trying to address.  Let's at least require a background check for all commercial sales.  That's what our legislation attempts to do by requiring background checks at sales at gun shows, or over the Internet.  </p><p>We'd also our legislation would encourage states to provide the information to the background check system so that the information would be there.  And we also create a commission to study this kind of, these massacres, this mass violence.  I think it's overdue, and I still hope we can succeed with another run at it.</p><p>TODD:  Senator, John Cornyn, the Republican -- the number two Republican in the Senate, he has a Fix NICS bill.  </p><p>TOOMEY:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  He says basically, hinting that whether it's your measure or even another that the president wants to put out there, raising the age on getting assault weapons to 21.  That it doesn't have the votes in the Senate.  Is he right?  Does your bill not have the 60 votes?</p><p>TOOMEY:  We don't know the answer to that, Chuck.  I've spent a lot of hours on the phone and communicating in other ways with my colleagues this week.  I do think there are some members who were not supportive in the past who are reconsidering.  I haven't got anyone who said, yes, sign me up, Pat.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>TOOMEY:  But there are definitely members who are reconsidering.  The president's expression of support for strengthening our background check system is very constructive.  The president can play a huge and in fact probably decisive role in this.  </p><p>So, I intend to give this another shot.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this.  On the idea of raising the age on assault weapons from 18 to 21, are you personally supportive of that?</p><p>TOOMEY:  I'm very skeptical about that, because the vast majority of 18, 19, 20, 21-year olds are law-abiding citizens who aren't a threat to anyone.  So I'm skeptical about that.  I'm willing to hear the other side on this, but I'm skeptical.</p><p>TODD:  Go -- what about the AR-15 specifically?  I mean, is there an argument to be made that something that powerful, you know, you could make an exception for some hunting rifles, but that one, that powerful.</p><p>TOOMEY:  Here's the problem, Chuck.  There's a lot of hunting rifles that are as powerful as an AR-15.  The difference between the AR-15 and an awful lot of commonly sold rifles is just cosmetic.  You know, it's got a grip under the barrel and it's painted black.  That is -- that doesn't change its lethality.</p><p>TODD:  I want to ask you about the failures of law enforcement down in South Florida.  The failures, whether it's the FBI, the Broward County sheriff's office, does that in your mind reinforce the notion that the background check system needs to be fixed?  We need another fail-safe because you can't always count on law enforcement to be there, or does that reinforce this notion that more people need to be armed?</p><p>TOOMEY:  These are not mutually exclusive, Chuck.  I think this is a case where an armed guard appears to have really, really failed to do his job, as best as we know so far.  I think we need an investigation on that.  But certainly, I don't think that would be the typical response of an armed guard, and it certainly is not the typical response of law enforcement and trained first responders we have all over the country.  </p><p>So, I think having properly trained capable people in vulnerable settings will enhance security, but I still believe that we absolutely should tighten up our background check system.  So I think both are, you know, sensible steps.</p><p>TODD:  You're opened to arm -- having some teachers be armed?</p><p>TOOMEY:  Under some circumstances.  I'd leave it to the individual school districts and the states.  I will tell you, in Pennsylvania, there are school districts where there are a number of teachers who are extensively trained there.  They're ex-military.  They would be comfortable and they would be -- it would be suitable.  I certainly wouldn't impose it on a school that didn't wish to do that.</p><p>TODD:  I want to get you to respond to something that the NRA's Wayne LaPierre said in a speech over the weekend.  Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAPIERRE:  The elites don't care not one whit about America's school system.  This growing socialist state dreams of manipulating school children to squeeze and squeeze information about their parents.  And I sense your anxiety.  And you should be anxious.  And you should be frightened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  You think the NRA has been playing a constructive role this week?</p><p>TOOMEY:  This is the first I've heard, and I don't know what else Wayne LaPierre said, so that strikes me as a little bit conspiratorial in its tone, but again, I don't have it in the full context.</p><p>TODD:  But I guess overall, I mean, there has been this -- a boycott that has gotten traction.  And, you know, the NRA seems to be more defiant than wanting to talk about the fact that, hey, a lot of people want to have a different conversation on guns.</p><p>TOOMEY:  Look, I mean I disagree with the NRA on this position.  The NRA once held the position that I hold, which is that background checks at gun sales and any kind of commercial sale are appropriate.  The NRA changed its position on that.  I disagree with them.  </p><p>I think it'd be terrific if the NRA would come back to where it once was.  And that would be very constructive.</p><p>TODD:  Finally, have you been guaranteed that your bill is going to get a vote?</p><p>TOOMEY:  No.  You know, I'll be speaking with Senator McConnell about that this week.  You know, time on the Senate schedule is precious, especially with our Democratic colleagues chewing so much of it up over non-controversial nominees, but if we've got 60 votes, then I think that would be a very compelling argument to have a vote, and I think I think we would.  </p><p>TODD:  All right.  Senator Pat Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania.  Thanks for coming on and sharing your views.  Much appreciated.</p><p>TOOMEY:  Thanks, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  Well, not every Republican is on board, even with some limited gun reform proposals that the president says he'll support.  After Mr. Trump proposed raising the minimum age to purchase the AR-15, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie didn't take long to tweet back at the president.</p><p>Quote: Why should a 20-year-old single mom be denied the right to defend herself and her kids?  We should lower the age to buy a handgun to 18 instead of raising the age to buy an AR-15.  Sad.  In all caps there, a little tweak at the president's use of that word.  </p><p>Well, Republican Congressman Massie joins me now.  </p><p>Congressman, welcome to MEET THE PRESS, sir.</p><p>REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R), KENTUCKY:  Thanks for having me on to talk about some serious solutions to these problems.</p><p>TODD:  Well, let me ask you this.  What is -- you heard Senator Toomey, he wants to expand the background check system for all gun purchases.  What's wrong with that?</p><p>MASSIE:  Listen, my heart is breaking for the families in Florida.  I have kids that go to public school.  We had a school shooting here in Kentucky, and I'm a legislator who's in a position to do something.  But if I came home after proposing some of these things that are so unserious and disingenuous that some of my colleagues are proposing as solutions to these school shootings, I couldn't face my wife or my children.  </p><p>Now this -- but, I've not been in that situation of a school shooting.  So, this week, I talked to two survivors of Columbine.  And one of them, Evan Todd, related to me his story of being in the library when the two shooters came in.  He was the first one shot.  He hid under a desk.  They found him, and he pleaded for his life.  Then, he escaped from the library, ran outside and there were two police behind a shed who had taken up a position.  They weren't going in.  </p><p>Now, he tells me that he forgives the adults that day.  The legislators, the administrators and the police because they couldn't foresee what was going to happen at Columbine.  But he said it's -- you know, it's a shame here we are 20 years later, it's still happening.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>MASSIE:  And people are rolling out these same old solutions that will do nothing.  And he supports my bill which is called the Safe Students Act, which will repeal the federal Gun Free School Zone Act.</p><p>TODD:  All right.  But what's wrong with having multiple fail-safes?  That's the part of this where I think that people get frustrated on this debate.  You have people that say, we don't want to infringe upon anybody's Second Amendment rights.  But what's wrong with an expanded background check?  What's wrong with maybe more cops at high schools?</p><p>MASSIE:  Well, you know, I wish that background checks stopped criminals or stopped school shootings, but they don't.  They failed in Texas with the church shooting.  They failed at Columbine.  Look, the two students there --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  Doesn't, well, wait a minute there.  Doesn't that mean the background check system is flawed?  Isn't that the issue here?  That we're not putting -- </p><p>MASSIE:  It's absolutely -- </p><p>TODD:  Well, then why don't -- because we don't put any of the information in it.  We're not putting enough information in it.</p><p>MASSIE:  Well, you're trying to put -- you're trying to put lipstick on a pig.  You're trying to put lipstick on a pig.  </p><p>Look, you could put all the information you want in it, but the shooter in Connecticut who stole his mother's firearms and shot her before he committed the crime wouldn't -- isn't going to be stopped by a background check.  Neither were the two perpetrators in Columbine who got other people to buy the guns for them.  One of them -- one of the straw purchasers went to prison for that, because talk about the handgun, you know, 21 age.  The guy that went to prison, he was 22.  And he sold a handgun to one of the perpetrators who was 17.  </p><p>Look, people, criminals are going to get a hold of guns.  We've got -- what we've got to look at is what's the solution.  The solution, frankly, you know, you could put more guards at schools if you have one guard.  It's probably a waste of money because you're just endangering that guard unless you have two guards.  And anybody that's in security profession knows that.  </p><p>But what you need are some of the teachers who are armed.  Ninety-eight percent of mass public shootings happen in a gun-free zone.  And we've labeled all of our schools as gun-free zones.  </p><p>We need to take those labels off, and put our kids in that 2 percent category of being safe, you know, instead of being in that 98 percent vulnerable category.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this.  A majority of the country disagrees with you, right?  You have -- we have 60 -- some 65 percent in a recent poll.  And it's been across the board, doesn't matter which poll, that in general, the public would like stricter regulation of gun sales, in some form or another.  </p><p>You're proposing weaker.  I understand that.  You're from a rural state.  And so, let me ask you this though.  Shouldn't that matter--</p><p>MASSIE:  Well, you're in a bubble.  You're in a bubble there.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this though -- 65 percent of the country disagrees with you.  Do you have a, do you have an obligation to legislate on behalf of them at all?</p><p>MASSIE:  You're in a bubble.  If you take out New York and California, 8 percent of Americans have concealed carry permits.  And the people watching this show right now, there are a lot of them getting ready for church in Middle America, putting their guns on, millions of them.  They're going to be carrying guns to church, and to family dinner after that, and they're going to be safe.  </p><p>And so, you know all these things, these hypotheticals that come out of the bubble in D.C. or New York City or California, what if this happens, what if that happens?  We don't have to ask what if this happens.  People are carrying every day.</p><p>TODD:  I guess I go back to is what are you -- what are you so opposed to expanding the background check system?  Why do you make this argument that says, well, if you just pass more gun laws, it won't matter, criminals get it, then why do we pass any laws?  Like, why do we pass laws on drugs, why do we pass laws on murder?</p><p>MASSIE:  Well, we should pass my law to repeal the Gun-Free School Zone Act.  I call it the Safe Students Act.  </p><p>But, look, those are -- those are false senses of security.  Like Evan Todd from Columbine, he's disgusted at these proposals because they wouldn't do anything.  And in 10 years, we're still going to have school shootings, unless you propose real legislation, like President Trump has proposed, that would allow teachers to be armed.</p><p>TODD:  But you're in favor of that, but you're opposed to raising the AR-15 to 21?</p><p>MASSIE:  Oh, well that's ridiculous here.  Think about this.  You had a ban on assault rifles in 1999 when Columbine happened.  The assault weapons ban lasted, the so-called ban, lasted from -- the so-called assault weapons ban, lasted from '94 to 2004.  Columbine fell right in the middle of that.  The assault weapons ban would do nothing to stop school shootings.</p><p>TODD:  Wow.</p><p>MASSIE:  Eighty-four percent of mass public shootings involve a firearm other than an assault rifle, so-called assault rifle.</p><p>TODD:  I understand that.  But going back, you just think a background -- do you think our background check --  </p><p>MASSIE:  Yes.</p><p>TODD:  -- why do we bother with it at all?</p><p>MASSIE:  Well, you know what, it's flawed.  Three million people, law-abiding citizens were denied a purchase since this has been put in place.  But only about one in a thousand are prosecuted for trying to, quote, buy a gun illegally.  </p><p>The reality is, most of those 3 million, 99.9 percent of them are actually law-abiding citizens who were denied a purchase because the background check system is flawed.  It doesn't have the right information in there.  It's got false information.  </p><p>And it disproportionately is biased against minorities.  If you can get the information from the ATF, you would find that out.</p><p>TODD:  Well, we have no gun research in this country at all because Congress in many ways has prevented that from happening.  </p><p>Congressman Massie --</p><p>MASSIE:  Well, I've got an inquiry into the ATF to get that data.</p><p>TODD:  All right.  Congressman Massie, I'm going to leave it there.  Sir, thanks for coming on and sharing your views.  Much appreciated.</p><p>MASSIE:  Thank you, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  When we come back, much more on the corporate backlash facing the NRA and what folks at one of the nation's largest gatherings of conservatives told us about the president's gun reform proposals.  And later, why is the president so defensive about the Democrats' new memo on the Russia probe?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back, panel is here.  </p><p>Former White House press secretary and NBC News political analyst, Josh Earnest, Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute, Helene Cooper, Pentagon correspondent for \"The New York Times\", and David Brody, host of \"Faith Nation\" on the Christian Broadcasting Network, co-author of his new book, \"The Faith of Donald J. Trump: A Spiritual Biography.\"</p><p>All right, before I turn the gun debate over to you, I want you to take a look at what we heard from some attendees at the CPAC Conference, influential, you know, conservative meeting here this week in the D.C. area.  </p><p>Here's how they reacted to some of the gun reforms the president is proposing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't believe schools should have a policy of arming teachers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Some teachers who would be willing to be armed is a reasonable request.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't think anyone goes through to buy a gun and needs it right then and there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think strengthening the background checks is a good idea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe that 18 should be the legal age.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I agree in raising the age because I don't think, you know, my son when he was 18, I would never give him an AR-15.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Again, I want to reiterate, that was CPAC conference attendees.  </p><p>David, the NRA, they're getting hammered here on this boycott.  And it's been effective I think because they've not shown a lot of empathy in the last 10 days.  And then perhaps even CPAC attendees have noticed.</p><p>DAVID BRODY, HOST, CBN'S \"FAITH NATION\":  No.  The NRA has been tone deaf.  And they're going off of talking points that have been out there for a while.  And they've got to figure out a way to update those.  </p><p>And now, you have a president, for the first time a Republican president, who comes along as basically a Trump-publican, if you will.  I mean, he's not a Republican, he's not a Democrat, he's somewhere in the middle, or who knows what he is, depending on what happens.</p><p>TODD:  Depends on who's in the office, I think.</p><p>BRODY:  Well, and I'll just say this, but when it comes to guns, clearly, he can lead here.  It's an important moment for him.  And I think there is a deal to be done.</p><p>TODD:  There could be.  </p><p>But, you know, why am I a little skeptical?</p><p>HELENE COOPER, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Because we've covered this forever.  I think you and I remember talking to you right after Sandy Hook and you laughed at me because I was like, this is it.  They're killing kindergarteners.  Surely, we're going to do something about it.</p><p>And I remember you telling me, you were like, no, this is not, you know, nothing's going to happen.</p><p>I never feel like I'm less of an American than when I listen to the gun control debate.  Because what seems so obvious and what seems so rational and yet you just had a conversation between these two Republican guests who you had on there, talking about nipping at the edges, and it's all this stuff that we all know at the end of the day is probably not going to do that much to change anything.  But it's still, if you can't even get that tiny -- this tiny, tiny, tiny stuff, you know, how are we actually going to get anything real?</p><p>TODD:  Josh, you were there during Sandy Hook.</p><p>JOSH EARNEST, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  And you saw the fight from Manchin-Toomey.  I've always thought part of the reason why Manchin-Toomey failed was it didn't feel like a direct response to Sandy Hook.  This time, we see how the background check system, if it had worked better, might have worked.</p><p>EARNEST:  Right.  And certainly, some of the -- the age limit being raised would also address the situation directly.  </p><p>I did think it was notable, and you mentioned this in the open, that Governor Scott was in a situation where he is actually taking a position that is contrary to the NRA.  It's imagine -- it's easy to imagine sitting around this table saying, Governor Scott's never going to take any action on this, you know why?  Because he's running for the United States Senate.</p><p>In fact, we're in a situation now where he is taking action on this --   </p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>EARNEST:  -- because he is running for the United States Senate.  </p><p>So, I'm not suggesting, Chuck, that I'm particularly optimistic that this Congress is going to get something done, but we are starting to see the politics on this shift in a way that leaves me more optimistic about the future.</p><p>TODD:  Danny, that's what I think, if nothing legislatively changes this time, but the debate has shifted.  The ground's shifted a little bit.</p><p>DANIELLE PLETKA, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  I don't think there's any question the debate has shifted.  The problem really is that we focus a lot on the NRA, which is I think out of touch, sort of, you know, old-school, old talking points from the 1980s.  But the reality is that the members of Congress, whether it's a Democrat-dominated Congress or a Republican-dominated Congress, are not taking these votes.  We've got to ask ourselves why that is.</p><p>TODD:  They don't want to take the votes, do they?</p><p>PLETKA:  But when they do, the reality is that these laws stay in place.  So the problem is that we sit here, you know, we West Coast/East Coast elites talk about this.  And I think we're, you know, we're probably in sync.  We agree with Governor Scott, we agree something needs to be done.  The problem is, there are a lot of actual Americans who live in places that don't agree.</p><p>TODD:  Josh, do you think Democrats want an incremental?  You know, it's interesting, base Democrats, will they accept incremental progress or will they kill it?</p><p>EARNEST:  Well, look, you know, this is one of the interesting things about this debate is that the vast majority of the problem exists on the Republican side.  But there are problems on the Democratic side, too.  Republicans, many critics of President Obama have pointed out that Democrats were in charge of the United States Congress for the first two years of his presidency, and they didn't take any of these votes.  </p><p>And there's a reason for that.  Because it wouldn't have passed, had they taken these votes, right?</p><p>But the other reason is that we --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  Harry Reid didn't want you to have that vote.</p><p>EARNEST:  That's right.</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>EARNEST:  Now, we were focused on preventing a second Great Depression, passing healthcare reform.  So, it's not as if we were focused on the wrong things, but the political dynamics here do portray that Democrats in some cases are not in the right place.  The question I think does -- the question is, what impact does that mean?  What does it mean for Democrats?  What should we do when we confront a candidate like Conor Lamb?</p><p>TODD:  Right.  I mean, look, I mean, Conor Lamb's in Western Pennsylvania saying one thing, and here's Pat Toomey the senator going, whoa, you know, let's do something.</p><p>BRODY:  But the issue here I think is that we've reached a tipping point.  And you know, in society, we reach tipping points.  In a marriage, you reach a tipping point.  Enough of the lying, the cheat, whatever it is.  </p><p>In the debate on guns, I think we've reached the tipping point here.  Why?  Yes, another shooting.  At some point, just by osmosis, it just happens.  It just happens.  You see the poll results.</p><p>But then beyond that, I think eventually what you're going to have to see here is like what is going to happen going forward here?  Because I believe that at some point, Republicans are going to have to figure this out.  They have a president, though, that can lead here.</p><p>TODD:  It's like why not try?</p><p>COOPER:  We have a data point that's coming out on March 24 with this.  You know, people are already talking about this national march on Washington.  I'm very curious to see if we are going to see thousands upon thousands of people coming up -- but we're talking about it, too.  When we're talking about a tipping point, at some point, you have to ask whether the voices of these kids, these kids who are going to the capitol, who are going -- standing before congress, who are standing before the White House who...</p><p>TODD:  Look, we have a change.  Brian Mast, a Republican member of congress, not far from where the shooting took place, he came out for the assault weapons ban. </p><p>PLETKA:  But shockingly enough, in Washington, it is reasonable to ask one question.  The march is great.  I agree with you, I think we have reached a tipping point.  We all agree about these issues, is this going to solve this problem?  That's -- we have a debate about what we can all do politically to make the kids go away and to make the lobbyists go away.  But what is going to solve this </p><p>problem?  And the answer is nobody wants to talk about that because it's unpalatable in the United </p><p>States. </p><p>BRODY:  Well, it's also cultural.  And just for a quick, mental health, I think, is going to be  where this debate is going to go. </p><p>TODD:  There's no doubt, but you can't do one without the other.  I think we all know that.</p><p>COOPER:  That's where we get back to the whole nibbling around the edges thing again.  It's -- yeah...</p><p>EARNEST:  President Obama wrote an op-ed in January of 2016 basically suggesting that Democrats, if they care about this issue, need to be single issue voters in the same way that NRA supporters are.  And I think that really is going to the question in this Connor Lamb race, right.  Are we willing to give up a golden opportunity to enhance our chances in the midterm elections by voting against somebody who says they support assault weapons ban.  That's a question that Pennsylvania voters are going to have ask themselves.</p><p>TODD:  We will leave that there.  Interesting way to leave the panel.</p><p>When we come back, we're going to hear from a Democrat who is trying to crack down on how the fake news issue spreads online and ramp up congress's role in policing social media.  It's Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.  She's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back.  This weekend we got to see House Democrat's response to Republican charges of misconduct in the FBI's Russian investigation.  The Democrat's newly declassified document defends the FBI's surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and rebuts Republican's highly publicized memo alleging partisan bias at the Justice Department.</p><p>Now part of the reason that initial memo was so hyped, Kremlin-linked bots seeking to discredit the Russia investigation, the automated accounts designed to amplify political One reason why it was so hyped was Russian-linked bots.  It was meant to amplify political divisions, sprang into action on social media, calling for that memo's release.  And of course they've also gotten involved in this gun debate as well, whether trying to create fake news or amplify fake news.</p><p>Joining me now is Democrat Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.  She's interested in a bipartisan bill aimed at trying to police social media, at least on the advertising frong.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, welcome back to Meet the Press.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D) MINNESOTA:  Thanks.  It's great to be on, Chuck.</p><p>All right, let me start with this larger issue here of policing social media.  I know your bill, and it's an attempt to make digital ads part of the campaign finance laws that we have here, that they be regulated just the same.  But can your -- would your bill been able to regulate YouTube and keeping them from spreading this idea that one of the students was an actor, for instance, when it came to the gun activism?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  There's several fronts that we should operating on here, Chuck.  I mean, first of all, the thought of these innocent kids, they get no NRA money.  They're just out there telling the truth about what happened, leading to what I hope is going to be a seminal moment in our country, where we finally get congress to act on some sensible gun legislation.  They're out there doing that.  And at the same time, you have websites linked to Russia that are immediately within hours putting</p><p>out fake things through bots, saying these kids are paid actors, things that are totally false.  </p><p>OK, one, come on, administration, put those sanctions in place.  They went through 98-2 against Russia for this very reason that they were messing around in our American elections.  Secondly, on the bot front, separate from my legislation, these are the most sophisticated companies in America.  They have brilliant people working there.  I believe that they've got to put more resources -- maybe it means they make less profits off of ads and other things, but they have got to put the resources into Facebook and Twitter to stop these bots from dominating the accounts.  There are literally tens of millions of these accounts out there right now on people's pages.</p><p>And the third things is...</p><p>TODD:  How do you incentivize -- oh, go ahead.  Finish your third point, sorry.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  No, no.  It's just how do you incentivize it?  Public pressure.  Congress holding hearings.  Pushing them and pushing them.  People realizing that these are fake people, which I'm sure...</p><p>TODD:  Should they be fined?  You know, in a super fund disaster, should Facebook and Twitter face fines if they fail to purge itself of bots, for instance, after the government finds out?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I think that would be a great idea, but then you need a congress to act.  And there are too many people that are afraid of doing something about this, because we know these sites are popular.  Everyone loves putting recipes, cat videos, it's a great thing.  But at the same time, there's an ugly side of this, and someone once said that there systems were set up without alarms, without </p><p>locks, and big surprise, bad guys are coming in and manipulating people, and that is what's happening and worse, literally committing crimes when they tell people they can text in and vote.</p><p>And the last thing we know is that Russian rubles were spent on ads, coming out of this latest indictment that the Russians spent a lot of money on paid ads.  That's much simpler to regulate, Chuck.  You know why?  TV, your station right now, has rules in place, so does radio and print.  Do the same thing.  They have got to have disclaimers on issue ads and on candidate ads, and they have to disclose them so the press and the other candidates can look at these ads and figure out where they are coming from, what they mean.</p><p>TODD:  I want to move, specifically to the gun issue, because you represent a diverse state when it comes to the gun issue, both with some rural areas.  I think of the Iron Range.  And I can only imagine their mindset when it comes to some of these gun laws, versus those in Minneapolis.  It's going to be a different story.</p><p>As a leader in the Democratic Party, how do you strike this balance.  You know, we were just talking about it in the panel before.  How do you strike this balance where, some of your colleagues, like right next door, Heidi Heitkamp is never going to be able to vote for an assault weapons ban.  But there is some base Democrats who think that's an outrageous decision.  What do you say to the base?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I was up on Iron Range two days ago.  And I was actually quite surprised when your host there and your guests talk about tipping points, that's where we are.  I had a number of proud gun owners, we have a hunting culture here, and I always look at every bill that comes before us, and I think would this have hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand?  And what these hunters were telling me the last few days, is that they are ready to do some background checks.   They asked me why the bump stock bill hadn't passed.  </p><p>They understand, as law abiding gun owners, that we need to make changes.  </p><p>And I think these students are going to lead the way.  And we're going to finally see some action.  And when I had those Sandy Hook parents in my office and they told their stories, and you think about the courage they had to come forward on the simple background check bill, and then congress didn't have the courage to pass it, I don't think you're going to see that happen again.  I want to see Senator Toomey's bill come up for a vote.  I'd like to see an assault weapon ban come up for a vote, and I would also like to see the work we need to do on domestic violence.</p><p>TODD:  You're on Judiciary committee.  There's been a lot of law enforcement errors that have </p><p>been discovered in the shooting itself, particularly whether it's the FBI.  What kind of concerns do you have about the FBI's misses here.  And what do you attribute it to?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I would like to get all the details on this, because I think someone clearly made a major, tragic mistake in not reporting that to the Miami field office.  And the FBI director has specifically come out and said it was a major mistake.</p><p>In addition to that, you have an armed sheriff's deputy outside of the school, didn't go in, has now left that department.  </p><p>But you literally had 23 reports about this particular killer to law enforcement over the years.  So they clearly had -- it's not just FBI, it's also what was going on on the local level.</p><p>TODD:  Well, do you attribute anything -- has the FBI got -- the FBI has taken a lot of heat </p><p>lately on a lot of ways.  Is this well deserved?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  It sounds like this was something that has to have a major change in terms of how they do their operations, if something was reported to a call center and then didn't go to the field office to be checked out, that's a mistake.  But again, 23 reports to local law enforcement as well.  So they have some issues here, but that doesn't take away from the fact that if you want to stop these mass shootings like we have seen in other countries, whether they are in a church, whether they are in a concert venue, an outdoor concert venue in Las Vegas, you've got to start admitting, as so many gun </p><p>owners in my state are starting to do, that we can to some changes without hurting hunting and includes </p><p>background checks, assault weapons bans and some of things we're talking about.</p><p>TODD:  Senator Klobuchar, I have to leave it there.  I appreciate it.  Thanks for coming on and sharing your views.  Always good to talk with you.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  Go Olympics.  We're proud of our Minnesota olympics, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  Quite a bit.  We need Minnesota to do well.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  ...Curley team.</p><p>TODD:  There you go.  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  They have done very well.  Thank you.</p><p>TODD:  When we come back, it's not just foreign adversaries using social media to sew division, how the big tech companies are causing some big problems.</p><p>But, first, we're remembering the man considered by many to be America's pastor.  The Reverend Billy Graham died this week at the age of 99.  He was a counselor and unofficial spiritual adviser to a dozen presidents, every one of them -- Truman to Obama -- prayed with Reverend Graham.  Graham will become the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Capitol rotunda this week.  His mission took him all over the world, including to Meet the Press four times.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILLY  GRAHAM, PASTOR:  We have the message, but how to communicate it to the masses?  And we have used television and radio and the press in every way we possibly can to communicate the fact that Christ can transform human life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back.  Data Download time.  We talk a lot about the forces that divide us in American politics increasingly.  Those forces are getting a big assist from the big four tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook.  These companies dictate how we get online, how we find </p><p>information and how we shop and how we find information and how we share it with our communities.  And they're bigger and worth more than ever.</p><p>A recent piece in Esquire magazine caught my eye.  Check out these numbers, they're astounding, in terms of sheer market value, Amazon is now worth more than the 15 most well known retail companies combined.  Look at that list of companies, folks, from Walmart to Nordstroms and everyone in between.</p><p>To match the combined value of Google and Facebook, you could take the value of the world's top five advertising firms, add the five major media companies and the five major communications companies, and that still doesn't equal those firm's total value.  We're talking Comcast, Disney, all of us.    </p><p>It's all that surprising they're worth a lot in dollars, but it's the influence they have over our day to day lives that's more mind-boggaling.  Two-thirds of U.S. adults have Facebook accounts, almost half of whom get their news there.</p><p>And of the top five apps used most across the globe, Facebook makes and its other platforms make up four out of the five.</p><p>So, what you say, right?  These companies are curating what you see, what you buy and what you read based on what you believe.  And blue America, your Facebook newsfeed is dominated by liberal voices -- the Daily Show, Bernie Sanders, Media Matters, and the ACLU.  In Red America, your feed shows the opposite: Breitbart News, the Conservative Post, Rush Limbaugh, and the anti-abortion rights Life News.com.  In the end, creating completely different cultural bubbles for Americans to live, work, and vote in.  That's what we've created here.  Which is why the big four are finally attracting the attention, and the ire, of lawmakers on the left and right.</p><p>When we come back, Endgame, more twists and turns in the special counsel's investigation.  And it's clearly getting a lot closer to the White House.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Back now with Endgame.  And if you're struggling to keep up with all the charges, indictments and plea deals coming out of the special counsel's office, you're not alone.  In the nine months since Robert Mueller was appointed to oversee the investigation, he's issued more than 100 criminal charges against three companies and 19 individuals, including a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin, who by the way, had owned -- also appears orchestrated an attack on U.S. troops in Syria using a private mercenary force, oh by the way.  </p><p>Helene, we also had the Democratic -- I know.  </p><p>COOPER:  I love that you actually managed to do that connection and get that in there.</p><p>TODD:  It's a stunning reminder of what Russia's doing to the United States.</p><p>But let me start with the larger picture here.  The president last night, the Democratic memo comes out, and he takes to Twitter and then takes a phoner with Judge Jeanine, Mueller's indictments </p><p>are coming and Mueller's indictments are coming.  The president is acting in an interesting way.</p><p>COOPER:  But he's acting in a very consistent way, which is always despite -- no matter what comes out of Mueller's office about what -- you know, just about the scope and the depth of this Russia -- of what Russia tried to do, President Trump's reaction is again, and again and again me, me, me, me, no collusion, look no collusion.  It's not about whether, you know, Russia completely subverted the American democratic process or about all of the other things that they have done.  In fact, including the Syria -- having Russian mercenaries attacking American troops and American-backed troops in Syria, you're not hearing the administration say anything at all about that, what you're hearing -- what you're hearing President Trump say, no, so far no phone calls, no collusion.</p><p>TODD:  Danny, I mean, that's the thing, some of his actions when it comes to Russia and Putin, including not calling out the fact that Russians attacked American troops.  Hard stop.  Russians attacked American troops, he hasn't said a word.</p><p>PLEKTA:  Inexplicable.  Look, the problem for the president of the United States is the one </p><p>that we identify every single time, Donald Trump is about Donald Trump, and not only that, but I think he takes it further.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.  So if people are saying bad things about them and trying to tie them back to me, I am not going to say anything.  It is -- it is inexplicable.</p><p>The -- one of the main reasons we talk about the Mueller investigation and Donald Trump is because Donald Trump keeps tying them together.  Mueller has not tied the president and collusion and his campaign to Russia, what he has done has not even touched that for the most part.</p><p>TODD:  Not yet.  We don't know.</p><p>PLETKA:  But Donald Trump keeps saying, it's not me. Don't look at me.</p><p>TODD: But it's a me thinks you doth protest too much.</p><p>BRODY:  But that was the reason, in essence, for the special counsel investigation.  </p><p>Look, the report from the heartland is these words, and maybe they're not the most intellectual words, but blah, blah, blah.  I mean, really, this is what folks in the heartland.  They're thinking about the gun debate.  You know, they're thinking about tax cuts.  They're just not -- look...</p><p>TODD:  What does that matter right now?  Does that matter to the investigation?</p><p>BRODY:  Well, no, my point simply is how it's playing politically.  And I'm just telling you that when you hear bank fraud and Ukraine and Paul Manafort and you put all up those statistics, I'm telling you how it plays in Peoria, they're just saying forget about it.  I mean, to the point where this is why Trump goes and talks about no collusion because look at those statistics you put, where is any of this?  And that's what he's saying.  I mean, who knws, maybe they want to see if he's got Russian dressing on his salad tonight.  I don't know.  But they're trying to figure this out somehow.  And they're not doing it so far.</p><p>TODD:  Huh.  What is your take on he Mueller probe?</p><p>EARNEST:  The challenge that president Trump faces is he is not someone who is not good at playing the long game.  He is constantly figuring out how tactically I can get myself through the news cycle and that's why he called Judge Janine Pirro on the same day that the Democratic memo was released.</p><p>But this is the -- where the sort of the thinking of that breaks down.  Yes, it is taking a while for </p><p>Mueller to conduct his investigation.  At some point, though, he will have something to reveal.  And that will be the question.  And that will be -- I think that's the more interesting question, the political </p><p>resonance of the ongoing investigation, I think to your point is accurate.  I don't think there's a lot on.  But once it concludes, once Mueller shows the goods, then how do the politics shift on this.</p><p>And I think that there will be -- once there is some substance for us to consider, I think that there will be some political consequences to consider as well.</p><p>TODD:  Well, and it just goes back to the lack of action.  That's what you don't understand.  You had internet company, we know what Mueller has found out is enough to punish Russia, at this point. We know enough to punish them and we haven't. </p><p>COOPER:  Absolutely, and no we haven't.  We haven't even instigated -- we haven't even put into -- the White House hasn't put in place the sanctions that congress has already voted in against...</p><p>PLETKA: Hang on just one second -- I'm sorry -- you know, I wrote a lot of sanctions legislation.  I have to say about this administration, president, weird, Russia, except.  But the notion that this administration has not moved on the legislation passed by congress on Russia is just simply false.</p><p>TODD:  No, they've moved.  It was the speed with which they...</p><p>PLETKA: No, again, I have looked at Iran sanctions.  I've looked at missile sanctions, nuclear sanctions, I have never seen an administration move so fast as they did.  This oligarchs list, other lists  that they have put together, in fact they have.  This is a process.  And I don't want to defend the Trump </p><p>administration where they don't deserve it, but in this case they've done a lot. </p><p>EARNEST:  One of the things I think is interesting about this discussion about sanctions is that so much of the criticism that the Obama administration got in dealing with Russia, whether that was countering them on Crimea, countering their interference in Ukraine, or even countering their interference in the elections was that, well, the Obama administration is not doing anything tough, they're just putting in place sanctions.</p><p>The truth is what we know now is that the Russians have spent a lot of time and energy working </p><p>with the Trump administration to try to get those sanctions rolled back.  So, here in the United States they may not be a big deal, but Russia obviously thinks those sanctions are big.</p><p>TODD:  All right, I'm going to pause to end the conversation, you guys can keep yelling at each </p><p>other if you want.</p><p>But  before we go, a big shoutout, collective shoutout, both to the U.S. women's hockey team and the U.S. men's curling team, on their gold medal, one a first ever.  So, take that, Sweden.</p><p>That's all for today.  We'll be back next week.  Because, if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.</p><p>END </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-577029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRG-X791-JBSW-7005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Can Facebook protect our information and its reputation?  </p><p>Joining me for insight and analysis are Hugh Hewitt, host on the Salem Radio Network, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Kasie Hunt, Robert Costa, moderator of \"Washington Week\" on PBS, and Heather McGhee, president of the liberal group Demos.  </p><p>Welcome to Sunday.  It's MEET THE PRESS.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history.  This is MEET THE PRESS WITH CHUCK TODD.</p><p>TODD:  Good Sunday morning.  </p><p>Five and a half weeks after 17 people were murdered in that mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, hundreds of thousands of people led and inspired by students, marched in more than 800 cities and towns around the country and the world against gun violence.  Now, we've seen marches for civil rights, for women, for the Tea Party.</p><p>But this is a first on the issue of guns.  The largest of the gatherings was right here in Washington D.C., where students from Marjory Stoneman High School issued a challenge to members of Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DELANEY TARR, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  They know that if there is no assault weapons ban passed, then we will vote them out.  They know that if there is no tightening of the background checks, we will vote them out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  We're going to have much more on the debate over guns in America later, when we bring you my discussions with seven people in Madison, Wisconsin, gun owners and opponents, on how to prevent gun violence while still respecting and abiding by the Second Amendment.  It's all part of the NBC News series \"SOLUTIONS: GUN VIOLENCE\".  </p><p>But we're going to begin this show with a president who increasingly seems to embrace crisis, chaos, and confrontation as his White House management style.</p><p>In just the last two-plus weeks, President Trump has added or promoted four men to his team, all of whom the president considers to be fighters, replacing people who told him things he didn't want to hear.  And Mr. Trump is gearing up for many fights, against China on trade, against North Korea and its nuclear program, against Iran and the nuclear deal struck by President Obama and U.S. allies, against Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation, and against Stormy Daniels and her claim of a sexual affair.</p><p>To some Americans, President Trump's staff changes and legal changes mean the world just got a lot more dangerous.  To others, he just did what was necessary to get tough with his and the country's adversaries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  Mr. Trump is reveling in the chaos he creates and testing his limits.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You're fired.  Get the hell out of here.  I made a lot of money with that phrase.</p><p>TODD:  This week, the president continued to dismiss advisors who would put up guard rails on Iran and North Korea, on trade, and on his own legal defense, replacing them with a combative, cable-news-ready team eager to say yes to his first instincts.  </p><p>On Thursday morning, the president's chief lawyer handling the Mueller probe, John Dowd, resigned.  After Mr. Trump made it clear he was bringing in a more aggressive attorney, a frequent commentator on Fox News, Joe DiGenova, who has pushed this conspiracy theory on television.</p><p>DIGENOVA:  Make no mistake about it: a group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely-created crime.</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  I think President Trump's going to war.  I think it's very obvious he's going to go to war on this.</p><p>TODD:  The president suggested that at least for now, he plans to ignore Dowd's advice against sitting down with the special counsel.</p><p>REPORTER:  Would you still like to testify to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, sir?</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>REPORTER:  You would?</p><p>TRUMP:  I would like to.</p><p>TODD:  By Thursday evening, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster was out.  Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton was in, hearing of the announcement appropriately enough while on TV.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  I think I still am a Fox News contributor.</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST:  No, you're not, apparently.</p><p>BOLTON:  I didn't really expect that announcement.</p><p>TODD:  Bolton is an advocate of regime change in Iran and North Korea, recently calling a preemptive strike in North Korea \"perfectly legitimate.\"</p><p>BOLTON:  I think that their history over decades is that they, like Iran, like others, use negotiations to buy time to conceal their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile activities.</p><p>TODD:  And he continues to defend his support of the Iraq War, which the president campaigned against.</p><p>TRUMP:  The war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, all right?</p><p>TODD:  But the president has long been enamored with TV-friendly advisors.</p><p>Who do you talk to for military advice right now?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I watch the shows.  I mean, I like Bolton.  I think he's, you know, a tough cookie, knows what he's talking about.</p><p>TODD:  Mr. Trump's shifting moods and willingness to be guided by Fox News and other conservative commentators is creating confusion inside the White House.  </p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump's top aides declared victory on the congressional spending bill.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT &amp;amp; BUDGET:  Is the President going to sign the bill?  The answer is yes.</p><p>TODD:  But on Friday morning, the president tweeted that his answer might be no, threatening a veto after many on Fox News tore the bill apart.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  This is not what the president promised.</p><p>TODD:  Then the president held an event to announce that actually, he was signing the bill anyway.</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO HOST:  I'm feeling like I just saw Donald Trump get on the escalator and go back up.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  Well, joining me now from Manchester, New Hampshire, is President Trump's first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.  And you, of course, wrote -- co-authored a book that said, let Trump Be Trump.  </p><p>So, we figured, why not talk to Mr. Lewandowski about this.  Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, sir.</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Thank you, Chuck.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>TODD:  So, what does the reshuffling underway at the White House -- how -- you know this man very well, you spent over a year traveling the country with him.  What's he up to?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, what this is is the president again continuing to follow through on the promises that he made on the campaign trail which is putting America first.  And when he brings in new individuals, he takes information from all of the people around him and then listens to those positions and then he makes the final decision.  </p><p>But what you have to have inside the building are people who are on the president's agenda.  Whether that means this president is implementing steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  if you're not on that agenda, you might not want to be in the building.  If this means that we're going to ensure that there is no continuation of nuclear weapons in North Korea, then you're going to have to make sure you're in the building, and you're listening and you're part of the president's team.  So, he is bringing people in who are on his team to make sure that his agenda is moving forward.</p><p>TODD:  So, your advice to anybody that disagrees with the president's agenda, \"get out.\"</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  No, no, not at all.  I completely disagree with that.  You can have a disagreement with the president.  He wants to have conversations on all sides.  But when the decision is made, you have to be on the team because the president is the final arbiter.</p><p>TODD:  So, if you disagree with the decision, don't leak, get out, I guess is what you're saying, though?  You're saying, you can disagree with him, but once he makes a decision, you better support it, and if you don't, then you should leave?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, Chuck, what I'm saying here is it's the president's final call.  And, you know, if you're a staff member, you have to be on the president's team, and you can disagree privately, but publicly, it's very problematic.  </p><p>And look, what we saw this week was a leak of a conversation between the president of the United States and Vladimir Putin from someone within the deep state and that is very, very concerning to the American people that that information is being made public.</p><p>TODD:  Leaked from the deep state?  So, an aide to the president might be part of the deep state?  Is that what you believe?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  I absolutely believe that it came from someone within that building.  There are very few people who are aware of the briefing document that the president was provided, and very few people were aware of the actual conversation that took place.  And I think there should be accountability.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this.  Where did Rex Tillerson go wrong?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, look, Rex had a fundamental different philosophy when it came to American relationships abroad, specifically as it relates to the nuclear deal.  He thought it was a good deal.  And the president has said many times it was a bad deal.  </p><p>And the president has said, particularly as it came to North Korea, that he was going to continue to put pressure on North Korea and that finally, the president was willing to sit down with Kim Jong-un, and Rex didn't think that that was the right decision.</p><p>TODD:  Where did H.R. McMaster go wrong?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, I think where H.R. McMaster went wrong is, you know, you've got-- you had a number of generals in the building with H.R. McMaster and General Kelly.  And I think H.R. McMaster was the individual in the building who was advocating for a larger presence in Afghanistan, which the president had talked about during the campaign that he wasn't in favor of.  And more intervention on behalf of the military, and that's not where this president is.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you about John Kelly, because here's what you told me.  You actually were on the show, I think, the week that it was announced that he was going to become the next chief of staff.  Here's what you told me at the time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  I think General Kelly is going to restore order to the staff.  General Kelly is going to bring the type of discipline to the staff to ensure that the leaks are stopped and that the president's agenda is foremost of what takes place in that building.  So, there'll be no more backbiting, there'll be no more stabbing each other in the back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Well, that was July 30th of last year.  How's John Kelly done?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, I think, by and large, General Kelly has done a good job in trying to control those leaks.  You know, what we've seen for an extended period of time -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  What about this week?  I mean, you just railed against --</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, this week--</p><p>TODD:  -- a major, problematic leak.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Oh, Chuck, I agree with you.  And I'm telling you, I think General Kelly, he has publicly said how frustrated he has been.  They're getting to the bottom of it.  And now what you've seen is you've seen the change at the National Security Council.  You've seen a change at National Economic Council.  </p><p>And what I hope both John Bolton and Larry Kudlow bring in is a team which is on the president's agenda.  And if they find individuals who are leaking information, I hope they terminate those people immediately.  You cannot be in the building and be leaking information about this president and expect to be able to keep your job.</p><p>TODD:  You ever counsel the president to fire John Kelly?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  No, I never have.</p><p>TODD:  Do you think he's doing a good job?  There's a lot of people that attribute the idea that you think John Kelly doesn't have the president's best interests at heart.  Where, where are you on him?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  No, look, I, I think -- I've said this very, very publicly and I'll repeat it again and say John Kelly is an American patriot and he has done a fantastic job serving his country.  He has recognized how difficult a job it is to be the chief of staff to the president of the United States.  </p><p>And, and I don't believe it's General Kelly's job to manage the president.  His job is to manage the staff.  And that's what he has been doing.  And that's what he continues to do.  </p><p>We've seen additional staff changes this week with Chris Liddell being named the deputy chief of staff to bring more order.  We've seen an increase in the portfolio of Johnny DeStefano inside the White House, an individual who has enormous respect to both the president and General Kelly.  Those are very important changes.</p><p>TODD:  Steve Bannon suggested this week that if there won't -- if John Kelly leaves, there won't be a replacement, that the president will essentially be his own chief of staff, a little bit -- more, more like he managed the Trump Organization.  Do you concur with that view?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Look, I think that's a, a scenario that could very well play out.  You know, we know that John F. Kennedy didn't have a chief of staff his entire presidency.  He had it for a period of time.  </p><p>Jimmy Carter to a lesser extent, the same thing.  </p><p>But the difference with this president is, he is the decision maker and he loves to have all the information brought to him.  I see him as the hub with a number of spokes coming out.  </p><p>And candidly -- and I'm not advocating for General Kelly to leave, I think he should stay.  But if he were to go, I don't think there is one person who is the chosen one to step in and fill that role.  So I could see a scenario where the president is giving instructions to a small, core group of individuals who are then implementing on his behalf.</p><p>TODD:  And you think at the end of the day that's what the president would prefer?  That that's a -- that's a more comfortable way that he likes to run things?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  I do think the president likes to opportunity to get input from as many people as possible, and that small group, call it four, five, six people, who can come in and report directly to the president and then go implement his agenda, is something that he's very comfortable with over his 40 years of business experience doing that.</p><p>TODD:  Have you met with the special counsel Robert Mueller?  I know you've testified before the Senate and the House Intel investigations.  What about the special counsel?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Look, I have said very candidly, I'll be happy to speak with the special counsel if they'd like to do that.  I've been very open about -- I volunteered to testify for 12 hours in front of the House Committee.  I've testified in front of the Senate Committee and I'll make myself available, because I was there at the very beginning of the campaign.  There was no collusion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  Have they asked for you yet though?  Have they asked for you?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Not yet.  No.  No, they haven't yet, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  You've not been subpoenaed?  Nothing?  OK.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  I have -- nope.  I have not been subpoenaed.  And, look, there's no reason to subpoena me because I'm willing to volunteer if they want to ask me questions.  I'll be happy to answer their questions because I have nothing to hide and I was there from the beginning, so I know there was no collusion.</p><p>TODD:  Yes, but you weren't there at the end, at the end of the day.  Are you confident--</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  No, that's exactly right.  I wasn't there at the end.</p><p>TODD:  Are you confident -- are you confident that between June 21st, 2016, after -- you left on June 20th -- that there is no collusion took place on that campaign?  Can you definitively say that?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Look, I can say that during my tenure, Chuck, which is all I can speak to, I saw no Russians.</p><p>TODD:  It's your tenure.  So you can't speak to anything after June 20th, 2016?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Well, I wasn't there.  And, you know, what Paul Manafort did or others may or may not have done, I wouldn't have any access to that information.  But what I have said was, if anybody did collude with the Russians in any way, shape, or form to impact the election, they should go to jail for the rest of their lives.</p><p>TODD:  Did you know when Cambridge Analytica was pitching you, and I know you -- it wasn't until very late that you finally approved a contract, I believe, did you know that Steve Bannon --</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  No, no I never -- Chuck, I never approved, I never approved Cambridge Analytica's contract.  They did not work for the campaign when I was the manager.  So we have to be clear about that.  </p><p>They pitched me three times, three times I said no.  They did not come to the campaign until after I left.</p><p>TODD:  Were you aware if Steve Bannon was a founding executive of Cambridge Analytica when you met with them three times?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  I knew that Steve had a role in the organization.  I didn't know what his ultimate role was.  But that didn't impact my decision because I didn't hire them.  They came to me three times, looking to be a vendor, and I said no all three times.</p><p>TODD:  But you didn't know he was a founding executive?  You didn't know he owned a piece?  You didn't know any of those things at the time when he was chairman of \"Breitbart News\"?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Correct.  I did not know that that was his role in Cambridge Analytica.  Correct.</p><p>TODD:  All right.  Corey Lewandowski, I'm going to leave it there.  Corey, thanks very much.  Appreciate you coming on and sharing your views, sir.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI:  Thank you.</p><p>TODD:  Joining me now is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, it's Mark Warner of Virginia.  </p><p>Senator Warner, welcome back to the show, sir.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  Thank you.</p><p>TODD:  I want to start first with all of the changes that we've seen take place.  And I want to put up a quote from Charlie Dent, a retiring Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania, more center-right than conservative-right, but he said this: The spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle.  Disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, and tempered statements are not conservative virtues, in my opinion.</p><p>This was Charlie Dent reacting to all of the changes this week.  What do you make of the changes?</p><p>WARNER:  I think he's right.  This chaos is not the way you run an organization.  I was a business executive for 20 years.  I ran a state.  It was called the best-managed state in the nation when I was governor of Virginia.  </p><p>But with this president, I think he thrives on chaos.  Maybe that's the way to run a reality TV show.  It's not the way to run the greatest country in the world.</p><p>TODD:  At the end of the day, should it-- there's a lot of folks not happy with the instability.  But he's comfortable with it.  Should that matter?</p><p>WARNER:  Well, I think at the end of the day, when he took the oath of office, it was to protect and defend the Constitution and our country.  </p><p>I think we are more vulnerable by having, you know, taking out and not consulting with our allies.  I think we are more vulnerable when you've got a president that wakes up every morning and even his closest advisors don't know what he's going to say or do.  I think we are more vulnerable when the president of the United States calls Vladimir Putin and, John McCain's words, not mine, congratulates a dictator on a sham election.</p><p>I don't think that makes our country safer.  And frankly, when the president of the United States, who still refuses to acknowledge Russian intervention, on that call, doesn't raise election security or doesn't stand up for our closest allies in the U.K.--  </p><p>TODD:  Why do you think he's doing that?</p><p>WARNER:  You know, Chuck, I gave up --</p><p>TODD:  You've looked at a lot of evidence.</p><p>WARNER:  I gave up predicting this president a long time ago.  I do know this, that when the president doesn't act, others do have to act.  </p><p>For example, election security.  The Russians hacked into our elections, they scanned or broke into 21 states, every one of the president's top security advisors have said they'll be back.  Yet, they received no direction from the White House to make election security a top priority.</p><p>TODD:  So, do you believe --</p><p>WARNER:  So, this week, this week bipartisan, our committee came out with, you know -- let's make sure we've got paper trail on every election, let's make sure we help states better information sharing.</p><p>So, if the president's not going to act to protect the country, in this case, Congress is actually stepping up.</p><p>TODD:  Do you believe the president's somehow acting as if he's compromised with Putin?</p><p>WARNER:  It is more than bizarre that 14 months into this president's administration, he has failed to ever call out Russia.  He has failed to ever condemn Putin, even after Putin was accused of killing a British individual of a Russian-British individual in the U.K.  There is something just strange about this.  And I think it is one of the reasons why Mueller's investigation has to continue and why our investigation has to continue.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you about Facebook.  Do you think they've been truthful and forthcoming?</p><p>WARNER:  I don't think Facebook has been fully forthcoming.  I called out Facebook back in December of '16.  In the spring of '17, I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica.  Early on, for most of 2017, they blew that off.  They then, during the summer, acknowledged that there was paid advertising.  But more importantly, that there were a number of Russian accounts --</p><p>TODD:  Right</p><p>WARNER:  -- that were fake accounts that spread information, that touched 150 million Americans.</p><p>TODD:  Do you have concern that Cambridge Analytica, founding executive of Steve Bannon, their financial sort of rainmaker are the Mercer family.  If you hire Cambridge Analytica, you've got Mercer money.  And that somehow this -- and then you had Steve Bannon was also the chairman of a news organization, and they're getting Facebook data.</p><p>WARNER:  Hold, Chuck, that's only part of it.</p><p>TODD:  Yes, I mean, are you concerned --</p><p>WARNER:  Their CEO, their CEO --  </p><p>TODD:  -- that all of this is -- was designed almost to create, I don't know, to create something -- to weaponize something that we weren't aware of?  When you throw a media company with this political consulting firm?</p><p>WARNER:  What we saw in 2016 was the broad weaponization of information by Russians and unfortunately using some other tools.  This same firm --</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>WARNER:  -- their recently disgraced CEO reached out to Julian Assange about leaked emails.  This same firm reached out to a Russian oil company, Lukoil, about working on trying to get American election data.  And this firm has a reputation -- it's been in more than 30 countries where it's been using disruptive tactics.  Why would this firm be then used by the Trump campaign, $6 million contract?  And I think there are still a whole host of questions.</p><p>TODD:  Did you know that Steve Bannon was a founding executive until recently?</p><p>WARNER:  I was aware --</p><p>TODD:  Were you aware of this?</p><p>WARNER:  I was aware that there was both from the Mercer family, from other individuals that were Cambridge Analytica had at best a colorful reputation.</p><p>TODD:  No, I understand that.  But did you know that here you had a chairman of a news organization who was, I guess, more of a principal on this?</p><p>WARNER:  There were--</p><p>TODD:  Was that obvious?</p><p>WARNER:  There were reports around.</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>WARNER:  And what bothers me is again, this is a firm that even I think the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, bragged about their value.</p><p>TODD:  Right</p><p>WARNER:  Then after the election, you've seen nothing but the Trump campaign trying to distance themselves.</p><p>TODD:  Right.  I've got to ask you about this Facebook ad today.  This is Mark Zuckerberg's apology.  And I hold it out because if you can find Facebook's logo here, you've got better eyesight than I do.  </p><p>It's very-- this looks like a guy that is uncomfortable with taking responsibility.  This is what he told Kara Swisher.  </p><p>Things like, where is the line on hate speech?  I mean, who chose me to be the person that did that?  I guess I have to because we're here now.  But I'd rather not.</p><p>Does he sound like a CEO that wants to take responsibility for his company's actions?</p><p>WARNER:  Mark Zuckerberg created, in many ways, the whole notion of social media.  It's a great American success story, as is Twitter, Google, a series of other companies.  </p><p>But I think the whole industry has been reluctant to accept the fact that we're seeing the dark underbelly of social media.  How it can be manipulated.  We're still dealing right now with kind of fake posts and fake accounts.</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>WARNER:  Think about the next generation of technology, where they can put somebody else's face on somebody's body, or totally real time misrepresent words that come out of somebody's mouth.  </p><p>This is an area where we have to get our arms around it.  And frankly, Mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify.  He says he will do it if he's the right person.  Well listen, I've got experts on my staff -- </p><p>TODD:  Who's the --</p><p>WARNER:  Yes, I've got experts on my staff.  But you don't want my staff here.  You want me here.  He is the face of Facebook.</p><p>TODD:  You wouldn't go to a voter and say, no, no, no, let me -- </p><p>WARNER:  Yes, let me take my staff.</p><p>TODD:  You wouldn't do that?</p><p>WARNER:  That's not going to cut it.  He needs to come out.  He created this entity --</p><p>TODD:  Yes. </p><p>WARNER:  -- he in fact created this industry, and he needs to come explain to the American public and to policy makers.</p><p>TODD:  But if the FTC finds that they violated their consent decree.  It's a $2 trillion fine minimum if you take the $40,000 for each instance, for each day that they let each instance have around 50 million.  And I do the quick math, $2 trillion.  Should that be the level of fine they should potentially be subject to?</p><p>WARNER:  The FTC has to determine whether they violated the 2011 consent decree.  They'll work through that.  But --</p><p>TODD:  And if they did, should you see maximum penalty?</p><p>WARNER:  I think there will be appropriate penalties.  But I think it raises the bigger question.  All of these social media platform companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content.  I think we have to relook at that.</p><p>TODD:  OK.</p><p>WARNER:  I think in many ways, some media companies.  I think we have to relook at the fact that if you move from one company to another, maybe you should be able to move all your data.  </p><p>There are solutions and what I invite Mr. Zuckerberg and others is come help work with us.  Congress is not always at the best in terms of cutting-edge technology.  They need to work with us so we try to get it right.  I don't want to out-regulate these companies into oblivion.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>WARNER:  But I do think people need to have the ability to know whether information they're receiving is honest, truthful, or at least originates in this country.</p><p>TODD:  Senator Warner, I have to leave it there, Democrat from Virginia.  Thanks for coming on and sharing your views.  </p><p>I think if you're a social media company, you can drop the word social.  You're a media company.  </p><p>Anyway, thank you sir.  </p><p>When we come back, we're going to break down the flurry of changes in the Trump administration and what they mean with the panel.  </p><p>And later, as hundreds of thousands around the world joined the March for Our Lives, we talked to a group of voters, gun owners, and gun opponents about what they think can be done to stop gun violence.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Panel is here.  </p><p>Hugh Hewitt, host on the Salem Radio Network and of \"Hugh Hewitt\" on MSNBC, Heather McGee, president of the liberal group Demos, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent, Kasie Hunt, host of \"Kasie DC\" on MSNBC, and Robert Costa, moderator of \"Washington Week\" on PBS.  </p><p>Welcome all.</p><p>I'm going to give you two takes on John Bolton, both from conservatives.  One's David French and one's George Will.  </p><p>George Will writes this: Because John Bolton is five things President Trump is not -- intelligent, educated, principled, articulate and experienced -- and because of Bolton's West Wing proximity to a president responsive to the most recent thought he has heard emanating from cable television or an employee, Bolton will soon be the second-most dangerous American.</p><p>Then, there's David French: A nuclear-armed Iran is far more dangerous than John Bolton.  A North Korea capable of incinerating American cities is far more dangerous than John Bolton.  The foreign-policy debate is frequently between hawks and doves, and in the last administration, the doves repeatedly failed.  It's time to give a hawk a chance.</p><p>Kasie Hunt, John Bolton, everybody has an opinion.</p><p>KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT:  Everybody does have an opinion.  And I think that this is -- you combine this choice.  And what you may think about John Bolton the man and his history with this president's chaotic management style, and you have a lot of people who maybe even might be willing to say, OK, let's give John Bolton a chance, really worried about the impact that he might have inside the administration.</p><p>TODD:  Bob, Bolton doesn't see eye to eye on the president with so many other issues, including the Iraq War.  But they do see eye to eye on one -- ripping up the Iran deal.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Ripping up the Iran deal and talking to White House officials over the last few days, they say Bolton's going to be an ally of Mike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state.  That they're going to be a partnership inside of this administration, trying to nudge the president forward.</p><p>It's not so much an ideological case they're making, it's a personality mesh with the president.  He never got along with General McMaster, he's become -- General Kelly's influence has faded a bit inside of the West Wing.  Pompeo, Bolton, Kudlow, the TV personalities, the hard-charging types.  They're the ones now who the president wants at his side.</p><p>TODD:  All right.  I have a feeling the two of you are going to have two very different takes on Bolton.  I know where Hugh is.  </p><p>Heather, I'll let you go first and go ahead.</p><p>HEATHER MCGHEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  So, there are three things that worry me about John Bolton.  First is that he's an unrepentant cheerleader and architect of the Iraq War who thinks that regime change is better than diplomacy, thinks that's still the case about Iraq, which is pretty insane, given the facts on the ground, and thinks the same about North Korea and Iran.</p><p>Second, he's untrustworthy.  I mean, you-- you were talking to Mark Warner about Cambridge Analytica.  He's currently running a super PAC that is one of Cambridge Analytica's biggest customers.  He ran a think tank in the 1990s that funneled foreign money to Republicans.  I just think there's more to the story of the web of connection you were talking about that involves John Bolton.</p><p>And then third, I'm going to be honest here and maybe it's the spirit of the young people from yesterday, but when I see men around their 70s who did everything they possibly could to avoid going into combat when it was their time, banging the war drum -- myself, many of my friends who have loved ones who actually had to fight in the Iraq War, it's dangerous, it's depressing, and it makes me feel like we don't have people who take seriously.  </p><p>I mean, Donald Trump loves war.  He thinks it's great theater, it's great television.  That is something he shares with John Bolton.  And it's something the American people have no appetite for.</p><p>TODD:  Hugh?</p><p>HUGH HEWITT, HOST, SALEM RADIO NETWORK:  As a Reagan-era conservative, I am very happy with the personnel choices made by the president this week.  What Bob said about Iran and the alliance between Secretary of State-designate Pompeo and incoming National Security Advisor Bolton is correct.  Add to that Jim Mattis, who understands Iran to be the central threat in the Middle East, and has been for the long, long time. </p><p>MCGHEE:  But Mattis is worried about working with Bolton. </p><p>HEWITT:  They might be, but I think with this talent -- Pompeo, Bolton, Kudlow, John Kelly, General Mattis, you have a foreign affairs team to rival Jim Baker, Howard Baker, Colin Powell and George Schultz at the end of the Reagan era.</p><p>I am overjoyed.  John Bolton has prepared for this job his entire life. </p><p>TODD:  I want to ask you, though, about Kelly and Mattis.  Does anybody think both of them will be there in three months?  Costa. </p><p>COSTA:  Based on my reporting, Kelly has had a strained relationship with President Trump.  Three months, some people in the White House say it could be a six months to a year.  He sees it as duty, he's not there for the politics.  He's not there because he has this kind of personal rapport with President Trump.</p><p>General Mattis, he does have concerns, I'm told, as well about John Bolton.  At the same time, the former UN ambassador is someone he believes he can work with on a lot of different issues, even if they don't have a close personal relationship. </p><p>TODD:  I want to bring up the president's tweet this morning because it seemed to be oddly </p><p>defensive on, I guess, his legal team.  And it's sort of like this is what's on his mind this morning.  \"Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case,\" he says.  \"Fame and fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.\"</p><p>Kasie Hunt, what he's referring to on the conflicted is Joe diGenova, his wife, Victoria Tensing, both of whom apparently they want to have joined the team, have some conflict of interest issues that they're trying to change.</p><p>And it's interesting that I think the president I guess is trying to erase doubt that he's having doubts on diGenova, I don't know. </p><p>HUNT:  It seems that way.  I mean, it seems to be a situation where he wants people on his team who are saying things in public that he agrees with.  The clip that you played in the beginning of the show from diGenova saying, look, the president is being set up by the FBI and the DOJ.  That's what the president wants to hear.</p><p>And John Dowd, the lawyer who was fired this week, who we haven't even hardly touched on today, was somebody who was telling him something he didn't want to hear, which was you should not go in and talk to the Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  That would be a bad idea.  </p><p>And, you know, we're seeing kind of across the board all these personnel changes.  That's what's happening if you disagree with the president. </p><p>COSTA:  Real quick, Ted Olson, the white shoe attorney here, veteran Washington lawyer, he said no thanks to President Trump this week.  That was the most revealing moment.  We scooped it at The Washington Post that all these lawyers don't want to come in.  It's not because of conflicts, it's because of the political risk.  They tell you privately it's the political risk of working with this president. </p><p>TODD:  It's tough.</p><p>Heather, is something that Eric Erickson said that makes me think that he is embracing these battles.  This is what he wrote, \"what Trump really cares about is making America great again through great compelling television in which one Donald J. Trump is the star, the hero, and the mythical demigod who overcomes impossible odds to achieve glorious victory.\"</p><p>And it gets at something that I know came up on Hugh's show, it's almost like the president </p><p>is embracing the battle.  Let's go.  And maybe he even isn't afraid of impeachment. </p><p>MCGHEE:  He says he loves conflict, and particularly because that makes good television.  That worries me as someone who is thinking about the actual foreign policy conflicts of that particular sort of entertainment predilection of our president.</p><p>But, yeah, he wants -- he thinks conflict drives us to be talking about him, which it does.  He think conflicts makes people have to choose sides and he thinks his base will always go to him if he's seen as being under siege.  He loves conflict.  The American people are sick of it. </p><p>TODD:  Hugh, you and I had this conversation earlier this week.  And you're of the mindset, you thought, he might actually embrace it. </p><p>HEWITT:  He might love an impeachment process.  It might be season three.  </p><p>But I want to make one point about the changes this week.  The three unhappiest people in </p><p>the world about the arrival of Secretary of State Pompeo are new CIA director, 33 years a covert operator, Gina Haspel, the Bolton appointment, the Larry Kudlow appointment, are named Ayatollah Khomenei, Kim Jung-un and Vladimir Putin, our enemies are the enemies of those men and Gina Haspel. </p><p>TODD:  We will see on Putin, that's for sure there.</p><p>Anyway, panel, you guys are coming back in a few minutes.  We're going to talk about Stormy Daniels and the gun debate.</p><p>But when we come back, how our political parties are coming to represent a lot more than just our politics.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  We are back.  Data ownload time.  We know the two parties are different and that they  represent two different Americas.  But data released by Pew this week shows us that those changes between the parties are actually accelerating and they're growing even further apart.</p><p>In many ways Democrats are moving faster than the changes we're seeing as a country while </p><p>Republicans have overall been slower to keep pace.  So there you go, more polarization.</p><p>Between 1997 and 2017, the country has become a lot more diverse with the white population now at 69 percent, that's a 14-point drop.</p><p>Democrats are outpacing that national average.  Only 59 percent of voters who identify with the Democratic Party are white, while Republicans still struggle on the diversity front.  83 percent of Republicans are white.</p><p>Now, on college education, in 2017 a full third of Americans have college degrees.  That was up eight points from 1997.  Democrats here, too, exceed the national average.  39 percent of Democrats are college educated while Republicans lag behind with just 28 percent of Republicans being college </p><p>educated.</p><p>Now, the country is also a bit less religious overall with nearly a quarter of Americans saying they don't affiliate with any religion, that's a 16-point jump in sort of secularism in the last 20 years. For Democrats, a full third do not affiliate with a religion while that number is much smaller for Republicans, 13 percent.</p><p>Look, this country is also getting older with 50 percent of voters now over the age of 50.  Nere, Democrats actually fall behind on this national trend.  42 percent of their voters are 50 or older.  The GOP, however, has grown older as the country has aged and they have grown older faster.  57 percent of Republicans are over the age of 50.</p><p>In short, Democrats are mostly heading in the same direction as the country as a whole.  That's why Democrats are so bullish on the future, and Republicans are so nervous about their future, even as their hold on older voters keeps them competitive in the now.</p><p>And these differences aren't just about bean counting, it makes finding common ground even harder.  And it's why compromise in Washington is so difficult and only growing more so.</p><p>We'll be back in a moment with this question, six months from now, which story will matter more to our politics, Stormy Daniels or yesterday's gun violence demonstrations?  The panel is back to discuss.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Back again with the panel.</p><p>Here's a question, in six months what will have more of an impact on Washington, the Stormy </p><p>Daniels interview on 60 Minutes or the gun march?  And I know that seems on one hand an absurd notion, but on the other hand it's about what has more impact on this town in the next six months.</p><p>I grant you the gun march I think is a long-term movement.  In the next six months, Kasie. </p><p>HUNT:  That's what I would say.  I think that the gun march and the degree of engagement from so many people at such a young age and the emotion we saw on display yesterday, I do think that that that is a sea change that is going to catch up with this congress in the longer term. </p><p>TODD:  I do agree. </p><p>HUNT:  On the Stormy Daniels' front, I'm not sure we can answer the question yet on that, but clearly this is something that has gotten to the president.  He is responding to what she is doing in a way that is completely different than how he was responding to everything else, in a way that suggests  that there is something very serious and significant there.  I think we'll learn a lot tonight when we hear from her publicly for the first time.</p><p>But on the flip side, there's a question about does any of it matter anymore?</p><p>TODD:  I don't know either.  But Jonah Goldberg had an interesting thesis about this.  And this is what he wrote, Bob.</p><p>No one during the Republican primaries, no one wanted to attack Trump because they knew he'd counterattack viciously and, again, shamelessly.  It's much like the old adage about not wrestling with pigs: you'll get dirty and pig likes it.  Trump uses the decency of others against them.  Think Marco Rubio.</p><p>That's what's so fascinating about Stormy Daniels.  What on earth can Donanld Trump say about the star of Breast Friends 2 and Finally Legal 7?  How can he embarrass her?  That this is what she has Kryptonite with Trump.</p><p>COSTA:  I don't know how he engages here.  What's been interesting, as a reporter is that he has not engaged in any kind of back and forth with Ms. Daniels in recent weeks.  He has been relatively quiet for a president for whom relative quiet is not usually a tactic.</p><p>What we're seeing, though, with this gun march, and I walked around with my notepad yesterday, it was regardless of your politics as a reporter, you're there, it was powerful.  And when I saw all these parents with strollers, young children, teenage students, and I asked  them who are you going to vote for, it was not really a partisan event.  But they were out there marching.  I said are you going to vote this fall?  They said certainly we will.</p><p>And it just -- you felt that something is in the air.  Yes, the president is moving on gun regulations right now with bump stocks, but if the Democrats take over the house or it's a narrow majority for the Republicans, there's this mood out there in the country, and you saw it on the mall, for gun reform. </p><p>TODD:  I want to play a little bit actually of some of these speeches were unbelievable.  We're not going to do them justice, but here's a quick montage of some of the better ones.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMERON KASKY, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Do you think any change is going to come from this?  Look around.  We are the change.</p><p>EMMA GONZALEZ, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  Fight for your lives before it's someone else's job. </p><p>NAOMI WADLER, STUDENT, GEORGE MASON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL:  For far too long these names, these black girls and women, have been just numbers.  I'm here to say never again for those girls too.</p><p>SAM FUENTES, STUDENT, STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL:  So when do we enough is enough?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  You know, Heather, I noted earlier this is really a handful of marches that you remember, that our town remembers -- the civil rights marches of the '60s, the abortion rights marches of the '80s and '90s, Tea Party, Million Man March, I think about those things.  This is right up there. </p><p>MCGHEE:  Absolutely.  And I think it's shocked many people how significant they were. </p><p>TODD:  Count me as one. </p><p>MCGHEE:  Count you as one.  How worldwide they were in places like, you know, South </p><p>Carolina and North Dakota.  Again, something like the women's march, you realize that there are these sort of moral questions that feel like they're dividing lines and galvanizing points for particularly women, people of color and young people who are saying that there is a corruption at the heart of our </p><p>politics right now.</p><p>The fact that money and politics and the way that the NRA is able to put their financial interests</p><p>and their political interests ahead of the lives of children, for young people that is a very, very stark moral issue.  And so what you're seeing here is the moral high ground that I think people in Washington are not used to having debates at that level and that's where the energy is and that's why when they chant \"vote them out,\" if I were a Republican, I'd be very scared. </p><p>TODD:  Hugh, first time where I feel like the gun control movement is prioritizing the issue for  voters in ways that the NRA for years has prioritize gun rights.</p><p>HEWITT:  Activism is addictive.  And they undersold their achievements.  The Florida law is a significant win that Governor Scott.  I agree with Bob, it's a purple issue.</p><p>Chris Coons and Pat Toomey have put together a very important law on closing some gaps in NICS.  So, I think the activism is active and it will keep going.</p><p>But far more important than either of those is your Facebook conversation.  Chris Coons has also suggested a new standing committee in the Senate.  We've got bipartisan support on big tech and data.  We have to get our hands on these media companies, it is the future survival of the country.  And what Senator Warner said, I think these kids will figure out they are not in control of their lives with their social media platforms.</p><p>COSTA:  You heard it in the Warner interview, he was hinting at what's to come.  There is talk among Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, make them like a utility company. </p><p>HEWITT:  A utility. </p><p>COSTA:  At that level of federal regulation. </p><p>HUNT:  And Facebook I think is actually more afraid of Democrats even taking back the House or potentially the Senate even though -- they are.  And there are many people that are running those companies, there's a lot of assumptions that Silicon Valley is full of Democrats, but quite frankly they think they're more likely to get regulated. </p><p>TODD:  Oh, this is populist on the left hand, right. </p><p>Anyway, when we come back, our NBC series solutions, gun violence, a group of voters debate how to reduce gun violence while respecting the Second Amendment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back.  NBC News is kicking off a new continuing series called Solutions.  We're trying to take a look at the ways communities across the country are tackling diverse policy challenges that our polarized climate can't seem to solve.</p><p>This week, timed to yesterday's worldwide demonstrations, we're looking at gun violence.  On Wednesday, I traveled to Madison, Wisconsin, where there's a group called reach out Wisconsin.  They have been bringing people together for a few years now to try to foster dialogue across the political </p><p>divide.  I spoke with three pro-gun Republicans, three Democrats, and one independent, who served </p><p>in the military.  And we began by discussing whether a ban on assault-style weapons would ever be possible under our constitution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVI POST, DEMOCRATIC VOTER:  The issue with the second amendment is what kind of weapons they were talking about.  Military weapons?  I know some people believe that  it's important for ordinary citizens to have whatever weapons the government has because the government may come to get us some day and we want to be able to defend ourselves.</p><p>So I can see a little bit of the logic to that, but I don't really agree with it. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Honestly, this is where I get stuck every single time.  So, the Second Amendment, of course, the right to have a militia for the purpose of promoting a free society, but then it follows thereafter with the right to bear arms shall not be infringed.  It's not the government...</p><p>TODD:  You have to argument over the comma. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's not saying that the government shall provide the right to bear arms, it's a right that's predating the constitution itself and saying that it shall not be infringed for these purposes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think that ordinary citizens ought not have the right to have nuclear weapons or F-35s or M1A1 Abrams tanks and the like.  And, you know, if someone is saying, well, citizens ought to be able to rise up against an oppressive government, an AR-15 isn't going to cut the mustard, buddy.  You need some serious firepower if you want to overthrow your government.</p><p>So we ended up drawing a line.  What strikes me as kind of arbitrary. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  See, I don't have a problem.  I'm very pro-Second Amendment, but I don't have a problem banning the AR-15 because the bullet travels three times as fast, so it does a</p><p>lot more damage to the organs, so I mean, it is a lot more dangerous because of that.</p><p>That being said, when you look at when we did have it banned from 1994 to 2004, yeah, people  stopped killing as much with the AR-15, but they just switched to other guns.  So I mean as a long-term  solution removing AR-15s or stopping them from being sold might affect it, but short-term we need to look at other things.</p><p>TODD:  Someone make the case for owning an AR-15. </p><p>SCOTT GRABINS, REPUBLICAN VOTER:  Generally speaking, an AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle.  And mechanically, it's no different than a hunting rifle.  Pull the trigger, you get one bullet. </p><p>TODD:  Do you think the AR-15 gets a bad name?</p><p>GRABINS:  Yeah.  I think we tend to lump in too many things under that one -- that heading as an assault weapon and it's really -- it's just a semiautomatic rifle. </p><p>BETSY ERICKSON, DEMOCRATIC VOTER:  I don't think that it's just a semiautomatic rifle.  I think that hunting rifles are designed differently.  They're designed to shut bullets actually at higher velocity over a farther distance with the goal of a single shot traveling a long distance to kill an animal.  An AR-15 is designed to kill people.  It's designed to inflict maximum damage at a much closer range and to fire bullets in rapid succession.</p><p>And I do think that they are different in purpose and in construction. </p><p>TODD:  If the whole goal is to find a solution, so what are some solutions. </p><p>ERICKSON:  One thing that we don't know a lot about are the underlying causes, you know, of these shootings.  I think that there's not a lot of research that's been done looking at gun violence as a  public health epidemic.  And I think...</p><p>TODD:  This new bill is supposed to open the door for more research.</p><p>ERICKSON:  And I think that that's absolutely critical.</p><p>CAIRE:  We have enough research.  I mean the problem is, and I'm going to cross the line of race here for a minute.  When white kids are killing each other, it's a problem.  And all of a sudden it becomes a national epidemic and a national issue that we need to spend $100 million in Wisconsin on for safety and security in schools.</p><p>LONG:  Honestly, I think we can all agree that there definitely needs to be more research as to the underlying reason as to why.  Why this is happening in the first place, because we all can see that it is clearly a problem, whether it's the school shooting or individuals.  Maybe more research, maybe some restrictions, whether it be the bullet counts, that's not necessarily regulating the gun itself. </p><p>TODD:  Davi, what have you learned here that's possible?  And what do you see as impossible?</p><p>POST:  I've got three things.  The first is close the gun show loophole, you know.  Make it a little harder for people to get these kinds of weapons.  Crack down, better background checks, especially for semiautomatic weapons.  And the third one I would say is in terms of mental health, I think we need to focus on reaching people who are isolated. </p><p>ZANTON:  I agree that the biggest problem facing our country right now is apathy, that we will talk about it when it's in the news and then we go about our lives.  So we really have to have a change of heart and actually want to look for solutions. </p><p>TODD:  Kaleem, what did you take away?</p><p> CAIRE:  A few things.  One, I think we'll produce a lot of research that will sit on the shelves and take forever to implement.  I think the greatest chance is probably a stronger background check.  It's also confirmed for me that our children are their best lobbyists, that adults aren't good lobbyists for children today.</p><p>But I do think that the opportunity exists.  I mean we've got to be bold.  I would love to see a tax just like we tax cigarettes.  I would love to see a special tax, a big surcharge put on weapons, and that those resources be used to invest in a healthy, productive and responsible society. </p><p>TODD:  Look, Wisconsin is -- I always like being here because there's something about the  citizenry of Wisconsin that makes you guys not want to yell at each other, so I really appreciate that. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  So you can be a Democrat not for gun control and you can be a Republican for it.  That's the point here.  Don't let your party decide.</p><p>You can see a much longer version of this on our website, Meetthepress.com and on the NBC  News app.   And before we go, a quick programming note, it's been 50 years since the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  And tonight on MSNBC, we're going to be taking a look back at how Dr. King, the civil rights movement, and the media change the way we looked at freedom and ourselves.  Please be sure to watch Hope and Fury: MLK, the Movement, and the Media tonight on MSBC at </p><p>9:00 eastern. </p><p>That's all we have for today.  Thanks for watching.  We'll be back because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-577635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYF-XX41-DY7X-Y35H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9167\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Big tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1030997893391/3.5.20%206%20GHz%20VLP%20ex%20parte.pdf\">lobbying hard</url> (PDF) for the ability to use the band for very low power devices deemed important for innovations such as in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). NCTA representscable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications, among others.</p><p>But CTIA, citing the need for more mid-band spectrum for 5G, has been urging the FCC to take a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d to the 6 GHz band that opens the lower portion of the band for unlicensed use, while exploring the idea of repurposing the upper portion of the band for licensed uses. CTIA represents wireless carriers, including AT&amp;T and Verizon. </p><p>RELATED: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/6-ghz-band-pits-ctia-against-apple-google-and-other-tech-behemoths\">6 GHz band pits CTIA against Apple, Google and other tech behemoths</url></p><p>In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1031269902565/031220%2018-295%2017-183%20NCTA%206%20GHz%20ex%20parte%20response%20to%20CTIA.pdf\">March 12 filing</url> (PDF), NCTA said CTIA's approach would delay wireless broadband access to 6 GHz by a decade. It called CTIA's proposal an \u201cill-conceived, last-minute push\u201d that would obstruct the \u201cwell-supported\u201d path toward unlicensed access in the 6 GHz band that also protects incumbent users.</p><p>\u201cThe claim that clearing and auctioning half of the 6 GHz band would be \u2018more consistent with global developments' is entirely at odds with international harmonization efforts at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and with the activities of individual countries and regions that are leading the world in wireless technology,\u201d the organization wrote.</p><p>At a recent ITU Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-10), there was a movement afoot by Huawei and Ericsson to get the 6 GHz band studied for mid-band 5G. But NCTA said there is no international study item for clearing the upper part of the 6 GHz band for licensed use. Instead, the 6 GHz study items at the ITU contemplate licensed users sharing spectrum with existing incumbents, \u201cmuch as 5G NR-U operations would be able to share 6 GHz spectrum under the Commission's proposal to designate the band for unlicensed use.\u201d</p><p>RELATED: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/tech-giants-challenge-at-t-s-assessment-6-ghz-band-for-unlicensed\">Tech giants challenge AT&amp;T's assessment of 6 GHz band for unlicensed use</url></p><p>\u201cWith existing unlicensed spectrum resources approaching exhaustion due to rapidly growing data demands from consumers and businesses across industries, the need for more wireless broadband spectrum is urgent,\u201d wrote NCTA's counsel, Danielle Pi\u00f1eres. \u201cThe Commission has an unprecedented opportunity in the 6 GHz band to quickly put next-generation wireless capabilities to work for American consumers and cannot afford to let it pass. It should not change course now and delay these benefits.\u201d</p><p>With the COVID-19 outbreak forcing more people to work from home, regulators are likely to see increased pressure to release more spectrum for all kinds of purposes, including Wi-Fi.</p><p>During a Senate Financial Services Subcommittee hearing last week, FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said the FCC, in response to COVID-19, should consider expediting waivers and experimental licenses that will expand network capabilities and create additional Wi-Fi capacity by temporarily authorizing use of the 5.9 GHz band.</p><p>NCTA's membership includes cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications as well as the likes of Disney Media, C-SPAN, Fox Networks, Showtime Networks and WarnerMedia. Midco and Federated Wireless also are members.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRCBRO-391356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRCBRO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF9-GN11-DXM4-G508-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Questex Media Group LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FierceWirelessTech</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 16, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Powell, president and CEO NCTA, 'We should reject the fairy tale stories of 'do no evil'.' In an aggressive speech at the Cable Congress in Dublin he called for fairer regulation of the internet - not just focusing on network companies but including the giant tech companies . The power of the new tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google is enormous. They are not competing in the market, 'they are the market', as The Economist wrote. When a competitor shows up, they just buy it. These companies have a market cap of $2.8 trillion, the GDP of France, while enjoying a light regulatory touch. 'We do need to start policing their behaviour, they have become too large and too indipensible not to do anything. Only they can address the issues around election fraud and sexual exploitation, while privacy remains an issue that they will not fix from within. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BBTV1093551520339230014251764100187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBTV-7638</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTB-1CD1-F03R-N4Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"191\"/><timeReceived>12:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Broadband TV News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The topic could not have been more apt than now when there is a renewed commitment by regulators to neutralize the efforts of criminals to undermine consumers of digital financial services (DFS) by exploiting the latter's vulnerabilities in an increasingly digital and data-driven world. There is a Consumer Protection Department at CBN and two consumer desks at the NDIC, which shows a national commitment to provide safety nets to consumers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Digital financial services (DFS) have been defined as financial operations using digital technology, including electronic money, mobile financial services, online financial services, i-teller and branchless banking, whether through a bank or non-bank institutions. It can encompass various monetary transactions such as depositing, withdrawing, sending and receiving money, as well as other financial products and services including payment, credit, saving, pensions and insurance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DFS can also include non-transactional services, such as viewing personal financial information through digital devices. It is only as recently as 2018 that the G20 countries came up with a non-binding policy guidelines on financial consumer protection in the digital age, indicating the fact that regulation in this sector is just emerging.</p><p>The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) is aware of the paucity of regulatory policy initiatives in this sector and is therefore providing a platform for stakeholders in the nation's financial sector to rub minds on how to better the economy and protect the consumer. This is the essence of the Financial Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) workshop, sponsored by Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) annually.</p><p> The 16th edition of NDIC/FICAN workshop was refreshingly intellectual and went a long way in adding value to the general public's financial literacy in the country. The high points of the annual workshop's brilliant discussions around developments in the financial sector focused attention on the protection of the consumer by the financial regulators.</p><p> The MD/CEO of NDIC, Alhaji Umaru Ibrahim, was ably represented at the occasion because of the value he put on promoting financial literacy and his commitment to financial journalism practice. It is not surprising that the MD declared in his opening remarks that \"with the recourse to technology and Fintechs, the entire dynamics of banking has been altered to such an extent that it poses serious challenges for both operators and regulators\".</p><p> He also made it clear that \"it was in recognition of what the future is likely to portend for the banking industry that for this year's workshop is dedicated to providing insight.\" Digital Financial Services (DFS) have both tremendous benefits and equally terrible risks as captured by the study conducted by the G20/OECD in 2018. A few of the benefits include: The digitalisation of finance offers the opportunity to achieve broad-based financial inclusion by extending the availability and penetration of financial services and by reducing the costs of providing financial services to the underserved population as we have seen with mobile banking.</p><p> New financial technologies can help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access alternative funding sources for supporting their cash flow and risk capital needs. DFS are offering more convenient, faster, secure and cheaper transactions.</p><p> This has positive implications in both advanced and emerging economies for businesses and consumers, both established users of financial products and the newly financially included. The latter in particular stand to benefit from a digital environment even in the absence of physical branches or agents provided appropriate security measures and consumer precautions are in place to avoid fraudulent transactions and other risks.</p><p> The digital revolution goes hand-in-hand with new providers entering the market and offering financial services directly to individuals through digital channels can have an impact on the level of competition in the financial market and contribute to lower costs, and offer an improved experience to financial consumers. Examples here include what we are witnessing in Nigeria in the urban transportation sector more digital platforms for moving around using taxis and the popular tricycle is being introduced into the market.</p><p> These are indeed interesting developments that capture one's imagination, courtesy of digital financial revolution unfolding before our eyes. The associated risks are also awesome categorized as follows: Market-driven: this can include misuse of unfamiliar (or new types of) products to uninformed consumers new types of fraud, often taking advantage of consumers' uncertainty in the digital environment a lack of security, privacy and confidentiality of data inappropriate or excessive use of digital profiling to identify potential customers and exclude unwanted groups Regulation and supervision driven: this can encompass uneven levels of protection within (e.</p><p>. inadequate disclosure and redress mechanisms) and across countries (e.</p><p>. variety of providers, cross border selling, regulatory arbitrage) consideration of data protection issues a lack of coordination among authorities for example with respect to new types of digital financial services.</p><p> Consumer-driven: the growing digitalisation of daily life and of financial decisions is not necessarily matched by increasing digital and financial literacy levels. Technology-driven: the increasing use of algorithms, which can affect decisions about credit, insurance or investments and can lead to denied access to certain services or inappropriate charges based on inaccurate or wrong correlations made without human interpretation unreliability of mobile networks and digital finance platforms may lead to inability to carry out transactions, inaccessibility of funds or cybersecurity risks.</p><p> Each of the 5 papers presented did justice to the topic. Let us glance at them briefly.</p><p> Dr. K.</p><p>S.Katata of the Research, Policy and International Relations of the NDIC presented two papers onFintech and Future of Banking and Key Attributes and Bank Failure Resolution Option.</p><p> The former paper surmised that Fintech firms and big tech organizations are capturing more and more of the banking value chain, providing services such as payments, checking and even savings accounts that could erode much of the traditional bank revenues in the foreseeable future. He demonstrated how these new entrants pose a threat to banks by raising service expectations and coming between banks and their customers.</p><p> He also cautioned traditional banks that their response should go far beyond closing branches, improving online and mobile banking offerings or making current products and services \"more digital.\" Instead, he advised banks to move further into the daily lives of customers, providing assistance before, during and after the financial transaction.</p><p> He agreed with the forecast by PwC that to be successful as a Bank in 2030, the bank of the future will need to embrace emerging technology remain flexible to adopt evolving business models, and put customers at the center of every strategy. The second paper discussed the objectives of effective resolution of banks that fell into deep crisis and the various legal frameworks and the tools developed over the years to help minimize risks of bank failures within Nigeria and the international best practices.</p><p> For instance, he listed the key objectives of the efforts to protect depositors to included: minimise adverse effects on banking and financial system stability ensure continuity of basic banking functions minimise reliance on public sector support and protect client funds and assets Abdulhamid Aliyu of the Bank Examination Department of the NDIC presented Emerging Issues in the banking regulation and supervision. He identified six emerging issues of concern to banking regulators as Defaults from traditional income haven of banks, namely oil and gas Derivatives defaults, especially on currency swap Disruptive technology Entry of Big Tech firms like Google, Amazon and Apple into the financial services will post a fin stability risk Cyber-crime and Insufficient expertise in the assessment of IFRS 9 implementation may affect the level of compliance and enforcement.</p><p> The paper went on to give possible mitigating steps as Continue proactive measures to ensure financial system stability Investment in disruptive technology Core investment in the training and re-training of bankers and regulators Regulators will need new laws to enable a level plain field with smaller tech firms and banks and more investment in Cybersecurity. S.</p><p>A. Oluyemi of Communication and Public Affairs Department of the NDIC presented a paper on The Role of Banks in Financial Literacy and Inclusion.</p><p> His paper dwelt on the achievements and challenges of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS). He concluded that enhanced financial literacy is the key to financial inclusion and financial inclusion, consumer protection and financial literacy complement each other.</p><p> The three formed the bedrock of the NFIS. The NFIS is essential to increase financial inclusion and consumers have to gain the knowledge, skills and confidence they need to make good financial decisions and the banking industry is necessary and supportive of the strategy's goals.</p><p> Finally, the paper titled Consumer Protection in the Financial System was delivered by S.K.</p><p> Salam-Alada of the Consumer Protection Department of the CBN. The paper concluded that consumer protection is critical in all that the financial system gamut is out to achieve in guaranteeing the future economic and social well-being of Nigeria through: promoting savings culture and entrepreneurship poverty reduction improved income-facilitating development engendering consumers' confidence addressing socio-economic challenges and ultimately ensuring financial system stability, sustainable economic growth and national development.</p><p> NDIC has come of age, having celebrated its 30 years of existence this year. It has every reason to celebrate its monumental achievements in carrying out its core mandate of minimizing risk through deposit insurance system (DIS) in our financial system.</p><p> Of the 30 years, no doubt the last 10 to 12 years were most illustrious.

A new poll from Pew Research finds that 72% of American adults think social media companies wield too much power and influence over politics.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg     According to a survey conducted last week, just 22% of Americans believe Silicon Valley technocrats hold the 'right amount' of political power, while just 6% believe it's 'not enough.'  Nearly 9 out of 10 'conservative Republicans' (89%) feel social media platforms have too much power vs. </p><p>74% of 'moderate or liberal Republicans,' while liberal Democrats are slightly more likely than moderate or conservative Democrats to agree (68% vs. 60%).    Majorities of both Republicans and Democrats believe social media companies wield too much power, but Republicans are particularly likely to express this view. Roughly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (82%) think these companies have too much power and influence in politics, compared with 63% of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Democrats, on the other hand, are more likely than Republicans to say these companies have about the right amount of power and influence in politics (28% vs. 13%). Small shares in both parties believe these companies do not have enough power. -Pew Research[3]  The results echoed a similar 2018 Center survey[4] which found that Republicans were more likely than Democrats to believe social media platforms censor political content, and are biased towards liberal views.  On July 27, CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google will appear together in front of Congress for the first time to testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, which has spent the last year investigating competition within the tech industry.  Beyond debates about fair business practices, the tech industry has also come under fire in recent months from a host of critics - from President Donald Trump[5] to civil rights advocates[6] and even tech companies' own employees[7].  Amid these concerns, Americans favor more, not less, regulation of major technology companies, according to the Center's recent survey. Some 47% of the public thinks the government should be regulating major technology companies more than they are now, while just 11% think they should be regulated less. About four-in-ten (39%) believe regulation should stay at its current level. -Pew Research[8]    Will lawmakers push for oversight so that Silicon Valley tech platforms stop discriminating along party lines?

Officials declined to say what was contained in the request, but South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg told CNN Business the document is dozens of pages long with many questions.</p><p>The attorneys general of California and Alabama are the only two from all 50 states not yet participating.</p><p>Asked why California has not joined the states pursuing the investigation, a spokesperson for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the state is committed to fighting anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>\"But to protect the integrity of our work, we can't comment --- to confirm or deny any pending or potential investigation,\" the spokesperson said. </p><p>A spokesperson for the Alabama attorney general didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>The investigation significantly raises the risks of regulation for Google, which so far has faced antitrust scrutiny from federal lawmakers and the Justice Department.

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. Some good news out of Nebraska on the right to repair. Right to repair advocates achieved some successes in 2019. The concept made the agenda for 2020 presidential campaigns, endorsed first by Elizabeth Warren and then Bernie Sanders, starting with farm equipment. </p><p>Twenty state legislatures have considered digital right to repair measures - although so fair, none has become state law. There is broader public awareness of the concept, with the New York Times editorial board now in favour. And the EU has adopted a limited right to repair for household appliances, to take effect in April 2021, with Australia, Canada, and South Africa also joining the party. Part of the impetus for these measures is the huge environmental costs of a throwaway culture, particularly for ewaste. But the economics costs are also a major concern, particularly for regulators. Both the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary committee have undertaken initiatives, with the House committee questioning whether Big Tech - e.g., Amazon,Apple, Facebook, and Google - are violating anti-trust laws. Apple, a staunch right to repair opponent, adopted limited concessions in late August, to provide independent repair providers access to Apple parts and repair tools (seeApple Blinks on Right to Repair: Or Does It?[1]) Earlier in 2019, the company played a major role in defeating legislation in California (see Apple to California Legislators: Consumers Will Hurt Themselves if Provided a Right to Repair[2]). For a recap of these and other developments, see US PIRG RIGHT TO REPAIR WRAPS UP A BIG YEAR[3]).Nebraska Right to Repair for Farm Equipment In early December, the Nebraska Farm Bureau voted 176 -1, to support a right to repair, including clear guidelines to prevent diluting future agreements. This policy was to counter what was seen as an earlier capitulation in California, where the California Farm Bureau Federation accepted a half-measure that left dealers with the whip hand over most repairs. According to US PIRG in NEBRASKA FARMERS VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR RIGHT TO REPAIR[4]:Working equipment is mission-critical for farms. If you can't harvest your crop because the equipment you need isn't functioning, you can't earn a living. But modern farm equipment is getting harder and harder to fix because manufacturers such as John Deere won't give farmers or independent mechanics access to what they need[5] to repair the equipment outside of their dealerships. This is especially true of the software locks on the equipment that require access to dealership-only software to fully repair. A documentary by Vice cataloged how farmers have taken to hiring hackers[6]and buying black market software to bypass the software locks so they can keep equipment in the fields.Dealers are fierce opponents of any right to repair, for as Crain's Chicago Business reports in Why Deere and Cat don't want customers to do it themselves[7],: Manufacturers have a strong financial incentive to limit customers' repair options. Making an iPhone hard to fix drives sales of new ones. For Illinois heavy-equipment makers, controlling repairs drives lucrative service work to dealers and boosts sales of parts, a growing portion of manufacturers' revenues. 'From the perspective of [John] Deere, opening up controlled systems or applications on equipment presents nothing but downsides,' says Morningstar analyst Scott Pope.Dealers depend on repair work, which yields profit margins up to five times better than new-equipment sales, Pope says. Right-to-repair laws also threaten parts sales, since Deere generally sells parts to its dealers. Deere brought in $37.36 billion in revenue in 2018, with about $5.8 billion from parts sales. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Christopher Ciolino says Deere's parts sales are growing faster than equipment sales. 'There has been a concerted effort to grow the aftermarket business' among all heavy-equipment makers, Ciolino says. 'Parts and service have very attractive margin profiles that not only add to the bottom line but help mitigate the cyclicality in their business.' Nebraska farmers are now aggressively promoting specific standards according to US PIRG in NEBRASKA FARMERS VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR RIGHT TO REPAIR[8]:The measure adopted by the Nebraska Farm Bureau laid out specific standards for any agreement or legislation:Right to Repair: Nebraska Farm Bureau supports the implementation of comprehensive right to repair legislation OR a negotiated written agreement between ag producers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This legislation or agreement must: 1. Be enforceable. 2. Guarantee farmer/repair technician access to the identical information, parts, and tools that are available to dealerships. These items must be fairly and reasonably priced (taking into account both small and large producers) and be delivered in a timely manner. 3. Include ALL OEM equipment, regardless of age, model, or years in use at the time of the effective date. 4. Differentiate between repair (the restoration of hardware to its original intended function) and illegal 'modding,' (modification of original hardware to bypass environmental controls). 5. Not require any agricultural equipment owner to agree to any contract which removes existing rights. Furthermore, Nebraska Farm Bureau will support or endorse any legislation or agreement that grants agricultural equipment owners/repair shops with the same rights accorded to automobile ...ght truck owners/repair shops. The Nebraska Farm Bureau is currently attempting to negotiate a right to repair deal with dealers and original equipment manufacturers, to incorporate these minimum standards, according to NET in Nebraska Farm Bureau Eager For 'Right To Repair' Agreement In 2020 [9].If a deal is not achieved by this time next year, the Nebraska farmers will opt to pursue mandatory legislation instead. Presidential campaigns provide an opportunity to highlight policies that affect farmers. In 2020, one key issue is the right to repair for farm equipment.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/nebraska-farmers-lead-on-right-to-repair.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/12/nebraska-farmers-lead-on-right-to-repair.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Doomsday scenarios[10], Global warming[11], Guest Post[12], Regulations and regulators[13] on December 30, 2019[14] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[15].

Jerome Powell said that the central bank was \"listening sensitively\" to stock markets after December's sell-off and would be \"patient\" with its interest rate policy.</p><p>4 House prices are rising at their weakest pace in six years after uncertainty created by Brexit talks led to a \"noticeable slowdown\" in December, according to Nationwide. Growth was only 0.5 per cent last month, down from 1.9 per cent in November and the slowest rate since February 2013.</p><p>5 Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines whose low-fare business model changed the aviation industry and was shamelessly aped by Ryanair, has died aged 87.</p><p>6 With Apple struggling to shift its iPhones, Facebook battling a string of scandals and investors chipping away at the valuations of Amazon, Netflix and Google, it feels as though Big Tech is in a rut - yet Microsoft is bucking the trend.</p><p>7 Activity in Britain's dominant services sector picked up in December, but businesses remained downbeat as confidence fell to its second lowest level since the financial crisis, according to a survey of executives.</p><p>8 TSB has failed to publish the first part of a long-awaited report into its calamitous IT meltdown.

I'm Bret Baier in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We begin tonight with a new indication of just how seriously President Trump and his national security team are taking what have been called credible warnings about threats from Iran. We learned about an hour ago the U.S. is sending an additional war ship and Patriot missile battery to the Middle East, adding to the forces already heading that way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has breaking details tonight from the Pentagon. Good evening -- Jennifer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Good evening - - Bret.</p><p>Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has approved the deployment of a Patriot missile battery to the Middle East as the administration tries to ramp up pressure on Iran which it says is prepositioning missiles that could threaten U.S. forces across the Middle East.</p><p>A Patriot battery is an air defense system with roughly 100 missiles. They can shoot down ballistic missiles and aircraft. The Pentagon also announced tonight it's moving an amphibious war ship from Europe, the USS Arlington, which transports U.S. Marines, amphibious vehicles, and rotary aircraft to support amphibious assault or expeditionary warfare missions.</p><p>The Arlington is replacing another U.S. warship in a swap. These military assets will join the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a U.S. Air Force bomber task force.</p><p>In a statement just released by the Pentagon, the Department of Defense continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, the military and proxies, adding the United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend U.S. forces and interests in the region -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Jennifer -- thank you. The breaking details, we'll come back for any more information.</p><p>There is still no deal tonight between the U.S. and China on a new trade policy. President Trump raised the stakes overnight, increasing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. China is promising to retaliate. All this comes as negotiators suspend their talks for at least now aimed at reaching a compromise that could end an escalating trade dispute between the two most powerful economies on the planet.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts has that story from the north lawn. Good evening -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.</p><p>Administration officials tell Fox News that no more talks are currently scheduled between the United States and China, but there is still optimism that a deal can eventually be reached.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: The 11th round of trade talks between the U.S. And China came and went with no hint of an agreement. But President Trump indicating that the talks will continue. The President tweeting, \"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive of conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations into the future will continue.\"</p><p>After China indicated it was taking back some core items of a deal it had already agreed to, President Trump lit a fire under the Chinese leadership. This morning raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent, tariffs the President said may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.</p><p>China's chief negotiator, the Vice Premier Liu He said today's talks went fairly well adding that talks will continue. But he criticized President Trump's use of tariffs to put the squeeze on China.</p><p>LIU HE, CHINESE VICE PREMIER (through translator): China believes raising tariffs in the current situation is not a solution to the problem but harmful to China, to the United States, and to the whole world.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump also upped the ante this morning, tweeting that the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25 percent on the remaining $325 billion in Chinese goods. That would be the largest tranche of tariffs yet, a big stick to wield.</p><p>Support for the President's tariff strategy is mixed. Brian Duncan, a hog farmer in Illinois says he stands to lose a lot from Chinese retaliation.</p><p>BRIAN DUNCAN, HOG FARMER: It prolongs what we hope would be a short, brief trade war into something that now looks indefinite.

Three were fired yesterday. Experts now say two of the same type were launched last Saturday. As they are considered ballistic missiles, Pyongyang could be at the risk of more U.N. sanctions.</p><p>TAKESHI IWAYA, JAPANESE DEFENSE MINISTER: The launch of such ballistic missiles are a clear violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution and we find it regrettable.</p><p>PALKOT: Analysts say after examining the imagery, the missiles are solid fuel ready at a moment's notice, mobile so that you can move around and hidden, low flying so they evade missile defenses.

The numbers are staggering, especially considering the company has lost about $9 billion and could be years away from turning a profit. Susan Li of the FOX Business Network has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: The largest American IPO since Facebook's debut seven years ago, ridesharing giant Uber is now roughly the size as century old General Electric.

We'll get reaction from the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIU HE, CHINESE VICE PREMIER: China believes raising tariffs in the current situation is not a solution to the problem, but harmful to the China, to the United States, and to the world.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL, (D) MICHIGAN: We don't have a level playing field in this country, and we have to have fair trade policy. It's a very complicated issue, but we need to do something about trade policies, because, quite frankly, it's been hurting the American worker.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA: It's painful. It hurts. The only to win a trade war is don't fight it. It's hurting us. It's hurting China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Those talks ended today without a deal, it seems. And so far, no definite time that they are going to continue with China. The president tweeting numerous times today about this, saying that \"We've lost $500 billion a year for many years on crazy trade with China. No more. Tariffs will bring in far more wealth into our country that even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind, also much easier and quicker to do. Our farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source.\" He tweeted a few more times along those lines.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel and start there, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and at the White House on the North Lawn, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters.\" Jeff, I'll start with you there. What is the sense at the White House about these talks?</p><p>JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: That's a good question, Bret. I guess for starters the sense is that we didn't get where we thought we were going to get, at least over a week ago. There were not too long ago the Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, and others were saying that a deal was close, that they were getting towards the final laps. And then there was a big setback a little over a week ago when China pulled back on some of its commitments within the draft agreement, nearly 150 page draft agreement that they've been working on.</p><p>And that, of course, was met with a lot of dissatisfaction by USTR, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and the rest of the team. And so that prompted the president on Sunday to increase tariffs, and now the talks ended today, as you said, without a deal, likely to continue on talks, but along at the same time, likely to have those tariffs continue, which means a longer trade war.</p><p>BAIER: Byron, here's number four and number five tweets today. \"Over the course of the past few days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversation into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed tariffs on China which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.\" So how does this play, and where does this come out? Obviously, farmers and a lot of people are feeling some pain already. Will they feel more, do you think?</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": They very well could. It seems to me that both sides have been feeling each other out and probably is calculating a little bit. And if there has been as much as we thought there was on issues like purchases from the United States, forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, that kind of stuff, if there had been that much progress and the Chinese backed away from it, then they made a bad bet. They miscalculated. And now they've been hit with these tariffs, and they may have to retaliate.</p><p>But it seems to me, how many years have we been hearing about these abuses from China? And Trump has finally taken a very strong position. As you saw Debbie Dingell, we've also heard Charles Schumer, he has some significant Democratic support on this. So it seems to me that he's going to stay where he is.</p><p>BAIER: And Mollie, we should point out, it definitely hurts farmers here, but it hurts China.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Senator Kennedy, earlier, you just had him saying that the only way to win a trade war is not to fight it. And that sort of assumes that you are totally fine with the trade situation as it is currently, that China can have high tariffs, that it can have these barriers to entry in their markets, that it can do intellectual property theft, and there's nothing we can do about it, or at least you can't do the stick approach, that you can only do the carrot approach.</p><p>We have tried the carrot approach for decades. It has not resulted in a better situation in terms of American companies being able to enter the Chinese market, and so the question is, what are you going to do? Now we had been told a year ago when tariffs first started that we were going to see dramatic increases in consumer prices, that this was going to be just horrific for the economy. We are in a very good economy right now. A year later we can look and we can see that in fact consumer prices have not gone up that much. Inflation is holding, GDP is doing well, the job market is great, wages are great for the United States. China is hurting a little bit, so it will be curious, we'll have to see if they are feeling pressure to come back.</p><p>BAIER: I want to turn to Iran, and these latest threats, and some more action on the U.S. part, moving more forces into the region. This is the president yesterday, Thursday, talking about answering questions about Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have information you don't want to know about that were very threatening, and we just want to have -- we have to have great security for this country and a lot of other places.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you risking a military confrontation, sir?</p><p>TRUMP: I guess you could say that mean, right? Isn't it? Always -- I don't want to no, but hopefully that won't happen. We have one of the most powerful ships in the world that's loaded up, and we don't want to have to do anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: The Navy putting out this video of the USS Lincoln, the carrier strike group, making its way through the Suez Canal. This is not usual. The Navy doesn't always put a video of their ships going through the Suez Canal on the way to the Persian Gulf. And now we have more information, ramping up pressure, prepositioning missiles that could threaten U.S. forces across the Middle East, a Patriot missile battery going into the region, as well as another warship. Jeff, it seems like these threats they are trying to deal with directly with the move of forces.</p><p>MASON: That's right. And some of those threats could include threats against oil tankers. That area of the world is where a huge chunk of world's energy, oil and tankers moves to the rest of the world, so that's one thing the United States is wanting to protect there. Iran, by the way, has called these report \"fake intelligence.\"</p><p>BAIER: The U.S. pulled out four Patriot missile batteries late last year, now they are sending one back in, Byron. But the bigger point is that they are showing everyone what they are doing.</p><p>YORK: They are being very, very visible about it. And now today sending more men, more equipment there, it's just a measure of how seriously we take this. Apparently intelligence that there were plans for the Iranians to either attack American forces somewhere in the Middle East or have some sort of drone attack, or there have been all sorts of speculation about what it was. But it's pretty clear we think it's really, really serious.</p><p>BAIER: And also Israel is an ally, and they get threats from Iran all the time. So being in the region, we are there.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Iran is a threatening country and it's always good to have a show of force and remind people of the dangers of going against American interests. I think it's also important that people be a little skeptical of what we are hearing right now. It doesn't seem to be in Iran's interest to launch an attack on the United States. We say that they are moving their missiles around, but it's important to remember that they've had missiles in their country for a long time. And so the provocative nature of some of what we are doing or how we are highlighting it is just kind of curious, particularly given that our sanctions against them are kind of going well. I think the United States needs to remember about being clear what it seeks from Iran and how what we are doing will accomplish that goal.</p><p>BAIER: That's a good point. Jeff, do we really have a sense of U.S. policy toward Iran other than having pulled out of the nuclear deal?</p><p>MASON: That's a big chunk of the U.S. policy. It's one of the things that the president is most proud of, is having reversed that decision made under President Barack Obama and taking the United States out of that. Surely sanctions are part of the policy now and trying to get some U.S. allies who for a long time have been attempting to keep that agreement in place to come along in the same direction that the U.S. under the Trump administration is going.</p><p>BAIER: All right, we'll follow it. Next up, the Friday lightning round.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Biden's kid took down about $3 million to $4 million we can count, and Biden, when the kid got under investigation, actually says --</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money. Well, son of a --</p><p>GIULIANI: I'll leave it out, was corrupt. That prosecutor was right on the tail of his son looking for the money that appeared to have been laundered.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, saying he's looking into this situation with Ukraine, in fact going over there. Let's start there. We're back with the panel. Mollie, what about this, looking at this. Is this on the up and up? What's happening?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: This was an issue several years ago when the son of the vice president joined the board of Burisma, this energy company in Ukraine. Another person, another American joined the board who was a John Kerry bundler, and that was also somewhat contentious. And then apparently there's this other issue of Joe Biden warning off a prosecutor who was looking into things. It was always kind of weird that the son of the vice president was given this plum position and the media didn't seem to be terribly interested in it at the time.</p><p>Ukraine is becoming a much more interesting country to look too. They have already admitted to some light meddling against Donald Trump in the 2016 election. And a lot of players in that Russian hoax go back to Ukraine. So I think we might be seeing more attention paid to that country.</p><p>BAIER: Jeff, what do you think? Is Biden starting to feel the heat from being a frontrunner, not just from Democratic primary contenders, but from the White House?</p><p>MASON: It certainly shows that the White House sees him as the one that they need to attack, and this particular area in Ukraine is the way that they want to go after him. So I think it elevates him on some level, and the president tweeting about him as well suggests that it's not only Biden who is going after the president and trying to ignore the fact that he still has a primary to win, but it's the president going after him as a potential likely opponent.</p><p>BAIER: Byron?</p><p>YORK: The fact is Joe Biden is having a good moment right now.</p><p>BAIER: You look at that Monmouth pull out of New Hampshire?</p><p>YORK: Absolutely. There was a school of thought that said that Joe Biden would begin fall immediately in the polls, immediately upon entering the race, that his best day in the race would be his first day in the race. And the absolute opposite has happened. In the Real Clear Politics average of polls he has a 25-point lead over Bernie, and a 33-point lead over Elizabeth Warren. It doesn't tell you where he's going to be in the future, but this has been a good rollout for Joe Biden.</p><p>BAIER: It has, and we'll see if the attacks start putting up ahead of that first debate in June as you take a look at those polls.</p><p>Take a listen to Facebook and the calls for them to be broken up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, FACEBOOK CO-FOUNDER: People have started competitors to Facebook over the past few years. And Facebook either acquires them when they are too small, or copies the technology outright.</p><p>REP. RO KHANNA, (D) CALIFORNIA: I'm for regulating them so they don't exploit privacy laws, so they don't buy up competitors and copy competitors. I want to make sure they don't have any future mergers so that they don't become big and stifling competition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Breaking up is tough to do?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Breaking up might not be a particularly great plan for Facebook, but this is where we primarily discuss politics, that and other social media companies, and the way that they have been shutting down conservative speech makes them less liked by conservative people, also by liberals.</p><p>BAIER: Jeff, quickly?</p><p>MASON: I'm just interested to see to what extent this ends up playing out on the campaign trail. That's a major policy decision to say whether or not you want big tech companies to be split up.</p><p>BAIER: I just want to notice that the AP is moving a wire that says the U.S. begins preparations to impose tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in China's imports that don't already face import taxes. That could affect a lot of things.</p><p>OK, let's do winners and losers. Jeff, first to you.</p><p>MASON: Winner, Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary finally got the nod to get the gig in full time from the president after being acting for several months. On the flipside, John Bolton had sort of a rough week. The policy in Venezuela that he's supporting is not going as quickly as he would like, and the president said yesterday publicly that he sometimes needed to temper his national security advisor.</p><p>BAIER: Mollie, winner and loser?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: Yes, whether you're a princess or a pauper, a baby is a wonderful blessing, and this week the royal couple there gave birth to Archi, and so that's a wonderful winner for the week. The loser would be Senator Richard Burr out of North Carolina. He's the head of the Senate Intel Committee, which has largely not done anything in terms of oversight with the Russia hoax, except for having a staff member who is in prison for lying about sleeping with one of his -- with a reporter. And then this week he for some reason decided to subpoena Don Trump Jr. months after he said that there was no Russia collusion. Not a great week for him.</p><p>BAIER: All right, winner and loser, Bryon?</p><p>YORK: Winner is President Trump who is actually experiencing a boom-let at the polls. His polling average, job approval, 45.1 percent, the highest it has been since February the 20th, 2017, when he was just in office. And the loser is Vladimir Putin, who fancies himself an athlete. Got out on the hockey ice, look at that. That's pretty bad.</p><p>BAIER: I've watched that.</p><p>YORK: And all those guys mysteriously died shortly after.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>YORK: So he is the loser for me.</p><p>BAIER: I could watch that a lot of times. I guarantee you it was not covered in Moscow.</p><p>YORK: I think it was totally blacked out. He should probably stick to meddling in elections.</p><p>BAIER: Yes, he was kidding by the way. He was kidding about the people being dead, OK? Yes, panel, thanks. We made it around the horn. Jeff, thanks for White House cameo.</p><p>When we come back, \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>BAIER: Finally tonight, it is Friday. That means \"Notable Quotables.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My heart goes out not just to the victims in this case, but there are those that won't be classified as victims that are feeling it this morning right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was going to go down fighting if I was going to go down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We sent some messages on Friday to make sure that it was clear to Iran that we recognize the threat.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We still have every intention of negotiating a good resolution with North Korea to get them to denuclearize.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are not in a Constitutional crisis.</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Case closed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Facebook that exists today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China often works in terms of 20 year plans. I'm not sure this president thinks beyond his next tweet.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Buttigieg. Buttigieg.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN) PRESIDENT CANDIDATE: So yes, I can win this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have the two best guys in the world, so I'm really happy.</p><p>TRUMP: My son is a very good person.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would put him back into the circus. The freak show in the house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can hug and kiss me anytime.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That's very nice, thank you.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE SPEAKER: It would be useful to see his tax returns.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you care about Trump's tax returns?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I don't really give a rear end about it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't care about anybody's tax returns. It's their business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love you mom.</p><p>TRUMP: The person who told him that red is his power color, wow, that was a good move.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Wearing a red tie.</p><p>That's it. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT - fair, balanced and still unafraid.</p><p>Make it a great weekend.</p><p>THE STORY with Martha starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019051001cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W36-HS61-DXH2-6097-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 10, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000DJUB</classCode><className>US NAVY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000DIRC</classCode><className>US AIR FORCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nuclear Weapons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Drugs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Federal Legislation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjUxRjAxOUQxNDM3NDQ0MEI2QzA4MzUwMjNENjgwNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTJGMUQ1NkM5MjFFNDZCQjg5NjNFM0U1NkUwM0I1REU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rules &amp;

We are completely different.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Revolut, headquartered in London, was only founded three years ago; it now has over 3 million customers in Europe, a number that has doubled over the past nine months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The neobank is attracting 7000 new customers each day, and expects this will be 10,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In April it secured $US250 million in fresh venture capital funding for global expansion, at a valuation of $US1.7 billion. It's the fastest-growing unicorn tech company in Europe.</p><p>And according to its website, Revolut is about to land down under. Ominously for the major banks, without any advertising, 20,000 Australians have already signed up to its waiting list.</p><p>Revolut expects to have a prepaid debit card live in the Australian market by the end of the year. It will launch in the new year and is targeting 150,000 local users by the end of 2019.</p><p>It's also taking on New Zealand, part of an ambitious plan to also capture Millennial customers in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p><p>Mr West reckons timing for the Australian launch is solid. The loss of trust in the big four banks on the back of the Hayne commission should help it lure customers away from the incumbents, he says.</p><p>\"When we launch in Australia, our main goal is to be an alternative to traditional banks. We are very anti bank, and people have really resonated with that,\" Mr West says in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial Review from London, ahead of an appearance at the Intersekt Festival in Melbourne on Monday, October 29, where he is delivering a keynote address.</p><p>Revolut's arrival will also worry other budding neobanks in Australia, such as Volt, Xinja and 86 400, which are also trying to lure Millennials away from the big four. The rise of \"challenger banks\" will be discussed at this week's Sibos conference in Sydney.</p><p>Revolut has already secured the necessary licensing in Australia for its payments cards by piggybacking off an AFSL licence held by an existing bank that Mr West declined to name.</p><p>It plans to use the new start-up bank licensing regime established by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and become an \"authorised deposit-taking institution\" (ADI), which would allow it to take deposits.</p><p>The company operates current accounts in Europe under an \"e-money\" licence, and is close to secure a full banking licence there which will allow it to begin lending operations. It plans to offer personal loans, business loans and mortgages, a product suite it also wants to replicate in Australia.</p><p>But the first product will be payments cards - which could let it get between existing banks and their customer relationships. Apple Pay should be available soon after launch, allowing customers to pay with their iPhones and Apple Watches, something only ANZ offers among the big four.</p><p>Revolut built up its big customer numbers in Europe by providing an ultra-low cost foreign exchange options for travellers. Its cards have no fees for overseas withdrawals and transfers, and exchange rates are the same banks get in wholesale markets. This will also be the case in Australia, where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/foreign-currency-fees-face-accc-probe-20181002-h16499\">the competition regulator recently launched an investigation targeting the high costs of money transfers offered by major banks</url>. It is also offering low-cost share trading, insurance and cryptocurrency wallets. </p><p>Revolut was also able to scale because its banking application was better than those offered by the British and European incumbents - something that will be harder in Australia, given the big tech investment by the majors on their banking applications. Mr West agrees Australian banks \"are certainly better than UK banks and most European banks\". But he adds \"they are still nothing special\".</p><p>\"None of them are offering the real, in depth analytics we are offering on spending, none are even close on the FX spreads, none of them have an app designed as beautifully as ours.\"</p><p>Revolut has aspirations to become the \"Amazon of finance\". Pressed to explain, Mr West says customers don't want half-a-dozen apps on their phone managing different elements of their financial life. \"They want to have everything centralised in one brand they know that they trust.</p><p>\"Customer are becoming lazy and expecting more from the services they use. I don't want my bank to bombard me with offers. I want to give my bank my criteria and to give me one solution right to me that matches my criteria.\"</p><p>The philosophy of Revolut is much more tech than fin. \"We are a tech company first and foremost. We are redefining banking on a global scale,\" he says.</p><p>Its recent Series C capital raising round - one of the largest ever by a European tech company - was led by DST Global, which was an early investor in Facebook and Spotify. It was also supported by Index Ventures, in investor in Facebook, Coinbase and Robinhood; and Ribbit Capital, one of the best-known VC investors in Palo Alto.</p><p>Like Netflix and Spotify, Revolut is pushing towards a subscription-based model: it has 150,000 customers paying ??6.99 a month; and 80,000 paying ??12.99 a month. These include all-you-can-eat insurance deals, personal concierges and various cashback offers. And like Uber and Amazon, Revolut has no plans to become profitable any time soon.</p><p>Mr West says Revolut doesn't consider banks its main competition - rather, it will come from Facebook and Amazon \"when they inevitably break into finance\". Oozing confidence, he says \"with our capital, brand awareness and unique style marketing, we won't struggle to win the Australian market over.</p><p>\"I am convinced we can do it faster and better than any other fintech in the market.\"</p><p>Time will tell.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029924881</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJ3-VK81-JBJ7-N1HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><timeReceived>04:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

(UBank runs on NAB legacy technology systems and its management reports into the NAB mothership.) </p><p>In the UK, some of the major banks are moving aggressively to counter the disruptive threat from the likes of Monzo and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/neobank-revolut-to-launch-in-australia-20000-on-waiting-list-20181019-h16v4h\">Revolut</url>, new brands that are starting to attract a material number of customers. (The five largest neobanks in the UK have 2.5 million customers, quadrupling over the last year.)</p><p>Royal Bank of Scotland is creating a new digital banking brand, to be known as Bo, that will be run independently of RBS. Management is keen to migrate 1 million NatWest customers on to the new platform. </p><p>It's earlier days in Australia. But Up, which is operating under Bendigo and Adelaide Bank's licence, is acquiring 1000 new customers each week to its new savings account, which is offering an introductory interest rate of 2.75 per cent. About 22,000 accounts have been opened since its October launch.</p><p>Volt will launch its savings and transaction card products from March. It hasn't yet announced pricing but has big ambitions to lure big four customers with higher interest rates. </p><p>Other local challengers including 86 400 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/xinja-meet-australias-first-crowdfunded-bank-20181218-h198lp\">Xinja are awaiting licences</url>. </p><p>While none of the new players are likely to move the dial on the billions of dollars sitting in deposits in the major banks (Commonwealth Bank has almost $500 billion in deposits), they won't need to scale at a lightning pace to make the majors jittery.</p><p>All of the major banks have watched the impressive growth of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/x/h1a8hf\">Afterpay,</url> which has attracted more than 2 million (mostly) Millennial customers in quick time. They're aware the royal commission has tarnished trust in their traditional brands built up over decades. </p><p>The majors fear the new players could interpose themselves between customer relationships by offering a slick new experience that might render the incumbents to utilities in the background. This could become a bigger disruptive threat down the track under the government's open banking policies which could facilitate more customer account switching. </p><p>Plenty of false starts</p><p>The Australian Financial Review understands various majors have actively considered moving into the space in the past few years. ANZ Banking Group was apparently considering unveiling a new digital bank in Asia before Shayne Elliott was appointed CEO, but abandoned the plans when it decided to refocus on Australia.</p><p>However, it is believed ANZ has been talking to Revolut, one of the biggest neobanks in the UK, as a potential partner in Australia. </p><p>Commonwealth Bank experimented with South African digital bank TYME but abandoned efforts to roll this out more broadly. However, industry sources consider it possible CBA could make a new digital play either via an acquisition or the development of a new brand.</p><p>Similarly, Westpac Banking Corp has also considered building a new digital banking brand but decided not to proceed when funding was allocated to re-engineering of its own banking systems. But its venture-capital fund Reinventure has been acquiring capability in the digital banking space and could provide the platform for a new push. </p><p>Management consultants are talking to global banks about the need for new, \"greenfield\" investments, as opposed to thinking about technology developments via user experience improvement.</p><p>Oliver Wyman issued its annual State of the financial services industry report on Tuesday, titled It's time to start again.</p><p>\"Experience has shown that by following a greenfield approach it is possible to build a digital banking or insurance platform that is open to customers in just 12 months, at materially lower cost than in the past,\" Oliver Wyman said. </p><p>\"Greenfield lets you sidestep the challenge of legacy infrastructure and get to a truly customer-centric offering faster.\"</p><p>Separate brand</p><p>Mark Bailie, the CEO of Bo, which is being managed as a separate brand within the RBS portfolio, says the core challenge \"is maintaining customer engagement in a world where the big tech firms are building powerful customer relationships, there are lots of competitors emerging, the barriers to entry are falling, and technology is ever more flexible and powerful\". </p><p>The start-ups are putting customer-centric design at the heart of their operations. Volt said on Tuesday it's creating Volt Labs, an app-based online community that lets customers provide their insights and ideas to contribute to designing Volt Bank products and services. Monzo did a similar thing in the UK. </p><p>Given their market power, the majors might decide on a wait-and-see approach. After all, there are plenty of unanswered questions about the neobanks, including their ability to raise capital, the cost of acquiring new customers and the tough road to profitability. </p><p>But UK neobanks are starting to grow via viral marketing and word of mouth. Up is already in the top 10 finance apps in Australia and is conducting marketing on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for customer acquisition. Oliver Wyman estimates it will cost a digital bank $30 to acquire a new current customer on average, compared to $150 for incumbents. </p><p>The start-ups are also investing in distribution partnerships. For example, Up is working with Afterpay and Google. Volt has partnered with PayPal and Collection House. And in the future, neobanks could seek to team up with retailers, telecommunication companies or airlines, who might use a combination of open banking and the newly licensed start-ups to increase their exposure to financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1030086796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7X-58J1-JBJ7-N3W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1066\"/><timeReceived>05:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The ETF is expected to begin trading in March once regulatory approval is granted.</p><p>The PowerShares listing is a milestone for the new exchange as it nears the first anniversary of its launch, and represents something of a statement on the part of Invesco Canada, says its president, Peter Intraligi.</p><p>\"Philosophically, the idea of increasing competition in Canada makes a great deal of sense to us. We are always looking for ways to be more efficient with our Power-Shares ETF listings and are strong proponents of the notion that increased competition drives efficiency and innovation (Invesco is one of the shareholders of Aequitas Innovations Inc.( <url normalizedValue=\"http://aequitasinnovations.com\">http://aequitasinnovations.com</url>/ ), the parent company of the NEO Exchange.)</p><p>As a shareholder the company has been able to closely monitor the growth of NEO since its launch, and with the development of the Powershares Global Momentum Index ETF, determined that the time was right to list on the exchange.</p><p>It was not a decision Invesco took lightly despite its ownership stake in in the parent company, Intraligi says. \"Clearly, the No. 1 and most important priority is the investors who invest in your products. You want to make sure that there aren't going to be any issues or flaws, and operationally we are very satisfied with where NEO is. We are very comfortable now with the position of the exchange.\"</p><p>Having made the first move, the Invesco president expects others to follow.</p><p>\"Every issuer would subscribe to the idea that more competition is better. I think the challenge was getting to the level of comfort you need to be the first to support something new. It is the old story of, 'I don't want to be first, just in case.' For us, we feel very comfortable and we hope that when our listing goes live it sends a clear signal that NEO is ready to bring a new level of competitiveness to the market, competition which benefits everyone.\"</p><p>Intraligi says that his company has already received \"very positive\" comments from broker-dealer market makers. \"They would like to see more competition. When you look at the U.S. market, that (competition) does exist and you get greater efficiencies and economies.\"</p><p>In Canada currently, all ETFs are traded on just one exchange. \"So I think this makes sense and we hope that this does start to broaden the market.\"</p><p>Brent Holliday, chief executive and founder of Vancouver-based Garibaldi Capital Advisors, is hopeful that the new exchange will prove to be a more cost-effective and efficient way for Canadian firms to go public.</p><p>\"If NEO does something in the senior listings space along the lines of what AIM (the London Stock Exchange market for smaller companies) did, and offers the liquidity and benefits like better pricing to companies, it might be a great alternative for growing tech companies.\"</p><p>To list in the Canadian Market you didn't have a choice. But now you do.</p><p>Currently such companies have few options, he adds. \"The complaint against the TSX is that it is really a resource and financial service market and so if you see big tech companies in the U.S. and other markets, they don't think of the TSX as a place to go list their companies.</p><p>Similarly, large Canadian tech companies that are thinking about going public, if they have U.S. equity investors, they look to the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange and then think of only the TSX as a colist.\"</p><p>Tim Johnston, chief listings officer of the NEO Exchange, is bullish on NEO's opportunities in the listing space. The exchange launched its listings business in the middle of 2015, so \"to get your first listing just six or seven months after your launch is quite remarkable given everything involved in the process.\" says Johnston.</p><p>Related</p><p>Incentive high for companies to move from TSX to NEO( http://wp.me/p1SCTv-2Euk )</p><p>Monumental year for new exchange( <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.financialpost.com/investing/monumental-year-for-new-exchange\">http://business.financialpost.com/investing/monumental-year-for-new-exchange</url> )</p><p>\"The first listing is an important catalyst because it gets over that kind of resistance to being the first, and in the Canadian market, from a senior issuer's perspective, there really hasn't been an alternative to the TSX in our market before.\"</p><p>Michael Becker, executive vice-president international business strategy, with New York-based Business Wire and a NEO trusted service provider, understands the David-and-Goliath challenge the upstart exchange is facing.</p><p>\"You are fighting tremendous incumbent inertia, a lack of innovation and battling the status quo,\" he says, noting the landscape is ripe for a lower-cost and more innovative alternative.</p><p>\"If you are a Canadian company looking to list on a senior exchange in the Canadian market you didn't have a choice.
