Also this week, Apple's general counsel Bruce Sewell testified in front of a United States congressional committee looking into issues around encryption and security. And last week, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Justice concerning warrants for email data. </p><p>These three news events are part of what's sure to be a growing wave of interactions between major technology companies and governments around the world and a relationship between tech companies, governments, and regulators that's going to get a lot more complicated in the years to come.Encryption and Security the Tip of the IcebergThe current battles between Apple and the FBI and Microsoft and the DoJ are just the tip of the iceberg here, but they are reflective of the ways in which technology has become not just part of our lives but central to them. Our most personal communications are now digital and are stored and pass through our personal and business devices and leave digital traces to an extent unprecedented in history. Warrants, which in the past would have been issued to individual or corporate suspects for reams of paper, are now issued to big tech companies for digital records. Because of the nature of digital record keeping, these tech companies are now involved in these legal proceedings in a way that's fundamentally new and requires new ways of working together with law enforcement. Requests by law enforcement are going to become more and more invasive (and potentially secretive, since obtaining a digital record doesn't deprive the owner of their copy and can therefore be done without their knowledge) and, at some point, society needs to establish new rules for these searches.Expansion of the Role of Technology Will Broaden Brushes with GovernmentHowever, as technology companies seek to broaden the scope of their products and services into new areas, many of the new activities they'll engage in will bring them into more frequent contact with governments and regulators around the world, in ways that have nothing to do with law enforcement. Consider two members of the vanguard of 'sharing economy' companies - Uber and Airbnb. Both have had frequent brushes with regulators, sometimes being prevented from operating entirely in new markets, sometimes being forced to make concessions or charge additional fees to their customers in order to continue operating. Both companies have also often taken an 'easier to ask forgiveness than permission' approach to launching in new markets, relying on pressure from avid customers to push through permission to operate over the objections of powerful lobbies and regulators. That approach may work for some companies in some industries, but it's unlikely to be the model to follow in many other markets tech companies want to expand in to. For example, pushing into financial markets like payments and banking in the same way would certainly not work - those markets are highly regulated and the punishments for flouting regulations can be severe. Further, it's one thing for a startup with no reputation to lose to engage in this cavalier behavior, but quite another for an established company with a brand to maintain to do the same.Significant Changes are Coming to Product DevelopmentAs technology companies move deeper into healthcare, education, payments, and other areas, they will find themselves increasingly having to get permission from the relevant government agencies and regulators in many countries around the world before they can begin operating. This will have several significant impacts on the way these companies normally like to do business: It will lengthen the time to market for new products and services because regulatory approval may well have to be obtained first It will make it harder to maintain secrecy for new products and services when many bodies around the world have to be consulted before launch It will make it harder to launch new products and services (or upgrades to existing ones) at specific predictable times, because regulatory approvals are unpredictable It will make it harder to do big-bang global launches for new products and services because of all the regulatory bodies involved That's a shame, because these are some of the areas where technology has the greatest potential to do good in the world and make real life-changing progress. That's not to say it can't still be done, but it will require substantial change in the way these companies do business.Partnering May be the Best ApproachOne possible approach is for tech companies to remain focused purely on the technological side of these innovations and allow others with specializations and experience in the respective industries they wish to enter take on the regulatory hazards. Apple CEO Tim Cook's approach to this problem was articulated in an interview with the UK's Telegraph newspaper last year: 'We don't want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process. I wouldn't mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it \u2014 maybe an app, maybe something else.' I see one possible outcome of the approach articulated here as a partnership approach under which Apple would create hooks in hardware and software for third party devices to interact with the Watch and provide additional functionality subject to regulation. That wouldn't hold Apple back from innovating on a predictable and rapid schedule, but would open the door to others more comfortable with the slow-moving regulatory approval process. It's easy to imagine such an approach being used in a variety of other markets too, with appropriate partners chosen for specific projects or opportunities. Whether this approach or another is taken, however, it's clear the future is going to be very different from the past. Big tech companies are going to have to get comfortable spending a lot more time engaging with governments in one way or another. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TCHP128926146122939913625176900023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHP-128926</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JKD-9YG1-F03R-N0XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><timeReceived>9:03 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tech.pinions</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 21, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

This is partly the reason for the poor performance of the technology sector in the past week. It's a bit too early to tell if this is in fact a longer trend that will continue for the months ahead.The good news is, there's no major catastrophe about to hit the sector -- that's not the reason big tech is down. It is rather a dash of investor caution, which is actually a good thing. </p><p>Especially since it's following continued positive news flow, new innovations and new opportunities. Apple's AAPL[1] WWDC event and Alphabet GOOGL[2] joining Amazon AMZN[3] in the $1000 club, Facebook FB[4] taking WhatsApp off IBM's IBM[5] cloud and Toshiba handing out another letter to Western Digital WDC[6] were the top news stories from last week.Apple WWDCThere were a lot of details at Apple's annual event where it characteristically didn't shed much light on the new iPhone. Here are a few high points-HomePod: The new Home device from Apple called HomePod, is rather expensive at $349. Slated to launch this December, it will work seamlessly with Apple Music (something Apple is playing up), but it's otherwise similar to other voice-activated digital home hubs from competitors. Mac Update: Apple says its new iMac Pro is its \"most powerful Mac ever,\" based on some attractive features like the 1080p FaceTime camera and real-time 3D rendering. The new device will be available in December and will sell for at least $4999.Watch Update: The Watch is getting many new faces. Other than the Kaleidoscope and Toy Story faces, there's one Siri -owered watch face that changes information on the watch face depending on your needs, an Activity face that displays your goals/targets and workout face that displays workout information and plays music during your workout. The Watch will also double as a flashlight when you work out at night. The music app on the Watch plays from multiple playlists and supports improved integration with the Airpods.Apple Pay Update: With iMessage integration, Apple Pay will be easier to use. The iOS 11 upgrade to Maps will now include malls and inside spaces, so the transaction can be tracked from internal maps to the completion of the sale and the collection of fees related thereto.AR/VR: Its ARKit allows app makers to make use of camera and sensor data to map digital objects into 3D space. With the ARKit, software developers will be able to create AR apps that will run on any Apple device. Since it is already a leading seller of premium devices, this will get AR into many more hands than any competing platform and will be a big draw to enterprise customers.Regarding VR, Apple is targeting VR content creation for Macs and already has developers working on the new iMac and High Sierra OS. It's also working with HTC Valve, Unity and Unreal to bring more content to Apple devices.Siri: With iOS 11, Apple will introduce a better Siri that can help with translation and speak in different voices. With SiriKit developers can use Siri in third-party apps, thus improving its productivity. In iOS 11, Siri will be able to recognize your voice, the context of your query, your interests and how you use your device to anticipate and address your needs before you ask it.Alphabet, Amazon Join $1000 ClubIn two successive weeks the two companies saw their share prices cross the $1000 mark. When this happens, it's obviously an indication of investor confidence in the way the company has done over the years as also its prospects of continuing on the growth path. In Alphabet's case, it remains so strongly positioned in the search advertising market and so successful in other initiatives like Google Play, YouTube, GSuite and Hardware, with so many attractive moonshots like self-driving cars, fiber, biotech, etc. and such a strong balance sheet, that investors are willing to discount the risks associated with its continuing antitrust proceedings with the EU and others.In Amazon's case, the company has grown into the dominant retailer in the U.S. with growing penetration in many international markets. It also enjoys a first-mover advantage in IaaS services where it continues to add services, lower costs and add to its client roster.Facebook to Move WhatsApp from IBM CloudFacebook is now moving WhatsApp from IBM's Softlayer severs to its own in an attempt to improve synergies and lower costs. The shift has taken some time because when it acquired WhatsApp, Facebook was in the process of moving Instagram in-house. Facebook also reportedly takes time with these things possibly to ensure that the transition is smooth. This isn't necessarily a negative for IBM cloud services because it was an inevitable thing, but it is something of a blow for its infrastructure services revenue as the market is very competitive with Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Notably, WhatsApp wasn't a top five customer for IBM.Toshiba Issues Second Warning Letter to Western DigitalThere are some interesting developments on this front as June 15, the day Toshiba will decide a winning bidder draws close. First, Foxconn said that Apple and Amazon were joining its effort to buy Toshiba's stake in its JV with Western Digital. Then Toshiba sent a second letter warning WDC to stop interfering with the sale process. And third, Western Digital has apparently softened its stand to agree to a 20% share rather than all of Toshiba's stake. Let's wait and see.\u00a0\u00a0Other storiesCorporateApple Downgraded: Analyst Andy Hargreaves of Pacific Crest thinks it's not a good idea to further accumulate the shares because he considers Apple's valuation to be super-rich and the shares likely to be down $10 a year from now. He has therefore lowered the rating to 'sector weight.' He also thinks that investors are way too positive on the iPhone 8 and not considering the negatives, such as weaker demand for the more expensive phone or inadequate supply considering the new parts it will be using.Shareholders Oppose Zuckerberg Chairmanship: According to Proposal Seven in Facebook's (FB) proxy statement, there is a call for the board to adopt a policy that the Chairman of the company will be an independent person. The proposal was put forward by consumer watchdog SumOfUs and endorsed by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which says that there are governance issues with the current arrangement where Zuckerberg controls the company as its largest shareholder, CEO and Chairman.Last year, shareholders approved a new class of shares (Class C) that would give each shareholder a Class C share for each Class A or Class B (10x voting power of Class A held mainly by Facebook executives) share held. Class C shares have no voting rights but will trade publicly and the arrangement will strengthen Zuckerberg's hold on the company even as he transfers the economist interest of his holdings to a 'charitable' company without the need for public disclosure. Creation of the Class C shares was contested later in court and the case will go to trial in September.Microsoft Realigns Operations: MicrosoftMSFT[7] initiated some executive reshuffling. The most important changes were as follows: A new Cloud AI Platform group to be led by Corporate Vice President Joseph Sirosh reporting directly to AI and research head Harry Shum. This business will include Azure Search, Azure Machine Learning, the Microsoft Bot Framework, R Server and the Algorithms and Data Science Solution team.Corporate Vice President of Azure, Jason Zander will now acquire additional responsibility for SQL Server and other database and data-management jobs in a new Azure + Data Platform Group and will continue to report to Guthrie. Dynamics CRM will be added to a new Business Applications Group headed by James Phillips. The group also includes Power BI, Dynamics ERP family of products, PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, the Azure Portal and SQL Server Reporting and Analysis service.Google to Open London HO, California R...enter: Google will build an R...acility in the Diridon Station area of San Jose, CA where it will employ 15,000 to 20,000 people. It has also in the process of building a huge campus in London, complete with 92,000 sq feet of office space, swimming pool, cafes, gyms, message rooms, parking spaces and a multi-use indoor sports pitch and themed gardens.Legal/RegulatoryApple Expands Third Party Repair Capabilities: In the wake of eight states introducing \"right to repair\" bills, Apple is equipping 400 third-party repair centers in 25 countries with the necessary machinery to do the job. This will reduce customer wait times when a phone is out of order and improve customer satisfaction.iPhone Data Theft in China: Chinese authorities have found that some 20 Apple/Apple distributor employees and 2 outsiders had sold personal information of Apple consumers like names, phone numbers, Apple IDs and other data for up 50 million yuan. It has been alleged that Apple's internal computing system was used for the purpose. The people were detained on the basis of a new cyber security law passed by the Chinese government, the details of which are still being ironed out.Apple consumer data has reportedly been an easy sell in the past as well because of the perception that Apple devices are only purchased by the affluent. But they haven't been checked by officials because there was no proper law against it. But information theft of important businessmen in the recent past has increased awareness.German Parents Can't Access Dead Daughter's FB Account: The parents of a 15-year old who met her death when hit by a Berlin subway train were denied access to her Facebook account. The mother, who had her log-in details, wanted to access her account because she suspected suicide as a result of bullying. Facebook put the account under 'memorial' status when tipped off by a 'friend' of the girl's.The German court ruled that the mother couldn't be granted access without the consent of the people the girl communicated with. The decision overturns that of a Berlin court that ruled in favor of the mother on the basis of inheritance law. The court in this case didn't rule on the inheritance factor but said the privacy law prevented it from ruling in the mother's favor. Germany's telecom act originally protected telephonic conversations alone but in 2009, it was amended to include emails as well.Kaspersky Files Antitrust Complaint Against Microsoft: Leading end point security solutions provider Kaspersky has gone to the European Commission and the German federal cartel office over alleged blockage by Microsoft, which bundles its own security software with Windows. Kaspersky says that Microsoft is creating obstacles for independent software security vendors despite the fact that its own security is not as robust. It blames Microsoft for \"a lower level of protection for users, a limitation on their right to choose and financial losses both for users and security solutions manufacturers.\"Microsoft says, 'Microsoft's primary objective is to keep customers protectedWe are confident that the security features of Windows 10 comply with competition laws. And we will answer any questions regulators may have.'Alphabet Might Have to Pay $9 Billion EU Fine: Reuters reports that two people familiar with the matter have said that the EU is getting ready to charge a $9 billion fine on Google in lieu of anti-competitive behavior related to its shopping service. In April 2015, the competition commission in the EU accused Google of manipulating search results to favor its own services, in the process hurting both competitors and consumers.The usual fine in such cases is 10% of the company's global turnover, which works out to around $9 billion in Google's case. Google has in the past offered to settle the case but its concessions were unsatisfactory to competitors. It isn't clear at this stage what restrictions and injunctions the commission will bring against Google and how that will affect its operations.New Products/TechnologyApple AI Processor Chip: Apple's semiconductor suppliers have their days numbered it seems. The company, which has been making a number of its own chips, looks set to make even more of these things in-house. One such chip (internally referred to as Neural Engine) will be dedicated for AI functions that will thereby speed up the phone while also helping Siri do your bidding.Companies like NVIDIA and Google do have dedicated AI chips that do work in the cloud. Apple has preferred to carry out many of these functions on the phone itself on account of privacy concerns. The recent hiring of Qualcomm engineer Esin Terzioglu is adding to speculation about Apple's chip ambitions with some saying the it might start making the entire SoC in-house.Andy Rubin Phone: Android creator Andy Rubin is unsatisfied with the way the smartphone market has become what with closed ecosystems, bloatware and pre-installed apps. He'd rather the phone was your personal device for you to load just what you like and little else. So he's using a stripped-down version of Android that he's calling Ambient to launch a truly attractive device called the Essential smartphone.It's a $699, 5.7-inch device with a tiny bezel, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, packing in 4GB of RAM, 128GB of on-device storage, 8 megapixel front-facing camera and 13 megapixel rear camera plus a second\u00a0monochrome sensor to help boost low-light shots. All of this at less than 185 grams, i.e. 3 grams lighter than the iPhone 7 Plus.Skeptics abound on the success of the device since it's a crowded market with Apple, Samsung, Google and a host of Chinese players employing different strategies to protect/grow their shares, effectively pushing out stalwarts like Nokia, Blackberry, Amazon and Microsoft. Essential is also launching a home device, but the smartphone is the main point of attraction.Skype Redesign: Microsoft has announced a redesign of its mobile Skype app that will include a 'Highlights' feature, just like Snapchat 'Stories,' i.e. photo and video sharing that will be only temporarily visible. This isn't very original, but a required change to bring the app on par with the plethora of other messaging services that people use these days. Other additions include bots, emojis, colorful backgrounds and the ability to share content from third-party services. Microsoft would also like to eventually enable live streaming and game playing on a video chat.Waymo Autonomous Trucks: Alphabet's Waymo, which has run the greatest number of tests for self-driving cars, is now embarking on a new project involving self-driving trucks. The company has said that it is relying on its 'eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software' to conduct 'a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck.' The pre-test run work may actually have been done much earlier since Levandowski, who spirited off Waymo files initially started out with a self-driving trucking company that was then acquired by Uber.Waymo's initial tests are being done on a company-owned track in California and will be followed up with rigs. Test vehicles will reportedly be on the road in Arizona later this year. The excitement with trucks is probably related to the dynamics of the trucking market where there is currently a shortage of drivers. But trucking is also trickier in the sense that there are some additional jobs required such as gas filling and ice cutting that may require manual effort. At any rate, competition is heating up with Tesla expected to launch a semi-truck in September that will likely incorporate self-driving technology.Fleet Management Tool from Google Project Wing: Google's Project Wing has leveraged Google Maps, Earth, and Street View to create a fleet management software called UTM (UAS Air Traffic Management) that will enable operators of large fleets of unmanned aircraft (drones) to simultaneously carry out various functions without colliding into each other, or other aircraft, or buildings and other obstacles.The program was run through a series of tests developed by NASA and the FAA at the FAA test site last week. Two Intel Aero Ready-to-Fly Drones for package delivery and a DJI Inspire operated by the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP) for rescue operations were used in the test.M...nd CollaborationsIntel-DARPA: The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is collaborating with Intel to create a new big data graph analytics platform that it is calling Hierarchical Identify Verify ...ploit (HIVE). The platform will help it handle more complex (many-to-many) relationships in data and help its deployment across many industries by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence.Alphabet Finally Selling Boston Dynamics: To further its goals of acquiring 'paradigm-shifting technologies and its vision of catalyzing the next wave of smart robotics\", Japanese firm Softbank has agreed to buy robotics companies Boston Dynamics and Schaft from Alphabet for an undisclosed amount. Boston Dynamics was earlier purchased by Alphabet to further its robotics plans.But Alphabet's robotics and machine learning technologies differ in process to the one employed by Boston Dynamics, which made the acquisition difficult to integrate. So it has been looking for a suitable buyer for the past year or so. Softbank has been reinventing itself through acquisitions and has even helped create the Vision Fund to increase its involvement with leading edge technologies.Pandora Still Shopping: Pandora continues to weigh its options in case Sirius XM, which can benefit the most from buying it, doesn't agree to pay the desired price. On one side it has investment firm KKR agreeing to invest $150 million, or Verizon, offering to invest $100 million, or the two investing in it together. On the other, it has Sirius offering to buy it outright.Pandora's growing losses and declining user base aren't exciting for any buyer, but what investors are interested in is its position in internet-connected cars. Pandora's agreement with KKR allows it a period to shop for a good price, failing which it will accept the KKR offer. For now, Pandora has extended this period, but if the extension period expires without a sale, the offer will be deemed accepted.Snap Buys Placed: Snap has acquired Placed, a startup that uses location-based analytics to measure the effectiveness of digital ad campaigns. Its goal is obviously to show that ads running on its social media platform actually generate sales for advertisers. The acquisition should therefore help attract new advertisers, while also encouraging existing clients to spend more on the platform.Some NumbersGame Console Sales Poised to Pop: A Jon Peddie Research press release says that consoles are in for a very strong year in 2017 after a couple of years of softness. The report says that sales will jump a whopping 77% this year on the back of new releases like Sony's 4K PS4, Microsoft's new Xbox-one (Scorpion) and the recently released Nintendo Switch, which seems to be gaining from pent-up demand.In the first quarter of 2017, the newly launched Switch took a 19% share, the Wii 27% and the Wii U 3%. Sony remained in leadership position with its PS3 taking a 24% share and PS4 17% share. Microsoft followed with its XB 360 taking an 8% share and XB1 a 2% share.Alibaba Raises Guidance: Alibaba shares soared last week as the company provided very strong revenue targets for the year. Management expects that ecommerce, cloud, digital media and entertainment, and of course international expansion will contribute to revenue growth of around 45-49%, or over $34 billion this year. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) is also expected to double in the next three years from $547 billion in fiscal 2017 to a trillion dollars by 2020.Netflix To Spend $6 Billion on Content: CEO Reed Hastings has said that the company intends to spend $6 billion on original content (including payments for original shows) this year. The company has seen something of a controversy over the shows that it streams the same day they hit the theater, but the CEO is optimistic about this changing in the future. At any rate, he feels that content costs would rise with the increase in subscribers and even to hang on to existing ones.Dell Results: Dell Technologies, which remains a privately held company with a tracking stock in lieu of its EMC (and therefore, VMware) buyout, reported disappointing results for the quarter ended May 5. For the quarter, it generated a net loss of $1.3 billion, or $2.57 a share on revenue of $17.8 billion. The Client Solutions Group, which includes its personal computer division, grew 6% to $9.1 billion while the infrastructure division grew 91.7% to $6.9 billion.The results are significantly worse than its year-ago performance, when revenue of $12.2 billion and fetched profits of $55 million. But Dell is now saddled with a huge amount of debt that it took on to buy EMC. The results don't look too impressive all things considered.Fitbit Drops in Wearables Ranking: Wearable device shipments grew 17.9% to 24.7 million units in the first quarter of 2017, but not all companies could make the most of the increased demand. For the first time this quarter, Xiaomi became the market leader with 14.7% share despite its 3.3% decline in shipments. It was followed closely by Apple, which grew 64.1% for a 14.6% share, mostly at Fitbit's expense, which declined 37.7% for a 12.3% share.This was the first time that Fitbit didn't come out on top. Samsung also grew very strongly at 90.8% for a 5.5% share while Garmin rounded out the top 5, growing 1.6% for a 4.6% share. Other wearables makers grew shipments 43.9%. Fitbit's inability to expand internationally to faster-growing markets is depressing its growth rate.Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch List Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Both the Hotels and Other segments grew strongly from the year-ago quarter.&lt;nl/&gt;Alibaba BABA[5]: Alibaba may have missed on the bottom line because of increased investments to boost growth in multiple areas, but its top line sailed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate[6] while growing 44.8% year over year. Active buyers grew strong double-digits and mobile GMV jumped triple-digits. Moreover, mobile GMV was 51% of total GMV, compared to just 27% last year. The lunar new yearfalling within the quarter helped results.&lt;nl/&gt;NVIDIANVDA[7]: The chipmaker missed on both the top and bottom lines[8], so it's not surprising that the shares took a thrashing. The Tegra line was a weak point in the last quarter and the PC market slump had an impact on guidance.&lt;nl/&gt;Is Yelp Up for Grabs? &lt;nl/&gt;It seems like a wild rumor to drive up share prices because the company, which has reasonably strong revenue growth rates continues to make losses and has been more abused than praised in recent times for false reviews and ranking system. Its greatest positive is the user base, which is largely mobile and local, which is why some companies may want to buy it.&lt;nl/&gt;For example, companies like Priceline, Expedia or TripAdvisor could benefit from the review database as well as the number of mobile users. In Priceline's case, there is the added attraction of removing OpenTable's competition in the restaurant reservation business. Both Facebook and Google continue to boost their local capabilities, so both could benefit in that respect.&lt;nl/&gt;And lastly, Amazon could also be interested, since it has an appetite for just about anything. But at the end of the day, everyone would think twice about the disgruntled user base, negative publicity and legal proceedings. And this could have an effect on the price tag.&lt;nl/&gt;What EU's Single Digital Market Means for U.S. Tech Cos &lt;nl/&gt;The European Union is attempting to remove online trade barriers between the 28 member countries to boost cross-border trade while also bringing increased regulation of the essential digital platforms offered by some U.S. tech firms.&lt;nl/&gt;The EU to deal with language barriers, legal barriers and barriers related to telecom and networking infrastructure. Moreover, there is also a practice of fixing different prices for different regions and even restricting access to some regions called geo-blocking.&lt;nl/&gt;While the first two barriers are technical and may be removed with some effort, the third related to the telecom infrastructure will involve an overhaul of the sector and therefore member states could fall out at any time. Geo-blocking can be removed immediately but enforcement will be difficult because of the level of monitoring it will necessitate.&lt;nl/&gt;And there again will most likely be significant difference of opinion amongst member states. So the promise of more choice and cheaper prices may be hard to bring about.&lt;nl/&gt;On the other side, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) comprising Google, Microsoft, eBay, Amazon and Facebook looks quite strong. The CCIA has said that most online businesses represented platforms after a while and the increased regulation of these platforms sought by the EU will backfire because it won't allow their own fledgling companies to flourish.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;Other stories you might have missed-&lt;nl/&gt;Corporate&lt;nl/&gt;AppleAAPL[9] Raises Debt: Apple raised $8 billion on Wednesday through bonds with maturities extending from two to 30 years. In line with its strategy of returning value to shareholders, the company will use the proceeds to pay dividends and buy back shares.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;New Road for Internet.org: In what could be an attempt to appease disgruntled media and other web developers in India that have complained against the unfairness of providing some hand-picked services for free, Internet.org will now consider proposals from all developers and could accept those that satisfy three criteria: first, that they encourage users to explore as much of the Internet as possible; second, that they use Internet data efficiently (i.e. bandwidth gorgers will not be entertained); and third, whether they are designed such that they work equally well with both smartphones and feature phones.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;Cisco Gets New CEO[10]&lt;nl/&gt;Zappos Employee Exodus: Around 14% of Zappos employees took up CEO Tony Hsieh's offer to quit the company by April 30 in exchange for at least three months' pay. The company has had such programs before, which generally resulted in 1-3% of the workforce quitting. The mass exodus this time round could be the result of the ongoing management restructuring to a Holacracy model, where there are no bosses and job titles and employees manage themselves.&lt;nl/&gt;Legal/Regulatory&lt;nl/&gt;Apple Under Scrutiny For Music Deals: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is looking into Apple's exclusive deals with record companies Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music to see if it used its leading position in digital music downloads to put other smaller players at a disadvantage. Apple is revamping Beats music to breathe life into its music business, which has been losing out to streaming companies.&lt;nl/&gt;Online music revenue matched physical sales for the first time last year, but Apple's iTunes lost ground to streaming music (both subscription and ad-supported). According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, iTunes sales dropped 8% last year, while both kinds of streaming revenue jumped 39%.&lt;nl/&gt;The points being explored include whether Apple's agreements with streaming companies have the effect of inflating music streaming prices, negatively impacting smaller operators like Spotify and limiting competition; and also whether they have the effect of limiting the ad-supported model.&lt;nl/&gt;Ericsson Takes Apple War to Europe: Ericsson has filed cases in Germany, Britain and the Netherlands saying that Apple has infringed on its patents related to 2G and 4G/LTE standards. The mobile telecom equipment maker had also offered to go into arbitration with Apple to reach a global licensing agreement, but Apple didn't respond within the allotted time. Last year, Samsung agreed to make necessary payments to Ericsson, including arrears.&lt;nl/&gt;U.S. Regulators Softening Stand on Drones: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is now willing to study drone flights beyond the line of sight of humans, which was essential for their large-scale deployment for automated actions including goods delivery and inspection work. The previous restrictions were based on concerns for civilian safety when unmonitored and uncontrolled drones traversed the air above them.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;Pandora's War with ASCAP, etc: Pandora won in the latest round of the case versus the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) when a federal appeals court rejected appeals by the group to raise rates paid by Pandora and restrict the number of titles it currently streams. Earlier, District Judge Denise Cote required Pandora to pay 1.84% of revenue to ASCAP, and the appeals court has now found that there was 'no clear error' in that judgment. Especially since licensing through ASCAP is optional and publishers may choose to opt out. Pandora's latest estimates indicate that it has 250 million users that listened to 1.77 billion hours of music last month. &lt;nl/&gt;New Technology/Products&lt;nl/&gt;Apple Search Engine Could Be In the Making: Analysts at Axiom Financial are now saying that Apple is building the team that created Applebot, Apple's proprietary web crawler that indexes web pages and powers its Siri and Spotlight Suggestions applications. Apple is expected to drop its default search partnership with Google this year and was largely expected to use Yahoo or Microsoft instead. But it now appears as if Apple has other plans.&lt;nl/&gt;Intel's INTC[11] New High-end Data Center Chips: Intel has refreshed its Xeon E7 line to add functionality and lower the total cost of ownership for data centers operating on massive scale. The increased number of processor cores and extension in cache per socket is positive, but DDR4 support could raise costs somewhat. The product family is expected to facilitate big data analytics, a market Intel expects to grow very strongly. Intel has already partnered with big tech companies like H-P, Dell and Cisco and expects to have 40 partners on board within a month.&lt;nl/&gt;YahooYHOO[12] Now Offers Analytics for Apple Watch: Strengthening its relationships with app developers, Yahoo has announced that its Mobile Developer Suite now also includes free Flurry analytics so developers can track interaction with their apps on Apple Watch and also determine how it differs from the main app on the smartphone. &lt;nl/&gt;Google Launches Cloud BigTable[13]&lt;nl/&gt;Alibaba Boosts Stake In Zulily: Last week, Alibaba bought several million Zulily shares in five lots through the week for a total investment of $56.2 million, according to a regulatory filing. Alibaba had previous holdings in the online retailer of women's and kids' merchandise, and the purchases took its total stake to 9.3%. Alibaba is looking to increase sales overseas as growth in the Chinese market is expected to be muted this year.&lt;nl/&gt;JD Invests in Tuniu: China's second largest ecommerce company JD.com has invested $350 million in Class A shares of Chinese travel company Tuniu for a 27.5% stake. The funding round of $500 million includes others such as Ctrip, DCM, Hony Capital and Temasek Holdings. Tuniu will operate JD's travel site and collect fees on travel booked. JD will collect on sales through other JD sites. Tuniu's revenues grew 81% in 2014 according to media reports. The deal is likely to help counter competition from market leader Alibaba and its travel site AliTrip.&lt;nl/&gt;New Smartphone OS from Tencent: Maker of popular instant messaging apps WeChat and QQ has now announced a new smartphone OS that pits it against Alibaba's Yun OS and Google's Android. The OS called TOS+ could end up quite popular since Tencent already has a loyal customer base of over a billion on these two platforms combined. But both Yun and TOS+ are free from certain censorship restrictions that Android is subject to.&lt;nl/&gt;M...nd Collaborations&lt;nl/&gt;IBM-Facebook Deal: The two tech companies have entered into an agreement according to which IBM analytics will use personal data from Facebook regarding local conditions and customer preferences (Custom Audiences), combine with the information on its own marketing cloud and come up with solutions that will facilitate better targeting by marketers.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;Intel-Altera Standstill Agreement Expires: Altera had previously refused Intel's $54 offer to acquire the company although investors clearly supported the deal. Reuters is now reporting that the companies signed a standstill agreement expiring on Jun 1, after which Intel can attempt a hostile takeover of the company.&lt;nl/&gt;Google Buys Timeful[14]&lt;nl/&gt;Prime Members Won't Pay For Internet On Some JetBlue Flights[15]&lt;nl/&gt;Some Numbers&lt;nl/&gt;Google (GOOGL) Says Mobile Search Tops Desktops: Google says that mobile search queries outpaced desktop search queries in the U.S., Japan and eight other countries for the first time. The company didn't provide further details as to the number of queries or the names of the other countries. But it did launch new advertising tools especially for mobile that help customers see, compare and buy products, cars, mortgages, auto dealerships, hotels, flights, etc. &lt;nl/&gt;Microsoft Will Pay to Upgrade Surface: Microsoft is offering $150 to trade in Surface RT and Surface 2 devices for Surface 3, but the final amount will be decided after the condition of the device has been checked. Surface 3 supports desktop apps and will get a free upgrade to Windows 10 when its launched. Devices in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico have to be sent in by May 31 to be considered.&lt;nl/&gt;Some Other Earnings Reports: Teradata[16], Cognizant[17], Groupon[18], Monster Worldwide[19], Scientific Games[20], Activision[21], Electronic Arts[22], Fiserv [23]\u00a0were some other tech companies that reported last week.&lt;nl/&gt;Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A quick look at some of the top stories-<br/><br/> The Bug in the First Android Watches <br/><br/> Right after the first Android smartwatches started shipping from Google's (GOOGL[1]) Play Store, Android Police identified a bug that was preventing the installation of paid apps on the devices. Googlewas able to work on a quick fix before the devices reached most customers, so there likely won't be too much of a backlash.</p><p><br/><br/>Samsung and LG made the first Android watches. Samsung's Gear Live at $199 is slightly cheaper than LG's G Watch, which costs $229. Both are powered by Qualcomm (QCOM[2]), run on Android Wear (the new OS for wearables) and are operated by a smartphone running on Android 4.3 or higher. The Samsung device has apparently got a better display and more sensors, while the LG device has longer battery life.<br/><br/> Semi Foundries Have a Story to Tell<br/><br/> All the pureplay foundry stocks declined this past week, but there's more to the story.<br/><br/> The Chinese foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International started the week on a positive note following the announcement of its collaboration with Qualcomm. The two have agreed to work together on 28nm process technology so Qualcomm, which is fabless, can get some of its Snapdragon processors manufactured in China. SMI benefits because the agreement will help develop its 28nm process and because Snapdragon is a market-leading device.\u00a0<br/><br/> United Microelectronics and Taiwan Semiconductor reported monthly sales numbers. Both saw sales up in the mid-teens percentage range, but this didn't have much of a positive impact on share prices. UMC is yet to get 28nm to scale, which means persistent pressure on margins. TSM is much better off, with stronger utilization, 20 nm ramp up and the positive impact of Apple's (AAPL[3]) business. <br/><br/> But TSM's partiality to Apple is not having a very good effect on its other partners. Qualcomm is already getting closer to Samsung and last week, Panasonic took some business to Intel (INTC[4]). As a result, Intelwill make SoCs for the Japanese company's audio visual equipment using its 14nm process. This is a very big deal for Intel, which only recently decided to share its process lead with competitors. But the services will not be opened to all and sundry: CEO Krzanich has promised only 'strategic' partners.<br/><br/> Additionally, In Semi Equipment World\u2026<br/><br/> Lam Research (LRCX[5]) shares jumped 4.01% after its analyst event at SEMICON. The company narrowed its CY14 WFE expectations to $32 billion, +/- $1 billion (previous +/- $2 billion). It now expects WFE spending of $35-40 billion by 2016/2017 (previous 2015/2016). The increased adoption of multi-patterning processes in logic and DRAM segments is expected to drive additional opportunities for Lam.<br/><br/> Management expects this to result in a market expansion opportunity of $2 billion by 2016/2017. This is expected to yield revenue, gross margin and operating margin of $5.6 billion, 46-47% and 21-23%, respectively, which are above previous expectations.<br/><br/> The merger of Applied Materials (AMAT[6]) and Tokyo Electron is drawing near and the two have now decided to call the combined entity Eteris[7], or the 'eternal evolution of society.'<br/><br/> KLA Tencor has decided to return more cash[8] to investors.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> GOOG = Class C shares (new, non-voting)<br/><br/> GOOGL = Class A shares (old, 1 vote per share)<br/><br/> Other stories you may have missed-<br/><br/> Corporate<br/><br/> China Labor Watch Slams Samsung: Samsung decided to stop business at a Chinese supplier when the U.S.-based labor watchdog China Labor Watch said that it found child labor at the facility. It also declared that Samsung's monitoring process was ineffective. Chinese law considers the employment of persons below 16 years to be child labor.<br/><br/>Microsoft Could Be Planning Job Cuts: CEO Satya Nadella has issued a memo that describes Microsoft (MSFT[9]) as 'the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world'. While he didn't mention any job cuts, the notable deviation from Ballmer's 'devices and services' strategy and the prospective integration of Nokia's devices business is leading to a lot of speculation.<br/><br/>Zynga Regains Compliance with Nasdaq[10]<br/><br/> Regulatory<br/><br/>Apple Loses lawsuit in China[11]<br/><br/> China Doesn't Like Apple's Location Tracking Feature: China Central Television (CCTV) has quoted a local security expert as saying that Apple's location-tracking feature made it possible for the company to track people's movement and could lead to the leaking of state secrets. Apple has defended itself by saying that it wasn't a default feature and could be turned off.<br/><br/> The government has not said anything regarding the issue, but it could play a part in the ongoing negotiations between the Chinese and U.S. governments. Unnamed sources also said that China recently told state-owned wireless carriers to cut marketing expenses because they overspent on subsidies and promotions of some devices.<br/><br/>Apple and GoogleAsked to Change Refund Policies: South Korea's Fair Trade Commission has asked Apple and Googleto change their policies with respect to free apps. Many free apps are automatically charged to the customer after the expiry of the free trial period before the customer is able to remove the app. The companies currently do not refund anything that was charged before cancelling the app.<br/><br/> New Technology/Products<br/><br/>Facebook's Mobile Video Player For iOS: Facebook is getting more active on the video front. Right on the heels of the LiveRail acquisition, the company is now testing a video feature for iOS devices that appears similar to Youtube's 'Related Videos.' When users click on a video in the news feed, they get other video suggestions that might prompt them to watch a few more.

The tech rout that began in August 2018 is just the most recent example. Tech investors want to know what caused the latest tech short-circuit and whether there are any bargains among the ruins. But you should also be asking whether you've got the fortitude to invest in such a volatile sector. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">See Also: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t058-s001-10-tech-stocks-that-pay-you-to-own-them/index.html\">10 Tech Stocks That Pay You to Own Them</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New technology has always revolutionized American life, and tech stocks have always been a part of that revolution. Railroad stocks dominated the 19th-century stock market; RCA, known to traders as Radio, was a lion of the Roaring Twenties. Polaroid dominated the Go-Go Years of the 1960s, and Microsoft and Applesoared in the 1990s, along with a spate of dubious internet stocks, such as Pets.com. </p><p>Facebook, Apple, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet--the FAANG stocks--have been the darlings of the most recent bull market. All five represent revolutionary advances: Facebook in social media, Apple in hardware, Amazon in retailing, Net\u00adflix in entertainment and Googlein internet search and online ads. From the start of 2018 until they peaked later in the year, the FAANG stocks gained an average of 55% (not including dividends). Netflix, up 118.3%, led the pack. </p><p>Most big tech rallies end badly. The most not\u00adable comeuppance was the tech wreck of 2000 to 2002. The technology-laden Nasdaq 100 tumbled 78.2% from January 14, 2000, to October 9, 2002, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 47.0%, not including dividends. This time around, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen 13.7% from its August 29 high, compared with 9.6% for the S&amp;P 500. The FAANGs have fared worse, as the table on the next page shows. (Prices and returns in this story are through December 7.) </p><p>What happened? Blame, at least in part, the usual suspect: high share prices relative to corporate earnings. \" Valuations got a little crazy, and when people get nervous, they sell what can give them some nice profits,\" says Robert Doll, senior portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. </p><p>When stocks gather that much momentum, everything has to go perfectly for those stocks to continue rising. Instead, the investment thesis for many tech stocks started to crack. In the case of Apple, rumors began to fly in November that the company had slashed iPhone production orders. Facebook's woes began earlier in the year, as the company faced scrutiny of its user privacy practices.</p><p>Investors have also started to worry that tech titans will face increased government regulation, either here or abroad. Recall that Microsoft faced years of antitrust battles with the European Union. Although not a worry currently, Amazon, Facebook and Google, which is facing antitrust action in Europe, could eventually face antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. Recent EU regulations give consumers more control over data collected by tech companies; California passed a tough new privacy law in June. \" Tech is sitting in the crosshairs of the regulators,\" says Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. [PULLQUOTE]</p><p>Semiconductor stocks hit a serious slump of their own, led by chipmakers Nvidia and Applied Materials, which each issued lackluster earnings outlooks. As is typical in the boom-and-bust microchip industry, bulging inventories and slower demand have clobbered chipmakers, and trade tensions with China have increased fears of slowing demand. </p><p>Finally, tech stocks were hit by what sank the rest of the stock market: fears of a slowing economy and concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates too far, too fast. Because tech stocks went up the most, they came down the hardest as well. </p><p>Value in the ruins. As tech meltdowns go, the recent one is relatively mild. Still, nearly half of the technology stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index are 20% or more below their 52-week highs. Although that's a big loss, bear in mind that the 2000 tech wreck was so severe that it took the Nasdaq 100 benchmark years to beat its 2000 high, and many of the dot-com stocks--including Pets.com--simply disappeared. </p><p>These intermittent meltdowns show that not every tech company stands the test of time. Polaroid, Digital Equipment and dozens of other firms litter the technology graveyard. \" Today's companies are not finished,\" Doll says. \" They have good earnings growth, cash flow, products and balance sheets.\"</p><p>Apple, for example, has $237.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Amazon announced record net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. Facebook produced earnings of $1.78 per share, well above analysts' estimates of $1.46 per share. </p><p>Before you dive into tech, bear in mind that you might own plenty already, especially if you're an index investor. Tech stocks account for 20% of the S&amp;P 500. Now is also a great time to reevaluate your risk tolerance. If downturns will have you waking up at night shouting, \" I'm ruined!\" then perhaps you'd be better off in more defensive corners of the stock market. </p><p>Otherwise, consider the debacle a buying opportunity. Among the five FAANG stocks, Alphabet (symbol <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=googl&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">GOOGL</url>, $1,047) is worth exploring. The company has an extremely strong position in the online ad market--one that would be difficult for another company to steal. Alphabet also has an extremely healthy free cash flow--that is, cash available for the company to use in whatever way it sees fit. </p><p>Other tech blue chips are on sale, too, including Microsoft (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=msft&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">MSFT</url>, $105). Its Windows operating system, for example, still sits on about 64% of all desktop computers, and it's increasingly a leader in cloud storage. The stock has a 1.8% dividend yield and enough cash on its books--nearly $136 billion--to sustain its payout for a very long time. </p><p>See Also: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t058-s001-the-baits-4-chinese-tech-stocks-to-buy-fangs/index.html\">The BAITs: 4 Chinese Tech Stocks to Buy to Replace the FANGs</url></p><p>Given the tech industry's continually changing nature, there's no harm in letting a pro decide which stocks to buy. Income-oriented investors might consider the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=tdiv&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">TDIV</url>), which buys only tech companies that pay dividends. The fund is up 2.2% over the past 12 months and has an annualized dividend yield of 2.8%.</p><p>For a diversified, actively managed fund, consider T. Rowe Price Global Tech\u00adnology Fund (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/tfn/index.php?ticker=prgtx&amp;page=stocktipsheet\">PRGTX</url>), which charges a below-average 0.89% in expenses. The fund has averaged a 17.9% return over the past five years, beating the average tech fund by a little more than four percentage points a year. It's been a white-knuckle ride. The fund tumbled 9.0% over the past three months, but that's still better than the average tech fund's 12.9% loss.</p><p>Lessons from tech wrecks of the past can help you gain perspective. \" The best thing you could have done in 2002 was ask yourself, 'What is the great stock I wanted to buy but didn't?'\" says Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management. You could try the same exercise today.</p><p>See Also: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-5-fintech-stocks-to-buy-for-the-future-of-finance/index.html\">5 Fintech Stocks to Buy for the Future of Finance</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDITOR'S PICKS</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-5-fintech-stocks-to-buy-for-the-future-of-finance/index.html\">5 Fintech Stocks to Buy for the Future of Finance</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t052-s001-the-25-best-stocks-to-buy-2019-hedge-funds/index.html\">The 25 Best Blue-Chip Stocks for 2019 (According to Hedge Funds)</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/t058-s001-the-baits-4-chinese-tech-stocks-to-buy-fangs/index.html\">The BAITs: 4 Chinese Tech Stocks to Buy to Replace the FANGs</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIPPUB-058008002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3V-9VJ1-DYTN-N4VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146142</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1218\"/><timeReceived>04:10 AM</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators. Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a news conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\" </p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama. Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe. The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses. Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance. Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business. One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006. Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. \"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday. On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" Walker wrote. But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets. \"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well, Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\" For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine. Google will control 31.1 percent of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers. \"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said. Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world. European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones. The Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN70536264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-9BB1-DYRV-43RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p> But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p> Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them from defecting to a rival service such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.</p><p>Facebook, in turn, faced renewed focus on its gobbling up of competitors. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg that documents obtained from the company \u201ctell a very disturbing story\u201d of Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p> He said the documents show Zuckerberg called Instagram a threat that could \u201cmeaningfully hurt\u201d Facebook.</p><p> Zuckerberg responded that Facebook viewed Instagram as both a competitor and a \u201ccomplement\u201d to Facebook\u2019s services, but also acknowledged that it competed with Facebook on photo-sharing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LBEACH-4910747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABB557E59769 LBEACH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-J271-JBCN-409X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Long Beach Press-Telegram</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem. We need fewer performances and face-palm-inducing spectacles like we had this week in Washington and more candid and carefully studied conversations about the dangers social media firms\u2019 products pose to democratic discourse.</p><p> Jared Schroeder is an associate professor of journalism at Southern Methodist University, where he specializes in First Amendment law.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem. We need fewer performances and face-palm-inducing spectacles like we had this week in Washington and more candid and carefully studied conversations about the dangers social media firms\u2019 products pose to democratic discourse.</p><p> Jared Schroeder is an associate professor of journalism at Southern Methodist University, where he specializes in First Amendment law.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p>President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem. We need fewer performances and face-palm-inducing spectacles like we had this week in Washington and more candid and carefully studied conversations about the dangers social media firms\u2019 products pose to democratic discourse.</p><p> Jared Schroeder is an associate professor of journalism at Southern Methodist University, where he specializes in First Amendment law.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem. We need fewer performances and face-palm-inducing spectacles like we had this week in Washington and more candid and carefully studied conversations about the dangers social media firms\u2019 products pose to democratic discourse.</p><p> Jared Schroeder is an associate professor of journalism at Southern Methodist University, where he specializes in First Amendment law.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem. We need fewer performances and face-palm-inducing spectacles like we had this week in Washington and more candid and carefully studied conversations about the dangers social media firms\u2019 products pose to democratic discourse.</p><p> Jared Schroeder is an associate professor of journalism at Southern Methodist University, where he specializes in First Amendment law.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing. They could fund media literacy programs in schools and support fact-checking organizations.</p><p> Whatever the solution, we must get to the root of the actual problem.

It\u2019s a shame the performances of our elected officials and tech barons in Washington were not considered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, as well as Senate and House committees, turned their attention to internet regulation, creating a spectacle that was mostly misguided and incapable of resolving any actual concerns about the growing power of big-tech firms raise in our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Trump announced he was taking on regulating social media again. As is often the case, he has recognized a legitimate concern, but seems only capable of making it worse.</p><p> Yes, big tech firms have amassed concerning amounts of power over the flow of information and our private data and displayed an inability to protect the pathways of democratic discourse from harm.</p><p> His solution, which uses a sledgehammer where the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel is needed, is to remove their legal protections. This will not solve the problem, but it will create more.</p><p> The president asked the FCC to \u201cadopt rules clarifying Section 230.\u201d The order sounds innocuous. Section</p><p> 230, however, has been referred to as the law that \u201ccreated the internet.\u201d The protection it has afforded fledgling companies has allowed the internet to grow into a vital engine for social and economic exchanges.</p><p> Section 230 is the part of the Communications Decency Act that makes internet service providers and online forums, such as Facebook and YouTube, immune from liability for how people use their services. When Section 230 is coupled with the First Amendment, these big-tech firms have incredible freedom to create and manage the online spaces we use each day.</p><p> They have the power to suspend accounts, as Twitter did to Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday. They have the power to label content as untrue, as Twitter did to the president\u2019s tweets about mail-in voting earlier this summer. They can also simply take content down. Facebook removed conspiracy-focused videos about COVID-19 this week.</p><p> Suspending, removing and qualifying information is not the main problem, though it appears to be driving the president\u2019s calls for regulation. Section 230 is also not at the heart of the issue, though a Senate subcommittee conducted hearings about revising the passage Tuesday.</p><p> The real problem is big-tech firms such as Facebook and Google have created economic models that benefit from maximizing activity on their sites, even when that activity fundamentally damages democracy. One report found Facebook earns about $7 annually per user. Any change that leads to fewer users will lead to smaller profits.</p><p> These economic motives were part of the spectacle Wednesday, when CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook testified about their economic models by often offering word salads to members of Congress. Our elected officials played their parts, often showing little understanding of the tech firms or their services.</p><p> When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.</p><p> Misinformation and disinformation drive significant amounts of social media traffic and \u2014 though big-tech firms have taken steps to at times curb some of this content \u2014 they have been loath to fundamentally address the harm their services create. Why? When your company makes $1.7 billion a quarter, why change the product?</p><p> Yet, as November\u2019s elections approach, our information ecosystems are awash in misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s why the regulation conversation we should be having is about incentivizing ways for these firms to redesign their products so they do less harm to democracy.</p><p> The challenge, and need for a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is underscored by the reality that both the president\u2019s concerns about being blocked, censored or qualified on social media \u2014 and those about regulations to protect democratic discourse \u2014 run into the same legal limitations. It is unlikely any change the FCC makes will survive in court. The First Amendment protects human and corporate speech with nearly the same zeal. This means the government cannot compel these firms to leave certain content online or remove it. At the same time, courts have continued to interpret Section 230 as protecting these firms from liability for how their services are used.</p><p> So what is to be done? My friend Dipayan Ghosh, a former Facebook employee and White House policymaker, and I argued for industry self-regulation earlier this summer. The idea would be, if the industry policed itself, we could avoid this messy process of attempting to regulate social media.</p><p> Another approach would be to tax social media firms\u2019 profits. The money would be used to repair the damage their products are doing.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Imagine that new power wielded by your most loathsome political enemy. If you\u2019re still good with it, then move forward. In most instances, my usual response is, \u201cOh, never mind.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Donald Trump recently tweeted. This is more than his usual Twitter dumpster fire. The president last week filed a court motion opposing a tech company challenge to his May executive order that seeks to insert the government more deeply into policing online speech.</p><p> This \u201cgovernance by executive order\u201d approach has always upset me. Republicans were rightly aghast at Barack Obama\u2019s misuse of presidential edicts, under the wise theory that, even if legal, they circumvent the checks and balances that are at the heart of our republic. Presidents have vast powers, but they aren\u2019t elected dictators.</p><p> After Trump took over, many formerly aghast Republicans became a little less aghast as the president issued orders they liked. At first, they said he was only undoing Obama\u2019s overreach. Now that Trump has decided to rival Obama for his muscular use of such orders, these folks are eerily silent. Perhaps the president will win re-election, but he might not. Sorry, but someone you despise will eventually grasp that presidential pen.</p><p> Many of these orders are largely symbolic. After Trump promised an executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions, he added it was merely a \u201csignal\u201d given that Obamacare already required such coverage. His proposals to regulate technology companies, however, are heading into more substantive territory. Are Republicans comfortable giving Democrats broad new powers to regulate the Internet?</p><p> I\u2019ve given up trying to find any ideological consistency from the president, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s really, really mad at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for fact-checking his tweets, deleting accounts from conservative activists and inconsistently punishing users who violate the firms\u2019 rules and regulations. Trump accuses the online forums of having a political bias, which may or may not be true \u2014 but they are ultimately private forums.</p><p> \u201cOnline platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\u201d the president said in his executive order. His solution is to chip away at Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. His supporters describe that 25-year-old regulation as a special privilege for online venues, because it protects them from lawsuits regarding the myriad comments, memes and videos that users post.</p><p> That section isn\u2019t a privilege, but something fundamental to the flourishing of these social-media services that we all enjoy and have come to depend upon for our communications. Because traditional publishers edit and review the articles they post (as opposed to the freewheeling comments section), they are subject to lawsuits if they publish something that may be defamatory.</p><p> If your Aunt Ethel could sue Facebook because of Cousin Frank\u2019s mean and accusatory online posts, then the entire social-media edifice would collapse around us. Fortunately, any overly intrusive executive order is unlikely to pass legal muster \u2014 and some members of Trump\u2019s own Federal Communications Commission have expressed doubts about serving as the president\u2019s online-speech enforcer.</p><p> The tech companies are in a bind. Conservatives complain that they are unfairly targeting the president, but progressives \u2014 who also have Section 230 in their crosshairs \u2014 want the services to be even more intrusive in their meddling. As Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote for Reason, \u201cProgressives don\u2019t like Section 230 because it means that only the perpetrators of crimes like harassment \u2026 can be charged or sue over these actions, not whatever digital tool or service they happened to use.\u201d</p><p> Trump isn\u2019t the only one behaving like a snowflake. Last year, the Joe Biden campaign demanded that Facebook and Twitter reject some of the president\u2019s political ads. \u201cIt is one thing to allow President Trump the platform to spread falsehoods from his own account; it is quite another to profit from paid ads echoing the same lies,\u201d the campaign argued. Egad.</p><p> Both candidates, by the way, have called for the federal government to revoke Section 230. The Biden folks also blathered about the importance of the First Amendment and the Trump executive order likewise rambled on about the importance of free speech, but that amendment is clear about restricting government from policing discourse.</p><p> Revoking Section 230 may not necessarily run afoul of the Constitution, but the Trump order (and Democratic proposals) would, as CNN reported, \u201cregulate how companies moderate content on their websites.\u201d The intent certainly is to insert government into free-speech matters. Since both parties support similar intrusions, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to apply my rule of thumb: Do you want the other guys to have a bigger hand in regulating your online speech?</p><p> Steven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

Meanwhile, the Internet has become a leading supplier of radio signals, providing far-flung audiences with new independent channels and digital transmission of a slew of existing stations.</p><p>Locally, over-the-air broadcasting soon will begin undergoing enormous changes.</p><p>In underserved markets, low-power stations could be allowed to hunt with the big dogs. The FCC seems ready to grant licenses to new entities, if only to inspire competition in an increasingly consolidated marketplace.</p><p>The biggest problem, established broadcasters say, is that the low-power signals could interfere with those of existing stations, and these entities would face less regulation. In cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, frequency spectrum already is almost filled to overflowing, so it isn't likely that many new stations could be added.</p><p>Just as in the television industry, however, the most revolutionary aspect of digital transmission comes in the expanded options available both to stations and listeners.</p><p>There is some bad news here, however, in that consumers will have to buy a new set if they want to experience the full robustness of a digital AM and FM signal. Blessedly, it won't cost as much as an high-definition TV set, and the channel numbers will remain the same.</p><p>\"Existing receivers will work in the system, because, for a period of time, we will continue to broadcast in analog,\" explained William J. Casey, director</p><p>of marketing and sales for Lucent Digital Radio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lucent Technologies. \"The stations want to do it because it increases fidelity for the consumer; there would be the ability to license or rent out that space on the sideband to data providers, and it is an opportunity to provide and enhance public service, such as emergency broadcasts.</p><p>\"For example, with the digital signal, if, there's a tornado, a transmitter can send a signal out to a digital radio and literally wake it up . . . . It turns the radio on at a high volume and issues a warning.\"</p><p>In early June, Lucent said it had successfully tested its In-Band On-Channel Digital Audio Broadcast system in live broadcasts with National Public Radio member station WBJB-FM in Lincroft, N.J.Lucent said there was no degradation of the host FM analog channel during the transmission of the digital FM signal over the same band.</p><p>Suren Pai, subsidiary president, said testing will continue in 1999 and the technology should be commercially available next year.</p><p>Said David Bickle, public relations manager for Lucent's New Ventures Group, \"FM will have a near-CD-quality sound, and AM will sound like FM does today. At the same time, you'll have the ability to receive data over the digital signal.</p><p>\"A radio probably will have a video display, which could show the name of the artist, the name of the song, local traffic or weather.\"</p><p>Casey estimates that a digital car radio might cost $ 100 more than a comparable existing unit, depending on the extra services provided.</p><p>But, as Ron Rodrigues, editor of Radio &amp; Records magazine, notes, we're not too far from seeing the day when wireless communications will allow car radios to browse the Internet for commercial-free or distant Web stations, and receive data on a dashboard screen.</p><p>Listening to radio over the Internet, at home or at work, is a growing phenomenon. \"It's been a big issue for the last year, especially after Arbitron came out with statistics showing that something like 16 percent to 27 percent of computer users are listening to audio on their computers and the Internet,\" said Rodrigues.</p><p>What's happening, observes E. Van Cullens, president of Harris Corp., a leading supplier of products and systems for the broadcast market, is, \"You're seeing that long-awaited, much-touted, overhyped convergence of voice, data and video, and you're going to see bigger companies starting to straddle those markets, because you now have the technology to actually intermix these things. Everybody's going to end up in the same place, because a bit is a bit is a bit, and once you get it digital, it becomes a software game.\"</p><p>On the Internet, of course, radio suddenly can become a visual, interactive medium. It also can begin to stream data.</p><p>Besides music or talk programming, a station's Web site can offer an advertiser a direct sales path to listeners through computerized links to the company. Similarly, it can create new advertising inventory for its national and international clients, because a station can sell both local and distant spots.</p><p>\"I may be working on a spreadsheet at my office, and, on my Internet radio, I hear a commercial for Minute Rice, in which they're providing a recipe,\" said Michael Fisher, a sales representative for RadioWave.com Inc., a subsidiary of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola. \"So I can maximize my screen and go to the company's Web site, pull up the recipe, print it and cook it tonight. Or, I could order some clothes for my kids from the Spiegel catalog, or get an online quote from an insurance company.</p><p>\"When a sales guy goes out and tries to sell a commercial, he can offer a company a $ 100 spot on the radio station, or a $ 120 commercial that also goes out on the Internet. Right now, we're simulcasting, but, when you get enough listeners on the Internet, you'll have the opportunity to sell one commercial to (age) 25-to-54 women in one market and a different one to men -- or, if the sponsor doesn't want to spend the extra $ 20, you can insert a national ad for a different company.\"</p><p>The RadioWave.com player software can be downloaded from the Internet or installed from a CD-ROM. It allows access to about 90 of the 2,000 stations on the Web. Others are available through companies such as RealNetworks Inc., Onradio.com and Broadcast.com.</p><p>Add to this MP3, a format that not only would compete with radio, but record stores as well.</p><p>Recently, both RealNetworks and Microsoft announced their intention to deliver music to consumers directly through the Internet.</p><p>Using software from RealJukeBox, PC owners can download encoded music from the Web in RealAudio or the MP3 format. They also can use it to record their own compact discs -- this time with the blessing of record companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Knight News Service;

But this year, the talk of the town is whether it's time to break up the technology giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) bold proposal to take on Google, Amazon and Facebook barreled through the conference, which continues through March 17 in Austin, Texas, like an electric scooter on a crowded sidewalk. Onstage at one event, journalist Kara Swisher said Warren's plan has the tech industry \"vomiting on their Allbirds.\" But at one tech podcast's live recording session on Sunday, chants of \"Break them up\" broke out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren's plan to break up Big Tech may be a long shot, but it appears it will make regulating the technology industry a key point of the 2020 debate. Other presidential hopefuls who attended South by Southwest, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), said it's time to look carefully at any future tech mergers -- and \"supercharge\" the agencies to crack down on monopolies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is an interview with Warren backstage at the Moody Theater:</p><p>Google and Amazon are very popular businesses. Why do you think this proposal to break up Big Tech will be a winning strategy with voters?</p><p>This is about keeping markets competitive. My proposal will still let any consumer go to Amazon and order a coffee maker for delivery within 48 hours, go to Google and look up the capital of North Dakota and go to Facebook and check out what their old college friends are up to. I propose to separate that platform that consumers use from the ancillary business products that Amazon and Google are able to unfairly promote and that has the consequence of stamping out little businesses, medium-size businesses, start-up businesses. I want to protect competition. The giants can't use the advantage of the platform to wipe out all the competition for what gets sold on the platform.</p><p>It's like in baseball. You can be the umpire; that's like the platform. Or you can own the team; that's one of the businesses. But you don't get to be the umpire and own the team in the league.</p><p>Let's take Amazon first. How would you propose to break Amazon up?</p><p>It's not even hard. Right now 49% of all retail sales come to Amazon. For comparison, about 9% of physical retail sales go to Walmart. Any small business that wants to do online retail pretty much has to be on Amazon. They go to Amazon right now, and they're on the platform and Amazon sucks up information about every buyer and every seller. When it spots a profitable business, it has the option of moving in on that profitable business' space, undercutting them -- maybe only temporarily -- on price, moving where they appear on the platform back to page 9, and killing off the competitor business and sucking up the business for themselves.</p><p>My proposal simply says, you can operate the platform. But [the] platform does not own the auxiliary businesses. They have to be spun into their own businesses. It's actually not that hard to break them apart.</p><p>But for consumers, if Amazon is offering a lower price...</p><p>Are you sure it's a lower price, did you check page 6?</p><p>You just said that they can undercut on price.</p><p>Temporarily. That's what they did with Diapers.com. This is another feature of the problem.</p><p>It's not on the Amazon website, so this is a little bit of a different example of what goes on. It lowers its price to below cost. There's no way Diapers.com can survive it. The business strategy [from Amazon] is to lower our price enough that Diapers.com just can't make it. After they make this announcement, they offer to buy Diapers.com. Diapers.com agrees because they have two choices, get sold or die. They let themselves get sold, they make some money on the sale, and Amazon no longer has a competitor. The price of diapers goes back up.</p><p>Do you expect to introduce legislation on this?</p><p>Yes. I've been working on antitrust issues for years. This is part of an extension of other legislation that I've introduced, other speeches that I've given, other policy papers I've put out. It's part of a much larger piece about protecting competition and not permitting industry giants to snuff out competition.</p><p>You called out Facebook, Google and Amazon. Why not Apple?</p><p>They should be on the list. There's no special reason. These were the three where it was easiest to make the example. Apple, it's true as well. Apple can run the platform or they can sell the apps. But they can't compete with other individuals on selling the apps at the same time that they're running the platform and sucking all the information off the platform and making decisions about whose apps are going to be at the top of the platform and who's going to be way in the back where you never find them.</p><p>How does this affect your position in Silicon Valley? Do you still plan to raise money and have campaign events there?</p><p>I'm not in Washington to work for the billionaires. I'm in Washington to try to make government work for everyone else.</p><p>But they've played a crucial part in funding Democratic candidates so how does that affect your path forward?</p><p>You know I'm not doing closed-door fundraisers with millionaires, but I already announced that policy.</p><p>In your post, you raised a lot of the privacy concerns that come up with Facebook. As you think about that, how does that affect how your campaign uses social media and tools like Facebook?</p><p>We use the same tools as everyone else, and we worry about those tools the same way as everyone else.</p><p>Facebook is an example of the problem we've got. Facebook looked over and saw that people were migrating off Facebook over to WhatsApp. They had two choices, they could get better, which is what happens in a competitive market. Or they could use their enormous size to buy WhatsApp and then suck all of the data out of WhatsApp. They chose the second path. I propose that merger be unwound. That would give consumers an option.</p><p>Venture capital right now refers to the area around Facebook, Amazon and Google as the \"kill zone\" because small businesses and start-ups that get too close and look like they might compete with those giants for business get killed. Investment is going down.</p><p>There is some concern that these ecosystems are very intertwined. The companies invest in start-ups. They're also acquiring start-ups, which puts more money back into the venture capital system. How do you avoid unintended consequences on innovation if you break the companies up?</p><p>I think what we have right now is the unintended consequence. The giants are destroying competition in one area after another. It's the job of law to enforce the rules to stop them. That's how competition will flourish in this marketplace. The country had to do this 120 years ago. We need to do it again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: SEN.

Ten years on, platforms like Google and Facebook are being mocked for their callousness on data privacy and the spread of misinformation. The New York Times described the 2010s \"the decade tech lost its way\". Ironically, the decade had begun with the \"Arab Spring\" and social media was hailed as an enabler of democracy and freedom of expression. As the curtain fell on tech's \"decade horribilis\", there was renewed hope that it might yet deliver on its promise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are some of the things that are likely to define the next 10 years in tech:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulation</p><p>Around the world, regulators are taking a hard look at the business practices of big tech firms like iPhone maker Apple, software behemoth Microsoft, e-commerce powerhouse Amazon.com, search giant Google's owner Alphabet and social media supremo Facebook. Tech's Big Five now have a combined market capitalisation of over US$4.94 trillion ($6.8 trillion). Over the past decade, the total market value of the five has risen seven-fold. Yet, tech honchos were not popping champagne corks this past holiday season to celebrate how much value they have created. Indeed, they were hunkered down, pondering their next move. Tech giants are in the crosshairs for sucking everything into their vortex, abusing their powers, collecting far too much information about us without our approval, and then monetising our data to boost their already hefty bottom lines.</p><p>Detractors have dubbed tech's Big Five as \"unregulated monopolies\". Amazon has disrupted retail, cloud services and logistics, yet still thrives on selling unsafe products on its platform while using its near-monopoly power to strong-arm competitors and suppliers. Google and Facebook algorithms have destroyed the media industry with their hammerlock on the global advertising market through programmatic ads. With its control of Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook is the dominant social media platform accused of spreading disinformation, weaponising racial hatred, and using voter suppression tactics, and is increasingly seen as a threat to democracies worldwide.</p><p>It is not just left-wing US presidential candidates who want Google and Facebook on a tighter leash. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Department of Justice, several US states as well as congressional committees have initiated inquiries into their anti-competitive behaviour. Moreover, the European Union has imposed US$7 billion in fines on Google over the past four years, and more penalties are likely. There have also been calls to break up Google which acquired YouTube for a song a decade ago.</p><p>But breaking up the tech giants will not be easy. It could take up to a decade, perhaps longer, to level the playing field, even if there is political will. Action is needed because tech giants continue to stifle competition and innovation. If we want to continue seeing the sort of value creation in tech that we saw over the last decade, regulators need to put their foot down and create an environment where a thousand unicorns, or private tech firms valued over a billion dollars, can bloom.</p><p>Still, I will not bet against Big Tech. While it is possible that one or two tech giants might falter, or indeed forcibly broken up, the rest will become even bigger and more powerful.</p><p>Splinternet</p><p>Despite the recent truce, the ongoing US-China trade war and the battle for tech supremacy will eventually lead to two separate technologies - one dominated by China, and the other by companies in the Western world. Unfortunately, the rest of the world will have a stark choice: Back one or the other. Will Asians use Google's Android, Apple's iOS or the new mobile operating system that Huawei is working on? Will they search on Google or Baidu, or use WeChat's search engine? Will they order goods from one of Alibaba's platforms or Amazon? Will they use ApplePay, Google Pay, Alibaba's Alipay or Tencent's WeChat Pay? Will they tweet on Twitter or Sina Weibo?</p><p>Washington wants to prevent Chinese firms from buying US-sourced technology components, investing in US tech firms as well as exporting their tech products to America. Beijing isn't taking it lying down. It recently launched a US$20 billion fund to support Chinese independence in a range of manufacturing technologies to complement another US$20 billion fund to boost development in semiconductors.</p><p>China's decision to consciously decouple from American tech, building separate domestic manufacturing capacity for components it previously imported and securing its own supply chains, only reinforces tech's Balkanisation, which in turn could lead to the de-rating of global tech giants. China's tech ecosystem would look like a beautiful bonsai to investors, confined mostly within its borders. The Alibabas and Tencents of the world will be de-rated, as will many American tech firms that can sell almost everywhere except in the world's second-largest market.</p><p>Like it or not, you are being watched and all sorts of data about you is being gathered through your smartphone, watch, tablet, computer, as well as your car, shopping habits, travels, financial transactions, and visits to the doctor, restaurants and theatres. Every time you are in a public space, be it a mall, office building or train station, your image is being recorded. Soon you would be able to board a plane, see a movie or watch a soccer match in a stadium without a physical ticket because cameras will recognise that you have already paid for your ticket since your details are stored somewhere in the cloud.</p><p>Surveillance will get worse, even in some of the most liberal countries that pride themselves on protecting privacy. Moreover, the debate around surveillance and privacy will only get louder in future, but we are too far along in the surveillance economy to turn back.</p><p>Augmented reality</p><p>In the past few years, big tech themes have included AI, machine learning and deep learning, digital payments, blockchains and the cloud-based subscription economy - peddling software-as-a-service. Increasingly, tech firms are selling hardware-as-a-service. Ten years from now, few of us will own smartphones, or even cars. Our subscription to a car or phone service will give us access to the latest hardware. Instead of smartphones, we will have wearables or a combination of EarPods and some form of glasses. Apple is expected to introduce its augmented reality glasses in 2022. Facebook, which has had little traction with its Occulus virtual reality glasses, is pouring billions into developing both AR and VR technology. Microsoft, which has had tepid reaction to its own mixed reality HoloLens headset, is aggressively investing in mixed reality. Despite the fiasco of the Google Glass, Alphabet too has ambitious plans for its AR and VR forays.</p><p>We are likely to see more traction on AI and digital payments in the new decade, but don't bet against incumbents like big banks. JPMorgan, which pooh-poohed bitcoin two years ago, is working on its own stable coin, JPM Coin. Facebook's digital currency Libra is probably as good as dead now, but I will predict that in the new decade that we will see several sovereign digital currencies. China is closest to becoming a digital currency pioneer.</p><p>The most talked-about disruption in the new decade will be the gradual switch to electric vehicles (EVs) and the arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on our roads, particularly Robotaxis. The big EV push, which is just starting, will gain momentum in the first half of the decade, followed by major traction for AVs in the second half.</p><p>At the end of 2019, there were over 410 unicorns worldwide. The new crop of unicorns will come not just from firms in blockchains, AI, payments or software. Instead, they will emerge from the 5G-enabled Internet of Things like driverless cars and remote robotic surgery. HealthTech is emerging as the next b-ig thing. Apple and Amazon are clear leaders here. Google, which bought Fitbit last year, is spending billions in healthcare using AI. Climate Change Tech will likely be a close second as startups begin to tackle the next big environmental challenge. I will also bet that companies that prioritise data privacy will get to unicorn status faster than their peers that don't.</p><p>Emerging unicorns may also include pioneers in quantum computing which uses supercomputers equipped with advanced processing powers, as well as edge computing which enables connected devices like driverless cars to process data closer to where it is created, or the \"edge\". Essentially, edge computing will provide driverless cars with an alternative to sending data to a far-away remote server or a centralised \"cloud\" for processing. As edge computing gains traction, driverless cars will become a reality sooner than we all expect.</p><p>The recent implosion of co-working unicorn WeWork will likely have far-reaching consequences on deciding who gets funded and how long unicorns stay can stay private in the new decade. Valued at over US$49 billion by its VC investors, WeWork sought a listing in October at a valuation between US$75 and US$100 billion. By the time investors read through its pre-IPO prospectus, or S-1 filing, the firm was just weeks away from bankruptcy. It was bailed out by its largest investor, Japan's SoftBank Group, and is currently valued at just under US$7.5 billion.</p><p>The lesson we have learnt from the WeWork saga is that public markets are far better in separating the wheat from the chaff than a handful of VCs in the private markets. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son became the world's richest person at the height of the 2,000 tech boom by overpaying for tech startups. When the bubble burst, Son, whose net worth declined 95% in the aftermath, spent the next decade nursing his wounds until he struck gold with a US$20 million investment in Chinese e-commerce pioneer Alibaba Holdings which turned into US$120 billion, or a 6,000-fold gain. In the aftermath of the botched WeWork IPO, it might take Son more than just a decade to get his mojo back.</p><p>After the nightmare of the just-ended decade, tech desperately needs to get its act together and start delivering on its promise - not just as an agent of change or disruption, but also as a force for good.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y07-TG11-DYX1-T2HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Last week, the search \u00adgiant announced that it was formally tiptoeing into banking - albeit piggybacking \u00adCitigroup\u00a0and Stanford University's Credit \u00adUnion - to \"offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay\", a digital wallet platform and online payment system, from \u00adearly next year.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The partnership, codenamed\u00a0Cache, \u00adbetween one of the oldest banks in \u00adAmerica and a tech firm that has US$120 billion ($163.5 billion) in net cash and whose US$900 billion market capitalisation is equivalent to that of the top three US banks combined, looks like a marriage made in heaven. Citi is a distant fourth domestically among the Big Four American banks despite its huge global footprint. Until now, the big gaping hole in its US footprint has been its lack of a physical presence in California, particularly, the Silicon Valley, home of most global tech \u00adgiants.\u00a0</p><p>Google's announcement that it was getting into payments came just days after social media behemoth\u00a0Facebook\u00a0unveiled its own payment system that will be built into its flagship Facebook as well as Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook Pay will not only allow users to send money to each other, but also enable a user who sees an ad on Instagram to buy the product right there by just clicking on a \"Buy\" button.</p><p>Facebook is as profitable as it is because the ads it shows are incredibly effective in bringing consumers to a point of sale on the internet. Yet, how many of those ad \"clicks\" are converted to sales depends on how easy it is for you to complete the transaction. Facebook raced to launch its digital wallet after regulators and lawmakers gave the thumbs down to\u00a0Libra,\u00a0a stablecoin or a type of cryptocurrency linked to real assets. Because of its association with the much-maligned Facebook, Libra is now seen as dead on arrival, though the company has vowed to keep pursuing it.\u00a0</p><p>If you sign up as a customer of the new Google-Citi banking partnership, you will be able to access your new accounts through the Google Pay app if you are an Android phone user, or through Google Wallet if you are a Chrome user. Most Android and Chrome users probably already have some of their financial data stored in their Google-run digital wallet. This includes credit card details that they may or may not have linked to Google Pay.\u00a0</p><p>Now, of course you will be able to access a current or checking account as well. You can get your salary directly credited to your Google account, pay monthly bills such as utilities or, if you rent a home, even set up a direct debit to your landlord. Eventually, you would be able to consolidate all of your financial services needs - savings, investments, payments and insurance - into a single app that will remind you when your bills are due. And if you are one of those who can't seem balance your chequebook, don't worry, the app will do everything for you and even update you on whether you might soon be running short of funds or are on target to save as much as you normally do at the end of the month.\u00a0</p><p>Tech giants' grand plan</p><p>For decades, companies have tended to stick to their core competency rather than expand willy-nilly into all sorts of areas. So, property firms do not go about splashing money on semiconductor technology. Yet the Big Four tech giants have blown away the notion that they need to stay inside their own lane. Apple does not just make hardware and Google long ceased to be merely a search engine because they have juiced all the revenues from their core businesses.\u00a0</p><p>Tech giants want to be your operating system for everything in the digital realm as digitalisation - or the use of digital technologies to change a business model and provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities - takes hold. Businesses from newspapers to movies to finance are being disrupted as they are digitised and, as such, almost every other company is morphing into something akin to a tech company. And when almost every business becomes a tech business, companies with the biggest advantage are the big tech players, or the Apples, Facebooks and Amazons of the world.\u00a0</p><p>There were good reasons why companies did not veer off their lane or core competency in the past. For one thing, capital was expensive and it was far easier to make money in your own area of expertise than from venturing into the unknown. Moreover, property firms or manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods stayed in their own lane because they could not use their customers to build a semiconductor business, a social network or a search engine.</p><p>Apple\u00a0and Google are not only flush with cash - more than a hundred billion dollars each in net cash - they also have a huge, loyal and growing customer base they can tap to cross-sell just about anything. Apple has more than a billion customers worldwide and an installed base of 1.4 billion devices; over 1.5 billion people regularly use Google's search engine or watch YouTube videos; Facebook and its subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram have 2.5 billion users, and e-commerce giant Amazon.com has 350 million active users, of which nearly 120 million are Prime members.\u00a0</p><p>A quarter of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to credit. Let me repeat an anecdote that I cited in a piece I wrote on fintech a couple of years ago. Overseas workers from India, Mexico, the Philippines, Nigeria and other nations send US$550 billion in remittances back home, paying 7% to 10% in charges and fees. That is between US$38 billion and US$55 billion gouged from the most vulnerable people on earth. Tech firms using blockchain could potentially cut that down to 1%, or up to US$50 billion in savings every year that presumably will flow back into developing economies. Tech can be hugely disruptive but can also be a force for good.</p><p>In consumer finance, it is all about the cost of acquiring customers. Apple and Google make cool apps, have a ton of young, tech-savvy customers, many of whom do not have a bank account and are currently not interested in opening one because with ApplePay,\u00a0Square's Cash App,\u00a0PayPal's Venmo, Goldman Sachs-backed Apple Card or a Robinhood account, they can already access a variety of financial services including deposits and checking accounts, debit and credit cards, commission-free securities trading and virtually fee-free wealth management services.\u00a0</p><p>Consumer banking is one of the most heavily regulated industries on earth - more than even utilities. Compliance costs, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, are high and, indeed, for banks in many jurisdictions, still rising.\u00a0In America, only regulated banks and credit unions can offer savings and checking accounts that are insured by FDIC, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Moreover, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 is designed to keep banking and non-banking businesses separate to stop companies from \u00adusing their banking arm to push customers to their other businesses. So it is not surprising that Google, Apple,\u00a0Amazon.com,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Uber, all of whom have ambitions of offering an array of financial services, are teaming up with incumbents rather than seeking banking licences or entanglements with regulators.\u00a0Two decades ago, Walmart tried to go it alone in financial services, only to retreat.</p><p>Aside from Google's partnership with Citi, Apple offers Apple Card in partnership with Wall Street giant\u00a0Goldman Sachs' consumer banking unit, Marcus. Amazon, which has been negotiating with\u00a0JPMorgan Chase\u00a0to offer current accounts, recently broke off the talks. It has not said whether it would seek another financial services partner. Tech giants need the incumbents at a time when they are under siege for invading our privacy, surreptitiously gathering our data without permission and using it to make boatloads of money for themselves. Banks like Citi that are teaming up with tech giants bring to the table their regulatory and compliance expertise alongside their banking licences.</p><p>Valuable data</p><p>By getting into consumer finance, Google gets access to incredibly sensitive, intimate financial data about you - including your salary as well as your entire financial transaction stream - how you spend your money, where you spend it and what you spend it on as well as how you fund all your transactions. That's a lot of data that Google can leverage on. Sure, access to your search history, reading your emails or following you through your GPS location with your mobile phone already gives it a lot of data about you, but once Google marries that data with all your intimate financial data, it will be sitting on a treasure trove of to-die-for information. Add that to all your personal health data that Google will soon start collecting (as I wrote in my last Technology column) and you begin to realise just how powerful a hold the likes of Google have on you once they have all your data.</p><p>The big concerns are not just privacy or Big Tech using your data for micro-targeted ads; there is also the worry about who ultimately owns the relationship with the customer in the case of Apple Card or Google's Citi checking account. While banks need tech giants to help expand their own reach and access new customers cheaply, they do not want to end up like telcos, which once owned the relationship with their phone customers when they sold those clunky Nokia phones or indeed when they had a landline into your home. Customers now believe their real relationship is with Apple, not with Singtel in Singapore or Maxis in Malaysia, which are increasingly being reduced to being just owners of pipes or infrastructure through which your phone or tablet's data is routed.\u00a0</p><p>Do we really want Amazon, Facebook and Google to be our bank too? \u00adGoogle's foray into checking accounts through \u00adCitigroup is just a first step for tech giants to be serious players in banking. Whether regulators will allow it to access all of your intimate financial data to boost its profits remains to be seen.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKK-FX61-DYX1-T1WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Global investors helped drive Chinese tech stocks 70% higher last year, with shares of the two internet giants, Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, more than doubling as they chased high-growth tech plays. More recently, though, investors have been less enamoured with the duo as well as\u00a0Baidu,\u00a0\u00adJD.com\u00a0and other Chinese tech stocks. From their peak in late January to the trough earlier this month, large Chinese tech stocks were down nearly 15%, with \u00adAlibaba 19% lower. Although they rebounded recently, most are way below their January peak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, what has changed? Is it just the sentiment towards Chinese stocks in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump's tough talk on trade and tariffs as well as his vow to clamp down on intellectual property violations by Chinese companies? Or are fundamentals, such as margin pressures and a slower pace of earnings growth from the robust levels of last year, a factor? \"It is only natural that there was some profit-\u00adtaking given how well Chinese internet stocks have performed over the past two years,\" \u00adOliver Cox, portfolio manager for JPMorgan \u00adAsset Management in Hong Kong, who runs the firm's Pacific Technology Fund, tells\u00a0The Edge Singapore\u00a0in a recent interview.\u00a0</p><p>China tech stocks are not alone in feeling suddenly unloved by global investors. Trump's tweets about e-commerce giant Amazon.com, the sight of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg being forced to testify before the US Congress and Washington's attempt to regulate search giant Google's parent Alphabet have all weighed on the global tech sector. Yet, while an aggressive pushback against the erosion of privacy as well as monetisation of data in the aftermath of recent Facebook revelations has impacted US tech giants, Chinese internet firms are continuing to grow at a much faster pace than their US peers and are also able to harness the data more powerfully.</p><p>To be sure, although US internet giants and their Chinese counterparts may share similar business models, their medium- to longer-term outlooks could not be more different. In many ways, Alibaba and Tencent have an advantage over their developed-market peers. For one thing, China's population is more ready to embrace new technology without fretting about privacy. Moreover, the country's regulatory environment is not only benign, but Beijing has been a big cheerleader for its home-grown cham\u00adpions whom it is keen to nurture as global tech leaders. In addition to Alibaba and its ilk being able to collect more data more freely, as China catches up in artificial intelligence and eventually takes the lead, their ability to monetise whatever they collect, including data on their customers' health and finances, makes them more formidable players in e-commerce, search, gaming, financial technology and robotics.</p><p>Chinese internet players have long lived in the shadow of global giants such as \u00adAmazon, Google and social network operator Facebook. \"Investors have consistently underestimated growth in consumer demand as well as in e-commerce or online retailing or gaming or even search advertising in China, which have all ended up growing far faster than what the market anticipated,\" says Cox. They have also underestimated the Chinese giants' ability to chart their own course to the top. Tencent and Alibaba are ranked among the top six tech companies in the world by market value.</p><p>Eighty-five per cent of people in China still buy from physical stores. Having cornered 15% of the total market, Alibaba and Tencent are now going aggressively after offline bricks-and-mortar retail. Over the past two years, they have spent about US$20 billion ($26.2 billion) buying offline retailers as they seek to extend their control of O2O, or online-to-offline, \u00adretailing by pulling in shoppers who buy online from retailers with a physical presence. More often than not, Chinese consumers are using Alipay or Tenpay to pay for their online or offline purchases. Aside from digital payments, Alibaba and Tencent are pouring money into logistics and delivery as well as mobile digital payments. These investments complement their core franchises, Cox says.</p><p>Still bleeding on payments</p><p>One area that has long been touted as a key driver for China tech plays is payments. China has leapfrogged into a cashless society. Most people pay for coffee, food, indeed even roadside chestnuts, by scanning QR codes on their smartphones. iResearch expects digital payments in China to grow 66% this year. Both Ali\u00adbaba's 33%-owned affiliate Ant Financial and Tencent's 30%-owned financial arm WeBank were expected to list later this year but analysts say those IPOs have now been pushed to next year. Ant and its mobile and online payment system \u00adAlipay now boast a little more than half of China's US$17 trillion payments market with Tencent's affiliates having a big chunk of the rest.</p><p>As a private company, Ant does not publish financial data, but analysts covering Alibaba have tried to figure out its revenues and profits. Gregory Zhao, China internet analyst for Barclays in New York, estimates that payments accounted for 55% of Ant's US$8.9 billion in revenues last year. He expects payments' share of Ant's total revenues will decline to around 33% within three years as it grows its wealth management and lending businesses. Karen Chan, internet analyst for Jefferies &amp; Co, estimates Ant had operating profits of US$2.1 billion last year. Payments and fintech are a huge opportunity for Alibaba and Tencent, argues JPMorgan's Cox. \"Given that \u00adAlibaba and Tencent have a huge existing user base of people transacting on their platforms, it is only natural that they want to expand the usage,\" he says.</p><p>The way Cox sees it, Ant \"may look like a payment business today, but if you fast forward five to 10 years, you might be looking at Ant as China's most prominent financial group. The business model has already expanded beyond mere payments to include credit cards, other lending, banking services, wealth management, savings, pensions and insurance\".</p><p>Ant is reportedly raising US$9 billion from Chinese and global investors, including Singapore's Temasek Holdings, valuing it at over US$150 billion, or almost as much as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo combined. At that valuation, Alibaba's financial arm would be the sixth largest financial institution in the country, just behind Bank of China. Ant is indeed huge; its RMB1.6 trillion ($333.7 billion) Yu'E Bao money market fund makes up nearly a quarter of China's total money market assets.\u00a0</p><p>Bhavtosh Vajpayee, analyst at Sanford Bernstein in Hong Kong, expects Ant to lose money this year and probably next year as it tries to take market share from Tencent's financial affiliates. In recent months, regulators in Beijing have cracked down on high interest rate payday loans, peer-to-peer lending, money market funds and cross-border foreign exchange payments. For its part, Ant has put a 24% interest rate ceiling on consumer loans and caps on money market fund investments. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma has promised that Ant will be \"socially responsible\" as it expands its services. Ear\u00adlier this year, the People's Bank of China decreed that Ant and WeChat Pay should place 42% of their total assets into non-interest-bearing PBOC accounts, from 12% previously. Not being able to put this much-bigger chunk of money to use will cut into Ant's profitability, says Vajpayee. He notes that Alibaba and Tencent are involved in a fierce subsidy war that could cost between US$2 billion and US$4 billion over the next year. Alibaba is spending billions on merchant subsidies in order to make up for its smaller share in offline payments, he adds.</p><p>Cox does not see cut-throat competition and PBOC's decision to force them to set a bigger slice aside as a big negative. As Ant and \u00adWeBank expand, they are bound to come under the regulatory purvey of the central bank, he says. \"They still have a huge user base, they have all the data, they know how to monetise it, they understand how to make online businesses work in what will be, over the next few years, the world's largest economy.\"</p><p>The JPMorgan portfolio manager argues that the internet giants' huge investments in payments as well as growing investments in logistics and offline retail expansion for \u00adAlibaba, and gaming and video for Tencent should be seen as moves to build stronger foundations for future growth. He concedes that over the next year or two, their margins are likely to be compressed as they continue to make new investments across a whole range of businesses, but argues that they will remain extremely profitable. \"What that means is, in the short run, costs will go up and as such, we might have slightly slower earnings growth,\" says Cox. He argues, however, that this is what fast-growing businesses such as Alibaba or \u00adTencent should be doing: \"Securing the moat, expanding the network, strengthening the franchise and the entire ecosystem to build a platform for higher long-term growth.\"\u00a0</p><p>Whether it is buying offline retail companies or building a large global, fintech business that includes not just payments but also online banking, wealth management and insurance, the investments being made by Alibaba and Tencent are strategically very sound and significant and expected to reap substantial returns over time, says Cox. \"Investors are looking beyond one-year or 18-month margin pressures because these investments will lead to much higher margins over the long term and help expand the overall franchise and business of these companies.\"</p><p>Alibaba's Ant and Tencent's WeChat Pay and Tenpay have also been expanding their financial services businesses overseas. Tencent has identified Indonesia and Malaysia as markets where it will expand its e-payment services. Ant and Alibaba are shareholders in Paytm, India's largest digital payment firm. Last month, Ant paid US$184.5 million for a 45% stake in Telenor Microfinance Bank, a subsidiary of Norway's \u00adTelenor that operates a mobile app for financial services in Pakistan. But Ant and Tencent still have no presence in the world's biggest economy, the US. In January, Alibaba was forced to scrap its US$1.2 billion acquisition of US money transfer firm MoneyGram International after the Trump administration objected to the deal.</p><p>CDRs or home listings</p><p>As they spend to grow their franchise, one key driver over the next year for giants such as \u00adAlibaba, Baidu and\u00a0JD.com\u00a0that are listed in the US, and Tencent which trades on the Hong Kong bourse, is likely to be mainland listings. Beijing wants these companies to list locally so that Chinese retail investors as well as institutions can partake in their lucrative growth. Alibaba, Tencent and others are reportedly exploring Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs), although most analysts do not expect mainland tech listings this year.\u00a0</p><p>One big positive of CDRs is that they will help expand the companies' investor base among their core users in mainland China. Detractors say existing shareholdings may be diluted if CDRs involve the issue of new shares. \"If it involves the issuance of additional shares, it could be dilutive, but that won't stop \u00adAlibaba doing a share buyback and reducing share count,\" argues Cox, who notes that the tech behemoths do not need to raise money from the A-shares market. \"They have been self-funding for a number of years.\" Moreover, the listing of Ant Financial and WeBank and other affiliates as well as subsidiaries over the next few years will keep their coffers overflowing.</p><p>After years of heady 40% to 60% annual earnings growth, Tencent and Alibaba are headed towards 20% to 25% growth this year and next, notes Bernstein's Vajpayee. That still makes them among the fastest-growing large tech companies in the world. They are also seen as a \"safe haven\" of sorts for investors who are worried about rising protectionism, the spectre of a US-China trade war and punitive tariffs because most of their business is domestic and they are not under the threat of being punished for \"stealing\" intellectual property as Washington pushes to rebalance trade flows between US and China. Long after the brouhaha of a trade war is over, China's internet giants will still be collecting, harnessing and monetising their customers' data and boosting their bottom lines.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S63-MPN1-DYX1-T0N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Following a correction in early February and, again, in early April, the benchmark has been climbing higher despite rising interest rates and concerns over a trade and tariff war with China, partly because the high-growth tech sector is seen as a safe haven of sorts in the current environment. Concerns about US President Donald Trump's policy on China's access to key tech has in recent weeks hit stocks in the semiconductor supply chain hard, but even that has failed to halt tech stocks' march to new peaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Few portfolio managers know technology like Paul Meeks, 55, who has been covering tech stocks for 30 years. Meeks actually grew up in Singa\u00adpore while his father was Asia CEO of a multinational chemical company. At the height of the tech bubble in 2000, Meeks was senior portfolio manager at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, overseeing US$7 billion ($9.5 billion) in tech-related funds under management. Then the tech bubble burst and, like other tech-focused portfolio managers, he suddenly found his funds decimated. Eighteen years on, Meeks is chief investment officer of Portland, Oregon-based Sloy, Dahl &amp; Holst, where he manages a tech-heavy portfolio of more than US$1 billion.</p><p>\"Overall, the fundamentals for tech are still pretty strong compared with the 10 other sectors that make up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index,\" he tells The Edge Singapore in a recent interview. As such, it really is a question of valuation, and the concern is that they may be a little stretched, at least for some of the big tech names that make up the FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent Alphabet, he notes.</p><p>Still, Meeks argues that there is no \"bubble\" in tech right now, though he concedes that what started as a brouhaha over trade and tariffs has blown into serious friction and threatens to turn into an all-out trade war posing clear risks to the tech sector.</p><p>\"Frankly, there are still plenty of opportunities in tech for long-term investors,\" he says. Investors are drawn to tech, he notes, because it is among a handful of sectors in which they can still see secular growth in the current environment and the US is alone among the world's large economies that is showing strong growth.</p><p>Until recently, with record-low interest rates, investors were hiding in dividend plays or interest-sensitive sectors or cyclicals. Since rising rates are a death knell to interest-sensitive stocks, consumer staples, real estate investment trusts and utilities, investors are now betting there is more juice left in tech. \"So, the tech story is a combination of superior growth and where we are in the cycle,\" he says. Tech companies sitting on the biggest pile of corporate cash in the US are beneficiaries of a higher interest rate environment. They can invest more in R&amp;D and innovation, boost dividends and double down on share buybacks like Apple has done.</p><p>Focus on big themes</p><p>Meeks says investors looking to invest in the tech sector need to think of big themes that are driving innovation - such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, mobility, mobile payments and e-commerce - and creating the most disruption. \"Cloud computing is where the majority of IT spending is going,\" he notes. \"Within the cloud, the most attractive space is the 'public cloud' - or Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) - which includes Amazon Web Services [AWS], Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud.\" Increasingly, more and more workload is going from a company's own data centre to the public cloud. He expects the three major US players will be joined by Alibaba Group Holding, which is growing quickly in the public cloud space in China and across Asia. \u00adAlthough it has underperformed in recent months, \u00adAlibaba stock is up 11% this year and 218% from its lows of February 2016.</p><p>Within the cloud, there is also Platform as a Service (Paas), or a cloud platform where outside developers can write code. In that space, aside from Amazon and Google, there are players such as Oracle, International Business Machines and SAP. Paas is considered the least attractive area in the cloud space. A more lucrative area is Software as a Service (Saas), where players such as Salesforce.com, Adobe and Auto\u00addesk dominate, says Meeks. Others include newly listed electronic signatures firm Docusign, which is up 80% since its April IPO, and cloud storage provider Box, which is up 40% since February. \"Salesforce's pace of growth is slowing, but software is an area in which margins are still fairly high,\" he says.</p><p>Another theme Meeks likes is artificial intelligence, which requires massive computer power. The most successful player in that space is chip giant Nvidia, which makes graphic processing chips. Nvidia stock is up 29% year-to-date and 656% since early 2016. \"Their chips power data centres, big data analytics and artificial intelligence,\" he notes. He also likes the mobility theme and argues that autonomous vehicles and electrification of automobiles offer huge opportunities. \"These days, cars are covered with semiconductors and sensors,\" he notes. A favourite stock in that space is Dutch firm NXP Semiconductors, which is being acquired by US chip giant Qualcomm, though the deal is being delayed by Chinese regulators. (A major player in advanced driver assistance space, Mobileye, was acquired by Intel last year.)</p><p>Although the global smartphone market is likely to contract this year, the devices require an increasing amount of storage, which helps flash memory chip players such as Micron, Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix. Although DRAMs and NAND flash are commodities, the industry is essentially now an oligopoly, and weaker players have exited the market. The industry is less cyclical than before and, whether it is servers that go into data centres, high-end smartphones or tablets, there is a voracious appetite for their products, says Meeks. Micron stock, which is up 152% since January last year, trades at just five times earnings and has a 3% dividend yield.</p><p>A favourite theme of Meeks' is e-commerce, a space in which he believes Amazon, a stock that he owns, will become even more dominant. For now, he prefers Chinese e-commerce players such as Alibaba and Tencent Holdings because they are catering to a growing middle class in emerging markets. \"A better way to play the e-commerce theme is through Chinese firms that are catering to a growing middle class in emerging markets,\" he says.</p><p>He also likes the payments space. Of course, Tencent and Alibaba are big proxies for mobile payments in China and, increasingly, elsewhere in Asia, where AliPay and Tencent Pay are catching on. He owns Paypal Holdings and Square. PayPal stock has had a good run, up 120% over the past 18 months. Square has done even better, up 344% over same period. \"Square got some love when it said it would accept crypto payment and applied for a banking licence,\" says Meeks. It has since withdrawn its application and its stock came under pressure. The way he sees it, Square and PayPal still have plenty of room to grow even after their strong run recently.</p><p>Buy, if FAANGs fall</p><p>To be sure, the recent outperformance of Nasdaq has been driven by outperformance of the FAANGs. Can the big-cap tech stocks keep powering the rally? Meeks is not so sure. Facebook went through a tough period in March after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke amid mounting concerns about privacy. The stock plunged 25% from its US$203 peak to US$152. It has since recouped all the losses and touched a new high on July 9. Facebook trades at 25 times earnings but its growth has slowed to 25% annually.</p><p>\"I wouldn't buy Facebook at these levels, though there may still be 15% to 20% upside left,\" says Meeks. If Facebook were to tumble again, however, he would see it as a buying opportunity. \"The worries about privacy are exaggerated.\" Indeed, he believes that while internet players may face more regulations, it is unlikely to dramatically stunt their growth over the long run. \"It may slow the momentum, but won't derail the growth,\" he says.</p><p>Meeks likes Amazon but concedes that the stock has run up tremendously. He will not buy more at current levels but, if the stock falls sharply, he might be interested. \"AWS is a dominant player in its segment and Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player in the US,\" he notes. AWS is still growing at 40% to 50% annually, with 20% to 30% operating margins, whereas margins on Amazon's retail business are typically like a retail store's 2% to 3%. Amazon stock trades at more than 80 times next year's earnings.</p><p>Alphabet is another stock that he owns and likes. \"It's closest to my price target. So, on any pullback, it is the one I'm likely to buy first,\" he says. \"Google has shown a rare ability to transition to new products to stay rele\u00advant. Tech companies dominate one product but often struggle to stay rele\u00advant in the next tech cycle.\" Google</p><p>has a dominant share of search advertising, but it also built Android, the dominant mobile operating system. \"When we transition to autonomous vehicles, Google's Waymo will probably be way ahead of others.\" Alphabet stock, up 10% this year, trades at just over 23 times this year's earnings.</p><p>Avoid Netflix, Facebook rivals</p><p>One stock he is wary about is Netflix, which is up 118% this year, or 790% since January 2015. \"Netflix gets a lot of love from Wall Street, but it has just gone too far too fast,\" he says. \"It may also be reaching a saturation point in the US because everyone who wants Netflix already has it.\"</p><p>The key to Netflix is international growth. \"Its main driver is proprietary movies and documentaries, and they are expensive to produce,\" says Meeks. Until now, Netflix has had the field to itself, but Amazon is chasing the same market and the e-commerce giant can be ruthless in trying to grab market share, he argues. There is also Apple, which is expanding its content creation business; if the Walt Disney-21st Century</p><p>Fox deal goes through, Netflix will have another formidable challenger.</p><p>Meeks does not think anyone will buy Netflix, which now has a market capitalisation of US$180 billion. Apple rarely does acquisitions because its culture is that it can do things itself, he notes. Even if it were interested, Netflix would be tough to swallow. \"Apple is the world's largest market cap firm, with more than US$200 billion cash, but it is too reliant on one product: the iPhone. They generate a huge load of cash and there has never been anything like it in the history of the world, but how do they grow bigger? Apple desperately needs a new trick. But I think instead of buying a Holly\u00adwood studio, they should focus on the cloud and buy Adobe or Salesforce.com.\"</p><p>If there is one tech stock he would recommend investors buy right now, it is T-Mobile, the No 3 US phone company, behind AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p><p>T-Mobile is in the process of buying No 4 US player, Sprint. He likes T-Mobile because its stock is close to a 52-week low. T-Mobile has been taking market share from AT&amp;T and Verizon, which have been busy expanding in Hollywood and on the internet. \"As we transition to 5G over the next five years, T-Mobile could emerge as the biggest player, with or without Sprint, because their technology will be superior. They are tightly managed, aggressive, and Wall Street loves the CEO, John Legere.\"</p><p>Is there one segment of tech that investors should stay away from? Meeks is wary of some of the \"dangerous\" social media companies, which all claim they will unseat Facebook but have never come around to doing it. Twitter has had a huge run, up 170% since early last year, he notes. He is not convinced that Snap has much of a future. And even though it is well worn and among the most shorted tech stocks on earth, Meeks says no tech stock worries him more than electric vehicle pioneer Tesla. \"Tesla has a serious manufacturing problem and is burning US$1 billion in cash every quarter and has US$2 billion debt due between now and the end of March,\" he says. \"Everyone thinks Elon Musk is the next Steve Jobs, but he keeps missing his audacious goals. If it were any other stock, it would have been crushed by now, but he has an aura about him.\"</p><p>The way he sees it, competitors such as Volkswagen, General Motors and BMW are ready to roll out their own electric vehicles. Musk has a small window of opportunity and his time is running out.</p><p>If trade and tariff wars between the US and China get worse, Meeks thinks tech hardware and semiconductor stocks will be directly hit but, psychologically, every stock will be affected. \"Trade wars are scary,\" he says, but adds that long-term investors in tech will be rewarded once the dust around trade settles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STK-8CT1-DYX1-T2HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Edge Publishing PTE.

The\u00a0congressional\u00a0hearing,\u00a0part of\u00a0a wide-ranging antitrust probe of the tech players that have a combined market capitalisation of US$3.3 trillion \u00ad($4.49 trillion), will cover their potential threat to competition and innovation as well as whether their continued dominance is harmful to consumers or business rivals.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The moment of truth for global tech \u00adgiants\u00a0is finally here.\u00a0A decade\u00a0after the end of the global financial crisis that suddenly catapulted high-growth tech companies with their blitzscaling business models to the forefront as the new drivers of the global economy, US regulators are\u00a0cracking\u00a0the whip. Will search giant Google, social media powerhouse Facebook and e-commerce pioneer Amazon be reined in? Will the intense scrutiny of their respective business models eventually lead to antitrust action against one or several of them? Will they be regulated?\u00a0Are\u00a0Facebook and Google\u00a0in danger of being\u00a0broken up?\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Silicon Valley behemoths are in the crosshairs of global regulators not because they are among the largest and most profitable businesses on earth, but because they exploit the data we produce as part of the normal course of web browsing, app use and digital consumption as well as making sophisticated inferences about who we are, what we want and what we are likely to do.\u00a0</p><p>Harvard\u00a0professor\u00a0Shoshana Zuboff, the author of a\u00a0new book on\u00a0the business model of data harvesting,\u00a0The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u00a0argues that\u00a0Google and Facebook are primarily focused on gathering data about everybody and using it to manipulate choices available to people and getting them to do things or modify behaviour, shaping it towards desired commercial outcomes\u00a0like generating advertising revenues or e-commerce sales.\u00a0</p><p>Indeed,\u00a0digital platforms\u00a0such as Google and Facebook are today where the US chemical industry was in the 1950s when they were pouring by-products like mercury and chromium into fresh water, says San Francisco-based veteran venture capitalist Roger \u00adMcNamee, the author of\u00a0Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \"What we are seeing is the digital equivalent of a toxic oil spill where tech companies like Facebook and Google are not bearing the huge cost of the damage they are doing to society,\" he says.\u00a0</p><p>Under scrutiny\u00a0</p><p>Tech giants have been under scrutiny since late 2016 when Facebook was accused of allowing Russians to manipulate the US presidential elections that put Donald Trump in the White House. Since then, both major parties in America, the Republicans and Democrats, have attacked the tech giants for their political bias, privacy violations as well as for their business model of extracting too much data without permission and then selling and reselling it for profits.\u00a0</p><p>US regulators, Congressmen as well as President Trump have stepped up their attacks on data harvesters in recent months. The ascension of William Barr, a known critic of Big Tech, as the US Attorney General in mid-February was the tipping point in the case against the internet giants. \"A lot of people wonder how huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,\" Barr told his Senate confirmation hearings earlier this year.\u00a0Late last month, Trump in a TV interview said that the government \"should be \u00adsuing Google and Facebook, which perhaps we will\". The president also has a long-running feud with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns\u00a0The Washington Post, a constant critic of his administration.\u00a0</p><p>Antitrust investigations into large, powerful companies are nothing new. In 1984, US regulators broke up giant telco AT&amp;T into small regional \"baby bell\" phone companies, which eventually helped \u00adusher in a telecommunications revolution. Computer giant\u00a0IBM\u00a0survived a \u00ad13-year antitrust scrutiny between 1969 and 1982.\u00a0\u00adMicrosoft, which was the dominant player in the personal computer era, barely scraped through after an extensive investigation that began 1998. In April 2000, the Department of Justice (DOJ) ruled that the software giant be broken up, and even though that ruling was later reversed, Microsoft was distracted enough by the scrutiny to miss the internet revolution as well as the switch to mobile communications, clearing the way for the emergence of players such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, and re-emergence of Apple.\u00a0</p><p>In late June, DOJ finally launched an official inquiry into Google. The US Federal Trade Commission is investigating both Facebook and Amazon, while DOJ is investigating Apple. FTC has been reportedly working with Facebook for months on a deal that could result in a US$5 billion fine. FTC is likely to take other regulatory actions resulting from the violations of the 2011 consent decree that prohibited Face- book from misleading consumers about their data privacy and security. The social network promised FTC that it would get the explicit consent of users before making changes that overrode their privacy preferences. FTC is also investigating reports that Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg was aware that his company was in violation of the FTC decree as far back as 2012 and did nothing about it.\u00a0</p><p>To be sure, regulators are moving quickly because the US is in the early stages of a political cycle that will end with fiercely fought presidential elections next November. That aside, there is also a growing awareness that the world's biggest tech firms have issues that are bad for the US and global economy, emerging competitors as well as the consumers around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Very different cases\u00a0</p><p>Yet each of the cases against the four tech giants could not be more different. Tech industry analysts say the case against Apple, which does not extract personal data without permission or sell data to advertisers, appears trivial. Apple has been criticised for its App Store. Though the company has a mere 17% share of global smartphone market, its App Store accounts for over two-thirds of the total app revenues worldwide.\u00a0</p><p>Music streaming giant\u00a0Spotify\u00a0recently lodged a formal complaint with the Euro\u00adpean Union claiming that Apple uses its App Store to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice in favour of its own Apple Music service. Apple denies the charges and competition lawyers say the problem can been rectified fairly easily by changing the way Apple charges developers who sell their apps on its App Store. Both Apple and its rival Google Play store take a 30% cut from developers or a smaller 15% for in-app purchases. Amazon has some serious structural issues, like its ability to develop competing white-label products at the expense of its brand\u00a0suppliers\u00a0and then pushing them at its customers with all the data at its disposal. But Amazon, which despite\u00a0its dominance in e-commerce\u00a0has less than 10% of the US retail market,\u00a0is seen likely to survive any antitrust scrutiny.\u00a0</p><p>For Google and Facebook, the issues go to the heart of their business\u00a0model. \"Facebook's acquisition of Instagram was the greatest regulatory failure of the past decade,\" says Taipei-based tech strategist Ben Thompson, who writes the popular\u00a0Stratechery\u00a0blog. Regulators doubled down on the mistake by later allowing Facebook to buy WhatsApp. Yet that\u00a0does not mean the antitrust scrutiny will lead to severe action like Facebook being forced to divest or hive off Instagram or WhatsApp, a breakup of Google or being put under regulations that basically tie their hands. Still, in Google's case particularly, it is more likely than not that DOJ will force some changes to the business model.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg has been appealing to America's worst nationalist instincts by arguing that instead of being obsessed with the size and power of the Silicon Valley giants, people should be\u00a0concerned about the Chinese tech giants that are being nurtured by Beijing and allowed to grow without any obstacles.\u00a0America's attempts to\u00a0rein in Facebook and Google are putting its tech leaders at a severe disadvantage in key technologies like artificial intelligence, where it needs to be ahead, against the likes of China's home-grown tech champions like\u00a0Alibaba Group Holding,\u00a0Tencent Holdings\u00a0and\u00a0Baidu.\u00a0</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren,\u00a0a left-leaning Democrat and leading contender for a presidential nomination next year,\u00a0has emerged as the icon of the Big Tech breakup.\u00a0She argues that the tech giants are a clear\u00a0danger to American democracy as well as to competition, because there is a massive gathering of data without permission, which is then used in a way that consumers are completely unaware of. \"Not only do companies like Facebook and Google extract private data without permission, they pay very little taxes, if any,\"\u00a0says Warren, who has been particularly harsh on Amazon and has argued that Apple should be forced to hive off its App Store.</p><p>Warren and several other Democratic presidential contenders argue that if Washington breaks up the Big Tech companies, there will be more competition and more innovation, which in turn will only help grow the US economy faster. Silicon Valley's entrepreneurial world has been completely upended as Facebook, Google and Amazon have grown into giant incumbents. Every start-up these days has to have a plan to avoid competing with these giant incumbents because they would be clobbered if they do,\u00a0the way Facebook started copying everything that Snapchat did.\u00a0Indeed, the fear of the tech giants\u00a0is starting to stifle \u00adinnovation. The upshot of that is that start-ups these days are trying riskier business models that tend to be capital-\u00adintensive, lower-return businesses and venture capitalists are being forced to take bigger risks or walk away.\u00a0</p><p>When American regulators finally do get around to forcing Google, Facebook and others to pay for the cost of the damage they have wreaked over the past decade, they will be a lot less profitable.\u00a0Yet\u00a0that will not make\u00a0Facebook or Google\u00a0unattractive businesses - just more responsible players in the society.</p><p>Assif Shameen is a technology writer based in North America</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK8-3JG1-DYX1-T008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Edge Publishing PTE.

She's one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out. Political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the internet as a democratising force, but they've been dismayed by the rise of the \"surveillance state\", and the near-monopolisation of digital platforms by huge corporations. Last month Taylor and more than 1 000 activists, scholars and techies gathered in New York City for a conference to talk about reinventing the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They dream of a co-op model: people dealing directly with one another without having to go through a data-sucking corporate hub.</p><p>\"The powerful definitely do not want us to reboot things, and they will go to great lengths to stop us from doing so, and they will use brute force or they will use bureaucracy,\" Taylor warned the audience.

We're in a new Machine Age.</p><p>Machine intelligence and digital social networks are now embedded in the basic infrastructure of the developed world. Much of this is objectively good and empowering. We tend to like our devices. We like our connectivity. We like being able to know nearly anything and everything, or shop impulsively.</p><p>But there's this shadow narrative being written at the same time. It's a passionate, if still remarkably disorganised, resistance to the digital establishment.</p><p>Techno-sceptics, or whatever you want to call them, sense that human needs are getting lost in the tech frenzy. They sense that there's too much focus on making sure that innovations will be good for the machines. Of the myriad critiques of the computer culture, one of the most common is that companies are getting rich off our personal data. Our thoughts, friendships and basic urges are processed by computer algorithms and sold to advertisers.</p><p>The machines may soon know more about us than we know about ourselves.That information is valuable. A frequent jibe is that on Facebook, we're not the customers, we're the merchandise. Some digital dissenters aren't focused on the economic issues, but simply on the nature of human-machine inter- actions. This is an issue we all understand intuitively: we're constantly distracted. We walk around with our eyes cast down upon our devices. We're rarely fully present anywhere.</p><p>Other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy. The Edward Snowden revelations incited widespread fear of government surveillance. That debate has been complicated by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, because national security officials say terrorists have exploited new types of encrypted social media. Some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality.</p><p>There are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans. And the robot issue leads inevitably to the most apocalyptic fear: that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors, leaving us enslaved - or worse - by the machines we created. But something different is going on now, and it simply has to do with speed. The first commercial internet browser hit the market in 1994. Google arrived in 1998. Twitter appeared in 2006, and the iPhone in 2007.</p><p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is all of 31 years old. Our technology today is so new that we haven't had time to understand how to use it wisely. We haven't quite learnt how to stop ourselves from texting and driving. Some countries are taking aggressive action to regulate new technologies. Washington's political establishment, however, has largely deferred to Silicon Valley.</p><p>The tech world doesn't want more government oversight and regulations. But there's a new voice among the dissenters: Pope Francis. The pontiff's recent encyclical \"On Care for Our Common Home\" contemplates the mixed blessings of technology. After acknowledging the marvels of modern technology, Francis sketches the dangers, writing that technological development hasn't been matched by development in human values and conscience. The pontiff is saying, with his special authority, what many others are saying these days: machines are not an end unto themselves.</p><p>Criticism</p><p>Remember the humans. The dean of the digital dissenters is Jaron Lanier. He's a musician, composer, performer and pioneer of virtual-reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer-generated 3D environments. But what he's most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create. He feels Silicon Valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine. Although he still works in technology, he largely has turned against his tribe. \"I'm the first guy to sober up after a heavy-duty party\" is how he describes himself. Lanier's humanistic take on technology may trace back to his tragic childhood: he was 9 when his mother was killed in a car accident in El Paso.</p><p>He later learnt that the accident might have been caused by an engineering flaw in the car.</p><p>He made his first major move as a digital dissenter when he published an essay, \"One Half a Manifesto\", that began with a bold declaration:\"For the last 20 years, I have found myself on the inside of a revolution, but on the outside of its resplendent dogma. Now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream, but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy, it's probably time for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than I have before.\" Lanier later wrote two books lamenting the way everyone essentially worked for Facebook, Google, and so on, by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations could monetise. He'd like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments.</p><p>Other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that notion, however. Taylor, for example, fears that micropayments would create an incentive for people to post click-bait material. Lanier's broadest argument is that technological change involves choices. Bad decisions will lock us into bad systems. We collectively decided, for example, to trade our privacy for free internet service. \"It's a choice. It's not inevitable,\" he says.</p><p>Much of today's tech environment emerged from the counterculture - the hackers and hippies of the 1960s and 1970s who viewed the personal computer as a tool of liberation. But the political left now has a more complicated, jaundiced relationship with the digital world. The same technologies that empower individuals and enable protesters to organise also make it possible for governments to spy on their citizens. What used to be a phone now looks to many people like a tracking device.</p><p>Then there's the question of who's making money. Progressives are appalled by the mind-boggling profits of the big tech companies. Most painful for progressives has been the rise of the \"sharing economy\", which they initially embraced. They say that companies such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk are creating a \"gig economy\" - one that, although it offers customers convenience and reasonable prices, is built on freelancers and contractors who lack the income or job protections of salaried employees.</p><p>But dissidents do not yet form an organised, coherent movement.</p><p>Fact is, people are participating in a system willingly - if not entirely aware of what is happening to their data. - The Washington Post</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MERCSA-57529316</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MERCSA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HSB-79S1-F091-R05H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312450</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 04, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In his view, there are two types of Luddites: the old-fashioned hand-wringers who are spooked by anything new and innovative, and the \"soft\" Luddites - he would put Taylor in that category - who say they embrace technology but want to go slower, with more European-style regulations.</p><p>\"It's the emergence of soft Luddites that I worry about, because it has become the elite conventional wisdom in a lot of spaces,\" Atkinson said.</p><p>But he may be worried prematurely. A Senate bill to regulate self-driving cars went precisely nowhere. It's not as though people are marching on Washington to demand that lawmakers address the self-driving-car threat.</p><p>The technological resistance is not limited to nonfiction polemics. Fiction writers are picking up the thread, often borrowing from George Orwell and his dystopian masterpiece \"1984.\"</p><p>For example, Gary Shteyngart's \"Super Sad True Love Story\" is a tale of people struggling to find love and humanity in a world of Big Brother-like surveillance, societal breakdown and increasingly coarse social norms. The novel features gadgets that allow people to rate one another numerically on their sexual attractiveness. Not implausible: A start-up company recently announced its plan to market an app that would allow users to rate everyone on a 1-to-5 scale, without their consent. (After furious protest from around the Internet, the backers modified their plan to include only positive reviews.)</p><p>Dave Eggers's novel \"The Circle\" tells of a rising star at a Google-like company. She excels by answering thousands of e-mails a day, working at a frenetic pace. She lives with a camera around her neck that streams everything she sees onto the Internet. This does not go well for her.</p><p>And there's a new voice among the dissenters: Pope Francis. The pontiff's recent encyclical \"On Care for Our Common Home\" contemplates the mixed blessings of technology. After acknowledging the marvels of modern technology (\"Who can deny the beauty of an aircraft or a skyscraper?\"), Francis sketched the dangers, writing that technological development hasn't been matched by development in human values and conscience.</p><p>\"The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings,\" he wrote.</p><p>The pontiff is saying, with his special authority, what many others are saying these days:  Machines are not an end unto themselves. Remember the humans.</p><p>The dean of the digital dissenters is Jaron Lanier. He's a musician, composer, performer and pioneer of virtual-reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer-generated 3D environments. But what he's most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create. </p><p>He believes that Silicon Valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine. Although he still works in technology, he largely has turned against his tribe.</p><p>\"I'm the first guy to sober up after a heavy-duty party\" is how he describes himself.</p><p>He can typically be found at home in California's Berkeley Hills, swiveling in a chair in front of a computer screen and a musical synthesizer. Directly behind him is a vintage Wurlitzer golden harp. Lutes and violins hang from the ceiling. This is his home office and man cave.</p><p>Lanier, 55, is a man of considerable girth and extraordinary hair. He has dreadlocks to his waist. He hasn't cut his hair for at least 30 years and says he wouldn't know how to go about it. When a visitor suggests that he could see a barber, he replies, in his usual high-pitched, singsong voice, \"I don't know that term. Is that a new start-up?\" </p><p>Lanier's humanistic take on technology may trace back to his tragic childhood: He was 9 when his mother was killed in a car accident in El Paso. He later learned that the accident may have been caused by an engineering flaw in the car.</p><p>\"It definitely influenced my thinking about the proper relationship of people and machines,\" he said. </p><p>By age 14, he was taking college classes at New Mexico State University. He never graduated from college, which didn't matter when he wound up in Silicon Valley, designing computer games. He eventually started a company that sold virtual-reality headsets, but the company folded. In 2000, he made his first major move as a digital dissenter when he published an essay, \"One Half a Manifesto,\" that began with a bold declaration:</p><p>\"For the last twenty years, I have found myself on the inside of a revolution, but on the outside of its resplendent dogma. Now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream, but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy, it's probably time for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than I have before.\"</p><p>Lanier later wrote two books lamenting the way everyone essentially works for Facebook, Google, etc., by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations can mon\u00adetize. He'd like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments.</p><p> Other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that notion, however. Taylor, for example, fears that micropayments would create an incentive for people to post click-bait material. Stupid stunts - \"Hold my beer, and watch this\" - would be potentially marketable.</p><p>Lanier's broadest argument is that technological change involves choices. Bad decisions will lock us into bad systems. We collectively decided, for example, to trade our privacy for free Internet service.</p><p>\"It's a choice. It's not inevitable,\" he says.</p><p>Lanier told his 8-year-old daughter recently: \"In our society there are two paths to success: One is to be good at computers and the other is to be a sociopath.\" </p><p>She's a smart girl and knows what \"sociopath\" means, he said. And he understands the nature of this world that he has helped invent. That's why this summer he sent his daughter to a software programming camp.</p><p>Much of today's tech environment emerged from the counterculture - the hackers and  hippies of the 1960s and '70s who viewed the personal computer as a tool of liberation. But the political left now has a more complicated, jaundiced relationship with the digital world. </p><p>The same technologies that empower individuals and enable protesters to organize also make it possible for governments to spy on their citizens. What used to be a phone now looks to many people like a tracking device.</p><p>Then there's the question of who's making money. Progressives are appalled by the mind-boggling profits of the big tech companies. The left also takes note of the gender and racial disparities in the tech companies, and the rise of a techno-elite.  </p><p>Most painful for progressives has been the rise of the \"sharing economy,\" which they initially embraced. They feel as though the idea was stolen from them and perverted into something that hurts workers. </p><p>They say that companies such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk are creating a \"gig economy\" - one that, although it offers customers convenience and reasonable prices, is built on freelancers and contractors who lack the income or job protections of salaried employees. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, an investor in Uber and Airbnb, owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             \"What was billed as 'sharing' was actually 'extraction,'\u00a0\" said Nathan Schneider, a journalist and co-organizer of the recent New School conference on cooperative platforms. \"It's revealed to be a way of shirking labor laws and extracting resources back to investors and building monopolies.\"</p><p>He was speaking at a reception at the end of the two-day conference. The event was a huge success, with attentive audiences packing the panel discussions. These people are committed to reinventing the Internet.</p><p>             \"The story of the Internet has been one of disappointment after disappointment,\" Schneider said. </p><p>As Schneider spoke, Astra Taylor stood a few feet away, holding court with friends and allies. Taylor is tall, with striking features that give her a commanding presence. She was born to be a tech critic. She wasn't home-schooled, she was \"unschooled.\" Her parents in Athens, Ga., put her in charge of her education. At age 13, she created her own newspaper with an environmentalist bent. She burned with a sense of right and wrong. \"I was a serious child,\" she says, persuasively.</p><p>She says she'd like to see more government-supported media platforms - think public radio - and more robust regulations to keep digital powerhouses from becoming monopolies.   Taylor is skeptical of the trope that information wants to be free; actually, she says, information often wants someone to pay for it.</p><p>             The Internet, she said, is a bit like a friend who needs to be straightened out. She imagines giving the Internet a talking-to: \"You know, Internet, we've known you for a long time and we think you're not living up to your potential. You keep making the same mistakes.\"</p><p>The final event at the New School conference featured a stemwinder of a talk by someone Taylor considers a mentor: Douglas (\"I'm on Team Human!\") Rushkoff.</p><p>             Rushkoff, whose new book is titled \"Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus,\" provided a primer on the rise of capitalism, central banks and industrial culture. He suggested that civilization started making wrong turns in the Middle Ages. Centralized currency - not good. In the early days, every community could have its own coinage. We need to \"rebirth the values of the peer-to-peer bazaar culture.\" </p><p>             Growing louder and more animated as his lecture went on, he talked about the need to \"optimize the economy for humans.\" </p><p>                          \"Where do humans fit into this new economy?\" he said. \"Really not as creators of value, but as the content. We are the content. We are the data. We are the media. As you use a smartphone, your smartphone gets smarter, but you get dumber.\"</p><p>Taylor, Rushkoff, Lanier and other tech skeptics do not yet form an organized, coherent movement. They're more like a confederation of gadflies. Even Pope Francis's thoughts on technology were largely lost amid his headline-grabbing views about climate change. </p><p>Andrew Keen, author of \"The Internet is Not the Answer,\" sounds a glum note when talking about what the technological resistance might accomplish.</p><p>\"No one's ever heard of Astra Taylor,\" he said. </p><p>He didn't mean that as an insult. He was making a point about the whole crew of dissenters. No one, he said, has ever heard of Andrew Keen, either.</p><p>The world is not about to go back to the Stone Age, at least not willingly. One billion people may use Facebook on any given day. Jaron Lanier may not like the way the big companies scrape value from our lives, but people are participating in that system willingly - if perhaps not entirely aware of what is happening to their data.</p><p>Taylor's smartphone with the cracked screen clearly has been in heavy use. She knows these gadgets are addictive by design - \"like Las Vegas slot machines in our pockets.\" But she also has trouble living without one. </p><p>\"I need to learn to turn it off,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:joel.achenbach@washpost.com\">joel.achenbach@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f0a707eca9c411e59b92dea7cd4b1a4d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HPW-XGC1-JB4M-V0DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2933\"/><timeReceived>10:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 26, 2015 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

She has bandaged it with clear packing tape and plans to use the phone until it disintegrates. She objects to the planned obsolescence of today's gadgetry, and to the way the big tech companies pressure customers to upgrade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor, 36, is a documentary filmmaker, musician and political activist. She's also an emerging star in the world of technology criticism. She's not paranoid, but she keeps duct tape over the camera lens on her laptop computer - because, as everyone knows, these gadgets can be taken over by nefarious agents of all kinds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Taylor is a 21st-century digital dissenter. She's one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out. Political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the Internet as a democratizing force, but they've been dismayed by the rise of the \"surveillance state,\" and the near-monopolization of digital platforms by huge corporations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Last month, Taylor and more than 1,000 activists, scholars and techies gathered at the New School in New York City for a conference to talk about reinventing the Internet. They dream of a co-op model: people dealing directly with one another without having to go through a data-sucking corporate hub.</p><p> \"The powerful definitely do not want us to reboot things, and they will go to great lengths to stop us from doing so, and they will use brute force or they will use bureaucracy,\" Taylor warned the conferees at the close of the two-day session.</p><p> We need a movement, she said, \"that says no to the existing order.\"</p><p> The dissenters have no easy task. We're in a new Machine Age. Machine intelligence and digital social networks are now embedded in the basic infrastructure of the developed world.</p><p> Much of this is objectively good and pleasurable and empowering. We tend to like our devices, our social media, our computer games. We like our connectivity. We like being able to know nearly anything and everything, or shop impulsively, by typing a few words into a search engine.</p><p> But there's this shadow narrative being written at the same time. It's a passionate, if still remarkably disorganized, resistance to the digital establishment.</p><p> Techno-skeptics, or whatever you want to call them - \"humanists\" may be the best term - sense that human needs are getting lost in the tech frenzy, that the priorities have been turned upside down. They sense that there's too much focus on making sure that new innovations will be good for the machines.</p><p> \"I'm on Team Human!\" author Douglas Rushkoff will say at the conclusion of a talk.</p><p> You could fill a college syllabus with books espousing some kind of technological resistance. Start the class with \"You Are Not a Gadget\" (Jaron Lanier), move on to \"The Internet Is Not the Answer\" (Andrew Keen), and then, to scare the students silly, \"Our Final Invention: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era\" (James Barrat).</p><p> Somewhere in the mix should be Astra Taylor's \"The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age,\" a clear-eyed reappraisal of the Internet and new media.</p><p> Of the myriad critiques of the computer culture, one of the most common is that companies are getting rich off our personal data. Our thoughts, friendships and basic urges are processed by computer algorithms and sold to advertisers. The machines may soon know more about us than we know about ourselves.</p><p> That information is valuable. A frequent gibe is that on Facebook, we're not the customers, we're the merchandise. Or to put it another way: If the service is free, you're the product.</p><p> Some digital dissenters aren't focused on the economic issues, but simply on the nature of human-machine interactions. This is an issue we all understand intuitively: We're constantly distracted. We walk around with our eyes cast down upon our devices. We're rarely fully present anywhere.</p><p> Other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy. The Edward Snowden revelations incited widespread fear of government surveillance. That debate has been complicated by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, because national security officials say terrorists have exploited new types of encrypted social media.</p><p> Some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality. There are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans. And the robot issue leads inevitably to the most apocalyptic fear: that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors, leaving us enslaved - or worse - by the machines we created.</p><p> - - -</p><p> Technological skepticism isn't new. Plato told the story of a king who protested the invention of writing, saying it would weaken his people's memory and \"implant forgetfulness in their souls.\"</p><p> But something different is going on now, and it simply has to do with speed. The first commercial Internet browser hit the market in 1994. Google arrived in 1998. Twitter appeared in 2006, and the iPhone in 2007. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is all of 31 years old.</p><p> Our technology today is so new that we haven't had time to understand how to use it wisely. We haven't quite learned how to stop ourselves from texting and driving; many of us are tempted to tap out one more letter even if we're going 75 on the highway.</p><p> Some countries are taking aggressive action to regulate new technologies. The South Korean government has decided that gaming is so addictive that it should be treated similarly to a drug or alcohol problem. Meanwhile, the European Union law \"Right to Be Forgotten\" forces companies such as Google and Yahoo to remove embarrassing material from search engine results if requested to do so.</p><p> Washington's political establishment, however, has largely deferred to Silicon Valley. The tech world skews libertarian and doesn't want more government oversight and regulations.</p><p> One of the tech world's top advocates in Washington is Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, which receives about two-thirds of its funding from tech companies.</p><p> Atkinson is a lanky, voluble man who sounds exasperated by the rise in what he considers to be neo-Luddite thinking. (\"Luddite\" is a term dating to the early 19th century, named for a murky character named Ned Ludd, who inspired textile workers to smash mechanical looms.)</p><p> He's worried that books by people such as Astra Taylor will create a thought contagion that will infect Washington policymaking. In his view, there are two types of Luddites: the old-fashioned hand-wringers who are spooked by anything new and innovative; and the \"soft\" Luddites - he would put Taylor in that category - who say they embrace technology but want to go slower, with more European-style regulations.</p><p> \"It's the emergence of soft Luddites that I worry about, because it has become the elite conventional wisdom in a lot of spaces,\" Atkinson said.</p><p> But he may be worried prematurely. A Senate bill to regulate self-driving cars went precisely nowhere. It's not as though people are marching on Washington to demand that lawmakers address the self-driving-car threat.</p><p> - - -</p><p> The technological resistance is not limited to nonfiction polemics. Fiction writers are picking up the thread, often borrowing from George Orwell and his dystopian masterpiece, \"1984.\"</p><p> For example, Gary Shteyngart's \"Super Sad True Love Story\" is a tale of people struggling to find love and humanity in a world of Big Brother-like surveillance, societal breakdown and increasingly coarse social norms. The novel features gadgets that allow people to rate one another numerically on their sexual attractiveness. Not implausible: A start-up company recently announced its plan to market an app that would allow users to rate everyone on a 1-to-5 scale, without their consent. (After furious protest from around the Internet, the backers modified their plan to include only positive reviews.)</p><p> Dave Eggers's novel \"The Circle\" tells of a rising star at a Google-like company. She excels by answering thousands of emails a day, working at a frenetic pace. She lives with a camera around her neck that streams everything she sees onto the Internet. This does not go well for her.</p><p> And there's a new voice among the dissenters: Pope Francis. The pontiff's recent encyclical \"On Care for Our Common Home\" contemplates the mixed blessings of technology. After acknowledging the marvels of modern technology (\"Who can deny the beauty of an aircraft or a skyscraper?\"), Francis sketched the dangers, writing that technological development hasn't been matched by development in human values and conscience.</p><p> \"The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings,\" he wrote.</p><p> The pontiff is saying, with his special authority, what many others are saying these days: Machines are not an end unto themselves. Remember the humans.</p><p> - - -</p><p> The dean of the digital dissenters is Jaron Lanier. He's a musician, composer, performer and pioneer of virtual-reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer-generated 3D environments. But what he's most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create.</p><p> He believes that Silicon Valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine. Although he still works in technology, he largely has turned against his tribe.</p><p> \"I'm the first guy to sober up after a heavy-duty party\" is how he describes himself.</p><p> He can typically be found at home in California's Berkeley Hills, swiveling in a chair in front of a computer screen and a musical synthesizer. Directly behind him is a vintage Wurlitzer golden harp. Lutes and violins hang from the ceiling. This is his home office and man cave.</p><p> Lanier, 55, is a man of considerable girth and extraordinary hair. He has dreadlocks to his waist. He hasn't cut his hair for at least 30 years and says he wouldn't know how to go about it. When a visitor suggests that he could see a barber, he replies, in his usual high-pitched, singsong voice: \"I don't know that term. Is that a new start-up?\"</p><p> Lanier's humanistic take on technology may trace back to his tragic childhood: He was 9 when his mother was killed in a car accident in El Paso. He later learned that the accident may have been caused by an engineering flaw in the car.</p><p> \"It definitely influenced my thinking about the proper relationship of people and machines,\" he said.</p><p> By age 14, he was taking college classes at New Mexico State University. He never graduated from college, which didn't matter when he wound up in Silicon Valley, designing computer games. He eventually started a company that sold virtual-reality headsets, but the company folded. In 2000, he made his first major move as a digital dissenter when he published an essay, \"One Half a Manifesto,\" that began with a bold declaration:</p><p> \"For the last twenty years, I have found myself on the inside of a revolution, but on the outside of its resplendent dogma. Now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream, but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy, it's probably time for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than I have before.\"</p><p> Lanier later wrote two books lamenting the way everyone essentially works for Facebook, Google, etc., by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations can monetize. He'd like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments.</p><p> Other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that notion, however. Taylor, for example, fears that micropayments would create an incentive for people to post click-bait material. Stupid stunts - \"Hold my beer, and watch this\" - would be potentially marketable.</p><p> Lanier's broadest argument is that technological change involves choices. Bad decisions will lock us into bad systems. We collectively decided, for example, to trade our privacy for free Internet service.</p><p> \"It's a choice. It's not inevitable,\" he says.</p><p> Lanier told his 8-year-old daughter recently: \"In our society there are two paths to success: One is to be good at computers and the other is to be a sociopath.\"</p><p> She's a smart girl and knows what \"sociopath\" means, he said. And he understands the nature of this world that he has helped invent. That's why this summer he sent his daughter to a software programming camp.</p><p> - - -</p><p> Much of today's tech environment emerged from the counterculture - the hackers and hippies of the 1960s and '70s who viewed the personal computer as a tool of liberation. But the political left now has a more complicated, jaundiced relationship with the digital world.</p><p> The same technologies that empower individuals and enable protesters to organize also make it possible for governments to spy on their citizens. What used to be a phone now looks to many people like a tracking device.</p><p> Then there's the question of who's making money. Progressives are appalled by the mind-boggling profits of the big tech companies. The left also takes note of the gender and racial disparities in the tech companies, and the rise of a techno-elite.</p><p> Most painful for progressives has been the rise of the \"sharing economy,\" which they initially embraced. They feel as though the idea was stolen from them and perverted into something that hurts workers.</p><p> They say that companies such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk are creating a \"gig economy\" - one that, although it offers customers convenience and reasonable prices, is built on freelancers and contractors who lack the income or job protections of salaried employees. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, an investor in Uber and Airbnb, owns The Washington Post.)</p><p> \"What was billed as \u2018sharing' was actually \u2018extraction,' \" said Nathan Schneider, a journalist and co-organizer of the recent New School conference on cooperative platforms. \"It's revealed to be a way of shirking labor laws and extracting resources back to investors and building monopolies.\"</p><p> He was speaking at a reception at the end of the two-day conference. The event was a huge success, with attentive audiences packing the panel discussions. These people are committed to reinventing the Internet.</p><p> \"The story of the Internet has been one of disappointment after disappointment,\" Schneider said.</p><p> As Schneider spoke, Astra Taylor stood a few feet away, holding court with friends and allies. Taylor is tall, with striking features that give her a commanding presence. She was born to be a tech critic. She wasn't home-schooled, she was \"unschooled.\" Her parents in Athens, Ga., put her in charge of her education. At age 13, she created her own newspaper with an environmentalist bent. She burned with a sense of right and wrong. \"I was a serious child,\" she says, persuasively.</p><p> She says she'd like to see more government-supported media platforms - think public radio - and more robust regulations to keep digital powerhouses from becoming monopolies. Taylor is skeptical of the trope that information wants to be free; actually, she says, information often wants someone to pay for it.</p><p> The Internet, she said, is a bit like a friend who needs to be straightened out. She imagines giving the Internet a talking-to: \"You know, Internet, we've known you for a long time and we think you're not living up to your potential. You keep making the same mistakes.\"</p><p> The final event at the New School conference featured a stemwinder of a talk by someone Taylor considers a mentor: Douglas (\"I'm on Team Human!\") Rushkoff.</p><p> Rushkoff, whose upcoming book is titled \"Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus,\" provided a primer on the rise of capitalism, central banks and industrial culture. He suggested that civilization started making wrong turns in the Middle Ages. Centralized currency - not good. In the early days, every community could have its own coinage. We need to \"rebirth the values of the peer-to-peer bazaar culture.\"</p><p> Growing louder and more animated as his lecture went on, he talked about the need to \"optimize the economy for humans.\"</p><p> \"Where do humans fit into this new economy?\" he said. \"Really not as creators of value, but as the content. We are the content. We are the data. We are the media. As you use a smartphone, your smartphone gets smarter, but you get dumber.\"</p><p> Taylor, Rushkoff, Lanier and other tech skeptics do not yet form an organized, coherent movement. They're more like a confederation of gadflies. Even Pope Francis's thoughts on technology were largely lost amid his headline-grabbing views about climate change.</p><p> Andrew Keen, author of \"The Internet is Not the Answer,\" sounds a glum note when talking about what the technological resistance might accomplish.</p><p> \"No one's ever heard of Astra Taylor,\" he said.</p><p> He didn't mean that as an insult. He was making a point about the whole crew of dissenters. No one, he said, has ever heard of Andrew Keen, either.</p><p> The world is not about to go back to the Stone Age, at least not willingly. One billion people may use Facebook on any given day. Jaron Lanier may not like the way the big companies scrape value from our lives, but people are participating in that system willingly - if perhaps not entirely aware of what is happening to their data.</p><p> Taylor's smartphone with the cracked screen clearly has been in heavy use. She knows these gadgets are addictive by design - \"like Las Vegas slot machines in our pockets.\" But she also has trouble living without one.</p><p> \"I need to learn to turn it off,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-1363322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BD037F88F6F NWBKIA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J1N-21T1-JD6S-R44Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Tribune, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

She has bandaged it with clear packing tape and plans to use the phone until it disintegrates. She objects to the planned obsolescence of today's gadgetry and to the way the big tech companies pressure customers to upgrade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor, 36, is a documentary filmmaker, musician and political activist. She's also an emerging star in the world of technology criticism. She's not paranoid, but she keeps duct tape over the camera lens on her laptop -- because, as everyone knows, these gadgets can be taken over by nefarious agents of all kinds.</p><p>Taylor is a 21st-century digital dissenter. She's one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out. Political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the Internet as a democratizing force, but they've been dismayed by the rise of the \"surveillance state,\" and the near monopolization of digital platforms by huge corporations.</p><p>Last month, Taylor and more than 1,000 activists, scholars and techies gathered at the New School in New York City to talk about reinventing the Internet. They dream of a co-op model: people dealing directly with one another without going through a data-sucking corporate hub.</p><p>We need a movement, Taylor told the conferees at the close of the two-day session, \"that says no to the existing order.\"</p><p>Of the myriad critiques of the computer culture, one of the most common is that companies are getting rich off users' personal data.</p><p>Some digital dissenters aren't focused on the economic issues, but simply on the nature of human-machine interactions: Because of their devices, people are constantly distracted. They're rarely fully present anywhere.</p><p>Other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy. Revelations in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden incited widespread fear of government surveillance.</p><p>Some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality. There are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans. And the robot issue leads to the most apocalyptic fear: that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors, leaving people enslaved by the machines they created.</p><p>Some countries are taking aggressive action to regulate new technologies. The South Korean government has decided that gaming is so addictive that it should be treated similarly to a drug or alcohol problem. Meanwhile, the European Union's \"right to be forgotten\" law forces companies such as Google and Yahooto remove embarrassing material from search engine results if requested to do so.</p><p>One of the tech world's top advocates in Washington, D.C., is Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which receives about two-thirds of its funding from tech companies.</p><p>Atkinson worries that books by people such as Astra Taylor will create a thought contagion that will infect Washington policymaking.

She has bandaged it with clear packing tape and plans to use the phone until it disintegrates. She objects to the planned obsolescence of today's gadgetry and to the way the big tech companies pressure customers to upgrade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taylor, 36, is a documentary filmmaker, musician and political activist. She's also an emerging star in the world of technology criticism. She's not paranoid, but she keeps duct tape over the camera lens on her laptop -- because, as everyone knows, these gadgets can be taken over by nefarious agents of all kinds.</p><p>Taylor is a 21st-century digital dissenter. She's one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out. Political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the Internet as a democratizing force, but they've been dismayed by the rise of the \"surveillance state,\" and the near monopolization of digital platforms by huge corporations.</p><p>Last month, Taylor and more than 1,000 activists, scholars and techies gathered at the New School in New York City to talk about reinventing the Internet. They dream of a co-op model: people dealing directly with one another without going through a data-sucking corporate hub.</p><p>We need a movement, Taylor told the conferees at the close of the two-day session, \"that says no to the existing order.\"</p><p>Some digital dissenters aren't focused on the economic issues, but simply on the nature of human-machine interactions: Because of their devices, people are constantly distracted. They're rarely fully present anywhere.</p><p>Other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy. Revelations in 2013 by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden incited widespread fear of government surveillance.</p><p>Some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality. There are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans. And the robot issue leads to the most apocalyptic fear: that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors, leaving people enslaved by the machines they created.</p><p>One of the tech world's top advocates in Washington, D.C., is Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which receives about two-thirds of its funding from tech companies.</p><p>Atkinson worries that books by people such as Astra Taylor will create a thought contagion that will infect Washington policymaking. In his view, there are two types of Luddites: the old-fashioned hand-wringers who are spooked by anything new and innovative; and the \"soft\" Luddites who say they embrace technology but want to go slower, with more European-style regulations.</p><p>The dean of the digital dissenters, meanwhile, is Jaron Lanier, 55. He's a musician, composer, performer and pioneer of virtual reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer-generated 3-D environments. But what he's most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create.</p><p>He believes that Silicon Valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine. Although he still works in technology, he largely has turned against his tribe.</p><p>Lanier has written books saying everyone essentially works for Facebook, Google, etc., by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations can monetize. He'd like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments.</p><p>Other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Astra Taylor envisions a reinvented Internet that connects humans without using a data-sucking corporate hub.<br/>YANA PASKOVA/FOR WASHINGTON POST</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ORSENT-160104228786458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORSENT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HSM-0KV1-DY2K-G11W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Sentinel Communications Co.

Virtusa xLabs collaborated with senior technologists and business leaders to identify the most influential technology trends that will help businesses to stay competitive and drive growth in 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trends also expose new business imperatives that leaders need to capitalise on to remain competitive in the evolving digital economy. \"Being successful in the digital economy requires a transformation that goes beyond embracing emerging technologies,\" EVP and global head of Virtusa xLabs, Senthil Ravindran said.</p><p>\"It demands a new way of thinking, a design mindset that applies new technologies and agile processes to transform experiences while maintaining privacy and security. With the pace of change accelerating, leaders need to embrace evolving technologies and remain willing to rapidly iterate and experiment. Traditional business methods that worked a decade ago, are no longer effective in today's agile digital environment,\" he said.</p><p>Virtusa xLabs analysed over 150 sources from industry experts, trend spotters and analyst firms to help business and technology leaders to prepare better for the wave of digital disruption.</p><p>Crossing the next AI frontier: The release of open source DRL libraries last year is set to spur the development of commercial applications for AI. As a result, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a powerful machine learning tool, will move out of research institutes and into the world of business.</p><p>Collaborative Intelligence: What if machines could learn from machines, not just humans? This seemingly far-fetched prospect is becoming a reality. Collaborative intelligence imagines a world of multi-machine-human exponential learning, fuelled by recent breakthroughs in AI.</p><p>Open banking adolescence: 2019 is the year when banks and financial institutions start to take the opportunities around Open Banking seriously. A key regulation will be laid down in September, which will mark the beginning of a new era in banking in Europe. Core tenets include interoperability, openness, customer-centricity and innovation.</p><p>Finnovation for the developing world: Financial inclusion is about to move into the next phase. The developing world's new digital payment rails have enabled millions to gain access to the formal economy. Regulators, FinTechs, challenger banks and traditional banks have an opportunity to create the products and services to ride on top of those rails and transform whole communities in the process.</p><p>Crypto coming of age: Until blue-chip financial giants help to establish the financial infrastructure for crypto-markets, institutional investor participation will remain weak. This year, the world's biggest banks and financial bodies are starting to build those structures, sending a strong signal to market participants and heralding a shift to a higher level of cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Making our data safe again: Many organisations are hoovering up large amounts of personal data to 'hack the minds' of their consumers or sell on their insights to third parties. By the same token, businesses are becoming prime targets for cyber-attacks.

Virtusa xLabs collaborated with senior technologists and business leaders to identify the most influential technology trends that will help businesses to stay competitive and drive growth in 2019.These trends also expose new business imperatives that leaders need to capitalise on in order to remain competitive in the evolving digital economy.?Being successful in the digital economy requires a transformation that goes beyond embracing emerging technologies,? said Senthil Ravindran, EVP and global head of Virtusa xLabs. </p><p>He adds,?It demands a new way of thinking. A design mindset that applies new technologies and agile processes to transform experiences while maintaining privacy and security. With the pace of change accelerating, leaders need to openly embrace evolving technologies and remain willing to rapidly iterate and experiment. Traditional business methods that worked a decade ago, are no longer effective when applied in today?s agile digital environment.?Virtusa xLabs analysed over 150 sources from industry experts, trend spotters, and analyst firms to help business and technology leaders to prepare better for the oncoming wave of digital disruption:1. Crossing the next AI frontier: The release of open source DRL libraries last year is set to spur the development of commercial applications for AI. As a result, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a powerful machine learning tool, will move out of research institutes and into the world of business.2. Collaborative Intelligence: What if machines could learn from machines, not just humans? This seemingly far-fetched prospect is now becoming a reality. Collaborative intelligence imagines a world of multi-machine-human exponential learning, fuelled by recent breakthroughs in AI.3. Open banking adolescence: 2019 is the year when banks and financial institutions start to take the opportunities around Open Banking seriously. A key regulation will be laid down in September, which will mark the beginning of a new era in banking in Europe. Core tenets include interoperability, openness, customer-centricity and innovation.4. Finnovation for the developing world: Financial inclusion is about to move into the next phase. The developing world?s new digital payment rails has enabled millions to gain access to the formal economy for the first time. Regulators, FinTechs, challenger banks, and traditional banks have an opportunity to create the products and services to ride on top of those rails and transform whole communities in the process.5. Crypto coming of age: Until blue-chip financial giants help to establish the financial infrastructure for crypto-markets, institutional investor participation will remain weak. This year, the world?s biggest banks and financial bodies are starting to build those structures, sending a strong signal to market participants and heralding a shift to a higher level of cryptocurrency activity.6. Making our data safe again: Many organisations are hoovering up large amounts of personal data to ?hack the minds? of their consumers or sell on their insights to third parties. By the same token, businesses themselves are becoming prime targets for cyber-attacks. In 2019, we expect to see decentralised digital identity products start to gain market traction, giving back control to individuals and organisations.7. Never disconnected: 5G will deliver the internet at light-speed. Whilst not expected to replace 4G until 2020, marquee firms are already launching 5G smartphones this year. Significantly, this communication protocol is an enabling technology that will accelerate progress with other exponential technologies like AI and IoT.8. Interlopers in the boardroom: Design is starting to play a strategic role within digital transformation programs. Companies have witnessed the innovations that have arisen from Big Tech?s design-led culture and are now taking stock. They?ve also absorbed the fruits of the Design Thinking movement, the spate of CDO appointments, and consulting firms? discourse on the centrality of design to successful digital transformations. This year, design will be on the boardroom agenda.9. Health data you can trust: Health data management is struggling to keep costs down, remain up-to-date, and support patient needs. The Synaptic Health Alliance, a consortium of leading healthcare organisations, is applying blockchain to improve Provider Data Management. This will be a key test in the uptake of blockchain solutions for the sector.10. Omniscient Healthcare: The connected health market is rapidly transforming. Invisibles, a non-invasive wireless device, is causing waves with its ability to analyse the reams of data that your body transmits in the comfort of your own home. Be it wearables, telemedicine platforms, apps, or other digital healthcare services, the connected health ecosystem is maturing rapidly and will have a much bigger impact in 2019.The Almanac also contains some leftfield trends that will stimulate fresh thinking for innovation projects. What?s more, it provides an overview of the technology trends to give readers a rounded understanding of the trend landscape for 2019.To find out more, please click here to download a copy of the report: Trend Almanac</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOTELE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOTELE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHF-KF51-JC11-C3VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279499</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Total Telecom All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TT_magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009U53</classCode><className>VIRTUSA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541513 COMPUTER FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VRTU (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5V</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DG3K</classCode><className>DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

He adds: 'It demands a new way of thinking. A design mindset that applies new technologies and agile processes to transform experiences while maintaining privacy and security. With the pace of change accelerating, leaders need to openly embrace evolving technologies and remain willing to rapidly iterate and experiment. Traditional business methods that worked a decade ago, are no longer effective when applied in today's agile digital environment.'</p><p>Virtusa xLabs analysed over 150 sources from industry experts, trend spotters, and analyst firms to help business and technology leaders to prepare better for the oncoming wave of digital disruption:</p><p>Crossing the next AI frontier: The release of open source DRL libraries last year is set to spur the development of commercial applications for AI. As a result, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a powerful machine learning tool, will move out of research institutes and into the world of business.</p><p>Collaborative intelligence: What if machines could learn from machines, not just humans? This seemingly far-fetched prospect is now becoming a reality. Collaborative intelligence imagines a world of multi-machine-human exponential learning, fuelled by recent breakthroughs in AI.</p><p>Open banking adolescence: 2019 is the year when banks and financial institutions start to take the opportunities around open banking seriously. A key regulation will be laid down in September, which will mark the beginning of a new era in banking in Europe. Core tenets include interoperability, openness, customer-centricity and innovation.</p><p>Finnovation for the developing world: Financial inclusion is about to move into the next phase. The developing world's new digital payment rails has enabled millions to gain access to the formal economy for the first time. Regulators, FinTechs, challenger banks, and traditional banks have an opportunity to create the products and services to ride on top of those rails and transform whole communities in the process.</p><p>Crypto coming of age: Until blue-chip financial giants help to establish the financial infrastructure for crypto-markets, institutional investor participation will remain weak. This year, the world's biggest banks and financial bodies are starting to build those structures, sending a strong signal to market participants and heralding a shift to a higher level of cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Making our data safe again: Many organisations are hoovering up large amounts of personal data to 'hack the minds' of their consumers or sell on their insights to third parties. By the same token, businesses themselves are becoming prime targets for cyber-attacks. In 2019, we expect to see decentralised digital identity products start to gain market traction, giving back control to individuals and organisations.</p><p>Never disconnected: 5G will deliver the internet at light-speed. Whilst not expected to replace 4G until 2020, marquee firms are already launching 5G smartphones this year. Significantly, this communication protocol is an enabling technology that will accelerate progress with other exponential technologies like AI and IoT.</p><p>Interlopers in the</p><p>boardroom: Design is starting to play a strategic role within digital transformation programs. Companies have witnessed the innovations that have arisen from Big Tech's design-led culture and are now taking stock. They've also absorbed the fruits of the Design Thinking movement, the spate of CDO appointments, and consulting firms' discourse on the centrality of design to successful digital transformations. This year, design will be on the boardroom agenda.</p><p>Health data you can trust: Health data management is struggling to keep costs down, remain up-to-date, and support patient needs. The Synaptic Health Alliance, a consortium of leading healthcare organisations, is applying blockchain to improve Provider Data Management.

Virtusa xLabs collaborated with senior technologists and business leaders to identify the most influential technology trends that will help businesses to stay competitive and drive growth in 2019.</p><p><br/><br/>These trends also expose new business imperatives that leaders need to capitalise on in order to remain competitive in the evolving digital economy. \"Being successful in the digital economy requires a transformation that goes beyond embracing emerging technologies,\" said Senthil Ravindran, EVP and global head of Virtusa xLabs. He adds, \"It demands a new way of thinking. A design mindset that applies new technologies and agile processes to transform experiences while maintaining privacy and security. With the pace of change accelerating, leaders need to openly embrace evolving technologies and remain willing to rapidly iterate and experiment. Traditional business methods that worked a decade ago, are no longer effective when applied in today's agile digital environment.\"<br/><br/>Virtusa xLabs analysed over 150 sources from industry experts, trend spotters, and analyst firms to help business and technology leaders to prepare better for the oncoming wave of digital disruption:<br/><br/>*Crossing the next AI frontier: The release of open source DRL libraries last year is set to spur the development of commercial applications for AI. As a result, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a powerful machine learning tool, will move out of research institutes and into the world of business.<br/><br/>*Collaborative Intelligence: What if machines could learn from machines, not just humans? This seemingly far-fetched prospect is now becoming a reality. Collaborative intelligence imagines a world of multi-machine-human exponential learning, fuelled by recent breakthroughs in AI.<br/><br/>*Open banking adolescence: 2019 is the year when banks and financial institutions start to take the opportunities around Open Banking seriously. A key regulation will be laid down in September, which will mark the beginning of a new era in banking in Europe. Core tenets include interoperability, openness, customer-centricity and innovation.<br/><br/>*Finnovation for the developing world: Financial inclusion is about to move into the next phase. The developing world's new digital payment rails has enabled millions to gain access to the formal economy for the first time. Regulators, FinTechs, challenger banks, and traditional banks have an opportunity to create the products and services to ride on top of those rails and transform whole communities in the process.<br/><br/>*Crypto coming of age: Until blue-chip financial giants help to establish the financial infrastructure for crypto-markets, institutional investor participation will remain weak. This year, the world's biggest banks and financial bodies are starting to build those structures, sending a strong signal to market participants and heralding a shift to a higher level of cryptocurrency activity.<br/><br/>*Making our data safe again: Many organisations are hoovering up large amounts of personal data to \"hack the minds\" of their consumers or sell on their insights to third parties. By the same token, businesses themselves are becoming prime targets for cyber-attacks. In 2019, we expect to see decentralised digital identity products start to gain market traction, giving back control to individuals and organisations.<br/><br/>*Never disconnected: 5G will deliver the internet at light-speed. Whilst not expected to replace 4G until 2020, marquee firms are already launching 5G smartphones this year. Significantly, this communication protocol is an enabling technology that will accelerate progress with other exponential technologies like AI and IoT.<br/><br/>*Interlopers in the boardroom: Design is starting to play a strategic role within digital transformation programs. Companies have witnessed the innovations that have arisen from Big Tech's design-led culture and are now taking stock. They've also absorbed the fruits of the Design Thinking movement, the spate of CDO appointments, and consulting firms' discourse on the centrality of design to successful digital transformations. This year, design will be on the boardroom agenda.<br/><br/>*Health data you can trust: Health data management is struggling to keep costs down, remain up-to-date, and support patient needs. The Synaptic Health Alliance, a consortium of leading healthcare organisations, is applying blockchain to improve Provider Data Management. This will be a key test in the uptake of blockchain solutions for the sector.<br/><br/>*Omniscient Healthcare: The connected health market is rapidly transforming. Invisibles, a non-invasive wireless device, is causing waves with its ability to analyse the reams of data that your body transmits in the comfort of your own home. Be it wearables, telemedicine platforms, apps, or other digital healthcare services, the connected health ecosystem is maturing rapidly and will have a much bigger impact in 2019.<br/><br/>The Almanac also contains some leftfield trends that will stimulate fresh thinking for innovation projects. What's more, it provides an overview of the technology trends to give readers a rounded understanding of the trend landscape for 2019.<br/><br/>To find out more, please click here to download a copy of the report: Trend Almanac<br/><br/>Contact: Kavita Singh<br/><br/>Organization: Virtusa Corporation<br/><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kavitasingh@virtusa.com\">kavitasingh@virtusa.com</email><br/><br/>Phone: +91-7032334331<br/><br/>Source: RealWire         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHD-YDW1-F0K1-N4PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"936\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But many of the president's proposals have yet to be fleshed out -- and may require cooperation from Congress -- signaling more debate to come for the industry.</p><p>(Sign up for POLITICO's Morning Tech tip sheet)</p><p>\"The commitments outlined by <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>represent positive progress on key issues including transparency from the government and in what companies will be allowed to disclose, extending privacy protections to non-US citizens, and FISA court reform,\" AOL, Apple, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo said in a joint statement after the president's speech.</p><p>But, they added, \"Crucial details remain to be addressed on these issues, and additional steps are needed on other important issues, so we'll continue to work with the administration and Congress to keep the momentum going and advocate for reforms consistent with the principles we outlined in December.\"</p><p>The companies' response to Edward Snowden's leaks about NSA surveillance has evolved significantly over the past several months, from legalistic statements to demands for more transparency about government surveillance requests to outright lobbying for NSA reform in Washington. Top executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg made their point directly to the president at the White House last month. And they took out full-page ads in major newspapers highlighting their belief in the need for surveillance reform.</p><p>The changing strategy reflects the business pressures created by the surveillance revelations, with regulators worldwide threatening new penalties and market barriers for U.S. tech companies, particularly in Europe, where efforts are underway to toughen consumer privacy rules.</p><p>(Also on POLITICO: Full technology policy coverage)</p><p>Obama on Friday moved in the direction of tech company positions on multiple fronts. He called for a panel of privacy and technology advocates on the FISC and announced a new position at the State Department \"to coordinate our diplomacy on issues related to technology and signals intelligence.\" The White House also recommitted the administration to defending the \"open Internet\" internationally.</p><p>\"What we've been doing over the last few months resonated with the president, and that we've got a lot of work left to do as we turn a lot of these reforms into legislation,\" said Dean Garfield, CEO of the the Information Technology Industry Council.</p><p>Many of the details of the president's plan, however, remain vague.</p><p>Obama, for example, emphasized the need for surveillance transparency, a major issue for the industry -- but the White House didn't reveal much about how that would work.</p><p>(Also on POLITICO: Lawmakers praise, pan <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>NSA plan)</p><p>In a statement after the speech, the White House said only that it's aiming to \"enable communications providers to make public more information than ever before about the orders they have received to provide data to the government.\" It said it's still \"in discussions with the providers about ways in which additional information could be made public.\"</p><p>The administration has been locked in a legal battle with tech companies at the surveillance court over how much the industry can disclose about government requests.</p><p>The White House's plan of action also lacked details on how surveillance court opinions might be made public and specifics on the protections for non-U.S. citizens, according to sources close to the tech companies that issued the joint statement Friday.</p><p>Also unresolved: how the intelligence community will meet the president's call to minimize incidental collection of Americans' emails and other communications as the NSA pursues foreign targets. And the administration said nothing about the issue of encryption, which has sparked criticism in the tech industry after reports that NSA has sought to crack a range of devices and services.</p><p>The president at one point appeared to open the door to scrutiny of commercial as well as government data collection -- something that could subject tech giants to unwanted questions.</p><p>\"Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data and use it for commercial purposes; that's how those targeted ads pop up on your computer or smartphone,\" Obama said in his speech.</p><p>The president announced a new presidential task force to study \"big data,\" led by top adviser John Podesta and other officials. The review will look at how the public and private sectors are confronting the \"challenges\" to privacy in an age where computers can process and analyze once unfathomable troves of information about people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-102336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B9N-DH91-JDJ6-K22P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><timeReceived>4:44 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2014  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 17, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, September 5th. Your top stories right now, just after 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech goes to Capitol Hill today. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey will be questioned this morning on possible foreign influence over social media and accusations of political bias.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think it's about election. I think what it's really about free speech.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the conservatives just leave, then only the liberal voices will be on Twitter. And Twitter's a very powerful tool.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are bringing you the hearings live this morning right here on Fox Business. Join us for that.</p><p>Plus, trade tensions with Canada and China weighing on markets this morning.</p><p>Futures are off of the low right now, down about 80 points but still underwater given this nervousness over the trade deals that we are waiting for. Dow Industrials set to open down about 80 points, S&amp;P 500 down 6, and the Nasdaq down 20.</p><p>This, after a mostly flat close for the markets yesterday -- take a look at market performance where The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down a quarter of a percent with an 18-point decline.</p><p>In Europe this morning, similar story -- money coming out of equities. FT 100 down a third of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris down almost 1 percent, and the DAX index down one-half of a percent in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets also in the red overnight, worst performer Hong Kong, as you can see.</p><p>Meanwhile Tropical Storm Gordon has turned deadly. The tropical storm has killed a child and left thousands of others without power. The very latest forecast coming up.</p><p>Plus, do not eat, do not buy Honey Smacks Cereal. That is the warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You want to hear this. The very latest on an outbreak as a result of Honey Smacks -- we will tell you about it.</p><p>And all ages welcome here, a Starbucks staffed entirely by senior citizens.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break it all down -- our own Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff CEO and managing partner Mike Murphy, and the former CEO of Home Depot and Chrysler Bob Nardelli. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER: Great to be with you.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The hour just ran by, this first hour.</p><p>NARDELLI: It did. It's amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Busy show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Apologies for acting like I got shot out of a cannon at 6:00 in the morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, no, no. You were talking about an incident that happened yesterday in the Kavanaugh hearing. And I want to hear more about that because it went viral on the Internet -- Dagen. And we saw the picture of -- what was it -- somebody on his staff sitting behind Brett Kavanaugh when he was sitting there in the testimony.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Zina Bash was her name. And she was accused by many people, left wing nuts I might call them this morning, accused of making a white power symbol with her hand. This perceived white power symbol started out as an Internet hoax created to troll people.</p><p>Her husband, Zina Bash's husband is a U.S. attorney and he was forced to issue a denial on Twitter. It's really shocking what has happened. Hold on one second. We're going to talk about --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's ridiculous. There's the picture.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're going to talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're going to talk about this later. But I want to just point out that her husband has had to say \"The attacks today on my wife are repulsive.\" He goes on to say \"Zina is Mexican on her mother's side and Jewish on her father's side. She was born in Mexico. Her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. We, of course, have nothing to do with hate groups which aim to terrorize and demean other people.\"</p><p>That is part of what her husband had to say. But again, I think this goes to these hearing that we're going to -- that we're going to see on Capitol Hill today from these social media companies, these executives because I think yesterday was a tipping point where people are sick of this hate spewing and the bile belching by people on the left just to get what they want and they will stop at nothing when it comes to destroying people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Part of the issue, I think, and tell me if you agree, is that this president is having really good outcomes. And whether or not you like his approach --</p><p>NARDELLI: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- when you look at 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent economic growth as a result of the tax cut plan and the rollback in regulations. Or you look at foreign policy and, you know, the judges that he's put on the courts, people are feeling good about the outcomes. And his skeptics, the left, are going insane over that.</p><p>NARDELLI: I mean in business, Maria -- we always used talk about people who do things make mistakes. They never make the biggest mistake of all which we saw in the prior administration -- do nothing.</p><p>And so, you know, there are some issues out there that people take exception to. But on the whole, 4 percent GDP, regulation rollback, taxes, unemployment -- I mean, you just go down the list of favorability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And so they're attacking -- now they attack a staffer on Kavanaugh's team.</p><p>MURPHY: They are. And I think people have to realize what you see on social media, you have to read through it a little bit, like use some common sense because a lot of it is just people trying to get you to think one way a lot of times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely.</p><p>We've got all of that coming up this morning. And joining the conversation, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Congressman Greg Walden is leading the discussion in the testimony with Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg. He's going to join us first. Billionaire real estate investor and Equity International founder and chairman, Sam Zell is here. He'll give us his take on the economy and I think he is a seller. Former AIG chairman and CEO Hank Greenburg is here to talk China and the former prime minister of Italy, Mario Monte walks in on the trade discussions happening. Plus Fox news senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off with this, big tech is testifying. AS I first reported right here, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are headed to Capitol Hill this morning to face a grilling from lawmakers over potential censorship concerns on social media.</p><p>President Trump weighed in last week on the importance of transparency when it comes to sharing content online.</p><p>I also spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about the issue on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Donald Trump, President of the United States: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CAL), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: If there's a conservative being shut down, that voice is not being heard. And if this is where two-thirds of Americans are getting their news, it's not a fair process and this country believes in fairness. The Internet was created on fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us now to talk more about that is Mashable.com tech editor Pete Pachal. Pete -- Good to see you. Thanks for joining us. Your expectations today?</p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASHABLE.COM: Well, it's social media on trial part two, as I like to think of it. Like any sequel, it's probably not going to be quite as satisfying and the story line might be a little more confused.</p><p>So basically the last time this happened, Mark Zuckerberg was testifying and we were right in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And there was a big focus on data privacy and just fundamentals of how Facebook works. We had the top guy talking about it.</p><p>Now we have Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey. They're both big players, no question but now it's more general stuff about the election and what sort of meddling may happen and sort of the steps they're taking about that as well as what we've just been talking about, this sort of silencing of conservative voices or at least, perceived silencing according to them that sort of may be going on. And they're going to have to answer for what has been called shadow banning, at least in Twitter's case and other things like that, to see if they really do care about like the quality of the conversation on their networks and if they really are being true to the idea of having all voices being heard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are the downside risks today? I mean What could we see? What's the worst thing that could happen to technology companies in light of all of this?</p><p>PACHAL: Well, I mean, there's going to be some gaps, certainly. There's going to be some missteps. But I mean the thing that they need to convince the lawmakers today that they're doing is actually really trying to fix their networks in both ways, really, and trying to sort of facilitate healthy conversation which is what a term Jack Dorsey likes to use. But also ensuring that the sort of wide scale inauthentic behavior like we saw the other week with Iranian and Russian sort of networks on Facebook.</p><p>And they were sort of ousted, trying to sort of set the stage for the midterm elections or do some influence, sort of making sure that there's open stuff for authentic behavior and they're shutting down the inauthentic behavior. If they can't show that or they can't be convincing about that, there could be some issues either financially or with regulation down the line.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The point I was trying to make earlier, that I was making badly, ineloquently is that Twitter has a bigger problem I think and even Facebook and other social media platforms, maybe Instagram to a lesser extent, people are tired of swimming in the cesspool.</p><p>They're just going to turn away from it. There's nothing that Twitter can potentially do to solve that problem. It is nothing but people hurling hate across the political aisle.</p><p>And that goes for both sides. And people are sick of it. Because it goes beyond just words. It goes to they're trying to destroy people's lives.</p><p>PACHAL: Well I agree with you to a large extent. Because, you know, there's a question about just how much does Twitter even control Twitter? Because basically these outrage mobs that we're seeing are an outgrowth of some of the fundamental ways that Twitter works.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they knocked Candace Owens off of the platform.</p><p>PACHAL: Well yes. And the stance (ph) -- here's what Twitter is really inadvertently good at doing is amplifying extreme points of view; whether it's on the left or the right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of them are not so extreme though -- that's what I'm saying, you know. Some of the points of view are not extreme. Wasn't there a couple of instances where, I mean, they took things off for absolutely no reason and then they said sorry, that was a mistake.</p><p>MURPHY: So Pete -- I would ask about that, with the algorithms. Initially they're set up by humans. So, you know, Jack Dorsey's talked about it, yes, we have a left-leaning bias at Twitter. Is there a way to get Twitter to a point where there is no bias or is it ok with the bias, in your opinion?</p><p>PACHAL: Well, I mean it's hard to say to what extent the bias exists. I mean certainly there is a bias --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he said -- he said yes, we're left-leaning.</p><p>PACHAL: Yes. I mean the company is. But can those algorithms be programmed to be fair regardless? I think they can to some extent. And I think they also need to -- I think Facebook actually does this better in the sense that they want moderators in the regions of the places where they are rather than having everyone in northern California make the call on content and using like one filter. They want multiple filters throughout.</p><p>Now, Twitter is a smaller company. And they don't have the same resources Facebook has. But that kind of approach where you don't have like a bunch of people in an office in northern California making these hard decisions about content, I think it's probably the way -- a good start, anyway.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bob.</p><p>NARDELLI: If there is to be regulation, you just mentioned some best practices, should the government pick those best practices and impose that? I mean what would you like to see coming out of this hearing?</p><p>PACHAL: Big question, yes. I mean in terms of the government stepping in, I think, you know, obviously you want to keep that to a minimum. I think stuff with regard to elections is probably the most likely regulation we're going to see on the social networks.</p><p>But I would love to see a set of best practices come out from at least one of these networks and I think Facebook is kind of leading the charge here, mostly because they've been hammered the most and have thrown the most resources against it and hopefully see other networks adopt that.</p><p>But Twitter sort of has a totally different role than Facebook. I mean it's similar but they're more of a news curator. And like I was saying earlier there's so many things inherent to Twitter that sort of go against healthy conversation like we've seen it over the years with bullying, with abuse, people getting kicked off the platform or just leaving the platform because of all that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, this issue censorship, if you want to call it that, I know that the people who quibble over censorship is when it's done by a government.</p><p>But what Facebook does is more insidious. They made money. They've shown reckless disregard for people's most personal information for years and years and years. And that's how they make money.</p><p>They basically are selling in one way, shape or form your behavior, your most personal data about yourself and they let literally tens of millions people's accounts were compromised because app developers were able to access not only people's data who download the app but the friends' data as well.</p><p>That data is out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's spread around the world. Twitter -- not Twitter-- Facebook doesn't even know where it is.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, where is Google? Where's Google in all of this? Wasn't -- you know, during the California primary, if you Google California GOP what are the ideologies? A list of ideologies comes up and one of the ideologies was Nazism.</p><p>PACHAL: Yes. Google is such a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's not a coincidence.</p><p>PACHAL: -- vast, sprawling company at this point. I'm willing to sort of - - like there were other accusations of Bernie Sanders versus Hillary Clinton and there was a thing where the results that came up Bernie Sanders was sort of disadvantaged.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, if you Googled Hillary Clinton it was all good stories. If you Googled Donald Trump it was evil, evil, evil. I mean, you know, so there's that as well. It seems to me -- they're a media company, if they abuse their power, there will be consequences. Whether that's regulatory or money, financial -- we don't know.</p><p>PACHAL: Yes. And I don't think there's a room at Google where people are coming in and picking and choosing this stuff. But I do think some of the steps they take to, say, prevent misinformation, like if something is written about you that's false, I would not like that to appear in an auto complete or a search result.</p><p>So they have tools to sort of push that down. But I do think some of that does sort of get mixed in with this political stuff and that's where things can get really dicey.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pete -- great to get your insights. Thank you -- Pete Pachal.</p><p>Stay with us, live coverage of the Dorsey and Sandberg testimonies today; they're testifying before Congress at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. We'll have that.</p><p>Tropical storm Gordon slams the Gulf Coast. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are coming off of the lows. We are still looking at a lower opening for the broader averages. Trade tensions with Canada and China unnerving investors this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials set to open down about 75 points. The S&amp;P is down 5 and the Nasdaq lower by 18.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, tropical storm Gordon is slamming the Gulf Coast with heavy rain, powerful winds.</p><p>Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan is live in Orange Beach, Alabama this morning with the very latest. Steve -- good morning to you.</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Over the last hour or so we've seen conditions gradually weaken here along the coast of Alabama, some wind gusts of 10 to 20 miles an hour, big surf behind me, four to six feet high, crashing into that pier. The rain has been on and off.</p><p>Tropical Storm Gordon hit last night at 10:00 p.m. It made landfall on the border between Mississippi and Alabama as a powerful tropical storm. Sustained wind speeds of 70 miles an hour -- that's just under a category 1 hurricane but not as bad as some people predicted.</p><p>As far as the damage goes, at least one person killed by the storm in Pensacola, a tree came down on a mobile home, killing a child.</p><p>Here in Alabama, many people waking up to no power in their house, at least 20,000 people in Alabama without power.</p><p>The real concern now is from the rain. It's been eight to twelve inches in some areas. But this is a quick moving storm and right now it is moving north. So we could see some rain and flooding across the state of Mississippi over the next 24 hours. Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Steve -- we'll be watching that. Thanks so much -- Steve Harrigan this morning in Alabama.</p><p>Coming up, Supreme Court showdown, we break down Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing yesterday. The circus that it was, protests from Democrats across the board.</p><p>Then Toyota recalls over 1 million cars worldwide. Details on the vehicles plagued with a fire risk later this hour.</p><p>Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, it is a Supreme Court showdown. Democrats tirelessly demanding to delay judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation proceedings yesterday, interrupting legislators, insisting for more time to review documents on the nominee, protesters spiraled out of control, causing massive disruptions, even before being escorted out by authorities. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please vote no. Please vote no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kavanaugh must not be put on the court.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This (INAUDIBLE) is an attack on women's rights. It's an attack on democracy. Shut the hearing down now, I urge you. Shut the hearing down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Police arrested at least 70 protesters yesterday. This is the first day of week-long hearings.</p><p>Joining us right now Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst. Judge' it's great to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that was only half of it. When Grassley first welcomed everybody -- the, you know, interruptions, wanting to just stop the hearing all together from three senators. It was just incredible. Your reaction.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So I have a couple of views. I think to the general public it's government at its worst. I think it really shows how low and base and combative and unresponsive to the needs of the American people our elected representatives can be.</p><p>If you go a little deeper into the weeds, I think the Democrats have concluded that they're more likely than not to lose this and Judge Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh. So since they can't really lay a glove on him, they want to attack the process.</p><p>Now, some of their complaints about the process are legitimate. I mean dumping 42,000 pages of documents on somebody 12 hours before the hearing is a task impossible. And many of those documents were stamped with may not be discussed in public. Well, what's the sense of surrendering a document if it can't be discussed?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sort of like redacting everything.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes, exactly. But I think the Democrats must have taken a poll and decided that their base wanted to see this kind of acerbic, in- your-face, obstreperous, anything we can do to slow this down type of behavior because it certainly didn't gain any traction with members of the Senate.</p><p>There are three members of the Senate being targeted here -- Rand Paul because the Democrats are hoping that on some of these documents there's something Brett Kavanaugh said in the Bush years supportive of torture. That would upset Senator Paul.</p><p>They're also looking for something that might upset Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski -- and that would be some antipathy toward Roe versus Wade.</p><p>They also understand that it looks bad if you hold back a document -- it looks like you have something to hide. I don't think he has anything to hide.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It didn't hurt the FBI or DOJ yet.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It's not his personal decision not to surrender this. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1974, an act that shortly after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, you need permission from two people to release presidential records -- the person who was president at the time the records are made and the person was president at the time the records were demanded.</p><p>George W. Bush, who was the president at the time these were made, signed off on everything. He doesn't care. Donald Trump said 100,000 of these -- I don't want the public to seem them. I'm claiming executive privilege.</p><p>It's a little silly for him to claim executive privilege on a historic document that precedes his presidency for 15 years, I think. But he has the right to do that.</p><p>Today, however, we're going to see the Q and A directly in his face. You're going to see a very bright judicial mind, but one that is frustrated because he doesn't want to reveal how he stands on hot button issues like guns, like the administrative state, like abortion, like torture.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's getting in there -- Judge. You know, Zina Bash, we talked about this earlier, one of Brett Kavanaugh's former law clerks -- she's under severe scrutiny. Look at this picture right here.</p><p>A video circulated of her making -- she had her hands folded and some on the left were saying it was a hand gesture. They said it was a white power sign that she was putting there.</p><p>Bash's husband is a U.S. attorney. He came to her defense. And he tweeted this in part, Zina is Mexican on her mother's side and Jewish on her father's side. She was born in Mexico. Her grandparents were holocaust survivors. We of course have nothing to do with hate groups which aim to terrorize and demean other people. Never have and never would.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let me add to this. He called the attacks on my wife repulsive. \"Some of the Twitter comments have even referred to our baby daughter.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know that there are good folks on both sides of the political divide. I hope that people will clearly condemn this idiotic and sickening accusation. And the people -- you know what, the people on the left who are perpetrating this lie, perpetuating this lie online, this is what people actually see. They're not sitting and watching these hearings all day long -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well I -- first of all I agree fully with the defense by the U.S. attorney of his wife's behavior. I mean this is just over the top.</p><p>But it shows the decision of the Democrats and the hard left in this country to do anything they can to tarnish this candidate. What are they really trying to tarnish? The person who nominated the candidate. What are they really trying to undo relitigate, revote -- what ever phrase you want to use undo election of 2016.</p><p>This woman is the last woman that would be showing a white power symbol in that environment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even the Anti-Defamation League had to come out and that said this symbol thing is a hoax.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I have to tell you, though --</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was created online. By the way, all these people online, I saw them, these are well-known individuals who should know better, passing this information around while they're online. Go on Amazon and see if can buy a soul.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To me it seems like desperation. I think they're worried about the midterm elections.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think you're right. They must believe that this type of in your face, uncivil behavior will generate support among their base. It doesn't with me. It doesn't with Republicans. I don't know if it does with moderates. But somehow they think that this is going to help them with their own people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's make a lot of noise so that you forget that your paycheck is higher and the economic situation is a lot better.</p><p>Judge -- you know, it's good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Thank you. Call again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge Napolitano. Coming up, former AIG chairman and CEO Hank Greenberg is with me. He's going to join me to weigh in, on the escalating trade tensions with China, tariffs and a lot more. He's up next.</p><p>Then, a wake-up call for your breakfast cereal. Listen up. The new CDC warning for Kellogg's honey smacks. Do not buy them. Do not eat them. Back in a minute.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, September 5th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Trade talks with Canada starting back up today. Investors are waiting for another round of tariffs to hit $200 billion in Chinese goods. That may very well be executed this week. The trade tensions are weighing on markets this morning. We're off of the lows but nonetheless we're expecting the Dow Industrials to open down about 80 points, that's one third of one percent. The S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of a percent, and the NASDAQ with av24 point decline down a third of a percent as well. This after mostly flat close yesterday for the markets, Dow Industrials gave up 12 points. It was the NASDAQ that was down 18 the worst performer, a quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower. Take a look at the European Indices with the worst performer in Paris, CAC Quarante down almost one percent.</p><p>The Asian markets also in the red overnight, worst performer was Hong Kong. Hang Seng Index down 2-2/3 percent.</p><p>Recall alert, more than one million Toyota vehicles are facing recall this morning after reports that they could cause a fire. Is your car on the list?</p><p>Then the CDC is warning do not eat, do not buy, the very latest on Honey Smacks and an outbreak here for the cereal. You'll want to hear the latest from the CDC on that.</p><p>And all ages welcome, a Starbucks staffed entirely by senior citizens. All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.</p><p>But first this top story this half an hour, U.S.-China trade tensions front and center. President Trump considering additional tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods as the United States looks to up the pressure on Beijing.</p><p>My next guest has some words for Chinese leadership with the recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, titled: Some Friendly Advice for Chinese Leaders. You can't expect to keep receiving favorable trade and investment terms unless you reciprocate. Writes, Hank Greenberg.</p><p>Joining me right now, is the former CEO and chairman of AIG and the current chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr, Hank Greenburg.</p><p>Hank, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>HANK GREENBURG, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, C.V. STARR: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Now, that op-ed obviously comes after an incredible amount of experience. You were the first business person ever to actually set up shop in China and you've had an incredible relationship with Chinese leadership. How do you see the current trade debacle?</p><p>GREENBURG: Well, it's unfortunate. China is the second largest economy in the world now. It will soon be the first economy in the world. They have a billion 400 million people. We have 300 million. On size alone and all they've learned in the last 20 and 30 years makes them a candidate to be the largest economy in the world. They can't have the same benefits from us on trade that they had at the beginning. We helped them quite a bit. The op-ed points that out. And I would hope that the Chinese realize that and we come to an agreement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Before we get into some of your solutions and the things that you write in that -- in that piece. Recently we learned that now, the president of China, President Xi is dictator for life. What does that mean to America? Let's talk -- this is a -- this is an important development. You know, we've got a democracy. We're going to be leading -- we're going to be dealing with one leader of China for the rest of his life, certainly, as a dictator. How does that impact things?</p><p>GREENBURG: Well, you said it all. He made himself the leader for life. Now, is that going to stick? Remember, there's only about a billion and a half -- million and-a-half communist members in China of a population of a billion, 400 million. Are they going to be satisfied with President Xi for life? Time will tell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, doesn't it -- they may be -- you know, satisfied or not satisfied. But doesn't that impact the way we deal with China? Given the fact that he doesn't care. He's going to be the leader regardless. He could wait and they're in -- and they're in it for the long run, right?</p><p>GREENBURG: Well, maybe. Things change. You know, he -- currently he's the leader for life. Will that -- will that hold? Hard to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that China has been stealing intellectual property from America for a long time, forcing this transfer of technology. They haven't really opened their markets. Now they say in five years you will be able to own an auto company or other -- couple of other industries in China out and out, rather than having a 49 percent stake in a joint venture. What's your take on how fast China is moving in terms of opening its markets to foreigners?</p><p>GREENBURG: Very slow. And as what I said in the op-ed, and I'd say that to them face-to-face. They have to have equality now. They've been at it long enough. We've helped them for a long time and it's time -- it's time the market would open for both sides.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, in the op-ed you write the ways that the United States helped China develop over the years.</p><p>GREENBURG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do they recognize that past assistance? Is that going to be helpful in these discussions?</p><p>GREENBURG: I think it will be. Because I don't think, you know, many people remember all the things we've done for China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does China remember?</p><p>GREENBURG: Not to say. I think we have to remind them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, in terms of the intellectual; property theft, they will not admit that they've been actually stealing I.P.</p><p>GREENBURG: They don't admit many things, obviously. But, you know, that's going to have to change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, will it change, though, Hank?</p><p>GREENBURG: I think it will. I think it will. Will it -- will it be -- will they change enough to satisfy us? Probably not. But there'll be -- there'll be movement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What does the U.S. need to do? How are you feeling about the potential of an additional $200 billion of tariffs moving on this week?</p><p>GREENBURG: Look, the tariff is only one part of trade. Does trade create jobs? Does it help income? There are many things that it does. It's not just the tariffs. I mean, we have to keep that in mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you heard from your colleagues in China the leadership in China, to discuss the ongoing conversations with the U.S.?</p><p>GREENBURG: Look, I discuss it all the time with China, with very high level Chinese, and you know, they understand that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've met President Xi, obviously.</p><p>GREENBURG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think he views China's future as an equal of the United States or something more?</p><p>GREENBURG: Could be something more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, tell us about that.</p><p>GREENBURG: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How did does he view China? What is he looking to do?</p><p>GREENBURG: He wants to make China back to what it was a couple hundred years ago, the Middle Kingdom, at least. And -- but it's going to go beyond that. He wants to control all of Asia, I believe, and, you know, he occupied the South China Sea islands and they're not supposed to be militarized. They are militarized. And so that's a concern. So I think we have -- we have problems with China. We have to resolve them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, isn't it also true that they want to be the leader in many of the industries that the U.S. is trying to be the leader in, like A.I., like, you know, certain technology in terms of -- you know, technology, driverless cars, whatever the leading technology is that we're looking at as the growth industries of the future, that's what they want to win.</p><p>GREENBURG: Well, you can't blame them for wanting to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, sure.</p><p>GREENBURG: That's a -- it's up to them. Remember, many Chinese went to school in the United States. Thousands of them. They go back, many of them, better educated and more willing to do things that they weren't able to do before. That's normal. But that doesn't mean we have to be enemies. We have to have a constructive relationship with China.</p><p>A world with the United States and China as allies is a much safer world than if we're not. And that's an important part of this whole conversation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you want to say to President Trump as he deals with the leadership in China right now?</p><p>GREENBURG: We've got to find a solution. It can't be just increasing tariffs. I mean that's -- China has to recognize, they have to give foreign companies equality in doing business in China, same as they want in our country. And that has to happen. I think most Chinese businessmen understand that now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because isn't it true that China is now using its economic power for its military complex? You know, we spoke with Devin Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee on the House, and he basically said they're creating military bases and complexes right up to sea level, getting their -- the best position across the world, not even near Asia.</p><p>GREENBURG: Well, I'm not too worried about that part of it. I think what they've done in the South China Sea is I'm concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why? Tell us about that.</p><p>GREENBURG: Yes, these little islands that they claim that China over the - - over the centuries had owned, there's no -- there's no evidence of that. If they went to court, in the -- in the world court, and they were denied that they had the right to that, they went ahead anyway.</p><p>And it was during the -- during the Obama administration, we did nothing. And now it would be -- now it would be very difficult to extract them from those -- from those islands.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In your view, will the U.S. be successful in opening up markets, in getting to -- getting China to change its behavior?</p><p>GREENBURG: I'm not sure they'll change their behavior willingly but I think there'll be change in many areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And if there isn't? They're the two largest economies in the world.</p><p>GREENBURG: Then we'll -- then we'll have a trade conflict.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GREENBURG: And it's not in our interest, not in their interest. I saw the other day, -- you now, China is building this one road, one infrastructure around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GREENBURG: I see that we're going to do $60 billion of that ourselves. We just announced it over the weekend.</p><p>And so, you know, we do have some conflicts. That's inevitable. But doesn't have to mean that we're enemies. Doesn't have to mean that we don't try to solve these problems. I think we can solve a lot of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the infrastructure announcement was what specifically over the weekend?</p><p>GREENBURG: That we're going to -- we're going to build, with a one -- with one road, one belt, what the Chinese are doing, we're going to be competing with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Hank, it's great to get your insights on these.</p><p>GREENBURG: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>GREENBURG: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hank Greenberg is the chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr.</p><p>President Trump is tweeting on Bob Woodward's new book this morning, here's what he just wrote. Isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or book totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost. Don't know why Washington politicians don't change libel laws.</p><p>All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, Toyota is recalling over a million cars across the world. The new warning from vehicles plagued with a fire risk coming up.</p><p>And then a heartwarming cup of Joe. Details on the first Starbucks reportedly run entirely by senior citizens. Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. An American hero killed in an insider attack in Afghanistan. Cheryl Casone with the detail, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, 42-year-old army command sergeant major Timothy Bolyard was killed by a member of the Afghan National Police. He was the highest enlisted soldier supporting the Trump's administration new advisor brigade. The command sergeant major awarded the bronze star, the nation's fourth highest military decoration on six different occasions. Two were given with valor, meaning they were granted for heroic acts. He was on his 13th deployment overseas.</p><p>Well, another headlines this morning, Toyota is recalling more than one million vehicles to repair a problem with the electrical system that could start a fire. The affected models include Prius and C-HR Crossover, SUVs, most of these were made in Japan between June 2015 and last May. Toyota spokesman says 192,000 Prius cars are going to be recalled here in the United States.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Toyota, stock is trading almost one percent lower in the premarket right now.</p><p>Well, the CDC says that 30 more people have gotten sick after eating Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. That's a total of 130 cases now over 36 states. And that includes 34 people that have been hospitalized.</p><p>Despite the salmonella contamination that was linked to the cereal Honey Smacks is still being sold in some stores. In June, Kellogg's recalled over a million cases of the cereal from more than 30 states due to the potential contamination.</p><p>Well, now the CDC is adding three more states to the list that have reported cases of illness now including Delaware, Maine, and Minnesota. Shares of Kellogg are up about five percent so far this year.</p><p>And here's a first, if you're a certain age, looking for a job, you're in luck. Starbucks is letting only senior citizens run one of its cafes in Mexico City. This is the first in the company's history. This is a result of a partnership between Starbucks and the National Institute for the Elderly which offers of course, jobs to seniors. Starbucks Mexico reportedly plans to provide employment to 100 senior adults by next year.</p><p>Taking a look at the stock right now, down seven percent this year.</p><p>By the way, Maria, all of the employees, it's going to be an entirely senior citizen run store, they have to be or they are right now between the ages of 55 and 60 and they get medical benefits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that.</p><p>CASONE: My God.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We all love that.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The nicest person I've run into in an Apple store was this retired older gentleman who helped me and who knew more than the guy who was maybe 50 years his junior.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, the economy under Trump, we are taking a closer look ahead of the August jobs report. We got the preview Big Friday this week. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets have been under pressure this morning. Take a look at Futures, indicating a decline of 90 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average and 27 points on the NASDAQ.</p><p>Second quarter growth was pretty impressive. September though is historically a slow month for markets. What will help bolster their confidence?</p><p>Joining us now is Troy Gayeski he's senior portfolio manager of SkyBridge Capital. And Troy, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL: Yes, great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expecting a tough September for markets?</p><p>GAYESKI: Well, given the recent run-up we are expecting more consolidation. I mean, if you look at the path of this year we had a huge run-up in January, then a correction and a long period of consolidation. We've only recently made new highs. And now some of the dark clouds are gathering in terms of trade, other issues, slower growth overseas, emerging markets are in the midst of almost a full-blown crisis now.</p><p>So, we are expecting a slightly tougher month. That being said, we don't expect a correction north of 10 percent, maybe two to three percent, upside to five. So there's no reason to overreact in the short term. Because the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are still extremely strong.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF: I agree with you, Troy, on your assessment. But what I -- what I take a bullish stance on is that, you're getting so many negatives in the market. You know, you hear the old expression in the markets climbs the wall.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: But we're nowhere close to where everybody is saying, you know, sell your house, get in the market, you need to be in the market with everything you have. So I think as long as that concern and worry is out there, it's a bullish sign for the market.</p><p>GAYESKI: We don't disagree over the medium to long term. The point is, over the next week or two, with some of these issues festering, particularly overseas, you see Indonesia been the latest emerging mark to get taken down last night and today, that just argues for softness over the next week or two. But over the medium to long-term, we expect this bull market to continue and newer highs to be made.</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, CHRYSLER AND HOME DEPOT: We were talking earlier, some of the areas that you're now focusing on relative to investment. Why don't you share with us what those are?</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes. So, we continue to focus on the credit quality of regional community banks. You know, if you think of the massive regulatory relief that's occurred there, the benefits of from tax reform, there's also benefits in terms of better lending margins there than the larger banks.</p><p>What you have is a setup where you can make, you know, high single digit cash flows. Because these are floating rate securities, they're still low dollar prices. And at the same time, you're going to get paid your principal back faster. So, we think that's -- you know, a low teens type return profile for the next several years with much less downside risk if we do have a surprise bear market or recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We got the Friday job reports out this week.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The August jobs numbers. You say if we see less or fewer than 200,000 jobs it signals a path toward overheating the market.</p><p>GAYESKI: Well, the point there is if, say we get a 150 number and at the same time unemployment drops 3.7 to 3.8. What that means is there's a little more pressure on the Fed to hike because we don't have as many marginally attached workers to pull back in.</p><p>That's been really the big success that, you know, that Janet Yellen has, is pulling marginally attached workers and now Jay Powell back in the labor force, running things little hotter than perhaps a lot of the Phillips curve crowd would've thought in terms of inflation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you want to short this market right here?</p><p>GAYESKI: No, it's a -- it's a losing bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Yes, because you look at where technology is, trillion dollar companies, now Amazon joins the trillion dollar club.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, shorting tech in the strike is the way to bullet fast.</p><p>NARDELLI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good quote.</p><p>GAYESKI: You just ask -- you just ask people from the 90s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Troy Gayeski.</p><p>Stay with Fox Business. Our special coverage of jobs in America, Friday morning 8:00 a.m. eastern right here. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday September 5th. Your top stories right now just after 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018090502cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6B-DCW1-JB20-G3FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00020JR</classCode><className>STARBUCKS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS722515 SNACK &amp;

Join us for that.</p><p>Plus, trade tensions with Canada and China weighing on markets this  morning.</p><p>Futures are off of the low right now, down about 80 points but still  underwater given this nervousness over the trade deals that we are waiting  for.  Dow Industrials set to open down about 80 points, S&amp;P 500 down 6, and  the Nasdaq down 20.</p><p>This, after a mostly flat close for the markets yesterday -- take a look at  market performance where The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down a quarter  of a percent with an 18-point decline.</p><p>In Europe this morning, similar story -- money coming out of equities.  FT  100 down a third of a percent, CAC 40 in Paris down almost 1 percent, and  the DAX index down one-half of a percent in Germany.</p><p>Asian markets also in the red overnight, worst performer Hong Kong, as you  can see.</p><p>Meanwhile Tropical Storm Gordon has turned deadly.  The tropical storm has  killed a child and left thousands of others without power.  The very latest  forecast coming up.</p><p>Plus, do not eat, do not buy Honey Smacks Cereal.  That is the warning from  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  You want to hear this.   The very latest on an outbreak as a result of Honey Smacks -- we will tell  you about it.</p><p>And all ages welcome here, a Starbucks staffed entirely by senior citizens.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break  it all down -- our own Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff CEO and managing partner  Mike Murphy, and the former CEO of Home Depot and Chrysler Bob Nardelli.   Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO OF HOME DEPOT AND CHRYSLER:  Great to be with you.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The hour just ran by, this first hour.</p><p>NARDELLI:  It did.  It's amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Busy show.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Apologies for acting like I got shot out of a cannon at 6:00 in  the morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, no.  You were talking about an incident that happened  yesterday in the Kavanaugh hearing.  And I want to hear more about that  because it went viral on the Internet -- Dagen.  And we saw the picture of  -- what was it -- somebody on his staff sitting behind Brett Kavanaugh when  he was sitting there in the testimony.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Zina Bash was her name.  And she was accused by many  people, left wing nuts I might call them this morning, accused of making a  white power symbol with her hand.  This perceived white power symbol  started out as an Internet hoax created to troll people.</p><p>Her husband, Zina Bash's husband is a U.S. attorney and he was forced to  issue a denial on Twitter.  It's really shocking what has happened.  Hold  on one second.  We're going to talk about -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's ridiculous.  There's the picture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's ridiculous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about this later.  But I want to just point  out that her husband has had to say \"The attacks today on my wife are  repulsive.\"  He goes on to say \"Zina is Mexican on her mother's side and  Jewish on her father's side.  She was born in Mexico.  Her grandparents  were Holocaust survivors.  We, of course, have nothing to do with hate  groups which aim to terrorize and demean other people.\"</p><p>That is part of what her husband had to say.  But again, I think this goes  to these hearing that we're going to -- that we're going to see on Capitol  Hill today from these social media companies, these executives because I  think yesterday was a tipping point where people are sick of this hate  spewing and the bile belching by people on the left just to get what they  want and they will stop at nothing when it comes to destroying people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Part of the issue, I think, and tell me if you agree, is  that this president is having really good outcomes.  And whether or not you  like his approach -- </p><p>NARDELLI:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- when you look at 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent economic growth  as a result of the tax cut plan and the rollback in regulations.  Or you  look at foreign policy and, you know, the judges that he's put on the  courts, people are feeling good about the outcomes.  And his skeptics, the  left, are going insane over that.  </p><p>NARDELLI:  I mean in business, Maria -- we always used talk about people  who do things make mistakes.  They never make the biggest mistake of all  which we saw in the prior administration -- do nothing.</p><p>And so, you know, there are some issues out there that people take  exception to.  But on the whole, 4 percent GDP, regulation rollback, taxes,  unemployment -- I mean, you just go down the list of favorability.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And so they're attacking -- now they attack a staffer  on Kavanaugh's team.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They are.  And I think people have to realize what you see on  social media, you have to read through it a little bit, like use some  common sense because a lot of it is just people trying to get you to think  one way a lot of times.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.</p><p>We've got all of that coming up this morning.  And joining the  conversation, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Congressman  Greg Walden is leading the discussion in the testimony with Jack Dorsey and  Sheryl Sandberg.  He's going to join us first.  Billionaire real estate  investor and Equity International founder and chairman, Sam Zell is here.   He'll give us his take on the economy and I think he is a seller.  Former  AIG chairman and CEO Hank Greenburg is here to talk China and the former  prime minister of Italy, Mario Monte walks in on the trade discussions  happening.  Plus Fox news senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano  weighs in as well.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off with this, big tech is testifying.  AS I first reported  right here, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's chief operating  officer Sheryl Sandberg are headed to Capitol Hill this morning to face a  grilling from lawmakers over potential censorship concerns on social media.</p><p>President Trump weighed in last week on the importance of transparency when  it comes to sharing content online.</p><p>I also spoke with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy about the issue on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Donald Trump, President of the United States:  I think that Google and  Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very  unfairly.  I think it's a very serious problem because they're really  trying to silence a very large part of this country.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CAL), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: If there's a  conservative being shut down, that voice is not being heard.  And if this  is where two-thirds of Americans are getting their news, it's not a fair  process and this country believes in fairness.  The Internet was created on  fairness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us now to talk more about that is Mashable.com tech  editor Pete Pachal.  Pete -- Good to see you.  Thanks for joining us.  Your  expectations today?  </p><p>PETE PACHAL, MASHABLE.COM:  Well, it's social media on trial part two, as I  like to think of it.  Like any sequel, it's probably not going to be quite  as satisfying and the story line might be a little more confused.</p><p>So basically the last time this happened, Mark Zuckerberg was testifying  and we were right in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  And  there was a big focus on data privacy and just fundamentals of how Facebook  works.  We had the top guy talking about it.</p><p>Now we have Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey.  They're both big players, no  question but now it's more general stuff about the election and what sort  of meddling may happen and sort of the steps they're taking about that as  well as what we've just been talking about, this sort of silencing of  conservative voices or at least, perceived silencing according to them that  sort of may be going on.  And they're going to have to answer for what has  been called shadow banning, at least in Twitter's case and other things  like that, to see if they really do care about like the quality of the  conversation on their networks and if they really are being true to the  idea of having all voices being heard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the downside risks today?  I mean What could we see?   What's the worst thing that could happen to technology companies in light  of all of this?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, I mean, there's going to be some gaps, certainly.  There's  going to be some missteps.  But I mean the thing that they need to convince  the lawmakers today that they're doing is actually really trying to fix  their networks in both ways, really, and trying to sort of facilitate  healthy conversation which is what a term Jack Dorsey likes to use.  But  also ensuring that the sort of wide scale inauthentic behavior like we saw  the other week with Iranian and Russian sort of networks on Facebook.</p><p>And they were sort of ousted, trying to sort of set the stage for the  midterm elections or do some influence, sort of making sure that there's  open stuff for authentic behavior and they're shutting down the inauthentic  behavior.  If they can't show that or they can't be convincing about that,  there could be some issues either financially or with regulation down the  line.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The point I was trying to make earlier, that I was making badly,  ineloquently is that Twitter has a bigger problem I think and even Facebook  and other social media platforms, maybe Instagram to a lesser extent,  people are tired of swimming in the cesspool.</p><p>They're just going to turn away from it.  There's nothing that Twitter can  potentially do to solve that problem.  It is nothing but people hurling  hate across the political aisle.</p><p>And that goes for both sides.  And people are sick of it.  Because it goes  beyond just words.  It goes to they're trying to destroy people's lives.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well I agree with you to a large extent.  Because, you know,  there's a question about just how much does Twitter even control Twitter?   Because basically these outrage mobs that we're seeing are an outgrowth of  some of the fundamental ways that Twitter works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they knocked Candace Owens off of the platform.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well yes.  And the stance (ph) -- here's what Twitter is really  inadvertently good at doing is amplifying extreme points of view; whether  it's on the left or the right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of them are not so extreme though -- that's what I'm  saying, you know.  Some of the points of view are not extreme.  Wasn't  there a couple of instances where, I mean, they took things off for  absolutely no reason and then they said sorry, that was a mistake.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So Pete -- I would ask about that, with the algorithms.  Initially  they're set up by humans.  So, you know, Jack Dorsey's talked about it,  yes, we have a left-leaning bias at Twitter.  Is there a way to get Twitter  to a point where there is no bias or is it ok with the bias, in your  opinion?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Well, I mean it's hard to say to what extent the bias exists.  I  mean certainly there is a bias -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he said -- he said yes, we're left-leaning.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes.  I mean the company is.  But can those algorithms be  programmed to be fair regardless?  I think they can to some extent.  And I  think they also need to -- I think Facebook actually does this better in  the sense that they want moderators in the regions of the places where they  are rather than having everyone in northern California make the call on  content and using like one filter.  They want multiple filters throughout.</p><p>Now, Twitter is a smaller company.  And they don't have the same resources  Facebook has.  But that kind of approach where you don't have like a bunch  of people in an office in northern California making these hard decisions  about content, I think it's probably the way -- a good start, anyway.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob.</p><p>NARDELLI:  If there is to be regulation, you just mentioned some best  practices, should the government pick those best practices and impose that?   I mean what would you like to see coming out of this hearing?  </p><p>PACHAL:  Big question, yes.  I mean in terms of the government stepping in,  I think, you know, obviously you want to keep that to a minimum.  I think  stuff with regard to elections is probably the most likely regulation we're  going to see on the social networks.</p><p>But I would love to see a set of best practices come out from at least one  of these networks and I think Facebook is kind of leading the charge here,  mostly because they've been hammered the most and have thrown the most  resources against it and hopefully see other networks adopt that. </p><p>But Twitter sort of has a totally different role than Facebook.  I mean  it's similar but they're more of a news curator.  And like I was saying  earlier there's so many things inherent to Twitter that sort of go against  healthy conversation like we've seen it over the years with bullying, with  abuse, people getting kicked off the platform or just leaving the platform  because of all that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, this issue censorship, if you want to call it that, I know  that the people who quibble over censorship is when it's done by a  government.</p><p>But what Facebook does is more insidious.  They made money.  They've shown  reckless disregard for people's most personal information for years and  years and years.  And that's how they make money.</p><p>They basically are selling in one way, shape or form your behavior, your  most personal data about yourself and they let literally tens of millions  people's accounts were compromised because app developers were able to  access not only people's data who download the app but the friends' data as  well.</p><p>That data is out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's spread around the world.  Twitter -- not Twitter-- Facebook  doesn't even know where it is.  </p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, where is Google?  Where's Google in all of this?   Wasn't -- you know, during the California primary, if you Google California  GOP what are the ideologies?  A list of ideologies comes up and one of the  ideologies was Nazism.  </p><p>PACHAL:  Yes.  Google is such a -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not a coincidence.</p><p>PACHAL: -- vast, sprawling company at this point.  I'm willing to sort of - - like there were other accusations of Bernie Sanders versus Hillary  Clinton and there was a thing where the results that came up Bernie Sanders  was sort of disadvantaged.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if you Googled Hillary Clinton it was all good stories.   If you Googled Donald Trump it was evil, evil, evil.  I mean, you know, so  there's that as well.  It seems to me -- they're a media company, if they  abuse their power, there will be consequences.  Whether that's regulatory  or money, financial -- we don't know.</p><p>PACHAL:  Yes.  And I don't think there's a room at Google where people are  coming in and picking and choosing this stuff.  But I do think some of the  steps they take to, say, prevent misinformation, like if something is  written about you that's false, I would not like that to appear in an auto  complete or a search result.</p><p>So they have tools to sort of push that down.  But I do think some of that  does sort of get mixed in with this political stuff and that's where things  can get really dicey.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pete -- great to get your insights.  Thank you -- Pete Pachal.</p><p>Stay with us, live coverage of the Dorsey and Sandberg testimonies today;  they're testifying before Congress at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.  We'll have that.</p><p>Tropical storm Gordon slams the Gulf Coast.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are coming off of the lows.  We are  still looking at a lower opening for the broader averages.  Trade tensions  with Canada and China unnerving investors this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials set to open down about 75 points.  The S&amp;P is down 5 and  the Nasdaq lower by 18.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, tropical storm Gordon is slamming the Gulf Coast  with heavy rain, powerful winds.</p><p>Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan is live in Orange Beach, Alabama this  morning with the very latest.  Steve -- good morning to you.  </p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Over the last hour or so we've seen conditions gradually weaken here along  the coast of Alabama, some wind gusts of 10 to 20 miles an hour, big surf  behind me, four to six feet high, crashing into that pier.  The rain has  been on and off.  </p><p>Tropical Storm Gordon hit last night at 10:00 p.m.  It made landfall on the  border between Mississippi and Alabama as a powerful tropical storm.   Sustained wind speeds of 70 miles an hour -- that's just under a category 1  hurricane but not as bad as some people predicted.</p><p>As far as the damage goes, at least one person killed by the storm in  Pensacola, a tree came down on a mobile home, killing a child.</p><p>Here in Alabama, many people waking up to no power in their house, at least  20,000 people in Alabama without power.</p><p>The real concern now is from the rain.  It's been eight to twelve inches in  some areas.  But this is a quick moving storm and right now it is moving  north.  So we could see some rain and flooding across the state of  Mississippi over the next 24 hours.  Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Steve -- we'll be watching that.  Thanks so much --  Steve Harrigan this morning in Alabama.</p><p>Coming up, Supreme Court showdown, we break down Judge Brett Kavanaugh's  confirmation hearing yesterday.  The circus that it was, protests from  Democrats across the board.</p><p>Then Toyota recalls over 1 million cars worldwide.  Details on the vehicles  plagued with a fire risk later this hour.</p><p>Back in a moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well, it is a Supreme Court showdown.  Democrats tirelessly demanding to  delay judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation proceedings yesterday,  interrupting legislators, insisting for more time to review documents on  the nominee, protesters spiraled out of control, causing massive  disruptions, even before being escorted out by authorities.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Please vote no.  Please vote no.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Kavanaugh must not be put on the court.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This (INAUDIBLE) is an attack on women's rights.  It's  an attack on democracy.  Shut the hearing down now, I urge you.  Shut the  hearing down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Police arrested at least 70 protesters yesterday.  This is the  first day of week-long hearings.</p><p>Joining us right now Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial  analyst.  Judge' it's great to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was only half of it.  When Grassley first welcomed  everybody -- the, you know, interruptions, wanting to just stop the hearing  all together from three senators.  It was just incredible.  Your reaction.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So I have a couple of views.  I think to the general public  it's government at its worst.  I think it really shows how low and base and  combative and unresponsive to the needs of the American people our elected  representatives can be.</p><p>If you go a little deeper into the weeds, I think the Democrats have  concluded that they're more likely than not to lose this and Judge  Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh.  So since they can't really lay a  glove on him, they want to attack the process.</p><p>Now, some of their complaints about the process are legitimate.  I mean  dumping 42,000 pages of documents on somebody 12 hours before the hearing  is a task impossible.  And many of those documents were stamped with may  not be discussed in public.  Well, what's the sense of surrendering a  document if it can't be discussed?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sort of like redacting everything.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  But I think the Democrats must have taken  a poll and decided that their base wanted to see this kind of acerbic, in- your-face, obstreperous, anything we can do to slow this down type of  behavior because it certainly didn't gain any traction with members of the  Senate.</p><p>There are three members of the Senate being targeted here -- Rand Paul  because the Democrats are hoping that on some of these documents there's  something Brett Kavanaugh said in the Bush years supportive of torture.   That would upset Senator Paul.</p><p>They're also looking for something that might upset Senator Collins and  Senator Murkowski -- and that would be some antipathy toward Roe versus  Wade.</p><p>They also understand that it looks bad if you hold back a document -- it  looks like you have something to hide.  I don't think he has anything to  hide.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It didn't hurt the FBI or DOJ yet.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's not his personal decision not to surrender this.  Under  the Presidential Records Act of 1974, an act that shortly after Richard  Nixon resigned the presidency, you need permission from two people to  release presidential records -- the person who was president at the time  the records are made and the person was president at the time the records  were demanded.</p><p>George W. Bush, who was the president at the time these were made, signed  off on everything.  He doesn't care.  Donald Trump said 100,000 of these --  I don't want the public to seem them.  I'm claiming executive privilege.</p><p>It's a little silly for him to claim executive privilege on a historic  document that precedes his presidency for 15 years, I think.  But he has  the right to do that.</p><p>Today, however, we're going to see the Q and A directly in his face.   You're going to see a very bright judicial mind, but one that is frustrated  because he doesn't want to reveal how he stands on hot button issues like  guns, like the administrative state, like abortion, like torture.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's getting in there -- Judge.  You know, Zina Bash, we talked  about this earlier, one of Brett Kavanaugh's former law clerks -- she's  under severe scrutiny.  Look at this picture right here.</p><p>A video circulated of her making -- she had her hands folded and some on  the left were saying it was a hand gesture.  They said it was a white power  sign that she was putting there. </p><p>Bash's husband is a U.S. attorney.  He came to her defense.  And he tweeted  this in part, Zina is Mexican on her mother's side and Jewish on her  father's side.  She was born in Mexico.  Her grandparents were holocaust  survivors.  We of course have nothing to do with hate groups which aim to  terrorize and demean other people.  Never have and never would.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let me add to this.  He called the attacks on my wife repulsive.   \"Some of the Twitter comments have even referred to our baby daughter.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that there are good folks on both sides of the political  divide.  I hope that people will clearly condemn this idiotic and sickening  accusation.  And the people -- you know what, the people on the left who  are perpetrating this lie, perpetuating this lie online, this is what  people actually see.  They're not sitting and watching these hearings all  day long -- Judge.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well I -- first of all I agree fully with the defense by the  U.S. attorney of his wife's behavior.  I mean this is just over the top.</p><p>But it shows the decision of the Democrats and the hard left in this  country to do anything they can to tarnish this candidate.  What are they  really trying to tarnish?  The person who nominated the candidate.  What  are they really trying to undo relitigate, revote -- what ever phrase you  want to use undo election of 2016. </p><p>This woman is the last woman that would be showing a white power symbol in  that environment.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even the Anti-Defamation League had to come out and that said  this symbol thing is a hoax.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I have to tell you, though -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was created online.  By the way, all these people online, I  saw them, these are well-known individuals who should know better, passing  this information around while they're online.  Go on Amazon and see if can  buy a soul.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  To me it seems like desperation.  I think they're worried about  the midterm elections.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think you're right.  They must believe that this type of in  your face, uncivil behavior will generate support among their base.  It  doesn't with me.  It doesn't with Republicans.  I don't know if it does  with moderates.  But somehow they think that this is going to help them  with their own people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's make a lot of noise so that you forget that your  paycheck is higher and the economic situation is a lot better.</p><p>Judge -- you know, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Thank you.  Call again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Napolitano.  Coming up, former AIG chairman and CEO Hank  Greenberg is with me.  He's going to join me to weigh in, on the escalating  trade tensions with China, tariffs and a lot more.  He's up next.</p><p>Then, a wake-up call for your breakfast cereal.  Listen up.  The new CDC  warning for Kellogg's honey smacks.  Do not buy them.  Do not eat them.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  Good morning  everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Wednesday, September 5th.  Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the  East Coast.  </p><p>Trade talks with Canada starting back up today.  Investors are waiting for  another round of tariffs to hit $200 billion in Chinese goods.  That may  very well be executed this week.  The trade tensions are weighing on  markets this morning.  We're off of the lows but nonetheless we're  expecting the Dow Industrials to open down about 80 points, that's one  third of one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 down a quarter of a percent, and the  NASDAQ with av24 point decline down a third of a percent as well.  This  after mostly flat close yesterday for the markets, Dow Industrials gave up  12 points.  It was the NASDAQ that was down 18 the worst performer, a  quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower.  Take a look at the European  Indices with the worst performer in Paris, CAC Quarante down almost one  percent.  </p><p>The Asian markets also in the red overnight, worst performer was Hong Kong.   Hang Seng Index down 2-2/3 percent.  </p><p>Recall alert, more than one million Toyota vehicles are facing recall this  morning after reports that they could cause a fire.  Is your car on the  list?  </p><p>Then the CDC is warning do not eat, do not buy, the very latest on Honey  Smacks and an outbreak here for the cereal.  You'll want to hear the latest  from the CDC on that.  </p><p>And all ages welcome, a Starbucks staffed entirely by senior citizens.  All  those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.  </p><p>But first this top story this half an hour, U.S.-China trade tensions front  and center.  President Trump considering additional tariffs on $200 billion  in Chinese goods as the United States looks to up the pressure on Beijing.  </p><p>My next guest has some words for Chinese leadership with the recent op-ed  in the Wall Street Journal, titled: Some Friendly Advice for Chinese  Leaders.  You can't expect to keep receiving favorable trade and investment  terms unless you reciprocate.  Writes, Hank Greenberg.</p><p>Joining me right now, is the former CEO and chairman of AIG and the current  chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr, Hank Greenburg.  </p><p>Hank, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>HANK GREENBURG, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, C.V. STARR:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Now, that op-ed obviously  comes after an incredible amount of experience.  You were the first  business person ever to actually set up shop in China and you've had an  incredible relationship with Chinese leadership.  How do you see the  current trade debacle?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, it's unfortunate.  China is the second largest economy in  the world now.  It will soon be the first economy in the world.  They have  a billion 400 million people.  We have 300 million.  On size alone and all  they've learned in the last 20 and 30 years makes them a candidate to be  the largest economy in the world.  They can't have the same benefits from  us on trade that they had at the beginning.  We helped them quite a bit.   The op-ed points that out.  And I would hope that the Chinese realize that  and we come to an agreement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we get into some of your solutions and the things that  you write in that -- in that piece.  Recently we learned that now, the  president of China, President Xi is dictator for life.  What does that mean  to America?  Let's talk -- this is a -- this is an important development.   You know, we've got a democracy.  We're going to be leading -- we're going  to be dealing with one leader of China for the rest of his life, certainly,  as a dictator.  How does that impact things?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, you said it all.  He made himself the leader for life.   Now, is that going to stick?  Remember, there's only about a billion and a  half -- million and-a-half communist members in China of a population of a  billion, 400 million.  Are they going to be satisfied with President Xi for  life?  Time will tell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, doesn't it -- they may be -- you know, satisfied  or not satisfied.  But doesn't that impact the way we deal with China?   Given the fact that he doesn't care.  He's going to be the leader  regardless.  He could wait and they're in -- and they're in it for the long  run, right?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, maybe.  Things change.  You know, he -- currently he's  the leader for life.  Will that -- will that hold?  Hard to say.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know that China has been stealing intellectual property from  America for a long time, forcing this transfer of technology.  They haven't  really opened their markets.  Now they say in five years you will be able  to own an auto company or other -- couple of other industries in China out  and out, rather than having a 49 percent stake in a joint venture.  What's  your take on how fast China is moving in terms of opening its markets to  foreigners?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Very slow.  And as what I said in the op-ed, and I'd say that  to them face-to-face.  They have to have equality now.  They've been at it  long enough.  We've helped them for a long time and it's time -- it's time  the market would open for both sides.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in the op-ed you write the ways that the United States  helped China develop over the years.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they recognize that past assistance?  Is that going to be  helpful in these discussions?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  I think it will be.  Because I don't think, you know, many  people remember all the things we've done for China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does China remember?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Not to say.  I think we have to remind them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, in terms of the intellectual; property theft, they will not  admit that they've been actually stealing I.P.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  They don't admit many things, obviously.  But, you know, that's  going to have to change.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, will it change, though, Hank?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  I think it will.  I think it will.  Will it -- will it be --  will they change enough to satisfy us?  Probably not.  But there'll be --  there'll be movement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What does the U.S. need to do?  How are you feeling about the  potential of an additional $200 billion of tariffs moving on this week?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Look, the tariff is only one part of trade.  Does trade create  jobs?  Does it help income?  There are many things that it does.  It's not  just the tariffs.  I mean, we have to keep that in mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you heard from your colleagues in China the leadership in  China, to discuss the ongoing conversations with the U.S.? </p><p>GREENBURG:  Look, I discuss it all the time with China, with very high  level Chinese, and you know, they understand that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've met President Xi, obviously.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think he views China's future as an equal of the United  States or something more?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Could be something more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, tell us about that.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did does he view China?  What is he looking to do?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  He wants to make China back to what it was a couple hundred  years ago, the Middle Kingdom, at least.  And -- but it's going to go  beyond that.  He wants to control all of Asia, I believe, and, you know, he  occupied the South China Sea islands and they're not supposed to be  militarized.  They are militarized.  And so that's a concern.  So I think  we have -- we have problems with China.  We have to resolve them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, isn't it also true that they want to be the leader in  many of the industries that the U.S. is trying to be the leader in, like  A.I., like, you know, certain technology in terms of -- you know,  technology, driverless cars, whatever the leading technology is that we're  looking at as the growth industries of the future, that's what they want to  win.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, you can't blame them for wanting to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, sure.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  That's a -- it's up to them.  Remember, many Chinese went to  school in the United States.  Thousands of them.  They go back, many of  them, better educated and more willing to do things that they weren't able  to do before.  That's normal.  But that doesn't mean we have to be enemies.   We have to have a constructive relationship with China.  </p><p>A world with the United States and China as allies is a much safer world  than if we're not.  And that's an important part of this whole  conversation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what do you want to say to President Trump as he deals with  the leadership in China right now?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  We've got to find a solution.  It can't be just increasing  tariffs.  I mean that's -- China has to recognize, they have to give  foreign companies equality in doing business in China, same as they want in  our country.  And that has to happen.  I think most Chinese businessmen  understand that now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because isn't it true that China is now using its economic  power for its military complex?  You know, we spoke with Devin Nunes, the  chairman of the Intel Committee on the House, and he basically said they're  creating military bases and complexes right up to sea level, getting their  -- the best position across the world, not even near Asia.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Well, I'm not too worried about that part of it.  I think what  they've done in the South China Sea is I'm concern.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?  Tell us about that.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Yes, these little islands that they claim that China over the - - over the centuries had owned, there's no -- there's no evidence of that.   If they went to court, in the -- in the world court, and they were denied  that they had the right to that, they went ahead anyway.  </p><p>And it was during the -- during the Obama administration, we did nothing.   And now it would be -- now it would be very difficult to extract them from  those -- from those islands.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  In your view, will the U.S. be successful in opening up  markets, in getting to -- getting China to change its behavior?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  I'm not sure they'll change their behavior willingly but I  think there'll be change in many areas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And if there isn't?  They're the two largest economies in the  world.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Then we'll -- then we'll have a trade conflict.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GREENBURG:  And it's not in our interest, not in their interest.  I saw the  other day, -- you now, China is building this one road, one infrastructure  around the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GREENBURG:  I see that we're going to do $60 billion of that ourselves.  We  just announced it over the weekend. </p><p>And so, you know, we do have some conflicts.  That's inevitable.  But  doesn't have to mean that we're enemies.  Doesn't have to mean that we  don't try to solve these problems.  I think we can solve a lot of them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the infrastructure announcement was what specifically over  the weekend?  </p><p>GREENBURG:  That we're going to -- we're going to build, with a one -- with  one road, one belt, what the Chinese are doing, we're going to be competing  with them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Hank, it's great to get  your insights on these. </p><p>GREENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GREENBURG:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hank Greenberg is the chairman and CEO of C.V. Starr.  </p><p>President Trump is tweeting on Bob Woodward's new book this morning, here's  what he just wrote.  Isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or  book totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is  literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without  retribution or cost.  Don't know why Washington politicians don't change  libel laws.  </p><p>All right, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, Toyota is  recalling over a million cars across the world.  The new warning from  vehicles plagued with a fire risk coming up.  </p><p>And then a heartwarming cup of Joe.  Details on the first Starbucks  reportedly run entirely by senior citizens.  Back in a moment, right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An American hero killed in an insider attack in  Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone with the detail, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, 42-year-old army  command sergeant major Timothy Bolyard was killed by a member of the Afghan  National Police.  He was the highest enlisted soldier supporting the  Trump's administration new advisor brigade.  The command sergeant major  awarded the bronze star, the nation's fourth highest military decoration on  six different occasions.  Two were given with valor, meaning they were  granted for heroic acts.  He was on his 13th deployment overseas.  </p><p>Well, another headlines this morning, Toyota is recalling more than one  million vehicles to repair a problem with the electrical system that could  start a fire.  The affected models include Prius and C-HR Crossover, SUVs,  most of these were made in Japan between June 2015 and last May.  Toyota  spokesman says 192,000 Prius cars are going to be recalled here in the  United States.  </p><p>Taking a look at shares of Toyota, stock is trading almost one percent  lower in the premarket right now.  </p><p>Well, the CDC says that 30 more people have gotten sick after eating  Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal.  That's a total of 130 cases now over 36  states.  And that includes 34 people that have been hospitalized.  </p><p>Despite the salmonella contamination that was linked to the cereal Honey  Smacks is still being sold in some stores.  In June, Kellogg's recalled  over a million cases of the cereal from more than 30 states due to the  potential contamination.  </p><p>Well, now the CDC is adding three more states to the list that have  reported cases of illness now including Delaware, Maine, and Minnesota.   Shares of Kellogg are up about five percent so far this year.  </p><p>And here's a first, if you're a certain age, looking for a job, you're in  luck.  Starbucks is letting only senior citizens run one of its cafes in  Mexico City.  This is the first in the company's history.  This is a result  of a partnership between Starbucks and the National Institute for the  Elderly which offers of course, jobs to seniors.  Starbucks Mexico  reportedly plans to provide employment to 100 senior adults by next year.  </p><p>Taking a look at the stock right now, down seven percent this year.  </p><p>By the way, Maria, all of the employees, it's going to be an entirely  senior citizen run store, they have to be or they are right now between the  ages of 55 and 60 and they get medical benefits.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that. </p><p>CASONE:  My God.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We all love that.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The nicest person I've run  into in an Apple store was this retired older gentleman who helped me and  who knew more than the guy who was maybe 50 years his junior.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, the economy under Trump, we are taking a closer look ahead of  the August jobs report. We got the preview Big Friday this week.  That's  next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets have been under pressure this morning.   Take a look at Futures, indicating a decline of 90 points on the Dow Jones  Industrial average and 27 points on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Second quarter growth was pretty impressive.  September though is  historically a slow month for markets.  What will help bolster their  confidence?  </p><p>Joining us now is Troy Gayeski he's senior portfolio manager of SkyBridge  Capital.  And Troy, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Yes, great to  be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting a tough September for markets?  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, given the recent run-up we are expecting more  consolidation.  I mean, if you look at the path of this year we had a huge  run-up in January, then a correction and a long period of consolidation.   We've only recently made new highs.  And now some of the dark clouds are  gathering in terms of trade, other issues, slower growth overseas, emerging  markets are in the midst of almost a full-blown crisis now.  </p><p>So, we are expecting a slightly tougher month.  That being said, we don't  expect a correction north of 10 percent, maybe two to three percent, upside  to five.  So there's no reason to overreact in the short term.  Because the  fundamentals of the U.S. economy are still extremely strong.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF:  I agree with you, Troy, on  your assessment.  But what I -- what I take a bullish stance on is that,  you're getting so many negatives in the market.  You know, you hear the old  expression in the markets climbs the wall.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  But we're nowhere close to where everybody is saying, you know,  sell your house, get in the market, you need to be in the market with  everything you have.  So I think as long as that concern and worry is out  there, it's a bullish sign for the market.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  We don't disagree over the medium to long term.  The point is,  over the next week or two, with some of these issues festering,  particularly overseas, you see Indonesia been the latest emerging mark to  get taken down last night and today, that just argues for softness over the  next week or two.  But over the medium to long-term, we expect this bull  market to continue and newer highs to be made.  </p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO, CHRYSLER AND HOME DEPOT:  We were talking  earlier, some of the areas that you're now focusing on relative to  investment.  Why don't you share with us what those are?  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.  So, we continue to focus on the credit quality of regional  community banks.  You know, if you think of the massive regulatory relief  that's occurred there, the benefits of from tax reform, there's also  benefits in terms of better lending margins there than the larger banks.</p><p>What you have is a setup where you can make, you know, high single digit  cash flows.  Because these are floating rate securities, they're still low  dollar prices.  And at the same time, you're going to get paid your  principal back faster.  So, we think that's -- you know, a low teens type  return profile for the next several years with much less downside risk if  we do have a surprise bear market or recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got the Friday job reports out this week.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The August jobs numbers.  You say if we see less or fewer than  200,000 jobs it signals a path toward overheating the market.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, the point there is if, say we get a 150 number and at the  same time unemployment drops 3.7 to 3.8.  What that means is there's a  little more pressure on the Fed to hike because we don't have as many  marginally attached workers to pull back in.  </p><p>That's been really the big success that, you know, that Janet Yellen has,  is pulling marginally attached workers and now Jay Powell back in the labor  force, running things little hotter than perhaps a lot of the Phillips  curve crowd would've thought in terms of inflation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to short this market right here?  </p><p>GAYESKI:  No, it's a -- it's a losing bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Yes, because you look at where technology is, trillion  dollar companies, now Amazon joins the trillion dollar club.  </p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes, shorting tech in the strike is the way to bullet fast.</p><p>NARDELLI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good quote.</p><p>GAYESKI:  You just ask -- you just ask people from the 90s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Troy Gayeski.</p><p>Stay with Fox Business.  Our special coverage of jobs in America, Friday  morning 8:00 a.m. eastern right here.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d847d8d842c74cd29e8e1df5de7ca198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MHS1-DYN6-W3C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><timeReceived>9:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/48f9d5132d7a4e2d823edad8fc407979\">special counsel Robert Mueller's report</url> and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/43b9a9291b804e6a8c9ed4b4cae01e72\">apparently pursuing antitrust investigations</url> of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d00353aea7f0image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5d003537ca39dimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5cffccf59b08cimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, and Matt Schruers,vice president of Law and policy with the Computer and Communications Industry Association, are sworn-in to testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust subcommittee hearing on 'Online Platforms and Market Power', on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 11, 2019.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-d847d8d842c74cd29e8e1df5de7ca198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MJY1-DYN6-W3KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><timeReceived>9:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-d847d8d842c74cd29e8e1df5de7ca198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MF31-JC65-54DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><timeReceived>9:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/43b9a9291b804e6a8c9ed4b4cae01e72\"/> of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee's chairman, said at the start of the hearing. The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Cicilline's proposal. Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice-president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news (and they) have not worked,\" Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance representing some 2,000 news organizations of all sizes and types, called an antitrust exemption \"the lightest-touch option on the table.\"</p><p>\"There's a real urgency in the industry. We're at crisis point now,\" Chavern said.</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google's vice-president of news Richard Gringas said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>In a Capitol steeped in partisanship, inflamed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report and Democrats' intensifying probes of President Donald Trump, Congress' new investigation of tech market power stands out. Not only is it bipartisan, but it's also the first such review by Congress of a sector that for more than a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, and several state attorneys general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust chief suggested in a speech Tuesday that he may take a broad view of harm to competition, and take into account quality factors such as the threat to privacy, not only whether a company's dominant market position results in higher prices.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said, according to a transcript of his speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, provided by the department.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what (the Europeans) are doing,\" Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-d847d8d842c74cd29e8e1df5de7ca198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9T-2R31-JBVR-34H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1023\"/><timeReceived>06:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
