In order to keep pace with their competitors, MedTech manufacturers around the world are increasingly fast-tracking their products to market, juggling the highest possible quality with reasonable design and manufacturing costs. As manufacturers begin to actualize the benefits of big data and analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and new digital tools, the medical device industry faces a new wave of unprecedented opportunities for increased growth and market share. Some of the most poignant and relevant trends impacting strategy and operations for medical device businesses particularly this year and also, for years to come are compiled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trends that Will Influence the Direction of the MedTech Markets</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indian MedTech Market Continues to Record Robust Growth</p><p>The Indian MedTech market will continue to record healthy growth despite a hardened stance on pricing for essential devices. Currently valued at Rs. 27,736 crore, the market is expected to grow to Rs. 39,262 crore in 2021, predicts BMI research. Market growth will moderate over the next 6 years, reflecting an increasingly competitive operating environment and expanding market share for lower cost domestically produced products in some sectors.</p><p>The market will benefit from sustained economic growth and strong healthcare drivers. It will continue to reduce its dependence on imports, as local manufacturing expands under the Make in India initiative. The expanding private sector will remain the main growth driver.</p><p>Diagnostic imaging weakness will continue to hinder import growth, but growth rates in US dollar terms will improve due to a stabilization of the rupee against the US dollar. In the 12 months to January 2017, imports grew by 7.7 percent in local currency terms and by 3.5 percent in US dollar terms, taking the running annual total to Rs. 18,130 crore.</p><p>Despite an improved performance in 2016, headwinds to exports persist with a weak external demand outlook in key markets. In the 12 months to January 2017, exports grew by 8.7 percent in local currency terms and by 4.4 percent in US dollar terms, taking the running annual total to Rs. 7510 crore.</p><p>Proposals by the national regulator to introduce price caps on distributor and retail margins will alleviate pricing pressures for medical devices. This will help to negate industry concerns over the prospect of hardline pricing controls on a broad range of devices similar to those introduced for cardiac stents and artificial knee joints, which risk undermining investor confidence, impeding innovation, and provoking retaliation by India's major trading partners.</p><p>2018 is expected to be an eventful year for the Indian MedTech sector, as manufacturers await key policy announcements. Finalization of the Draft Pharmaceutical Policy 2017 will be important for the pharmaceuticals sector. The introduction of the Medical Devices Rules 2017 will be a determining guideline. The year could also see healthcare services deepening its wings into regional markets as big hospital chains look to consolidate and technology-driven firms help break barriers to penetrate areas beyond the metros.</p><p>Streamlining Medical Device Manufacturing</p><p>These recent trends in healthcare emphasize the efficiency and convenience of embedding controllers, sensors, firmware, wireless connectivity, and remote monitoring into new devices. The demand for medical devices is not just about the delivery of care anymore. There are now health tech products that allow consumers to monitor their health, which can improve preventative medicine. By focusing more on prevention, costs can be reduced, which creates even greater incentive for getting advanced devices on the market faster. In order to fully harness the newest technologies, manufacturers need strategies to access in-house or contracted resources, to produce technologically advanced products with precision, speed, and regulatory compliance. This means the next generation of successful medical devices should focus on incorporating these leading-edge innovations: wireless network connectivity (Internet of Things, or IoT) and adoption of additive manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing.</p><p>Disruption from Outsiders</p><p>New medical device trends allow for healthcare startups to enter the once exclusive market. Rather than a members-only club, the medical device market opens its doors to small and startup companies, allowing them to compete. Even established players are beginning to develop innovative technologies and some partner with the smaller companies who already have them. The FDA is responding by announcing a pilot pre-certification program that reduces the wait time and cost of market entry for MedTech devices. The FDA skips analyzing the product and instead focuses on the developing company. If the FDA approves the company, they can build safe, reliable, and high-quality devices without needing approval on each individual product the company develops.</p><p>AI to go Mainstream for Imaging Diagnostics Segment</p><p>AI is expected to play a major role in the future of medical imaging by automating processes, improving workflow productivity, and increasing diagnostic accuracy. It is expected that operationalizing AI platforms across medical imaging workflows that leverage advanced or deep learning capabilities would result in 10-15 percent gain in productivity by augmenting the work of radiologists and improve screening outcomes in 2-3 years.</p><p>Blockchain Move from Hype to Real as Initial Established Use Case Generates ROI</p><p>Blockchain in healthcare, while still relatively immature, early enterprise B2B focused initiatives will provide meaningful demonstrations of the potential from this technology. For example, during 2018, the initial implementation of blockchain solutions will start to have early implication across insurance claim management, clearing houses, and revenue cycle management (RCM) outsourced vendor ecosystem. Furthermore, it will be an exciting year for the initial coin offering (ICO) or token sale activity with grand aspirations of disruption and consumer empowerment in the healthcare space.</p><p>Pharma/MedTech Combination</p><p>New medical device trends for 2018 will see the fusion between pharmaceuticals and MedTech, two industries which used to operate within their own borders. But now, as more medical devices enter the market, more medical device manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials on their devices and are enlisting the help of pharmaceutical companies. MedTech companies, especially startups, leverage the expertise of drug companies to compete in the lucrative pharmaceuticals-device product market. Expect to see a rise in these combination products in 2018 and beyond. This medical device trend will reveal a revolutionary new level of value for healthcare providers and their patients. This partnership will foster innovative treatment options and continue to motivate MedTech development.</p><p>Big Tech Companies will see High Rewards from their Investments</p><p>Frost &amp; Sullivan anticipates that during 2018, the FDA program designed to fast track digital therapeutics and health apps is expected to provide significant impetus for nontraditional participants such as Apple, Verily (Google), Samsung, and Fitbit to enter the medical-grade arena. Furthermore, there will be fundamental convergence of healthcare with IT and retail industries to leverage tech and business models related best practices to excel on the patient-centricity and innovation front.</p><p>Robotics Attains High Penetration</p><p>The need to enhance performance and rehabilitation of elderly patients and looming shortage of care workers is expected to propel the demand for global care assistance. Automation robots market is expected to cross USD 1.6 billion by 2018. As competition is expected to increase, finding the right type of partner for the right type of robotic technology in any segment will be key to gain early leadership and traction in this market. By 2025, 80 percent of surgical procedures will be performed with robots.</p><p>Asia-Pacific Countries take the Lead on Smart Hospital Projects</p><p>Several digital advances and market trends, including the smart city concept, are pushing the need for hospitals to become smart. By 2018, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia will account for approximately 3200 smart hospital beds. However, interoperability and cybersecurity will continue as major hurdles for the implementation of smart hospital solutions.</p><p>Cyberattacks on Healthcare Industry are Expected to Double During 2018</p><p>As the healthcare industry continues digitizing all of its information, it continues to attract more attention from cybercriminals. Entailing this it is likely that cybersecurity hacking will result in major multi-million-dollar risk for a MedTech or consumer device player. This makes it essential for governments, health authorities, and medical device OEMs to work more collaboratively to release frequent guidelines and manufacturer disclosure statements for stronger awareness as well as developing risk management solutions.</p><p>Integrating Medical Devices into the IoT</p><p>Practically every type of sensor one can imagine will be used for diagnostic reasons, such as biosensors, pressure sensors, impact sensors, wearable electrodes, chemical sensors, and optical sensors. Wearables are also predicted to become more complex and combine multiple emerging technologies, such as intricate molding designs, textiles and materials, as well as 3D printing, miniaturization, battery capacity, flexible circuits, and wireless connectivity. Leading-edge wearable devices may be connected to the Internet so they transmit important health data directly to a doctor. Since patients are becoming more tech-savvy, they expect more advanced technology incorporated into their healthcare. Additionally, care settings are changing from hospital and clinical environments to extended care facilities or the home. As the population continues to age, the need for devices in these environments will continue to increase. More people will want to self-manage their care, so it is important to have wearables and other remote diagnostic equipment that can transmit information daily to ensure patients are following their care plans. This is especially important for those suffering from chronic conditions, like hypertension and diabetes. As the IoT plays an increasingly larger role in daily life, health tech OEMs are rushing to develop newer medical devices, which take advantage of wireless networking capabilities. Some examples of IoT-enabled devices are infusion pumps, glucometers, inhalers, heart monitors, and insulin pens. The key IoT components for these devices include: connectivity using the newest and emerging standards, such as RFID or Bluetooth technology; remote 3D printing, and developing solutions that can extend the lifespan of the device.</p><p>Prototyping Devices through 3D Printing</p><p>Additive manufacturing is beginning to make a significant impact on the manufacturing of medical instrumentation. Through 3D printing, manufacturers can better customize parts to build devices or improve existing designs. 3D printing gives manufacturers the flexibility to make fast and easy changes during product development and refinements. The main benefits of 3D printing in additive manufacturing are faster prototyping, reduced costs, and more robust production cycles. Custom medical products, from individualized shoe insoles to prosthetic limbs can be customized through 3D printing. Up until this point, injection molding has been the preferred method due to speed. While the actual practice of injection molding is faster, a project must have a lead time of at least a few weeks to acquire the right tooling.</p><p>Overall, the MedTech industry is moving forward at a staggering pace. The demands of patients drive the health tech industry, which further drives innovative design and manufacturing. It is expected that wearable devices will play a larger role as patients demand more control of their care. In turn, these demands will largely transform diagnostic medicine, as well as the maintenance of patient health. The increased use of wearables could drastically change patient care by reducing doctor visits and identifying serious conditions before they become potentially life threatening. Lifespans could be increased, the quality of life could be improved, and medical costs could be driven down to the point that the savings are passed on to patients.</p><p>Things MedTech Should be Prepared for in 2018</p><p>MedTech companies making a list of new year resolutions might want to take note of a new trends report published by the consulting firm, North Highland. According to the report, cybersecurity and compliance are still top concerns across the healthcare and life sciences sectors, but 86 percent of leaders surveyed by the firm indicated that transformation and adaptability are key to competitiveness.</p><p>Cybersecurity</p><p>Cybersecurity was the top strategic priority for the healthcare industry, yet only 25 percent of survey respondents said they felt very prepared to address it. The low level of confidence in addressing cybersecurity likely stems from nuances regarding personal health information and Internet-enabled medical devices. While cybersecurity must be an actively-managed risk, it need not be the primary business strategy.</p><p>Transformation</p><p>Transforming to be more efficient was cited as a definite competitive advantage by 62 percent of respondents, and 41 percent said it was much more important for 2018, but only 31 percent said they are very prepared to address it. While less than a third of healthcare leaders feel prepared to address this challenge, every healthcare company in the world could transform for efficiency. One of the challenges for this complex sector is that it has not historically been proactive in this realm. A holistic strategy where centers of innovation are communicating effectively would engender a more cohesive execution of transformation.</p><p>Innovation, IoT, and AI</p><p>The survey found that healthcare leaders feel ready to tackle areas that could lead to competitive advantages, such as product enhancement innovation, IoT, and AI. Despite this readiness, however, respondents indicated that they are focused on other priorities for 2018. While leaders may be focused elsewhere, there is an urgency for healthcare companies to use these tools to communicate and engage with customers. Healthcare is cumbersome whether consumers are purchasing medicine or medical devices, scheduling appointments, or seeking care or advice. Today's consumers are accustomed to fast and easy mobile shopping and banking served up with proactive customer engagement. Unless healthcare becomes more hassle-free, people will look for the path of least resistance in how, when, and what they choose for care.</p><p>Adaptability</p><p>Adapting to changing customer needs and customer centricity was another priority the report uncovered, yet only 21 percent of those surveyed said they feel very prepared for customer centricity. Respondents called out lack of knowledge or skills, and budget pressures as barriers to adaptability. Lack of knowledge and skills is a massive challenge in healthcare. One such challenge is a lack of broad or disruptive thinking. If healthcare leaders consider applying solutions that have made a disruptive impact in other industries, they will find the competitive advantage they are seeking.</p><p>Healthcare can close the gap on shrinking growth if they gain a new perspective on the modern-day consumer. What do patients and caregivers want? What will make them stay or leave? The answer lies in understanding consumer motivations, needs, and wants.</p><p>Trends Impacting IVD Market in 2018</p><p>The in vitro diagnostics (IVD) instruments, kits, reagents, and related supplies market is projected to grow to USD 74 billion by 2022. Diagnostics providers are actively expanding into markets in developing countries, where there is a rising demand for quality healthcare services. However, stable IVD market growth is also expected in developed countries.</p><p>Some of the key trends fueling global IVD market growth include:</p><p>A Market Holding its Own</p><p>The IVD industry has been the beneficiary of genomic research and unfortunately the march of obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiac disease, and infectious diseases, worldwide. These situations have created demand for highly specific, sensitive, and sometimes expensive tests.</p><p>Growth through 2021</p><p>IVD is a growing industry expecting to see annual gains looking ahead to 2021. The forecasted multi-billion-dollar gains include all laboratory and hospital-based products, and OTC product sales.</p><p>International Gains</p><p>IVD companies are casting their nets in developing countries, where rising incomes and standards of living have sparked a new health consciousness and growing demands for quality medical care.</p><p>Aging Global Population</p><p>Among the key world events that bode well for the future: an aging worldwide population. Increasing numbers of people between the ages of 45 and 75 years in the industrialized world consume more healthcare services such as heart and cancer tests.</p><p>IT Innovators</p><p>Big names in information technology - IBM, Apple, Google, Dell, and others - are making their mark in transforming crude test results into actionable medical information.</p><p>Genes and Disease Risk</p><p>The link between genes and disease risk provides an ongoing market opportunity for in vitro diagnostic research and product development in cancer, autoimmune diseases, cardiac conditions, allergy, diabetes, psychiatric conditions, and other diseases.</p><p>The Goal: New but Affordable</p><p>Often technology is far ahead of healthcare regulations and reimbursement plans. The onus is therefore on manufacturers to prove their new intervention is not only effective but also supplies a cost-effective treatment alternative.</p><p>An Informed Public</p><p>Wide dissemination of medical information in the media and on the Internet has spawned a more informed population that is prepared to seek out new technologies. The value of the consumer lobby has not gone unnoticed by diagnostic test marketers and this has become another tool in the battle to gain acceptance of newer diagnostics by healthcare payer groups - private and government-based.</p><p>New Sampling</p><p>No more blood sampling: be prepared for an in vitro diagnostic market of breath tests for conditions that includes respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and even chronic diseases. Wearable patch sensors have been commercialized for glucose and vital signs monitoring; more and more applications are in development.</p><p>Changing Core Lab</p><p>Not 10-15 years ago, most microbiology and anatomic pathology labs were tucked away somewhere in the basement. The major test areas were similarly separated by impenetrable walls. Those days are long gone: imagine a centralized hospital lab where clinical chemistry, immunoassays, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, some microbiology, some cytology tests are all performed in one room and often on instrumentation that are linked by an automated track line and all in the same room. More importantly tests are carried out by a lab information system that consolidates test results to an electronic patient record, or EMR.</p><p>Watch PoC</p><p>Point of care (PoC) testing attractions include heavy venture capital and company interest. PoC testing blends clinical and traditional medical engineering with telecommunications, information, and computer science, opening niche markets for PoC testing and devices. Diagnostics and patient monitoring will play a larger role in POC testing. Newer technologies entering developing countries, such as smartphone-linked diagnostic devices, can make huge differences.</p><p>Major Demand from the Developing World</p><p>Developing world's demand for clinical chemistry products will increase faster than developed world's demand as countries upgrade and expand healthcare systems. These improvements will boost the volume of patient testing, especially in the large expanding economies of Brazil, China, India, and Russia. However, a large share of developing world's demand for clinical chemistry products will remain concentrated in lower value-added reagents and instruments for basic health screening. This trend will reflect continuing limits on the availability of healthcare funding and the less advanced nature of medical delivery systems in most countries.</p><p>Way Forward</p><p>We foresee another year of big disruptions, transformations, and innovations as the healthcare industry continues to overhaul outmoded business models. Advances in areas ranging from cancer immunotherapy products to blood testing, as well as the convergence of cutting-edge technology such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, will help shape the healthcare industry into a much-anticipated, value-based care paradigm.</p><p>2018 will definitely be an exciting year as major transformations and new entrants unfold!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDBUY-0037072936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDBUY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RK8-XSX1-JB5M-W1PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365210</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Medical Buyer, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Medical Buyer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 6, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Healthcare Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUxMkVDQjJDOEY5NDVDQ0E5NTFEMTlDMjIwNzVERjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBEQTY4ODlFREI3NDFERkFGQjVGNjM4NjZFMEM4NEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA0RjRFQTA3RUI2NENCRDlEODAyNDZFREM1OTE1RDQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUNBQzhDMTI1NTM2NEFBNUE0RjEzRjMyNDdEOTg3ODI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkQ5QTg4MzhENENGNEFDRDhDMzdDMDRCQjMwM0IxMjk</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U1NEQ5NkFBQjhENEUyMjhDMjM2MjRFQkVBOTFDODI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkIwM0E1RTM4NkY5NEU4QjhBM0RCNzc5QjE4RkIzOEI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFAA</classCode><className>INDUSTRY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001100</classCode><className>MEDICAL DEVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002001</classCode><className>MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CY6A</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001768</classCode><className>US DOLLAR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000436</classCode><className>CURRENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000487</classCode><className>DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

This column covers the trade story, the rise of non-tariff measures (NTMs), the expansion of technology into medtech supply chains, and the emergence of the East Asia-Pacific region as a major player in global medtech supply chains. I'll also share some of the big questions on my mind as we enter a new year (and decade).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trade Story</p><p>In the decades preceding the 2010s, medtech supply chains were highly fragmented. This was largely the result of Western multinationals outsourcing and offshoring parts and components manufacturing to countries with low-labor costs, while specializing in high-value added activities (i.e., research and development, marketing, and logistics). In addition to financial incentives provided by the host countries, this supply chain strategy owed largely to free trade agreements, which granted duty-free access for multinationals. This translated into a high volume of medtech trade, led by parts. During this period, global medtech trade expanded by over 200 percent, while parts trade alone grew by 330 percent. For the most part, the trend toward trade liberalization continued throughout the 2010s. The U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement took effect in 2012, while the implementation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) appears imminent. Both trade agreements included specific annexes covering medical devices as well as chapters benefitting the sector, such as customs and trade facilitation and technical barriers to trade. In the case of the USMCA, chapters cover subject matter ranging from digital trade, good regulatory practices, and secure commitments from North American trading partners to maintaining open cross-border data flows and adopting best international regulatory practices.</p><p>Outside of the United States, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional intergovernmental organization of 10 Southeast Asian countries, minted free trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and India in 2010. More recently, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) enjoined 11 countries that collectively accounted for roughly 20 percent of global medtech trade in 2018. Much like the previous trade agreements discussed previously, the CPTPP also included specific chapters that targeted regulatory convergence for the medtech sector. These are certainly promising developments for the sector, as regulatory divergence is a principal impediment to greater market access.</p><p>Yet, even while the general trend toward liberalization occurred, the end of the decade saw a greater inclination toward tariffs, highlighted by the U.S.-China trade dispute. At press time, tariffs impacted roughly one-quarter of U.S. medtech-related imports from China.</p><p>The Rise of NTMs</p><p>Notably, while tariffs have received a substantial amount of attention over the past two years, the steady growth of NTMs may have been more impactful on trade flows during the previous decade. NTMs refer to policy measures (other than customs tariffs) that can potentially have an economic effect on international trade in goods. The measures most relevant to the medtech sector are considered technical in nature and include conformity assessment procedures (i.e., certification, testing, and quality system requirements) and technical regulations (i.e., specifications of product characteristics, labeling requirements, production processes, and testing).</p><p>During the past decade, 376 medtech-specific NTMs were implemented worldwide. This stands in sharp contrast to the 145 that entered into force in the decade preceding the 2010s. Notably, NTMs can serve legitimate purposes by ensuring consumer protections and aligning the medtech standards of a particular country with that of international best practices. For example, measures that adopt standards endorsed by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum--such as a risk-based classification system for medical devices--would likely prove trade facilitating. However, NTMs can also be employed to protect domestic industries from import competition, thereby reducing trade. An example could be country-specific labeling requirements or unnecessarily complicated procedures.</p><p>Many industry experts with whom I've spoken suggest the growth of NTMs is an encouraging trend. In part, it reflects the growing awareness of countries to abide by their commitments under the World Trade Organization's Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement to notify other members of their intentions to adopt regulatory measures that could substantially influence trade flows.</p><p>The Digitalization of Medtech Supply Chains</p><p>Throughout the 2010s, the shift toward value-driven healthcare accelerated. During this time, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, and the Internet of Things) abetted by advancements in computing and processing capabilities were increasingly leveraged in the production of medtech. The increasing digitization of medtech supply chains arrived amid a climate of increasing pricing pressures on manufacturers; rising compliance costs owing to stricter regulations in key markets, such as the EU; and operational complexities arising from the spate of industry-wide mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>At the same time, the leading \"big tech\" companies in the United States including Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) entered into the healthcare space, concentrating on different segments of the sector. For example, Apple has emphasized its consumer products; the iWatch series 4 received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval as a Class II medical device in 2018. Although tech companies have long provided services to the healthcare industry, the close of the decade found these companies creating or investing in technologies for doctors, patients, and consumers.</p><p>The growing involvement of technology in medtech supply chains may also be responsible for elevating concerns other than labor costs as a guide to influencing investment decisions. For example, the application of 3D printing to products such as hearing aids could translate into more regional supply chains, as manufacturers prioritize rapid time-to-market over low-cost labor. Further, the growth of automation during the past decade may also reduce the reliance of medtech manufacturers on low-cost labor, permitting specialization in high-value added activities going forward.</p><p>Asia-Pacific's Rise</p><p>The 2010s witnessed the emergence of the Asia-Pacific region as a critical player in the international medtech supply chain. China was the principal driver of this trend. In the early part of the decade, the country was still a predominant supplier of low-tech goods, but over the past eight years or so, the country transitioned into a viable exporter of higher-tech medical devices (Figure 1). This trend occurred alongside China's stated intentions under the \"Make in China 2025\" industrial policy to become more self-sufficient in supplying the country's advanced medtech market with domestic production.</p><p>To fulfill this objective, China has increasingly retained its domestic production, rather than exporting it to other countries for final assembly. Having long served as a principal manufacturer and exporter of low-cost goods, this development may explain why the 2010s witnessed a 177 percentage point reduction in the rate of global medtech trade growth relative to the preceding decade.</p><p>At the same time, China's ascension into higher segments of the global value chain coupled with rising wages within the country have created opportunities for other regional countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam to supply key medtech markets. For example, the region appeared to partially displace the EU as the United States' leading medtech trading bloc throughout the decade (Figure 2).</p><p>Much like China, these countries represent chronically underserved medtech markets, which has presented U.S. firms with significant market opportunities. As previously stated, the participation of many of these countries in large trading agreements such as the CPTPP, may facilitate greater medtech trade in the region, as these agreements promise to achieve greater regulatory harmonization.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>While some interesting trends emerged during the last decade, the concluding years have left me with a lot of questions. What are the long-term supply chain implications arising from the U.S-China trade dispute? If China succeeds in supplying its high-end medtech market with domestic production, what will that mean for global medtech trade and for U.S. multinationals that are currently the leading suppliers? With uncertainties surrounding the impact of the EU's MDR, will the Asia-Pacific region continue to chip into the EU's status as the United States' leading medtech trading partner? I hope to answer these questions in the years ahead.</p><p>Mihir Torsekar covers trade and competitiveness issues affecting the U.S. and global medical device industry as part of his duties at the United States International Trade Commission.</p><p>Mihir Torsekar * Analyst, U.S. International Trade Commission</p><p>Caption: Figure 1: The share of China's medtech exports that were low-tech and medium--to high-tech, 2001-16.

Companies increasingly understand the operational aspects of their product or service, which not only helps to de-risk early investment, but shows they know where it fits in the clinical workflow, that it solves a clinical problem and delivers economic value.                                                                                                      </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is often hard to be heard above the general hubbub of medtech business in action - the soundtrack to the annual Medica event - anywhere in the vast D\u00fcsseldorf exhibition arena. But over at the North Carolina stand at Medica 2018, the Technology Commercialization Group's take on current realities and future trends in global medtech adoption were coming over clear as a bell.</p><p>TCG executives Dean Gray and Reinhard Merz, along with Russ King, president of TCG partner company Methodsense Inc., were in agreement that there seems to be more money available for early-stage projects. Gray said, \"From what I have seen over the couple of years in the US, money for early- and growth-stage companies is coming not just from traditional venture capital or private equity sources, but also from angel investors, family offices and recently Asia.\" </p><p>In addition, capital medical equipment companies, which are always challenged when trying to attract investment (most investors are challenged by capital goods business models) are also getting more attention from family-owned investment offices in the US, which are showing increasing levels of investor sophistication. \"They are making more investments at early stages, which is very encouraging for these capital equipment companies,\" said Gray, who is focused on medical devices, diagnostic imaging and digital health.</p><p>Why is this change evident? There are more sources of early-stage funding than there were five or 10 years ago. Angel groups are more prevalent in medtech, and non-dilutive funding has become a bigger source for start-ups. These include the National Institutes of Health's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) fund (with the Small Business Technology Transfer program, known as America's Seed Fund) to help companies get through the earlier stages of product development to commercialization. These are very important programs, especially for university spin-outs - but also for non-academic spin-outs. In fiscal 2018, SBIR and STTR invested over $1bn in health and life sciences companies, a key objective being to translate promising technologies to the private sector.</p><p>Changes Apparent In Pattern Of Investments</p><p>Medtech areas of greatest interest for investors remain cardiology, diabetes and regenerative medicine - \"the usual suspects.\" Non-traditional life sciences investors are increasingly aware of the broader issues in medtech, and of newer technology developments. Digital health, for instance, has encouraged investors to become more active in medtech. Indeed, the tech part of the equation is both compelling and unstoppable. Digital health ideas often originate from non-life sciences individuals and organizations. \"They don't have the clinical background, but they've come up with a cool concept,\" said Gray. And tech solutions to clinical problems can be a compelling notion, and help bring new investors into the digital health space.</p><p>Investors from outside the US - from China and also Korea, for example - have lately been more active in investing earlier in life sciences generally. \u00a0It has been a feature of many partnering meetings for medtechs, in and outside the US, that Chinese VCs have a large presence, either formally or informally. But the US-China tariffs standoff has changed that a little in recent months. Until mid-June 2018, China's investment progress vis-\u00e0-vis US medtech start-ups was \"going fine,\" but lately many Chinese companies have come under pressure to ensure cash does not go into the US. This has made it difficult for companies funded out of China to move forward in the US market.</p><p>\"When they get on the map, they are solidly on the map,\" says TCG's Dean Gray, of Korean investment commitment.</p><p>Korean investors remain active in the US market, and indeed, several TCG client companies have Korean capital invested. They tend to be \"very selective\" investors, but have a deep financial commitment. They are careful to ensure that companies are properly funded and have the right resources to expand globally. \"But when they do get on the map, they are solidly on the map,\" said Gray.</p><p>He reiterated that there is enhanced investment from accredited private individuals, angel investors and even health-care system corporate VCs and other institutions, who are getting more adventurous with earlier-stage companies. At one time, companies seeking capital were required to have a product cleared or approved for the market or to be generating revenue: an investment candidate company was one that was actually acquiring some market share. But that's changed, and so has the presence of family-owned investment offices.</p><p>Economic Issues Dominate Thoughts And Planning</p><p>Regulatory is no longer the biggest issue in getting onto the market; now it is reimbursement for many companies. \"Some of the recent US medical device regulatory reforms have been encouraging for medtech companies; but reimbursement and insurance coverage, and developing a reliable business model, particularly in ehealth, digital health and mobile health - there are economic issues that are occupying more thinking time and requiring more effort to resolve than historically has been the case,\" noted King. </p><p>King also sees the attention paid to regulatory affairs starting earlier and earlier in the planning, and often at the very beginning of a company's life cycle. Methodsense is a global regulatory affairs and quality assurance consultancy that helps companies with FDA and other regulatory agency processes to obtain market entry for medical device products. Early regulatory attention on the part of manufacturers is, in many respects \"a critical consideration or even a determinative consideration on capitalization,\" said King. \u00a0And it's as much a factor in the US as globally. \"These early-stage concerns speak to the knowledge of the investor population. Investors want to qualify an investment by assessing more thoroughly regulatory risks, including the risk classification of the product, the kinds of testing required for market entry and, the biggest risk, whether a product requires a clinical trial,\" he added.</p><p>                                  Some standards fall under the radar screen for much of the industry, \"but they chew up cash flow very quickly.\" - Russ King                                 </p><p>EU medical device manufacturing companies are currently experiencing a great deal of change with the forthcoming Medical Device Regulation (MDR) ISO 13485:2016 and the reshaping of other standards, IEC 60601 on EMC testing, for instance. \"They fall under the radar screen for much of the industry, but they chew up cash flow very quickly,\" said King. In short, the pressure EU regulators are putting on medtech companies is only increasing.\u00a0 </p><p>In the US, the FDA is driving to simplify matters in an ever-more-complex regulatory world. Its Breakthrough Designation is a welcome change, but Gray cautioned that \"no FDA shortcut, in the end, makes it less expensive.\" FDA shortcuts tend to mean \"pay later.\" But crucially, it's all about getting to market, and breakthrough medical technology and digital solutions solve certain problems.</p><p>But in summary, while still difficult, the transactional challenge in getting product clearances or approvals is perceived to be less of an issue. By contrast, reimbursement brings with it a relatively greater sense of challenge. \"While the transactional nature of regulatory isn't necessarily any less challenging, the 'pain' is now more on the reimbursement side,\" said Gray. </p><p>Viable Business Models</p><p>The acknowledgement by companies of the need to better understand the markets they are entering, and specifically the clinical problems they are solving, while also confirming that people are willing to pay for the technology, is another factor in the maturing of players in the medtech sector. This, along with the trend to earlier-stage investment (see above), is the standout feature in today's evolving medtech ecosystem.</p><p>Companies are now aware of the need for an economic \u00a0- or business - \u00a0model that shows who will make money with the device, and the nature of the insurance and reimbursement landscape. It's not a new consideration - and neither is regulatory - but it is now being factored in more. \"It is absolutely critical that you have a viable business model, and that you are able to effectively argue for that model,\" stated [add speaker name].</p><p>This is where value-based health care models come into play. VBHC must have a global outlook, and not just in geographic terms, but from the lab to the point of sale, to postmarket and to product improvements down the road, said Merz, adding, \"Our business model as a consulting firm is to have an impact on the business goals of the company, and not in a transactional way.\" Merz is TCG's European lead on medical devices, pharma and biotech.</p><p>Workflow Considerations</p><p>Clinical/economic considerations are yet another key area. \"Understanding the operational aspects of your product or service is important; it helps to further de-risk early investment,\" said Gray. Solving clinical problems and delivering economic value is a realizable goal, \"but how does this product or service fit into the clinical workflow?\" Does it make things easier, faster, better? \"Emerging companies - and products - can easily be killed by that problem.\" Understanding a product's fit with clinical workflow, and how it affects overall quality of care, is an increasingly important factor to consider early in the product development process. \"Founders and executives who address workflow, along with the usual clinical/economic value, regulatory and reimbursement considerations, enhance the perceived value of their product with both customers and investors.\u00a0 This may account for how the capital is moving backwards in the cycle,\" Gray suggested.</p><p>The Evolving Tech Landscape</p><p>The current top talking point is artificial intelligence: \"Everyone wants an AI product - all you need is developers in the back room - but lots of them!\" quipped King. \"But it's got to solve the right problem.\" In fact, this is a challenge more broadly: many AI-driven projects and companies are carried along by the technical capability of what their algorithm platform can do. It may be deep - or machine learning, but they haven't always started thinking about what the platform can do for users in a busy clinical setting. \"Is it solving the right problems in a practical way, operationally?,\" asked Gray.</p><p>The big data and predictive analytics approach is happening in radiology already.\u00a0 The direction that medtech business is taking will lead to both market disruption and business tie-ups. \"It's a real opportunity in health care: can we leverage that information for predictive purposes?\"</p><p>Does TCG get a sense that major medtech companies, the Medtronics and the J&amp;Js, are worried? Data technology companies' perspectives on these problems are different than those of traditional medtechs, the group noted. Medtechs are keenly processing what's going on, recognizing that they are behind the tech companies in terms of the technical capabilities of AI. But it is unlikely that tech companies will be solely driving the dialogue.</p><p>                                  The big medtechs should be thinking about how Google and Apple can offer insights into the potential for product solutions based on patient characteristics.                               </p><p>\"Google and Apple are going to help us understand experiences,\" said King. While the major medtechs will solve different kinds of problems, the big-tech perspective is to look at pattern recognition from actions, events and outcomes, and to devise patient-centric, or process-centric, solutions in the hospital, or more broadly, in the entire continuum of patient care. But there will be more plug-ins and digital surgery partnerships along the way featuring the big players.</p><p>The big medtechs should be thinking about how Google and Apple can offer insights into the potential for product solutions based on patient characteristics. Paying for these services - how, when and at what level - is still an open book, but the guiding notion is that data prove the cause-and-effect relationship. </p><p>And procedure-specific reimbursement is just one path to revenues - there are others, in Gray's view. \"The idea is that we may avoid a bigger cost problem by intervening now,\" he said. Using data to improve the overall quality of patient care may even be a bigger opportunity. Data analytics can help providers and hospitals, for example, better understand bottlenecks and barriers to achieving their quality goals in a value-based care setting. \"Improved care is great for patients, of course, but it also has economic value to health care systems.\u00a0 It better enables them to achieve their desired reimbursement levels linked to quality goals.\"</p><p>There will be winners and losers in this unfolding scenario, but identifying who these will be is not straightforward or simple. \"The issues will be different for every single company and product, and it's hard to generalize, as every company has its own formula and way of fitting into the ecosystem,\" said King. \"What will always kill a company is being undercapitalized for what it needs to do. If that is the case, it's going to fail.\" </p><p>Big Questions For Medtechs</p><p>Many digital health companies are focused on technology, not the clinical problem. But being very specific about clinical problems is more important than ever. Gray says the biggest questions of all remain: \"What's the problem? What's the problem? And what's the problem?\" But just behind that are other vital questions, principally, does the solution make sense to clinicians? Do clinicians think it's a problem too? Is it a problem worth solving?

Digital technologies will expedite the process. Yet critics unfairly claim health care is too slow to transform. 2020 will be the year when the industry shake-out from the EU Medical Device Regulation will become fully visible; until now, it has mainly been silence and speculation. The MDR has united medtech executives on one thing: it must not slow down access to innovation for patients. But is it a failure in waiting? Innovation will remain the spine of the industry, but disruptive forces are telling manufacturers the old business model will not suffice. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Digital is no longer a vertical, it cuts across all sectors. It is a horizontal.\" Andy Fish of AdvaMed was explaining to the press in late fall 2019 that, in medtech, companies will come to incorporate digital as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. \"Digital is now the coin of the realm,\" he said, explaining the rationale behind the US industry's decision to invest time and resources in a new Center For Digital Heath.</p><p>It is a further recognition of the health care value of digital, now and in the future, and another step on the road to the integration of modern methods of care delivery. It is also a reflection of the transition in health care industries from supply push to demand pull. </p><p>Innovation tends to spawn early adopters with their own jargon, but they are not the real market for medtech companies of any size. Delegates were reminded of this truth at the French annual medtech start-ups meeting, in spring 2019. In such a fast-moving climate, there can be a tendency to overplay the early prospects of a technology - digital or \"traditional.\" Later in its lifecycle, the continual, incremental and perhaps less visible changes that make a real difference tend to be underplayed.</p><p>This applies to the value-based health care arena too, where much is happening, even if progress here is not as fast or as major as expected. That is the view of Boston Scientific's Eric Th\u00e9paut who gave In Vivo a brief tour in mid-2019 of how health care will change in the future. VBHC, he said, \"is a long-term initiative, and a step-by-step approach is needed.\" It is a delivery concept that one day will become more mainstream, similar to how once disruptive medical tools like nanotechnology, molecular diagnostics, POCT and telehealth are now part of the medtech routine.</p><p>Elsewhere for the medtech industry, some routines are changing fast. 2020 will see the biggest change to EU medtech regulation since the 1993 Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), when the EU Council's Medical Device Regulation (MDR, 2017/745) comes fully into force. That is the promise. But as the clock ticks down to implementation day on May 26, the magnitude of the task has been starting to cause a few jitters. Will there be realization at EU level that, while the MDR is generally welcomed, it is coming too soon? It is certainly the right thing to do, but it is arriving too fast, so it is the wrong thing to do, to paraphrase ResMed CEO Mick Farrell during MedTech Europe's MedTech Forum panel discussion, in Paris, in May 2019. There are still not enough notified bodies accredited to do the work required by the MDR (seven under the MDR, and two under the IVDR, as of November 8, 2019). Under the previous EU directives, there were latterly 58 such organizations. This prospective shortage of resources makes the new regulation work against high-quality patient care - the very thing the MDR promises to strengthen. </p><p>The first signs of a more flexible European Commission approach were seen in October 2019, when talk emerged of some Class I products additionally being able to use the MDR's four-year grace period, remaining under MDD oversight until 2024. There was also a proposal for a two-year delay in Eudamed. These moves open the door to possibly further concessions from the commission in 2020, which would suit most of industry very well. Brexit - delayed for a third time in October 2019\u00a0 \u0336 \u00a0throws a considerable spanner in the works, and may yet be the catalyst that allows the commission to do a more concerted rethink on MDR timetables without sacrificing the EU policy line.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Favorable Demographic Trends Are There To Be Exploited\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>On a broad scale, the outlook for medtech business is good, with global health care expected to benefit from continued favorable demographic trends. The world's population is anticipated to grow by more than 1 billion by 2030. The number of people over the age of 60 is forecast to rise by 500 million, to 1.4 billion, with the prevalence of cancer, cardiovascular (CV) diseases and other long-term conditions rising in tandem. Health care spending is expected to increase annually by 4% to 5% on average through to 2021 when around half of all health care spending - some $4 trillion - will be targeted at cancer, and CV and respiratory diseases, according to Deloitte's Global Healthcare Sector Outlook.</p><p>This is good news for medtechs, but there is a complication: innovation is changing. Big-scale innovations in the traditional device areas are becoming fewer. An increasing amount of innovation is coming from digital iterations and advances. For example, Abbott's Merlin 10.0 app (CardioMEMS HF sensor system), which keeps heart failure patients out of hospital and allows physicians to communicate directly with patients. </p><p>The US FDA is fully behind mobile apps, which can help individuals manage their own health and wellness, and gain access to useful information when and where they need it. The US, arguably the most fertile and receptive market for medtech innovation, is once again leading the way in a new cornerstone of the industry, just as in did in fall 2013 when it broke the turf on device UDI implementation. </p><p>It seems mobile apps are being adopted almost as quickly as they are developed: in 2017 alone, 325,000 health care apps were available on smartphones, according to FDA-reported industry estimates. The agency posted an updated Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications Guidance (MMA guidance) in fall 2019.</p><p>Into The Data-Driven Era Of The 2020s</p><p>Apps are where the medtech and digital confluence is at its most obvious. Digital is prompting a rethink among those medtechs who are reviewing whether they should be targeting consumers and wellness, or patients and sickness. The simplistic view is that there is a clear marketing advantage, at least, to seek consumer/wellness branding, as ZS principal Brian Chapman explained to In Vivo. But as a rule, medtech has yet to view patient-consumers as its real customers; its efforts are still focused largely on provider systems.\u00a0(<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV124303//\">\"MedTech Forum 2019 Consumers And Wellness Or Patients And Health Care\" \"In Vivo\"</url>) </p><p>Nevertheless, medtech is \"truly beginning to acquire the tools and capabilities that will allow it to enter a data-driven, personalized new era,\" said Kevin Lobo, chair and CEO of Stryker, and the current AdvaMed chair. EY's latest annual Pulse Of The Industry report (2019) quotes Lobo as saying that data-driven medical devices will be at the forefront of health care's transformation. Digital and AI are currently the standout features in an industry that has seen \"generally conservative activity\" in the past year.</p><p>Boston Scientific's Th\u00e9paut agreed, there was no changing course now. \"Digitization is going to completely transform health care, albeit later than has happened in the consumer world,\" he said, alluding to the type of criticism often flung in health care's direction. But there are clear reasons for this to be so. \"We are focusing on patients in a highly regulated industry, and health care will always be unique.\" Commoditizing it would not be good for the ecosystem or the patient; however, it will evolve significantly.</p><p>Patients were arguably already \"at the center,\" but now they are going to be even more so, with device-derived information more fluid and available more quickly. At present, the European industry remains focused on products and therapeutic value, but what is required, in Th\u00e9paut's view, is a very open dialog with patients. FDA guidance seems to acknowledge this shift. Indeed, at the 2019 MedTech Forum, it was sobering to find both that the medtech industry was unable to define precisely the benefits that \"digital\" could bring; and that it was open about that. </p><p>Digital Is 'Blurring Everything'</p><p>The medtech industry is still very much at the digital learning stage, as underlined by AdvaMed with its rebooted Center For Digital Heath (CDH). The center will look at adoption, regulation and reimbursement of digital tools across the industry. In the UK, the BIVDA diagnostics industry association is going along the same path. BIVDA chair Darren Stenlake (Sysmex) told an association meeting in early October that \"digital is blurring everything,\" and highlighted the UK industry's plans to focus a new working group on IT infrastructures, cybersecurity and malware.</p><p>AdvaMed has highlighted that digital cuts across the whole medtech industry, and digital products are not the rare commodities they were just three years ago. Hence the need to pool resources in one center. The big medtech names and certain software manufacturers are already members of the CDH. How its membership changes and grows, and how its agenda shifts will be very telling in terms of how health care will be delivered in the 2020s, and by whom.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Technology Trends</p><p>Digital will continue to hog the headlines in 2020, but not to the total detriment of traditional medical technologies.</p><p>Indeed, innovation levels are currently at seldom-reached heights, to judge from activity at the FDA, which broke its new novel medical devices approval record in 2018: at 106 new devices (PMS, panel-track supplements, de novos, breakthrough 510(k)s; and HDEs.) Generally, as an investment proposition, medtech is currently perceived as less favorable than biopharma, and the intense competition means a clear run on innovation does not last for very long. However, the appetite for and pace of innovation in medtech cannot be matched, as seen, for example, in ... </p><p>The consensus is that massive opportunities are available in medtech, as seen in Abbott's significant breakthrough with MitraClip. Abbott's structural heart franchise rose strongly to $1.2bn in 2018. The next-generation MitraClip percutaneous mitral valve repair system was perhaps the single most eye-catching \"traditional\" medical technology in 2018. A rich year for Abbott, 2018 also yielded the HeartMate 3 LVAD as a destination (long-term use) therapy, and the XIENCE Sierra drug-eluting stent system. The group was able to boast healthy cardiovascular sales, and is now the fifth-leading medtech group by sales, after Medtronic, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Philips and GE Healthcare. </p><p>Indeed, devices for minimally invasive procedures will likely gain increasing momentum in the more patient-centric 2020s. PAD micro-catheters, small incision radiation-therapy devices in breast cancer therapy, and urology drainage catheters that significantly reduce UTIs are the types of technologies touted for future success. Thus, a clear driving theme is becoming visible for medtech R&amp;D departments, which are now able to more rapidly determine if their technology has what it takes to gain acceptance in the value-based era.</p><p>Fellow cardiovascular company Edwards Lifesciences Corp. expects revenues from its transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve therapies to double to $80m in 2020. The global market for mitral and tricuspid repair and replacement therapies will reach $3bn by 2024 - but it will not stop there, according to Edwards' CEO Michael Mussallem. The Sapien TAVR system will continue to drive the group's revenues - by 20-25% to over $4bn in 2019.</p><p>More recent technology breakthroughs that will continue to command attention in 2020 and beyond include diabetes technology group Senseonics' implantable Eversense CGM. The group has become the third to receive the non-adjunctive indication, which allows a CGM to be used for insulin dosing in place of a fingerstick glucometer. </p><p>The global market for hearing aids is expected to grow to $11bn by 2023, a CAGR of 7.4%, according to Informa's Meddevicetracker. This is on the back of the rising aging population worldwide experiencing hearing loss, and a younger population looking for more sophisticated devices. Into this market will come Bose's direct-to-consumer hearing aid, a device that does not need to be fitted by physicians, and can be sold online. This is a disruptive challenge to the majors, like Sonova, William Demant and GN Store Nord. </p><p>And of course, Apple's every move in medtech is scrutinized, and never more so than when the de novo-classified Apple Watch gained FDA approval in fall 2018 for an app that functions as an electrocardiogram (ECG). </p><p>There is a consensus that light-therapy-based devices will attract more market interest in the coming years. Philips' VitalSky delirium-recovery technology, which will challenge traditional pharma approaches for a condition that costs $150bn per year in the US alone, is one such technology. It does not attract greater direct reimbursement, but it helps reduce in hospital stay length, and thus generates a secondary reimbursement effect. </p><p>It is another example of the value-based, holistic care approach that will be the subtext of medtech providers in the coming decade.\u00a0 </p><p>M&amp;A And Start-Ups</p><p>A cautious mood has settled in regarding M&amp;A targets, especially given the strong valuations at present. In our annual table of major M&amp;A, the list of purely medtech-focused $1bn+ acquisitions is shorter than usual. It is a cautious environment at present that will extend into 2020, but this will be seen negatively by start-ups, which provide the traditional fuel for the majors' medtech innovation. </p><p>The EU MDR will also have a telling effect on those who succeed, which companies will be acquired and when, and which companies will decide to bite the bullet and cut programs and products. Companies are now increasingly expected to gain reimbursement before they can make an exit. And all this against an environment of overall industry financing levels declining for the second consecutive year in 2018, according to data from EY. However, venture capital continues to flow into medtech.</p><p>A good indication of where there are new seams to be exploited is provided by Cleveland Clinic Innovations in its Top 10 Medical Innovations, the annual showcase from the US hospital group that was voted US News &amp; World Report's \"2019-20 Best Hospital.\" CCI predicted in fall 2019 that the following technologies, procedures and trends would gain ground in 2020:</p><p>                                           Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. This will further expand in the US, to individuals with secondary or functional MR, despite optimal medical therapy. The mitral valve is defective in around 1 in 10 individuals over the age of 75, causing regurgitation, so this is seen as an important new treatment option.</p><p>Closed-loop spinal cord stimulation. Chronic pain is a reason for prescription of opioid medication, but spinal cord stimulation also provides electrical stimulus to the spinal cord. Closed-loop stimulation allows for better communication between the device and the spinal cord, and can reduce unsatisfactory outcomes due to subtherapeutic or overstimulation events. </p><p>Biologics in orthopedic repair. Cells, blood components, growth factors, and other natural substances are increasingly finding their way into orthopedic care, allowing for the possibility of expedited improved outcomes. To facilitate biologics license approvals, the FDA has opened new pathways to expedite reviews.</p><p>Antibiotic envelopes for cardiac implantable device infection prevention. Some 1.5 million patients receive an implantable cardiac electronic device every year. Antibiotic-embedded envelopes can encase these cardiac devices, effectively preventing infection or even potentially life-threatening complications.                                                                                                      </p><p>Investments In Digital Health</p><p>US investment in digital health start-ups was up 16% at over $11bn in 2018, according to a new Top 150 Investments report and interactive research briefing from CB Insights (New York). Genomics company Grail secured a total of $1.6bn, disease diagnosis company 23andMe, $795m, and health care services delivery company Babylon Health, $635m. The big rounds went to companies innovating across health insurance \u0336 \u00a0Clover Health raising $500m in a series E, and genomics company Ginkgo BioWorks, $290m (series E), for instance.                               </p><p>Notable in this list of 150 was how many Chinese firms occupy top rankings. The world's second-largest economy is investing significantly in health care, a national priority as the population ages and demands better options. The Chinese health care market is growing at 17% CAGR, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>The report showed that China's tech giant Tencent was a top three investor in digital health start-ups (based on the number of portfolio companies), alongside Google and Microsoft - these three representing over 70% of digital health deals made by the key big tech companies. Google is the undisputed leader in digital health investment, according to CB Insights, mainly in genomics, clinical research, and insurance and benefits. Its subsidiaries and investment vehicles include Alphabet, Google Ventures, CapitalG, Gradient Ventures, Verily Life Sciences, and incubators such as Google Launchpad Accelerator. In November 2019, Google said it was acquiring FitBit for $2.1bn, boosting its presence in the wearable technology market.\u00a0 Intel, Samsung, Alibaba, Amazon, and Comcast have likewise reached household-name status in digital health care. </p><p>These groups' top targets are not medtech per se, but data management, wellness, diagnostics, remote patient monitoring, drug delivery, telemedicine and chronic disease management, as well as genomics and the other leading targets listed by Google (above). The clinician expertise resides in the major medtechs, which the big techs do not have access to, and maybe do not want. But there is no hiding from it: these developments show how the health care delivery model is undergoing huge change. \u00a0</p><p>Rising Role Of Genomics In Health Care Management</p><p>The awakening of minds to the potential of genomics is arguably the biggest single positive development in the success of targeted therapy in the decade ahead. Genomics is one of three new industries (alongside digital and diagnostics) that the UK Life Sciences Industrial Strategy (LSIS), and NHS England's second \"sector deal\" aim to establish in the coming years. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125253//\">\"UK Plugs Into Golden Period For Medtech Innovation\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>The LSIS was authored by Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who is a champion of genomics and of the power it brings to identify at-risk individuals with greater precision. Genomics is expected to have a profound impact on the development of diagnostics and on new ways of treating disease, he said. The biggest genomics company, Illumina, which has built its genomics reach around the 2007 purchase of UK DNA sequencing firm Solexa, is of the same mind. </p><p>Illumina CSO David Bentley told In Vivo that if genetic testing followed the trend of wearables, becoming readily accessible and filling in gaps like phenotypes and medical indicators, such as pulse and blood sugar level, it will become very popular. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV124323//\">\"Illumina CSO Bentley Paints A Vision For The Future Of Precision Medicine\" \"In Vivo\"</url>)</p><p>Many key genomics organizations already use Illumina technology, such as 23andMe and Grail, illustrating its pivotal role in individuals' health care management. Things to come for Illumina include the completion of the$1.2bn acquisition of Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PacBio), giving it both long- and short-read technologies; and projects on sudden cardiac death and neurological diseases. </p><p>Elevating Early Diagnosis</p><p>Improved patient outcomes and cost-savings for provider systems have long been the obvious yet all-too-easily overlooked benefits of IVDs and other diagnostics technologies. Conditions such as cancer, stroke, heart disease and diabetes can be supported or prevented through early and regular use of diagnostics. But despite widespread recognition of their value, diagnostic services have suffered from chronic underinvestment in health care systems, and slow or even non-availability of IVD tests in mainstream medicine. </p><p>The message of \"the earlier and the more targeted, the better\" has become more understandable with the success of AI and machine learning, and the power of big data. Diagnostics' true value is thus becoming more visible, and the importance of early diagnosis is being elevated in initiatives like the NHS Long Term Plan (LTP) in the UK. Technologies are being developed faster too. The LTP states that by 2021, pathology networks will deliver quicker test turnaround times and improved access to more complex tests at less overall cost. </p><p>IVDs are the biggest subsegment of the world medtech market (including dental and ophthalmic) of $426bn in 2018. IVDs accounted for almost 13% or $55.4bn. By 2021, the overall IVDs market will have risen to $70bn, according to IQVIA Medtech in a 2019 global IVDs industry outlook white paper.</p><p>M&amp;A Deals In Medtech</p><p>M&amp;A spending increased in the 12 months to June 2019, according to EY, but the uplift came from a larger number of smaller deals. The 2019 batch of major disclosed deals reveal significant spending from a limited number of acquirers. </p><p>The eye-catching deal-makers were: 3M, with $7.7bn-worth of spending in two major deals; Stryker, whose deal to buy Wright Medical for $4bn will combine the third and ninth largest orthopedic groups in 2020; and Exact Sciences, a colorectal cancer diagnostics and services company, in purchasing Genomic Health. Exact Sciences had sales of just $1.8m in 2014, rising swiftly to $454m in 2018, spurred by an ACS recommendation that colorectal\u00a0cancer\u00a0screening\u00a0should begin\u00a0at\u00a0age\u00a045, not 50.\u00a0</p><p>But while deal numbers are smaller on average, valuations are getting higher. Medtechs are seemingly prioritizing tuck-ins and portfolio optimization, rather than opting for larger, more adventurous targets. The largest M&amp;A deals in the first ten months of 2019 were as follows: </p><p>Largest Medtech M&amp;A Deals In 2019*</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Buyer</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Target</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Industry Sector</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Price</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Announced 2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3M (US)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">M*Modal</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Health IT</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$1bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">February 4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">J&amp;J (US)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Auris Health (US)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Robotics surgery</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$3.4bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">February 13</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Danaher</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">GE's Biopharma business</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Drug discovery tools</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$21.4bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">February 25</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Smith &amp; Nephew</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Osiris Therapeutics</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Regen-med - wound care</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$660m</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">March 12</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">3M</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Acelity</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Wound care</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$6.7bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">May 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Boston Scientific</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Vertiflex</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Orthopedics ? spinal implants</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$465m</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">May 9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dassault Systems</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Medidata</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Clinical trials software (mainly pharma)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$5.8bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">June 12</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Abbvie</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Allergan</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Pharma deal, incl. medical aesthetics</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$63bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">June 25</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Exact Sciences</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Genomic Health</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Cancer diagnostic tests</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$2.3bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">July 29</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Siemens Healthineers</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Corindus</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Vascular robotics</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$1.1bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">August 8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stryker</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mobius</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Imaging  Robotics</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$500m</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">September 4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cantel Medical (US)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Hu-Friedy (US)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Dental devices</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$719.4m</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">October 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stryker</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wright Medical</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Extremities orthopedics</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">$4bn</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">November 4</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>* Correct as of November 8, 2019; deal value $450m and above</p><p>SOURCE: IN VIVO AND MEDTECH INSIGHT</p><p>Robotics Market Growth Tempts Innovators\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Competition in robotics is picking up, as many want a bigger piece of the action that the robotics pioneer Intuitive Surgical has done so much to create. They also know that space is limited in a market with very high entry barriers, hence the rapid attention to targeted M&amp;A in the past two to three years. CMR Surgical, Verb Surgical, Olympus Corp., Samsung, TransEnterix Inc. and Wego Holding Co., all serious contenders, now have even greater competition from Medtronic, with its Hugo RAS system that will rival Intuitive's Da Vinci system in gynecologic, urologic, cardiothoracic surgery, head and neck and general surgery. The market for robotic minimally invasive surgery systems is growing at some 20% annually and is worth about $4bn, according to Medtronic. The global market for RAS systems is expected to reach $5.3bn by 2021.</p><p>Medtronic also markets the Mazor robotic system for spine surgery. NuVasive Inc. and Globus Medical are now developing orthopedics platforms, and Auris Health is also expected to compete with Intuitive in the area of robotic-assisted bronchoscope devices, by means of its endoluminal system for minimally invasive biopsies in the peripheral lung. It follows DePuy Synthes' purchase of Orthotaxy's robotic technology for orthopedics in 2018, which some saw as a belated entry into the sector. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Siemens and Johnson &amp; Johnson made the largest robotics M&amp;A deals in 2019. Stryker was in there too, with an imaging robotics purchase (Moebius). This large-scale move into robotics is a further illustration of how medtechs in 2019-2020 are becoming immersed in disruptive technologies and practices that go beyond the technology alone.</p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashley.yeo@informa.com\">Ashley Yeo</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVIVO-IV124391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVIVO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPN-03M1-F0JS-Y002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436900</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4217\"/><timeReceived>9:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>In Vivo</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001XAD</classCode><className>BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS339113 SURGICAL APPLIANCE &amp;

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has lately attracted an unlikely group of fans during her rise to power in Washington: the populist right, as well as none other than President Donald Trump's former advisorSteve Bannon, according to a recentPolitico[1]interview. </p><p>That's right, Bannon is among the group of right-wing public figures who have showered praise on the politically far-left congresswoman recently, dubbing her as a rising star in the Democratic Party. 'AOC has what I call 'gameness' or competitive heart \u2014 the combination of grit, determination, fighting spirit that you can't coach,' Bannon told Politico. 'You either have it or you don't, and she has it big league.' Bannon said despite the vast differences between Ocasio-Cortez' policies and that of the right, the 29-year-old Democratic socialist can still cooperate with the populist right on a number of issues, including a stronger approach to dealing with China and stronger regulations on big tech. Even Bannon's former boss, Trump, doesn't seem to mind Ocasio-Cortez calling him a racist, when he was asked about it earlier this month: 'Who cares?'

nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the world s most influential voices on merger policy is among the unlikeliest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jason Furman, President Barack Obama s chief economic adviser, has never worked as an enforcer and doesn t hold a position of power in government. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, macroeconomics is his specialty, not antitrust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite proficiency with GDP growth, job numbers and labor market flows rather than merger analysis, legal precedent and remedies, Furman   who does list tech policy as an academic pursuit   is a hot commodity on the international competition law and policy scene. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tackling mergers from an economic angle, he relies on number-crunching to buttress his argument that concentration has increased across a range of industries due to consolidation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Free from the day-to-day machinations of enforcement, Furman has the bandwidth to ponder deeper, existential questions about antitrust, such as whether a tectonic shift is needed to regulate digital platforms.</p><p>With Obama Vice President Joe Biden set to be nominated at the mostly virtual Democratic National Convention from Monday, Aug. 17, to Thursday, Furman s ideas are poised to resonate more loudly in Washington if his former colleague wins the White House. </p><p>Furman would  receive a more favorable audience in a Biden administration  than under President Donald Trump, former Republican Federal Trade Commission chairman Bill Kovacic said, with the caveat that many perspectives would compete for Biden s attention. </p><p>For a taste of Furman s influence, look to the U.K., where the British government tapped him in 2018 to chair a government panel that examined competition in the digital economy.</p><p>His work culminated in a March 2019 report, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785547/unlocking_digital_competition_furman_review_web.pdf\">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785547/unlocking_digital_competition_furman_review_web.pdf</url> |Unlocking Digital Competition,\" that recommended sweeping changes to antitrust oversight, including creation of a new enforcement division with the power to investigate internet companies and impose solutions.</p><p>London s Competition and Markets Authority is now crafting a <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814709/cma_digital_strategy_2019.pdf\">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814709/cma_digital_strategy_2019.pdf</url>   |digital markets strategy that will draw on suggestions from what it dubbed the  Furman Report. </p><p>A CMA spokeswoman confirmed that no decision has been made regarding whether the unit would be part of the agency or a separate entity.</p><p>The choice of an Obama cabinet member-turned-Harvard University economics professor for this critical role, rather than a distinguished former antitrust agency chairman, says a lot about Furman s stature. </p><p> Jason is one of the lead thinkers on how public policy needs to adjust to the realities of the digital market,  said Gene Kimmelman, chief counsel at the Department of Justice antitrust division under Obama.</p><p> If governments are relying on his expertise, that s very wise of them. </p><p>As the Deal <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20004714/index.dl\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20004714/index.dl</url>  |reported in March, Kimmelman is floating a third enforcement agency for Washington, alongside the FTC and DOJ, designed to oversee digital platforms that don t fit traditional antitrust models. </p><p>It s an audacious concept inspired by Furman s U.K. proposal.</p><p>For someone who doesn t list antitrust as an area of expertise on his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/jason-furman\">https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/jason-furman</url>      |bio, Furman s tentacles reach deep in the world of competition. </p><p>He's testified before the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Federal Trade Commission and Congress on merger policy.</p><p>Among his talking points: rising concentration has strengthened market power, a trend confirmed by macroeconomic data, underscoring the need for robust enforcement.</p><p>Now, this phantom enforcer is well-positioned to raise his profile on antitrust as Big Tech faces a <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20007190/index.dl|backlash\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20007190/index.dl|backlash</url> in Washington, and with a former boss leading in the presidential polls heading into November.</p><p>Middle Lane</p><p>While it might be tempting for critics to dismiss Furman as a radical seeking revolutionary change, he's no liberal firebrand. </p><p>When progressives Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., announced plans in April for a temporary moratorium on large mergers to prevent companies from exploiting the pandemic, Furman panned the proposal. </p><p> I strongly support tougher merger enforcement in general,  he tweeted. </p><p> But banning all mergers without regard to any analysis of their circumstances makes no sense in the best of times and is particularly misguided when some mergers can save jobs in the midst of an economic crisis. </p><p>The sentiment likely contributed to the planned legislation ultimately being shelved by the lawmakers.</p><p>Furman has pushed back on other antitrust-related progressive priorities. </p><p>While the CMA report he shepherded proposed a new regulatory framework for tech giants, it didn t recommend unraveling them.</p><p>That s a significant departure from Warren, who vowed on the campaign trail to split apart Facebook Inc. (FB), Alphabet Inc. s (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to promote competition. </p><p> In the Furman report they don t talk about breaking up companies,  emphasized Kovacic, now a law professor at George Washington University. </p><p>The team always pitched their approach as not advocating the dismantling of companies, and Furman s tweet opposing a merger ban  is consistent with that  centrist approach, the former FTC chairman said. </p><p>Notably, the U.K. report also endorsed the consumer welfare standard, a key metric for vetting mergers that emphasizes consumer effects such as price hikes, as liberals seek to expand it to encompass variables such as racial equity and poverty.</p><p>But Furman s team did suggest improvements could be made to how the existing standard is applied to transactions.</p><p>The Harvard professor didn t respond to a request for comment, so it s unclear if   or to what extent   he s working behind the scenes to shape Biden s approach to merger policy.</p><p>But Kovacic thinks Furman has a role.  It would be astonishing  if he wasn t involved given his tenure in the Obama-Biden White House, he said. </p><p>Whether or not the professor helped shape the draft 2020 <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20007549/index.dl|Democratic\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20007549/index.dl|Democratic</url> Party Platform to be ratified this week, his antitrust priorities are reflected in the document, which warns of market concentration while describing corporate breakups as \"a last resort. </p><p>Improbable Journey</p><p>During a 2018 FTC hearing on the future of competition and consumer protection, Furman explained how he stumbled upon antitrust. </p><p>While serving as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013 to 2017, he encountered the topic while exploring low productivity growth and high income inequality. </p><p>\"There was a crime that had been committed and we were looking for suspects,\" as something was \"clearly going wrong in the economy,\" he told the commission.</p><p>Those two factors \"were underlying the slowdown of the growth in income\" for typical families, he said.</p><p>Regarding the selection of Furman to head the U.K. panel on digital competition, he was chosen because the Brits wanted someone who would approach these angles with a wide lens, Kovacic said. </p><p> Someone who knew a lot about competition policy, but not just from an antitrust perspective,  added the former FTC chairman, the only American on the CMA board. </p><p>The agency recognized that regulation of digital platforms encompasses a myriad of issues, including intellectual property, data, privacy and consumer protection, he explained.</p><p>But antitrust and regulatory perspectives also were represented. </p><p>Other participants included Amelia Fletcher, a CMA board member who served as chief economist on mergers for the Office of Fair Trading, a predecessor to London s current authority.</p><p>Phillip Marsden, a former CMA and Office of Fair Trading enforcer, also was on the panel. </p><p> He didn t have that enforcement background, but Amelia and Phillip did,  Kovacic said.</p><p>Furman s moderate views on antitrust and supportive commentary about major corporations don t always sit well with left-leaning advocacy groups worried about monopoly power. </p><p> In 2005 @jasonfurman wrote a paper titled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mackinac.org/archives/2006/walmart.pdf\">https://www.mackinac.org/archives/2006/walmart.pdf</url>    |Walmart: A Progressive Success Story,  Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute and author of \"Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy,\"\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1258041733847359495|tweeted\">https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1258041733847359495|tweeted</url> May 6. </p><p> Today he fancies himself an objective scientist and pronounces dictums on anti-monopoly policy.

The bill is intended to address mega-mergers and private equity predation. </p><p>Kovacic suggested that the rift among Democrats over Furman s positions reflects deeper tensions building within the party over antitrust that would widen if Biden wins. </p><p> Part of what's going to be interesting to watch  are the  intra-party debates among the Democrats  to decide which enforcement vision should prevail under Biden, the former FTC chairman observed.</p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 50 Billion and Up</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-20007647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MY-BTK1-JBSN-10MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deal, L.L.C.

First, the lords of Silicon Valley face political headwinds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is tech-company skepticism on the populist right, the anticorporate left and the goodgovernment center. There is talk of trustbusting and utility-style regulation from Steve Bannon as well as Bernie Sanders. There is a palpable feeling, as Ben Smith of Buzzfeed wrote last week, that the online giants' \"golden age\" of political immunity is ending, and that it might be \"normal politics, normal regulation\" from here on out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second, one of these giants - Amazon - is in the market for a second headquarters, where it intends to park some 50,000 employees and an awful lot of tech-industry dollars over the years and decades ahead.</p><p>The Amazon hunt has inspired data whizzes to argue about which U.S. metropolis best fits the company's demanding specifications. The New York Times' The Upshot, for instance, used indicators like job growth, an educated labor pool, quality of life and ease of transportation to winnow the list to Portland, Oregon; Denver; Boston; and D.C. - and then gave the edge to Denver for its space and lower cost of living.</p><p>The company will probably ultimately make a choice along these lines. But the political backdrop, the growing suspicion on the right and left about whether big tech serves the common good, raises an interesting question: What if Amazon treated their headquartering decision as an act of corporate citizenship, part public relations stunt and part genuinely patriotic gesture? What if it approached the decision as an opportunity to push back against trends driving populist suspicion of big business - educational and geographic polarization, coastal growth and heartland decay, the sense that the New Economy creates wealth but not jobs and that its tycoons are loyal to globalization rather than their country?</p><p>Amazon can't realistically spread its offices and jobs across America's most isolated and despairing counties. But instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state - think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham. Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative to the obvious Acelaland options - not Boston but Hartford, Connecticut, not D.C. but Baltimore, not New York but Bridgeport, Connecticut. Or it could pick a big, battered, declining city and offer its presence as an engine of revitalization, building Amazon Cleveland or Amazon Detroit.</p><p>A particularly compelling pick, according to my extremely nonscientific \"what's good for America\" metric, might be St. Louis - a once-great metropolis fallen on hard times, the major urban center for a large spread of Trump country, the geographic center of the country and the historic bridge between East and West.</p><p>Of course, Amazon also needs its choice for a new headquarters to make financial sense. The company is not a charity, and making itself the prisoner of a disastrous investment won't ultimately help anyone except its rivals.</p><p>But it's hard to know with any real certainty what the best long-term geographic investment for the company would be. The fact that tech companies tend to cluster doesn't mean that a uniquely rich and powerful company couldn't benefit from having a city of its own. The fact that bright young singletons gravitate toward coastal urbs right now doesn't mean that you couldn't attract talent - especially married-with-kids talent - to a heartland city whose Amazon District took advantage of sprawling housing stock left over from a prosperous past.</p><p>Depending on which elements on Amazon's wish list you weight most heavily, you can make a great variety of cities score impressively - from Bridgeport to Provo, Utah; Detroit to Rochester, New York.</p><p>Ultimately, as Lyman Stone, a prolific Department of Agriculture cotton economist, points out in a piece on Amazon's decision, there is no city that comes close to meeting all of the company's requirements: \"No matter where Amazon goes, they will have to build their own fundamentals.\"</p><p>And no matter where the company goes, what it builds will change that city radically - so a static analysis of any destination will only take you so far.</p><p>If Donald Trump were the deal making, industrial-policy president that he once promised to be, he would be on the phone with Jeff Bezos right now, making a case along these very lines - while hinting, broadly and of course nonthreateningly (har, har), at the political benefits of opening Amazon St. Louis or Amazon Detroit, of being seen as a company that renews cities and doesn't just put brick and mortar out of business.</p><p>I don't have a strong view - yet - on whether we should treat internet giants like utilities. But when you enjoy a monopoly's powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind of pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as if what's good for America is good for Amazon as well.</p><p>Ross Douthat is a New York Times columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>By Ross Douthat</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-091917A04art2xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897D7163BBD40 NWBKCT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHF-C371-JBCN-42KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Record-Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

First, the lords of Silicon Valley face political headwinds. There is tech-company skepticism on the populist right, the anti-corporate left and the good-government center. </p><p>There is talk of trustbusting and utility-style regulation from Steve Bannon as well as Bernie Sanders. There is a palpable feeling, as Ben Smith of Buzzfeed wrote last week, that the online giants' 'golden age' of political immunity is ending, and that it might be 'normal politics, normal regulation' from here on out. Second, one of these giants \u2014 Amazon \u2014 is in the market for a second headquarters, where it intends to park some 50,000 employees and an awful lot of tech-industry dollars over the years and decades ahead.The Amazon hunt has inspired data whizzes to argue about which U.S. metropolis best fits the company's demanding specifications. The New York Times' The Upshot, for instance, used indicators like job growth, an educated labor pool, quality of life and ease of transportation to winnow the list to Portland, Ore.; Denver; Boston; and D.C. \u2014 and then gave the edge to Denver for its space and lower cost of living. The company will probably ultimately make a choice along these lines. But the political backdrop, the growing suspicion on the right and left about whether big tech serves the common good, raises an interesting question: What if Amazon treated its headquartering decision as an act of corporate citizenship, part public-relations stunt and part genuinely patriotic gesture? What if it approached the decision as an opportunity to push back against trends driving populist suspicion of big business \u2014 educational and geographic polarization, coastal growth and heartland decay, the sense that the New Economy creates wealth but not jobs and that its tycoons are loyal to globalization rather than their country? Top Opinion stories Amazon can't realistically spread its offices and jobs across America's most isolated and despairing counties. But instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state \u2014 think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham. Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative to the obvious Acelaland options \u2014 not Boston but Hartford, Conn., not D.C. but Baltimore, not New York but Bridgeport, Conn. Or it could pick a big, battered, declining city and offer its presence as an engine of revitalization, building Amazon Cleveland or Amazon Detroit. A particularly compelling pick, according to my extremely nonscientific 'what's good for America' metric, might be St. Louis \u2014 a once-great metropolis fallen on hard times, the major urban center for a large spread of Trump country, the geographic center of the country and the historic bridge between East and West. Of course, Amazon also needs its choice for a new headquarters to make financial sense. The company is not a charity, and making itself the prisoner of a disastrous investment won't ultimately help anyone except its rivals.But it's hard to know with any real certainty what the best long-term geographic investment for the company would be. The fact that tech companies tend to cluster doesn't mean that a uniquely rich and powerful company couldn't benefit from having a city of its own. The fact that bright young singletons gravitate toward coastal urbs right now doesn't mean that you couldn't attract talent \u2014 especially married-with-kids talent \u2014 to a heartland city whose Amazon District took advantage of sprawling housing stock left over from a prosperous past. Depending on which elements on Amazon's wish list you weight most heavily, you can make a great variety of cities score impressively \u2014 from Bridgeport to Provo, Utah; Detroit to Rochester, N.Y. Ultimately, as Lyman Stone, a prolific Department of Agriculture cotton economist, points out in a piece on Amazon's decision, there is no city that comes close to meeting all of the company's requirements: 'No matter where Amazon goes, they will have to build their own fundamentals.' And no matter where the company goes, what it builds will change that city radically \u2014 so a static analysis of any destination will only take you so far. If Donald Trump were the deal-making, industrial-policy president that he once promised to be, he would be on the phone with Jeff Bezos right now, making a case along these very lines \u2014 while hinting, broadly and of course nonthreateningly (har, har), at the political benefits of opening Amazon St. Louis or Amazon Detroit, of being seen as a company that renews cities and doesn't just put brick and mortar out of business.I don't have a strong view \u2014 yet \u2014 on whether we should treat internet giants like utilities. But when you enjoy a monopoly's powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind of pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as if what's good for America is good for Amazon as well. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-SE1297571505776295747251761300174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SE-129757</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHD-6931-F03R-N42X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>11:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Today File</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

First, the lords of Silicon Valley face political headwinds. There is tech-company skepticism on the populist right, the anti-corporate left and the good-government center. There is talk of trustbusting and utility-style regulation from <person><nameText>Steve Bannon </nameText></person>as well as Bernie Sanders. There is a palpable feeling, as Ben Smith of Buzzfeed wrote last week, that the online giants' \"golden age\" of political immunity is ending, and that it might be \"normal politics, normal regulation\" from here on out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Second, one of these giants - Amazon - is in the market for a second headquarters, where it intends to park some 50,000 employees and an awful lot of tech-industry dollars over the years and decades ahead.</p><p>The Amazon hunt has inspired data whizzes to argue about which American metropolis best fits the company's demanding specifications. This newspaper's The Upshot, for instance, used indicators like job growth, an educated labor pool, quality of life and ease of transportation to winnow the list to Portland, Ore.; Denver; Boston; and D.C. - and then gave the edge to Denver for its space and lower cost of living.</p><p>The company will probably ultimately make a choice along these lines. But the political backdrop, the growing suspicion on right and left about whether big tech serves the common good, raises an interesting question: What if Amazon treated their headquartering decision as an act of corporate citizenship, part public relations stunt and part genuinely patriotic gesture? What if it approached the decision as an opportunity to push back against trends driving populist suspicion of big business - educational and geographic polarization, coastal growth and heartland decay, the sense that the New Economy creates wealth but not jobs and that its tycoons are loyal to globalization rather than their country?</p><p>Amazon can't realistically spread its offices and jobs across America's most isolated and despairing counties. But instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state - think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham. Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative to the obvious Acelaland options - not Boston but Hartford, not D.C. but Baltimore, not New York but Bridgeport. Or it could pick a big, battered, declining city and offer its presence as an engine of revitalization, building Amazon Cleveland or Amazon Detroit.</p><p>A particularly compelling pick, according to my extremely nonscientific \"what's good for America\" metric, might be St. Louis - a once-great metropolis fallen on hard times, the major urban center for a large spread of Trump country, the geographic center of the country and the historic bridge between East and West.</p><p>Of course, Amazon also needs its choice for a new headquarters to make financial sense. The company is not a charity, and making itself the prisoner of a disastrous investment won't ultimately help anyone except its rivals.</p><p>But it's hard to know with any real certainty what the best long-term geographic investment for the company would be. The fact that tech companies tend to cluster doesn't mean that a uniquely rich and powerful company couldn't benefit from having a city of its own. The fact that bright young singletons gravitate toward coastal urbs right now doesn't mean that you couldn't attract talent - especially married-with-kids talent - to a heartland city whose Amazon District took advantage of sprawling housing stock left over from a prosperous past. Depending on which elements on Amazon's wish list you weight most heavily, you can make a great variety of cities score impressively - from Bridgeport to Provo, Utah; Detroit to Rochester, N.Y.</p><p>Ultimately, as Lyman Stone, a prolific Department of Agriculture cotton economist, points out in a piece on Amazon's decision, there is no city that comes close to meeting all of the company's requirements: \"No matter where Amazon goes, they will have to build their own fundamentals.\" And no matter where the company goes, what it builds will change that city radically - so a static analysis of any destination will only take you so far.</p><p>If Donald Trump were the deal making, industrial-policy president that he once promised to be, he would be on the phone with Jeff Bezos right now, making a case along these very lines - while hinting, broadly and of course nonthreateningly (har, har), at the political benefits of opening Amazon St. Louis or Amazon Detroit, of being seen as a company that renews cities and doesn't just put brick and mortar out of business.</p><p>I don't have a strong view - yet - on whether we should treat internet giants like utilities. But when you enjoy a monopoly's powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as though what's good for America is good for Amazon as well.</p><p>I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005431555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PH8-NXD1-DYR7-C2XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 16, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

But when you enjoy a monopoly\u2019s powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as though what\u2019s good for America is good for Amazon as well.</p><p>I invite you to follow me on <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/DouthatNYT\">Twitter (@DouthatNYT)</url>.</p><p>Follow The New York Times Opinion section on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion\">Twitter (@NYTopinion)</url>, and sign up for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday/\">Opinion Today newsletter</url>. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005431555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGV-GTB1-DXY4-X125-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 16, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Ed</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Bezos, Jeffrey P</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Corporate Social Responsibility</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Relocation of Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bezos, Jeffrey P</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp;

First, the lords of Silicon Valley face political headwinds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is tech-company skepticism on the populist right, the anti-corporate left and the good-government center. There is talk of trustbusting and utility-style regulation from <person><nameText>Steve Bannon </nameText></person>as well as Bernie Sanders. There is a palpable feeling, as Ben Smith of Buzz-feed wrote last week, that the online giants' \"golden age\" of political immunity is ending, and that it might be \"normal politics, normal regulation\" from here on out.</p><p>Second, one of these giants - Amazon - is in the market for a second headquarters, where it intends to park some 50,000 employees and an awful lot of tech-industry dollars over the years and decades ahead.</p><p>The Amazon hunt has inspired data whizzes to argue about which U.S. metropolis best fits the company's demanding specifications.</p><p>The New York Times' The Upshot, for instance, used indicators like job growth, an educated labor pool, quality of life and ease of transportation to winnow the list to Portland, Oregon; Denver; Boston; and D.C. - and then gave the edge to Denver for its space and lower cost of living.</p><p>The company will probably ultimately make a choice along these lines. But the political backdrop, the growing suspicion on the right and left about whether big tech serves the common good, raises an interesting question:</p><p>What if Amazon treated their headquartering decision as an act of corporate citizenship, part public relations stunt and part genuinely patriotic gesture?</p><p>Instead of picking an obvious BosWash hub or creative-class boomtown, it could opt to plant itself in a medium-sized city in a conservative state - think Nashville or Indianapolis or Birmingham.</p><p>Or it could look for a struggling East Coast alternative - Hartford, Connecticut, Baltimore, Bridgeport, Connecticut. Or it could pick a declining city and offer its presence as an engine of revitalization, building Amazon Cleveland or Amazon Detroit.</p><p>A particularly compelling pick might be St. Louis - a once-great metropolis fallen on hard times, the major urban center for a large spread of Trump country, the geographic center of the country and the historic bridge between East and West.</p><p>Of course, Amazon also needs its choice for a new headquarters to make financial sense.</p><p>If Donald Trump were the deal making, industrial-policy president that he once promised to be, he would be on the phone with <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos </nameText></person>right now, making a case along these very lines - while hinting, broadly and of course nonthreateningly (har, har), at the political benefits of opening Amazon St. Louis or Amazon Detroit, of being seen as a company that renews cities and doesn't just put brick and mortar out of business.</p><p>I don't have a strong view - yet - on whether we should treat internet giants like utilities.</p><p>But when you enjoy a monopoly's powers, one way to avoid being regulated like one is to act with a kind of pre-emptive patriotism, and behave as if what's good for America is good for Amazon as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAYDNW-DDN/2017/09/19/Ar00910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAYDNW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHD-K191-JC1N-W1NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144574</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Dayton Newspapers, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Dayton Daily News (Ohio)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 19, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

From Dunedin, the startup carved out a global niche in appointment-booking software, which is today used by around 12,000 hair salons, personal trainers and other small businesses worldwide.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Along the way, Baker has also become something of an influencer in the way we work. In its early days, the CEO and his handful of cohorts worked from their homes - not unusual for a bootstrapped startup. But the difference with Timely is that Baker stuck with the remote-working setup even as his staff swelled to more than 90, with Slack used as the primary communications tool to keep everyone on the same page as new hires have been added in Wellington, Auckland, Melbourne and the UK. So how many hours do his remote staff work? Baker says he's only focused on outcomes, not timesheets. \"Doing 70 hours of it isn't hustle, it's a shambles,\" he wrote in his widely-shared post slating \"Unwork\" - or mindless hours mistaken for productivity.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Campbell Brown  </p><p>PredictHQ founder  </p><p>Three years ago, Aucklander Campbell Brown (main image) was running Online Republic, a site that offered online car and camper van rentals and cruise ship bookings. But the company had difficulty predicting demand.  </p><p>It was constantly caught out by public events or, more particularly, when several public events happened at once, especially around holidays. Brown was amazed to discover that while there were lots of forecasting tools that mined historic data, there was no global player who aggregated all public events in one, easy to access service. So after Online Republic was flicked off to Webjet (for a tidy $85 million) he founded PredictIQ to do just that. He quickly signed marquee customers, including Uber, and Domino's - which in turn filled a US$10m ($15m) Series A funding round mid-year from a group of heavyweight Silicon Valley VCs. Today, 80 staff - and a ton of AI - track more than 20 million events in more than 30,000 cities. Brown says he's shooting for $100m annual revenue in the medium term. His longer-term target is $1b.  </p><p>Alex Fala  </p><p>Vend CEO  </p><p>On one level, Alex Fala sounds like a bread-head. He recently told the Herald he expects Vend to hit a $1b valuation within five years. The Auckland-based maker of cloud point-of-sale software (think of an iPad replacing a cash register) already has a private equity valuation of more than $150m, and backers including Peter Thiel and Sam Morgan on its books. Vend already has around 300 staff and Fala says he's on the hunt for 125 more - and that his company can fund the extra hires without any need for new capital. Regardless, there's IPO buzz. Vend might not need their cash, but investors want in on a company that's looking like the new Xero. So it's obvious Fala has management and financial chops. But Vend has also developed a reputation as a family-friendly place to work. Before he began a corporate career, Fala was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, where his thesis was \"Saving the Samoan Culture: Sustainability of Gift-giving Traditions in the New Zealand Samoan Community.\" He is also a member of the Conscious Capitalism NZ group.  </p><p>Lisa FongNational Cyber Security Centre Director, GCSB Cyber Security Director  </p><p>No pressure. In an era when online threats are rising from hostile governments, organised crime, thrill seekers and anarchists, Lisa Fong heads the National Cyber Security Centre, a unit of the GCSB whose mission \"is to help New Zealand's most significant public and private sector organisations to protect their information systems from advanced cyber-borne threats\"that could hit critical infrastructure, see top exporter's IP secrets spilled or otherwise harm our economy.  </p><p>Fong - who finished in the top 1 per cent of her year as she gained an LLB at Auckland then a Master of Laws from the New York University School of Law as a Vanderbilt Scholar - is also on the GCSB's senior leadership team as the spook outfit's Cyber Security Director. That's some responsibility, given the The Telecommunications (Interception Capability and Security) Act 2013 makes the spy agency responsible for approving or blocking any phone company or ISP's network improvements (think Huawei being blocked from Spark's 5G upgrade) and - in an era of creeping encryption - making sure that all networks carry interceptable data. Next on her agenda: working with ISPs on a system to develop the capability to \"proactively detect potential incidents before they occur\".  </p><p>Anna Guenther  </p><p>PledgeMe founder  </p><p>PledgeMe, which has become a mainstay of the crowdfunded equity scene over the past couple of years, came about in part from Anna Guenther's masters thesis at Otago University, and seeing the success Kickstarter was having in the US. \"I was doing my Master in Entrepreneurship and the thesis was to do everything but launch a business [and I was] really interested in crowdfunding,\" she says.  </p><p>A timely regulatory change mid-decade saw the Financial Markets Authority license PledgeMe as one of NZ's first wave of crowdfunded equity platforms. To date, PledgeMe has raised more than $40m, over half of that over the past 24 months as it has expanded across the Tasman. In 2016, Guenther became one of the leaders of the ginger group Women Who Get Shit Done and has lobbied to get more women into technology, and more women into governance roles. Notably, she shamed the Hi-Tech Awards on social media in 2018 for claiming to \"Celebrate Diversity\" while having only one female speaker out of 16. The event picked up its game the following year. She told the Herald that she attended the Hi-Tech Awards before last as a guest of a sponsor. \"I remember a guy approached us and complimented the man I was with on bringing such a 'hot date'. He didn't think that maybe I ran a tech company.\"  </p><p>Dean Hall  </p><p>RocketWerkz CEO, unlimited leave advocate  </p><p>Oamaru kid Dean Hall cut his teeth on the primitive, arcade-style games offered by Amiga 500 and Commodore 64 computers before a five year stint in the Air Force, followed by a spell at Wellington game developer Sidhe Interactive, then signed up with the Army for two years - including survival training in Brunei. He then headed to Europe, where he blended his enlisted and gaming experience to create a zombie shoot 'em up game called DayZ - which started as a \"mod\" for another game, ARMA2, but went on to earn a reported $100m. Hall then returned to New Zealand in 2015, where he founded his own game development studio, Rocketwerkz - which employs 50 people in Dunedin. Following an injection of capital from Chinese gaming giant Tencent (which now owns 36 per cent of his company), Hall is opening a second studio in Auckland to create a big-budget survival game. He's looking for 60 staff for his Auckland waterfront operation, and hopes to have a full complement in a marquee waterfront location by the end of 2020 (he currently has 30 in temporary Albert St digs).  </p><p>Mahmood Hikmet  </p><p>Ohmio R&amp;D head  </p><p>Mohammed Hikmet and his young family escaped war-torn Iraq for New Zealand in 1991. It wasn't all roses: the one-time pizza delivery boy was told his tertiary qualifications weren't recognised here so he had to work three part-time jobs as he put himself through university all over again.  </p><p>Hikmet then started a computer repair business before seeing an opportunity for electronic signs and co-founding HMI Technologies - maker of those ubiquitous solar-powered signs that display your speed in real-time, or tell you to slow down. In 2017, HMI spun-off its Ohmio unit which is developing self-driving electric vehicles - with instructions sent via 5G and lidar sensors to avoid unexpected obstructions. The public face and research and development brains behind Ohmio is Mohammed Hikmet's son Mahmood Hikmet - who gained an engineering PhD from Auckland University. Ohmio has had two of its larger self-driving people-movers piloted at Christchurch Airport, and has an MoU with a South Korean smart city developer for 150 more - which will be manufactured in Heshan after Ohmio inked a US$20m joint-venture deal with the Chinese city after failing to find a local backer.  </p><p>Danny Ing  </p><p>CIN7 founder  </p><p>A 6-year-old Danny Ing and his family arrived in NZ the late 1970s as refugees, having earlier escaped war-torn Vietnam as boat people.  </p><p>His parents opened a takeaway shop in Te Puke, and Ing worked there part-time to save for his first computer, a Commodore 64. Computers remained Ing's passion and at age 27 he set up his own web design company. It morphed into CIN7 (for Connected Inventory), which helps retailers sell sets of goods through both a bricks and mortar stores and multiple online sales channels. Business really started to boom in 2017 when Amazon set up shop across the Tasman, and local retailers needed a hand negotiating its systems. But by this year half of CIN7's new business - managed by 150 staff, all in Auckland - was coming out of North America. Ing went looking for a US partner to help manage his company's hyper-growth. A broker ended up introducing him to Colorado-based venture capital outfit Rubicon Technology Partners, who took a majority stake in October. Ing won't say how much money changed hands, but it was above the $100m threshold that triggers Overseas Investment Office scrutiny (the agency approved the deal). Now all eyes on are Ing's next move.  </p><p>Angie Judge  </p><p>Dexibit CEO, founder  </p><p>A typically busy November saw Dexibit founder Angie Judge pick up an Inspiring Women Leaders gong at NZ Trade &amp; Enterprise's New Zealand International Business Awards 2019 (shared with the Organic Initiative's Helen Robinson) and take the stage in front of an audience of 500 for the PCW Herald Talks event \"How to be a tech revolutionary.\"  </p><p>Judge founded Dexibit, an analytics company that provides data to museums and other cultural institutions, from the UK's National Gallery to Motat, using AI to analyse how visitors behave today and to predict future trends. Judge is an advocate for more women in technology in the media and in her public speaking, but also leads by example. Half her company's staff spread across Auckland, Washington and London are female, represented in all business units including data science, and engineering. And Dexibit's board is 60 per cent women.  </p><p>Jon Kalaugher  </p><p>Flowingly founder, MK1 Ventures director  </p><p>Jon Kalaugher has developed something of a golden touch with his investments in software-as-a-service (SaaS) startups through his MK1 Ventures vehicle. The entrepreneur was an early backer of cloud success stories including AskNicely, Joyous, Plexure and PushPay.  </p><p>Along the way he founded IT services outfit Securecom in 2002, then sold it in 2009 before founding Naverisk to create workflow automation software for managed service providers and IT professionals. After Naverisk was bought by Texan company ECI in 2015 for US$15m, Kalaugher founded his third startup, Flowingly, which creates workflow automation software - but for every aspect of a company, not just the IT department. Through the funds he's generated from previous wins, Kalaugher was able to fund Flowingly himself as it bagged a major Fortune 100 customer in Europe. Now, Kalaugher is in the process of raising $23m for Flowingly, and on the eye-out for more SaaS startups to invest in.  </p><p>Arama Kukutai  </p><p>Finistere Ventures partner  </p><p>One time Parininihi ki Waitotara Trust deputy chairman and NZTE regional director Arama Kukutai is now a partner at venture capital company Finistere Ventures, which has offices in Silicon Valley, San Diego and Ireland. Finistere invests worldwide, but one of its specialities has been backing New Zealand agrifood and agritech startups including medical cannabis BioLumic. Earlier this year, Finistere set up a satellite office at The Factory in Palmerston North, and led a $13m funding round for Christchurch-based food and beverage player Invert Robotics. Kukutai is open to pitches in the sector as Finistere invests US$200m from its latest fund, a big chunk of which he'd like to invest in NZ.  </p><p>Young Ly, AJ Bertenshaw, Steve West  </p><p>Serato CEO; founders  </p><p>While you might not have heard of the DJ software company, fans like Kayne West and Eminem have turned it in to a music industry mainstay.  </p><p>Serato's 150 staff have a global lock on their niche, earning the company tens of millions per year. chief executive Young Ly was the father of Grabaseat during his time as innovation manager at Air NZ. Today he's the driving force behind Serato's relentless growth. Co-founders AJ Bertenshaw and Steve West are still directors, but these days spending most of their time on new projects. Bertenshaw is an investor in TicketFairy, an online service for selling tickets and organising events that hopes to take on the likes of Ticketmaster and Ticketek, while West is backing ChargeNet, which is in the process of building a nationwide network of EV chargers.  </p><p>Edwina MistryCreateOps founder  </p><p>Over the past decade, Edwina Mistry been been involved in efforts to encourage high school students, especially female and Maori and Pasifika students in South Auckland, into the technology industry through programmes including JHack, YTech, Code Camp, DigiGirlz and ShadowTech, roping in industry partners such as Datacom and Microsoft to bolster her efforts. She has been on NZQA panels for ICT curriculum design for both school and tertiary and she currently serves as executive director of industry group NZTech's TechWomen project. The long-time Manukau Institute of Technology industry engagement manager has recently left academia behind to found her own company, CreateOps, for people who want to take their next step in life, change career direction or develop leadership skills.  </p><p>Emma Naji  </p><p>Intela AI co-founder, Executive Director AI Forum NZ  </p><p>Is Emma Naji good at AI? A nation of rugby fans will be hoping so. The Wellington company she co-founded, Intela AI, teamed with another startup in the capital, Dot Loves Data, and Amazon to create a new real-time video analytics tool that sees AI software \"watch\" a live feed of a game then feed analytics back to an iPad-totting coach on the sideline in real-time. The idea is that by analysing this data, which includes details such as player locations, speeds, proximity, and running paths, coaches gain new insights that help teams gain competitive advantages. NZ Rugby High-Performance Analysis Manager Jason Healy told the Herald he was excited by the technology and its potential. The All Blacks are set to trial it, Healy said - but a decision on whether its used for tests will be down to new coach Ian Foster. Naji was also recently named executive director of AI Forum NZ, an umbrella group for the fast-growing artificial intelligence industry as it grapples with the regulatory and ethical issues inherent in the Rise of the Machines.  </p><p>Robbie Paul  </p><p>Icehouse Ventures CEO, Tuhua Ventures managing partner  </p><p>With long-time doyen Andy Hamilton moving on, Robbie Paul has become the brightest star in the Icehouse universe of business incubation and investing. Paul is also a founding investor and managing partner in Icehouse spin-off Tuhua Ventures, which has put money into a number of promising startups including Parrot Analytics (which tracks social media chatter and other non-traditional metrics to gauge the popularity of TV series in the post-ratings streaming era), Chicken-free Chicken maker Sunfed and Halter, a startup that makes a smart-collar linked to a smartphone app to herd cows. Earlier this year, Paul oversaw an Icehouse restructure that saw a crew of new partners - FNZC, Sir Stephen Tindall's investment company K1W1 and KiwiSaver provider Simplicity - between them they have committed $3m to help establish Icehouse Ventures, which took over the previous startup activities of the Icehouse incubator.  </p><p>Andy Prow  </p><p>CEO and cofounder, RedShield  </p><p>2019 has been a year when Aussie VC funds like Blackbird and AirTree have swooped in to buy large chunks of Kiwi startups. But, when RedShield CEO, co-founder and major shareholder Andy Prow went looking for new capital this year, the Wellingtonian was able to find a new local backer, Pencarrow, as he raised $14m at at $64m valuation in September. RedShield earlier raised $6.2m in a Series A round in 2016. Although he has fresh buzz - one member of our panel described him as \"the next Rod Drury\" - this is not Prow's first time at the rodeo. He founded Aura Information Security, then sold to Kordia in 2015 for $10m. His latest venture makes what it calls \"shielding\" software to protect an organisation from a wide array of online nasties. RedShield provides a service for companies facing complex threats - which means most of its customers are large organisations such as healthcare providers, energy companies and government agencies.  </p><p>John-Daniel TraskRaygun co-founder  </p><p>Trask began his entrepreneurial career at Palmerston North Boys' High School in the 1990s, where he sold software on floppy disks for $5 a pop, and schooled himself on computers, in part, through reading NZ PC World magazine. After a spell working for Rod Drury's Xero, Trask co-founded his own business, now known after its product, Raygun. \"Raygun is like putting a black box flight recorder into your software,\" Trask says. His company's software records crashes and bugs, then reports backs back to the software maker on its customer experience.  </p><p>Raygun took off in the US and Trask has spent a lot of time living in Seattle, where it has an office and around a third of its 30 staff. Trask committed $15m to hiring 70 staff in Wellington as he doubled-down on his commitment to Silicon-Welly. Aaron Ward &amp; John Ballinger  </p><p>AskNicely cofounders  </p><p>\"Net promoter score\" or NPS is perhaps the trendiest business metric of 2019. It's derived from taking the number of positive mentions a company gets from customers, then taking away the number of negative mentions for a net score ranging somewhere from -100 to 100. Aaron Ward and John Ballinger didn't invent NPS, but after huddling in a Ponsonby garden shed, they did release the first app, AskNicely, designed to make it easy to calculate a person or business's NPS through real-time customer satisfaction survey data. AskNicely also aims to help companies improve their satisfaction ratings, with a \"conversational\" rather than \"interrogating\" series of quick questions. Earlier this year, AskNicely raised $15m from backers in the US, Australia and Sir Stephen Tindall's K1W1 fund at home. The next milestone: turning a profit, which Ward expects in 2020.  </p><p>Chris WilsonGrinding Gear Games managing director  </p><p>Chris Wilson rules the world from his modest office beside a West Auckland Pak'nSave - or at least a virtual world. The self-effacing Westie runs Grinding Gear Games, whose sole title, the role playing game Path of Exile, has some 2 million players worldwide. Wilson was playing another RPG a decade ago when chatting to a player who was logged on from Sweden: Erik Olofsson. The pair fantasised about creating their own fantasy world. But unlike most such chats, it didn't stop at mere fancy. Olofsson - a designer - jumped on a plane and flew down to New Zealand to collaborate with Wilson, who was whiling away his time on a series of contract-programming jobs. A 2012 kickstarter campaign raised US$200,000 to develop Path of Exile. A US$2.5m round followed in 2013 as enthusiastic fans shelled out to back the game on the crowdfunding site.  </p><p>Grinding Gear Games had grown to 114 staff by May last year when China's Tencent took a majority holding for an undisclosed sum beyond the $100m threshold that triggers OIO involvement. Wilson, who had a 43 per cent holding ahead of the Tencent deal, says he still owns a minority stake and, more importantly, negotiated to keep operations in NZ.  </p><p>Ross Young  </p><p>Google NZ public policy &amp; government affairs manager  </p><p>It's been a year of political, PR and legal challenges for Google, from ongoing debate around profit-shifting to its on-again-off-again relationship controversial online ticket seller Viagogo to it inadvertently emailing the suppressed name of Grace Millane's alleged killer in December, then again making it accessible within a click after he was convicted last month. But unlike in Australia, where Google has been caught in a number of measures cracking down on Big Tech, on this side of the Tasman there's been a lot of bark by the Crown without much bite. That's in part a testament to the skills of Google's Wellington-based senior manager for public policy and government affairs Ross Young. The ex-Commerce Commission senior legal counsel has one of the toughest jobs in tech and he's been prosecuting it well, helping to persuade our Government to take a more pragmatic, globally-focused approach than the big stick being used in Canberra. Next challenge: addressing the Deputy PM's assertion that Google and Facebook are suffocating media.     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHTech20</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR8-57S1-JDK8-V447-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 14, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

By placing second in the primary vote in California's 12th Congressional District primary, Buttar has earned himself a spot on the November general election ballot as a challenger to incumber and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi received 72.5 percent of the vote while Buttar came in second with 12.7 percent. Thanks to California's primary system - where the top two winners make it to the general election- Buttar's second-place finish means that he has garnered enough votes to make it on the ballot in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Twitter, Buttar described the victory as \"planting seeds.\" \"Now, we have 8 months to win our race,\" he tweeted.</p><p>That's certainly true. As one might expect from the highest-ranked Democrat in government, Pelosi is likely not to be easy to beat, even if her centrism and cosigning on Trump's imperialism has rankled many San Franciscans. Yet Buttar has a long history of activism and organizing that has him poised to be a formidable challenger to Rep. Pelosi. One might draw a comparison to Virginia State Senator Lee Carter, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or Seattle city councilmember Kshama Sawant - similar left-populist candidates whose redistributive policies were widely popular, enough to upset or defeat centrist or right-wing opponents.</p><p>We <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/03/01/in-democratic-socialist-shahid-buttar-a-leftist-challenger-to-nancy-pelosi-emerges/\">previously reported</url> on Buttar's campaign before the California Primary; in light of the recent results, we are printing the interview in full.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A lot of your campaign is centered around talking about what Pelosi has done wrong. I'm curious how you would respond to those who might say that the Democratic Party right now needs to be united in an effort, collective effort to get Trump out of office.</emphasis></p><p>Yes, I would agree. It's precisely why we have to remove a conservative who imposes Republican policies from the leadership of the Democratic Party.</p><p>I'll press on that. We must be united to stop Trump, and that requires uniting around a progressive agenda. Uniting around corporate centrism is the equivalent of ducking into a punch. Anybody who thinks that Pelosi, or Buttigieg, or Biden, or Bloomberg represents the path to beating Trump ignores the 2016 election and the lessons we have to learn from it, and that lesson simply is that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/03/27/pikettys-new-paper-vindicates-bernie-sanders-electoral-strategy/\">centrism cannot beat right-wing populism</url> - especially now with the momentum that white nationalists and white nationalist extremists have gained under this current president. We either embrace a left-wing populism to meet the needs of working people and future generations or we abdicate the political system to the right-wing zealots. Centrists cannot hold on their own.</p><p>I'll develop that even one step further. That's the same voices who might see a Pelosi, or a Buttigieg, or a Biden, or a Klobuchar as providing the pathway to Trump. They ignore the ultimate reality that candidates don't win elections. Movements and volunteers win elections. There is one candidate in the Democratic field who has demonstratively vastly more volunteers and donors than any of the rest of them. His name's Bernie Sanders, and if he's not the nominee, Democrats are basically telling all of those volunteers to take a hike, and that's the surest way to ensure that the Democrats lose the election to Trump. Unity looks like nominating a candidate supported by the most people.</p><p>Maybe one last way I'd put that is that San Franciscans have a choice between a federal voice in Washington that's either aligned with our next president or aligned with our last president. You see Speaker Pelosi supporting Trump's foreign policy, his trade policy, his fiscal austerity rules. You see her opposing Medicare for All and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-green-new-deal/\">Green New Deal</url> policies supported by Bernie. I want to make sure that when there's a Sanders administration in Washington that San Francisco is represented by an ally of that administration, not an intransigent opponent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It sounds like, what I hear from you, is that you don't think Nancy Pelosi captures the voice of San Francisco right now.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can you speak more about that?</emphasis></p><p>Sure. One of the things that's long-defined San Francisco is intersectionality, and its commitment to human rights. The United Nations was founded here. This is the sort of epicenter of a lot of different communities, from the peace and justice community to LGBTQ community to the environment rights, all have their deep roots here. None of those movements have representation from San Francisco's elected voice in Washington.</p><p>Just to take a couple of those examples, some of the communities that see her having stood with them in the past include, for instance, LGBTQ folks. There was an era in her career when she showed up, particularly for funding for AIDS research for instance under Reagan. My political memory of her absence on LGBT rights really inheres in the 2000s through the 2010s, when I was fighting for marriage equality in the courts as a cis-hetero Muslim lawyer from the Midwest; while Nancy Pelosi, with all the institutional privilege of the Speaker of the House, couldn't even accept the equal rights of my neighbors. She gets a lot of support from LGBT folks who don't recognize her record.</p><p>Say the same thing on Democratic Party partisans concerned about our criminal president. [Pelosi] gets some love from people who see her fighting Trump because they see photo ops, her pointing across a table, or her ripping up the speech, or her putting on sunglasses while wearing a red coat. None of that frankly matters. It's all symbolism, and I see her support our criminal president in policy while mounting a largely theatrical resistance - and theater is not enough.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If you were in Pelosi's position leading the impeachment in the House, how would have you handled it?</emphasis></p><p>I wrote an article last year sort of laying out particularly the basis for impeachment grounded in the president's violations of the Emoluments Clause. It is a constitutional violation to enrich one's self at public expense. That's all this president does. He doesn't even make a pretense of governing. He's only there to enrich himself.</p><p>The impeachment process that Nancy Pelosi brought, in addition to being a year late, affirmatively excluded his corruption from the process. It focused entirely on a political crime inviting foreign interference in a US election, and that is a crime. It should be impeachable, except impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. What would be the most ... the surest way to not win GOP votes in the Senate would be to bring an impeachment based on a partisan charge. That's exactly what she did. It wasn't in any way unpredictable that the process that she supported would fail in the Senate. I warned that it would the day that she started when it was clear that she wasn't going to include emoluments.</p><p>Just to sum that up, I laid out the case that would have won. She refused to embrace it. She showed up six months later with a limited process that I said would fail and has failed. I would like to, instead of being in a position to say, \"I told you so,\" I would like rather to help my neighbors, and this city, and the country not fall into the same pits that we repeatedly find ourselves in under the unfortunately failed leadership of the Speaker.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I am curious if you can speak to how, if elected, your work in Congress would contribute to the end of systemic inequality in America?</emphasis></p><p>Hell yeah. Thank you for that question. There are lots of different dimensions of inequality. It's what we mean by intersectionality. We have people face marginalization along a lot of different dimensions. Just to pick off a couple of them and then I'll try to stitch them together. One of the sharpest to me is criminal justice. It's so obvious the pervasive biases that degrade the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and frankly have railroaded millions of people into jails and prisons.</p><p>I see in the criminal justice system ... Well, first we should help to fix it. The first thing we do there, and this again is in the category of easy going up to hard, the easiest thing we can do is remove cannabis from the federal Controlled Substances Act. In California and many states, we have access to recreational or medicinal cannabis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Right.</emphasis></p><p>It's not true in many states, and in each of those states it's still a pretext for police to search, harass, arrest, detain, charge usually young people of color, often who are doing nothing intrinsically wrong.</p><p>Removing that pretext is sort of the baseline. Other things we can do here include for instance enacting the End Racial Profiling Act. This is a law that I've backed for the better part of 15 years. It almost passed Congress 19 years ago with the support of the Bush administration before the 9/11 attacks knocked it off the congressional table and it's never been seen or heard from since. President Obama refused to support it when he was a president, which I found, suffice it to say, disappointing. That measure, as much as anything else, would ensure that police interactions with the public are based on suspicion of offense and not skin color, or religious presentation, or national creed.</p><p>At the moment, we can have frankly no confidence at all in our criminal justice system. It's one reason why we see reform-minded DAs like my friend and ally Chesa Boudin, like Larry Krasner, Wesley Bell being neglected around the country. It's because there's an expanding awareness that the pretense of criminal justice is nothing more than a pretense, and it tends to be a grease trail for executive abuses.</p><p>Outside the criminal justice context, and I have a 30 point criminal justice reform platform. It includes creating a national registry of killer cops. It includes statutorily amending the qualified immunity doctrine, which lets cops get away with violence with impunity. Let's set all that aside for a moment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Union support is at the forefront of national conversations today. What policies, in your opinion, do you think actually work to provide healthy environments for unions to thrive in this country?</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. One of them just passed the House, the Protecting Right to Organize Act. Speaker Pelosi for months had opposed that bill. Just last week, she reversed positions, brought it to the floor, it passed the House, and now it's pending before the Senate. That measure would among other things prohibit right to work laws in states. It would be the most frankly transformative labor reform of a generation.</p><p>I describe the Speaker shifting with respect to it as reflecting a bunch of things. One, I think her team's awareness that our campaign is gaining ground. Two, I think an awareness in the broader Democratic institutional establishment and leadership that the populist voices of the activist base cannot be suppressed. Kind of taking us back to that thing we were discussing about like Doctor King and the Letter from a Birmingham Jail.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I wanted to talk a little bit about the tech industry. The tech industry in San Francisco has obviously been a big influence on the national economy as well and I think work culture. Locally, these companies have caused immense inequality though in part to their tax breaks that they receive and the fact that they aren't really regulated. I was curious what you make of big tech companies in America. Do you think they should be regulated, nationalized, turned into worker owned enterprises, or something else?</emphasis></p><p>Fascinating. I'm a big fan of antitrust enforcement. Again, I'll give a sort of set of escalating answers. Antitrust enforcement is the baseline. It's an existing set of laws. The enforcement agencies are basically out to lunch. This is not a new phenomena. I was offered a job in the Justice Department's antitrust section in 2001, and my antitrust professor at Stanford told me, \"Don't waste your time,\" because the Bush administration had shut the section down for all intents and purposes. It's never been open for business since.</p><p>You can see the abdication of the antitrust enforcement all over Silicon Valley. If I were to offer a paradigm example, I would say Facebook's acquisition on Instagram and WhatsApp both reflect anti-competitive consolidation that undermine both consumers and competition, and it made the internet worse. I think it's a perfect example of how we need to at least check and balance corporate consolidation. Antitrust law could do that if the regulators showed up for work and if Congress held them accountable and provided the robust oversight that they need.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You wrote a few years ago about bringing Burner values into the day in, day out politics of our society and that it's a challenge. I'm curious, well, first if you think if Burning Man has been gentrified, and then also what of these Burner values would you want to bring to national politics?</emphasis></p><p>Wow. Great questions. The first, I struggle with how to answer it because there's different layers of what Burning Man is. There's an organization. There's an event in the desert. There's a set of surrounding subcultures. The organization, frankly, is kind of whatever. I mean it's an organization. I think it's a couple hundred people, so it's not the relevant comparison.</p><p>Has the event been gentrified? Maybe. It, at least, has shifted, but it's also small to me. It's not the event that I particularly identify with. It's the set of countercultures that comprise it. That's much bigger than the organization. It's much more expansive than the people who've gone to the event. It's global. I would say it even stretches back across time long before Burning Man started. It's counterculture ultimately is what it is.</p><p>I would say running to represent San Francisco in Congress, for me the role of counterculture is a huge part of that, because this has been the counter-cultural capital of the country for well over a century. Whether you go back to the 1850s and the rule of the counterculture here, whether you think about it like the turn of the century, it was very present, in the 50s and the beat culture, the 60s, the people challenging the war in Vietnam for instance, punk culture in the 70s, the LGBT culture of the 80s and 90s. Burning Man comes up after all that. I see it as basically to some extent amalgamating all of those preceding countercultures.</p><p>If there's anything I were to say that defines the Burning Man counterculture, it's that it is inclusive of like anybody's version of whatever makes them unique. There is no single counterculture that comprises it, because it collects them. It's kind of like freakniks of the world unite, and that's what I like about it. It's a place for anybody, however they define, however they present. It's not a place. It's a state of mind.</p><p>In terms of the Burner values I'd want to take to Washington, one of them, there are 10 principles that the organization and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/05/01/larry-and-me-my-dinner-in-switzerland-with-the-late-founder-of-burning-man/\">founder</url> formerly elucidated. They include civic participation, communal effort. I see those are two that are especially critical to for instance addressing the mounting global climate crisis. It's going to take a lot of cooperation, and I see those values reflecting that.</p><p>At the event that happens once a year, there is a novel approach to resources of the gift economy, and that's another of the principles that informs the counterculture. I would say that that principle of sharing at root is one that I find very compelling. I find it very essential in the sense of constructing the socialist alternative. Medicare for all is sharing. That's a social policy that reflects a shared commitment to pooling our resources so that we all can have access to a thing that we all need. I see that principle as essential in all of these things. The Green New Deal I think reflects all of those remixes. It's a lot of communal effort, it's a lot of civic participation, and it's going to take some sharing.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SALON-1583607601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SALON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH7-97S1-DYTP-R3JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">243527</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Salon.com, LLC.

After all the talks of its rampant data collection practices, the company faced strong backlash with its Facebook Research data collection app. Now, Facebook has strategised to continue its data collection acts, while taking on the aspects of \"transparency\" and \"responsibility\", with its new programme - Study from Facebook.</p><p><br/> In essence, it is a market research programme for the social media platform, wherein it aims to collect information on how users access the internet and the features that they use the most, and subsequently use this data to improve their own product. While this itself is a usual process followed by millions of companies worldwide, what's invasive here is the way Facebook is going about it, and the kind of data it would collect.<br/> In the official blog post published last night, Facebook product manager Sagee Ben-Zedeff stated, \"We'll run ads to encourage people to participate in this market research program. When someone clicks on an ad, they'll have the option to register and, if they qualify, they'll be invited to download the app.\" Continuing to explain the transparency and privacy-focused stance of the programme, Ben-Zedeff said, \"People will see a description of how the app works and what information they'll be sharing with us so they can confirm they want to participate.\"<br/> \"We also notify users on the Study from Facebook website and in the Play Store description about what information we collect and how it will be used. This is all accessible before participants provide any market research information to the app. Anyone who uses the app will be compensated for contributing to the research. Only people who are 18 and older will be eligible to participate at launch, and all participants will be able to opt out at any time,\" he said.<br/>Facebook has clarified that the information they will collect include what kind of apps are installed on a phone, the amount of time that a user spends on each of these apps, the features in these apps that are in use, and location and network details. In essence, this is pretty similar to what the Facebook Research app did, except that this time, the data is being collected with a user's permission. Furthermore, one of the biggest contentions was that the Facebook Research app was collecting data from teenagers, who may not have been entirely aware of the nature of privacy invasion they were going through.<br/>Facebook's intention to \"compensate\" users for using the 'Study' service is also likely to be of a similar nature to Research, wherein time spent giving access to Facebook and providing referrals would help users earn a significant amount of money. By offering the service publicly and with apparent transparency, Facebook is also addressing grievances of collecting data without full disclosure, and hence, earning legal immunity from possible lawsuits.<br/> Ben-Zedeff signed off by saying, \"We plan to take this same approach going forward with other market research projects that help us understand how people use different products and services.\" As anti-trust lawsuits continue to rattle Facebook and other big tech firms, the strategies to stay in firm control of industries are slowly evolving in ways that would require far more stringent regulations in order to control them.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DGTDEV-n11039017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DGTDEV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB6-88C1-JBYT-H2K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410729</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Digit Devworx</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Several federal bills have been introduced to address everything from online ad transparency to data privacy, and legislators from both sides of the aisle have indicated their interest in passing a federal data privacy bill. Many of them have pointed to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation as a rough blueprint.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those aren\u2019t the only issues with which the tech industry is grappling. Some conservative lawmakers, like Rep. Lamar Smith, (R-Texas) pressed tech executives about a perceived bias against conservatives. Some Democrats, like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) drafted legislation in 2018 that would impose steep fines on tech companies, including the possibility of jail time for senior executives, in the event of data breaches and company disclosures related to them.</p><p>Here are a few of the legislators Adweek\u2019s tech team will be keeping an eye on in 2019 as discussions about tech regulation continue apace.</p><p>Blumenthal has positioned himself as an advocate to give the Federal Trade Commission more power to enforce rules related to data collection and privacy. During Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s September hearing with Congress, the Connecticut Democrat said the company wouldn\u2019t change its data business unless an outside agency enforces rules to rein them in, and he\u2019s accused the company of violating its 2011 consent decree with the FTC regarding the handling of user data. Blumenthal, who is also on a Senate subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, is also the co-sponsor of the Consent Act\u2014the \u201cCustomer Online Notification for Stopping Edge-provider Network Transgressions\u201d\u2014which was introduced in September by Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has also positioned himself as a fierce critic of big tech. The legislation has been compared to the European Union\u2019s General Data Practice Regulations.</p><p>Weeks after Facebook and the now defunct British firm Cambridge Analytica came under fire, Klobuchar introduced the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act of 2018. The bipartisan legislation, co-sponsored by Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, would require social media companies to better explain their data policies and allow users to opt out of having their data collected, and require companies to disclose of any data breaches within 72 hours. Klobucher, a Democrat from Minnesota, also recently co-sponsored the Data Care Act, which would hold internet companies responsible for consumer data loss and would impose a $10,000 penalty for each violation.</p><p>Kennedy, the co-sponsor of Klobuchar\u2019s Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act, has expressed a reluctant willingness to regulate tech companies like Facebook, particularly when it comes to informing consumers about how their data is being used and when it may have been compromised. Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, has said he is disinterested in passing extensive regulations on Big Tech, which may mean he\u2019ll serve as a check on some Democratic lawmakers\u2019 more expansive regulatory plans, but he has also expressed willingness to pass regulation and an interest in reaching across the aisle to make it happen. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God I will,\u201d Kennedy said in April when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been a vocal critic of Facebook and Google, and not just because of issues related to how Russia and others countries use social media to interfere with U.S. elections. Last year, Warner co-sponsored legislation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar and the late Sen. John McCain that would have forced tech platforms to increase transparency around the opaque world of online political advertising. The legislation didn\u2019t come up for a vote, but it did put pressure on companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to adjust how they label and track political ads. Earlier this month, Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, criticized the FTC for its slow response to addressing Facebook\u2019s online data practices.</p><p>As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Burr was one of the first lawmakers to allow tech executives to come under the Congressional microscope by holding a hearing last fall to investigate how Russian operatives used social media companies to influence the 2016 presidential election. When Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified in September, the North Carolina Republican said \u201cthe products and services that enable social media don\u2019t fit neatly into the consumer safety and regulatory constructs of the past,\u201d and suggested that if regulation is an answer, the companies and lawmakers should have an \u201chonest dialogue about what that looks like.\u201d</p><p>Cicilline, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, has been deeply critical of Facebook in 2018, accusing Zuckerberg of \u201clying to Congress\u201d and saying that the social media company \u201ccannot be trusted to regulate itself.\u201d Cicilline, who will likely be taking a leadership role in the subcommittee next year, has hinted at possible antitrust violations. The Rhode Island Democrat is also looking to intervene in the immense power of the so-called duopoly of Facebook and Google, introducing a bill that would give journalism outlets the ability to negotiate collectively with the major platforms. He\u2019s expected to take the lead of the subcommittee once Democrats take control of the House in 2019.</p><p>Walden, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has positioned himself as an advocate for consumer privacy in the digital age. While he will lose his chairmanship in 2019, the Republican Congressman has indicated that he is considering regulation of Big Tech. When Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress in April, Walden, whose district is home to a Facebook data center, said he was worried the company might not have \u201cmatured\u201d as it\u2019s grown. In July, Walden, an Oregon Republican, and three other senior Republican lawmakers wrote letters to the CEOs of Apple and Alphabet to elicit answers about how the companies work with third parties to collect data on their users.</p><p>Khanna, whose district consists of Silicon Valley, is a little friendlier to Big Tech than other Democratic lawmakers but has nonetheless indicated a need for regulation that would enshrine some rights for consumers regarding data privacy and security. The California Democrat, after consulting with tech companies and think tanks, this year drafted an Internet Bill of Rights, guidelines that would give consumers\u2019 net neutrality rights, an opt-in mechanism for data collection and the right for consumers to obtain the data that tech companies are collecting on them. In November, Khanna indicated in an interview with The Verge that he expected the House\u2019s Energy and Commerce Committee to pass data privacy regulations within the next six months.</p><p>Speaking of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, was elected to serve as the new chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is taking up tech legislation. Pallone beat out Silicon Valley\u2019s pick to lead the Committee, the California Democratic Rep. Anna Eschoo, who represents Silicon Valley. Pallone has been a vocal advocate for net neutrality and has in that vein expressed concerns about the content selection processes on tech platforms like Google and Facebook, which he has said are not neutral. He has also pressed tech executives on the spread of disinformation and hate speech on their platforms.</p><p>If 2018 was any indication, some conservative lawmakers will continue to press Big Tech about the perceived bias against conservatives on social media and big tech platforms. For example, Darrel Issa, a conservative California Republican who once proposed a two-year moratorium on tech regulation in 2012, changed his tune on possible tech regulation in 2018. (During a December hearing with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Issa expressed concerns about the algorithms that determine what people see on the platforms and the privacy settings governing users.) And while Issa, a Republican from California, is retiring in January, he isn\u2019t the only conservative lawmaker who has pushed for regulation, particularly around content moderation. Regardless, it\u2019s clear that the line of questioning around so-called bias is a partisan pain point that could cause some tension between Republicans and Democrats working together to address online privacy and security concerns, an otherwise bipartisan legislative priority.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1009844</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2S-3K21-JC8H-T0B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 28, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Tuttle told Business Insider that the market for initial public offerings is primed for a strong second half of the year. He discussed the value proposition of listing on the exchange \u2014 something the media doesn't pay attention to \u2014 and rival IEX. John Tuttle has his pitch down. </p><p>The 35-year-old head of global listings at the New York Stock Exchange\u2014 one of Wall Street's most iconic institutions \u2014 is in charge of attracting companies to go public on the exchange. The Michigan native glows when talking about the 225-year-old exchange and its family of listed companies, which he says represent the \"greatest community of companies on earth.\" \"It is 84% of the Fortune 100, 87% of the Dow, and 76% of the S...00,\" Tuttle told Business Insider in a recent interview. He described the exchange as one of the \"four buildings that define America\" \u2014 along with the White House, the Capitol, and the Supreme Court. Still, the draw of going public isn't as strong as it once was, with 52 companies going public on the exchange in the first half of this year. And while that's better than last year, and 2015, it's not as good as 2014 when 68 companies went public by mid-year. Companies are staying private longer to avoid the regulatory cost and increased scrutiny that comes with being a public company, not to mention that some of the most anticipated IPOs of the year \u2014 Snap and Blue Apron \u2014 have significantly lagged behind the markets since going public. Both are down since listing on the exchange. Yet Tuttle is looking forward. He's bullish on the IPO market and thinks the environment is primed for more companies to go public in the second half of the year. During our wide-ranging interview, Tuttle addressed business at the exchange, the reasons he thinks the market for IPOs will pick up, and rival IEX. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.Frank Chaparro: What are your thoughts on the IPO market? Business is tougher now than it was in 2014 or 2013, but do you expect it to improve? John Tuttle: As an absolute number, the number of companies that went public in 2014 versus this year is down a little. If you look at what makes the IPO market kind of warm or the IPO window open, it's low and stable interest rates, telegraphed to steadily rise. And they are right now. And why does that matter? It matters because a lot of asset managers haven't had many options with regard to the asset classes to allocate money toward and receive a meaningful return. Some of them took capital and put it into private companies, which let those companies stay private longer. So with interest rates telegraphed to steadily rise, other asset classes become more appealing. Also, volatility has been low and stable. As I said, the correlation between volatility and IPO market is pretty much a negative one. Now that it's stable, the IPO window is open. Asset prices and indexes are flirting with record highs, which means there's confidence in the markets. And those companies that have gone public \u2014 with a few exceptions that I would argue are idiosyncratic to what is going all overall \u2014 have done well in the months, quarters, following their IPO. If you look at the companies that have gone public in the US for pretty much all asset classes, but particularly technology, they have done pretty well as a public company. By and large, the majority of them have performed well in the months and weeks following their listing. Editor's note: The stock price of Snap[1], the company behind messaging app Snapchat, and Blue Apron[2], the meal-delivery service, have both notably declined since their IPO on the exchange.Chaparro: Why do you think large companies waiting to go public are making a mistake? Tuttle: The thing that's interesting is something the media never focuses on. There are benefits to being a private company \u2014 I get it. But there are a lot of benefits to being a public company. It instills discipline, from a financial and a governance standpoint. Some of these companies, by staying private longer, do not necessarily have the governance and financial discipline they need. Chaparro: Some of the largest and most recognized technology companies are listed on Nasdaq, but lately we have seen more and more big tech companies \u2014 Alibaba, Snap, Blue Apron, and now, reportedly, Spotify[3] \u2014 listing on exchange. Has the listings team taken specific steps to attract technology companies to the exchange and chip away at the idea that Nasdaq is the go-to venue for such companies? Tuttle: We want all great companies to list on the New York Stock Exchange. And there are a lot of great technology companies coming to market. I think the standards we had in place up until the mid-2000 were not accommodating for 21st-century companies, like technology companies. But since we modernized our listing standards, the majority of technology companies by count and by capital raise over that period have chosen to list on the New York Stock Exchange. The proof is in the pudding this year: 93% of the tech proceeds were raised on the New York Stock Exchange. The majority of companies by count as well. And we have different listing standards. Of course we want to see that trend continue.Chaparro: I'm sure you came across David Swensen's criticism of rebates in The New York Times[4]. What's your defense of paying brokers billions of dollars to send trades to the exchange, and why shouldn't folks consider them kickbacks? Tuttle: Market structure matters. We incentivize market participants to provide liquidity, which accrues to the benefit of our issues. That lowers cost of capitals for our issuers. It makes markets more liquid, which results in savings not only for the issuer but for institutional investors and mom-and-pop investors, period. People love to say these things are nefarious and they're not well intended. Absolutely not. Chaparro: Why do you think people think rebates are nefarious? Tuttle: Market structure matters, and having the tools to provide less volatility, tighter spreads, and superior market quality to issuers and to investors is not something that can be built overnight. It is something that takes expertise and something that takes resources committed to it. Chaparro: But IEX, according to Swensen, has the tightest spreads for over 490 stocks in the S...00. Tuttle: I would question the integrity of that data. I can assure you that the New York Stock Exchange's high-tech, high-touch market model allows us to have more displayed size, much narrower spreads, and larger and less volatile auctions. Chaparro: Speaking of IEX, they're looking to snag listings from you and Nasdaq this fall[5]. Are you worried they'll be able to successfully lure business away from your venue? Tuttle: What I focus on every day when I get up is not on what other people are doing but how we can deliver more and more value to our issuers. That is what we've been doing for 225 years. That's what we continue to do every day. We are constantly investing in products and services to help our companies be better publicly traded companies. We are investing in this building to be a field office in lower Manhattan. We are investing in our market model. And we are investing in people who will help them during their lifetime as a public company. Chaparro: I talked to your counterpart at Nasdaq[6], and he said the SEC's approval of IEX last year was a good thing for the marketplace because it opens exchanges up to innovate more. Do you agree? Tuttle: I think that is fair. Markets are going to continue to evolve. Exchanges are going to continue to evolve. The landscape will get more competitive. To be able to succeed, and the way we've succeeded, is by constantly finding ways to make our experience better for our customers. We talk to investors. We talk to issuers. We talk to market participants. And we want to tailor our offerings to meet their needs. Chaparro: Shifting gears a bit, Wall Street is abuzz about techs such as machine learning and AI. What technologies is the exchange looking at?Tuttle: We think technology is going to continue to evolve. We think the future will be driven by smart people interacting with sophisticated technology to produce better outcomes. We are not convinced it will be this dystopian world. It is going to create opportunities we don't know exist. When it comes to things like machine learning, the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, we look to find what is interesting. If there is an immediate application to our business model, we will dive deeper. Chaparro: What have you dived deep into? Tuttle: We've done some stuff. We are following the development of digital currencies, and we are observing the result of other organizations as they begin to use technologies such as AI. As with past technologies, we will integrate them into our business once they are mature technologies that demonstrably can improve what we offer to our clients. But the near-term applications of some of this is mainly in the post-trade area, so settlement and clearing, and that in the US is all controlled by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp., so they are looking at all this stuff, like the distributed ledger. When it comes to the stock exchange, it is not necessarily at that point yet. And also some other products, when you're talking about coffee futures, for instance, that's a lot more complex than a single share of a single company. You are talking about a set amount of product delivered at a set price at a certain time at a certain location, so it's not as easy to turn that into a distributed ledger or blockchain.NOW WATCH:

But in picking what stocks go into the fund, portfolio manager John Delano pays little attention to what's happening to the benchmark. \"We have an acronym \u2014 MANTRA \u2014 which stands for Mass Affluence, New Technology, Restructuring and Aging,\" he told Business Insider.  Ignoring your benchmark is one way to consistently beat it. At least, that approach has helped the $12 billionOppenheimer Global Fund[2]outperform its MSCI benchmark since 2008, according to data compiled byMorningstar[3]. Sure, the portfolio of large-cap US and foreign stocks has recently benefitted from an overall resurgence in global economic growth. </p><p>But John Delano, the fund's co-portfolio manager, says a rigorous stock-picking process and a focus on five key themes also guide how its composed.  Business Insider recently spoke to Delano, who was recently nominated for Morningstar's 2017 International-Stock Fund Manager award. The interview was edited for length and clarity. Akin Oyedele: What are some of the big-picture guidelines that guide your buy or sell decisions? John Delano: We don't look at a benchmark. We're very focused on just finding the best 70-80 stocks with the best return potential. Everything gets driven from a bottom-up as opposed to a top-down perspective.We're thematic investors, so we're looking for economic trends that will go on for five, 10, 20 years. The turnover in the strategy last year was about 6% or 7%. You're looking at a 15 year holding period on average. We're looking for companies with a management team that we believe in and really think about partnering with. They've got the financial capabilities to see some of the opportunities that may come along. We have an acronym \u2014 MANTRA \u2014 which stands for Mass Affluence, New Technology, Restructuring and Aging. As an example, with mass affluence, as the world continues to create more wealth and people are able to move from a needs to a wants category with disposable income, one of the things they naturally want is for luxury goods. One of our biggest holdings is Louis Vuitton.LVMH[4][its parent] has been an acquisitive company. They've just bought Christian Dior and have bought some other names over the years. It's one that has the brands and economic moat that gives them a chance to earn sustainable returns. Oyedele: When you mentioned LVMH I thought about the broader retail sector. Luxury as a category has not always been lumped together with the rest of the sector, but do you get questions about what's happening in retail, and do you see luxury as being different? Delano:I do see it as being different. When I think about retail, I think about selling other people's products. And luxury is really about selling your products. LV is a perfect example of this. They have 100% control over their distribution. So they're really a brand that's got a direct consumer connection. Other retailers are really just trying to distribute products that they don't own. So the margin opportunity is drastically different. When you think about retail in general, and in an Amazon[5] world where the efficiency, cost to distribute, and pricing keep coming down, it's a very different situation. If LV was selling somebody else's product, somebody else could sell that even cheaper. That makes it very difficult. But when you're the one selling your product and you're competing on that exclusivity, it's a completely different economic situation. We own really no retail from that standpoint. Oyedele: Apart from LV are there any other luxury brands that you're betting on? Delano: We own Kering[6] which owns Gucci, Tiffany[7], and Brunello Cucinelli[8]. Oyedele:Outside of retail, are there any other companies that you find particularly interesting right now? You mentioned earlier that you're not trying to mimic a benchmark. Are there any that you see yourself as contrarian on, but confident in? Delano: Frankly a lot of them are less controversial now than they have been, but I can touch on a couple. We own Airbus[9],S...lobal[10],Citigroup[11],SAP[12], andBMW[13].Read more about Delano's views on Airbus and the airline industry here.[14]Oyedele:What are your thoughts on the big tech names like Facebook[15], Netflix[16], and Apple[17]? Delano:We're invested in Facebook, we're not invested in the others. [Alphabet[18] is the fund's biggest position.] And it's really about where we find that the valuation is compelling for our shareholders. Oyedele: Facebook and Google share something in common in that they have recently come under regulatory scrutiny, especially with regards to the 2016 election. How much of a concern is that to you? Delano: It's a natural evolution. As these companies touch more people's lives more often, the scrutiny they're under will continue to grow. They matter more everyday. I don't find it particularly unusual from that standpoint and it is something that they'll have to address and be cognizant of. But you have questions about Google from a regulatory standpoint in Europe that aren't just about the 2016 election It doesn't overly concern me, but it's something that the company has to address.NOW

Everything gets driven from a bottom-up as opposed to a top-down perspective.\u00a0We're thematic investors, so we're looking for economic trends that will go on for five, 10, 20 years.</p><p>The turnover in the strategy last year was about 6% or 7%.

Luxury as a category has not always been lumped together with the rest of the sector, but do you get questions about what's happening in retail, and do you see luxury as being different?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oppenheimer Global FundDelano:</emphasis>\u00a0I do see it as being different. When I think about retail, I think about selling other people's products. And luxury is really about selling your products. LV is a perfect example of this. They have 100% control over their distribution. So they're really a brand that's got a direct consumer connection.</p><p>Other retailers are really just trying to distribute products that they don't own. So the margin opportunity is drastically different.</p><p>When you think about retail in general, and in an <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/amzn-Quote?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Amazon</url> world where the efficiency, cost to distribute, and pricing keep coming down, it's a very different situation. If LV was selling somebody else's product, somebody else could sell that even cheaper. That makes it very difficult. But when you're the one selling your product and you're competing on that exclusivity, it's a completely different economic situation. We own really no retail from that standpoint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oyedele:</emphasis> Apart from LV are there any other luxury brands that you're betting on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Delano:</emphasis> We own <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/Kering-Quote?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Kering</url> which owns Gucci,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/TIF-Quote?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Tiffany</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/Brunello_Cucinelli_Spa-Quote?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Brunello Cucinelli</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oyedele:</emphasis>\u00a0Outside of retail, are there any other companies that you find particularly interesting right now?

The promise was enormous: Facebook was billing Libra as a way to unlock financial services for 1.7 billion people around the world who lack access to traditional banks. Not only that, but the opportunities to build products and businesses on top of the Libra network could be endless.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a big moment for both the company and Marcus. In recent years, Facebook's business breakthroughs had been driven primarily by acquisitions like Whatsapp and Instagram. Libra was arguably the biggest in-house innovation to come from the company in years. For Marcus, who headed up the project, Libra was more than just a year in the making --- he'd spent his career working to improve digital payments. </p><p>\"Everyone was anxious and excited at the same time and it was a memorable night,\" Marcus told CNN Business. \"It was great to finally, after all of this work and all of this time ... to be able to just move into a very open phase of the project.\"</p><p>The next day, Facebook announced Libra along with the Libra Association, an independent organization to manage the currency, and Calibra, a new Facebook subsidiary run by Marcus to develop products and services around Libra. </p><p>But once released into the world, it didn't take long for the world to turn on Libra.</p><p>Criticism from politicians, regulators and finance experts came swiftly. Many feared Libra could upend the global financial system, threatening the power of central banks or of government-backed currencies like the US dollar. They also worried it could give the social media giant even more power and threaten user privacy. The United States lacks a straightforward regulatory structure for cryptocurrencies, making it unclear who would be responsible for overseeing Libra.</p><p>Lawmakers called both Marcus and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and grilled them in public hearings. Some lawmakers have even proposed legislation that aim to stop Libra altogether.</p><p>It would have been a challenging fight under any circumstances. But Facebook was already in hot water on other fronts --- facing an antitrust probe, pushback over its political ads policy, continued concerns over its use of user data and questions about its potential role in election interference. Even Zuckerberg conceded in his testimony that Facebook might not be the \"ideal messenger\" for Libra at the moment. </p><p>\"Deciding to pursue a major initiative despite all those dynamics was certainly a risk,\" said R.A. Farrokhnia, executive director of advanced projects and applied research in fintech at Columbia Business School. \"You have to do your risk-reward analyst, not just for business strategy, but also reputationally.\"</p><p>If Libra succeeds, it could revolutionize the way people use money, though there are questions about whether it will truly deliver all the positive benefits Facebook claims. </p><p>Libra could also give Facebook access to even more information about its users. Though it says it plans to keep users' financial and social data separate, the company could potentially have a picture of people's social lives, buying habits and financial transactions.</p><p>\"The onus is going to be on us to demonstrate that we're actually worth people's trust, and we will have to make strong commitments when it comes to privacy,\" Marcus said.</p><p>If Libra fails to get off the ground, it would be a major flop not just for Facebook but also for Marcus, who has staked his career on improving digital payments, and for Facebook's partners in the effort, which include major US tech and venture capital firms. And it could mean Facebook losing out to some of the other corporations considering similar products, such as JP Morgan and Walmart. And even its failure wouldn't change the fact that Libra has invited even more antitrust scrutiny and negative attention during an already difficult period of the company's history.</p><p>Nonetheless, Marcus says he's \"very confident\" Libra will succeed.</p><p>\"Look, it is really hard, and it will continue to be hard, and it might get harder before it gets easier,\" he said. \"That's what I tell my team, so that we are ready for what's to come. But this is change that is happening, and I believe that we bring a real solution to problems that billions of people are faced with everyday.\"</p><p>What is Libra? </p><p>If all goes as planned, Libra will be the sort of project that cryptocurrency proponents have envisioned for years but no one has been able to pull off, yet. Existing cryptocurrencies struggle with wide swings in price or too little adoption to make them truly useful in everyday transactions. </p><p>Libra is a purely digital currency, easily accessed from a cell phone or computer. It's universal, able to be used by people around the world with no foreign transaction fees and no centralized control by a government or central bank. It's useful for such transactions as sending money to friends or buying things online because it is a \"stablecoin\" that avoids the kind of wild volatility experienced by other digital currencies such as Bitcoin. And it can be exchanged instantaneously with little or no fees. </p><p>Here's how it would work: Users will access Libra through digital wallets on their phone. They'll get Libra by exchanging hard currency through a bank account or a local merchant, Facebook says, or by receiving it in digital transfers. The value of the currency will be backed 1:1 by a basket of government-backed assets --- likely the dollar, euro, yen and stable debt instruments, among others --- that will be managed by the Libra Association.</p><p>Libra differs from many other cryptocurrencies in one major way, in that the network it's built on will be run only by members of the Libra Association, unlike some other \"permissionless\" blockchain networks that anyone can join. This means Libra is not an entirely decentralized currency; it's simply controlled by the association rather than a government. However, this model will allow the network to scale faster and transactions to be processed and cleared more quickly. </p><p>For such a product to be successful --- allowing users to send it to their friends or use it to shop online --- it needs to be easy to use and widely adopted. This is where Facebook's scale gives it an advantage over existing cryptocurrencies: If even a third of Facebook's 2.4 billion monthly users adopted Libra, the currency would serve a population more than twice the size of the United States. </p><p>Marcus said it's for precisely those reasons that Facebook had an obligation to create Libra. </p><p>\"I believe that we can add so much value because we have distribution, we have two of the largest messaging apps in the world,\" Marcus said, referring to WhatsApp and Messenger. \"And as a result, because of this distribution, because of our engineering talent, I think that those two combined can ... actually deliver the very service we think will solve many people's problems.\"</p><p>Among the people Facebook hopes to serve are under- or unbanked people around the world --- people who live far away from banks, or who can't afford account minimums or transfer or remittance fees. Many of those same people do have cell phones and use Facebook services, the company says, and would benefit from lower cost, digital access to financial services. </p><p>Globally, remittance costs average nearly 7%, according to the World Bank. Libra would make it much cheaper (if not free) and faster for people who rely on sending money to family around the world, Marcus said. </p><p>Marcus didn't want Libra, a product intended to be a global public good, to be run solely by Facebook. He created the independent Libra Association to act as a sort of buffer between Facebook and Libra. The Geneva-based group --- a coalition of 21 \"founding member\" companies and nonprofits including Facebook --- will manage Libra, oversee its launch and work with regulators. </p><p>The members include such major Silicon Valley players as Lyft, Spotify and Andreessen Horowitz. Marcus was voted into one of five board seats at the organization. He said the association plans to expand to 100 more diverse members by Libra's expected 2020 launch. </p><p>Users will access Libra through digital wallets where they can send and save the currency, similar to existing products like Venmo. Calibra will create the first Libra wallet, though any company will be able to build wallets or other products and services for using Libra. </p><p>Libra is expected to enable more transactions between businesses and users within the Facebook ecosystem. In turn, Facebook hopes businesses will spend more on ads on the platform, boosting its bottom line. And while the digital wallet will be the first product to come out of Calibra, the subsidiary could eventually offer other financial services, such as loans, creating new revenue streams for the company. </p><p>\"The whole thing is part of Facebook's push to be more of a financial hub,\" said CB Insights senior intelligence analyst Nicholas Pappageorge. \"They want to be more in users' lives than just photos and a place to connect with your friends. One way to do that is definitely to be a payment hub, maybe eventually something closer to a bank.\"</p><p>Could Libra mean a future where Facebook becomes a bank? Marcus said that's not likely. Instead, Facebook plans to work with existing banks to provide such services. </p><p>The pushback</p><p>Despite Facebook's best efforts to market the product as something with the potential to change the world for the better, many regulators and politicians have not shared the company's enthusiasm.</p><p>And while many experts agree there are inefficiencies in the existing financial system --- cumbersome fees, long wait times to process transactions, for example --- not all are convinced that sidelining legacy institutions with a product developed at Facebook is the way to solve them. </p><p>\"There is this ideology of a tech fix for everything,\" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a finance expert and law professor at University of California, Irvine. \"We can bring Mark Zuckerberg to Congress and publicly shame him, but we can't vote him out. Where with the (Federal Reserve), we have some public accountability. Facebook has not demonstrated a desire or ability to be a public steward ... So why would we trust Facebook more than our own public institutions?\"</p><p>Lawmakers and regulators around the world have latched onto this question. </p><p>Their concerns about Libra largely fall into three categories. There are practical questions such as how to ensure users' privacy. There are more existential questions such as what a new, universal digital currency could mean for the global financial system or the power of the US dollar. Then there are the Facebook-specific questions: Why should Facebook be trusted to mount such a major effort after its years of scandals? And could Libra further concentrate the company's power? </p><p>\"There's a big potential for a not only impacting our economy but the global economy, so we need to get the message loud and clear to Mr. Zuckerberg that he's not a country on his own,\" Sylvia Garcia, a Democratic Congresswoman from Texas, said in an interview with reporters last month.</p><p>Another major concern is that Libra could face the same abuse as many other cryptocurrencies by providing users a layer of anonymity. Bitcoin, for example, has been used by terrorist groups to skirt economic sanctions by Western governments. </p><p>Marcus said that to address that issue, all companies offering digital wallets on the Libra network, including Calibra, will follow US anti-money laundering and \"know your customer\" laws, just as banks do. Marcus also said that because all transactions on a blockchain network are permanently recorded, even when transactors' names are hidden, enforcement may be easier than with cash. </p><p>But because the Libra network runs on open-source code, it could still be possible for any person to write software for their own personal digital wallets, which would complicate enforcement.</p><p>\"We've done everything possible to make US currency to be inconvenient for drug dealers, tax evaders and terrorists,\" said Brad Sherman, a Democratic Representative from California. But Libra, he said, could be \"useful for those people.\"</p><p>Some US lawmakers are now considering legislation that would bar Facebook and other big tech companies from operating cryptocurrencies altogether. Meanwhile, leaders in several countries across the Atlantic are moving to block Libra from operating in Europe. </p><p>Thanks at least in part to that political scrutiny, seven of Facebook's early partners in the project dropped out of the effort just before the Libra Association's official launch. Many of them were major payments companies, including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal, making some experts worried the group would miss out on their regulatory expertise.</p><p>Marcus, in a Tweet after the credit card companies pulled out, thanked them for \"sticking it out until the 11th hour.\"</p><p>\"The pressure has been intense (understatement), and I respect their decision to wait until there's regulatory clarity for (Libra) to proceed,\" he said.</p><p>'Why wait?'</p><p>Marcus said there would have been a cost to waiting to release Libra.</p><p>\"If you look at the people who currently are underserved or not served at all, who live on the margin of our financial system because they can't afford the cost of our current financial system, why wait?\" Marcus said. \"I understand that there is a cost for the company and for all of us to do this right now, but the cost is much greater every day that the very people that we want to serve are not served ... If you think about it that way, then there's just no better time. You have to move. You have to act.\"</p><p>Facebook has argued, too, that if the United States doesn't lead on fostering cryptocurrency innovations, other countries could. China, for example, has been working on a plan to implement a digital national currency. That argument that has succeeded in garnering some lawmaker support. </p><p>\"The fact that Facebook is launching into competition with China is positive for US national security,\" said Andy Barr, a Republican Representative from Kentucky.</p><p>Facebook and Libra's other backers have repeatedly said they won't launch the currency without regulatory approval. And during his Congressional testimony, Zuckerberg also said that Facebook could leave the effort if Libra's larger governance organization decides to move forward without US lawmaker approval, suggesting the company could risk losing out on the benefits of the project it invested in developing. </p><p>But Marcus said Facebook leaving the organization is unlikely, and that conversations with global financial regulators are going better than it might appear from the outside.</p><p>\"For now the plan is to work through these issues, and certainly we don't have an indication that there's no path forward,\" he said. \"Right now, the interactions we're having with regulators, not only here in the US but around the world, are actually very constructive.\"</p><p>A career focused on digital payments</p><p>For Marcus, the success of Libra is personal.</p><p>Seeking to improve digital payments has been a throughline of his career. He founded Zong, a mobile payments provider for online companies, which he sold to then-eBay-owned PayPal in 2011. Later, Marcus worked as president of PayPal. He left his post there for Facebook in 2014, where he built payments functionality into the Messenger app. Now, he's brought on two former Zong executives to the leadership of the Libra Association. </p><p>He's been mulling the idea of Libra for years, since he first became interested in Bitcoin in 2012. </p><p>\"The hope at the time was that the volatility of Bitcoin will eventually stabilize and that, as a result, it would become a very good medium of exchange,\" he said. \"For me, now, it's clearer that Bitcoin serves a purpose of being digital gold, not a good medium of exchange. And so it felt like this was the right time for us to start thinking about how we could address the very things that blockchain and cryptocurrency were meant to do and that we had real solutions to bring to the fore.\"</p><p>As for whether Libra is the riskiest thing he's ever done, Marcus said it's definitely \"the thing that creates the most emotions\" that he's ever done. </p><p>Indeed, many in the cryptocurrency world and some of Facebook's early nonprofit partners on the project think that Libra could bring real benefit to underserved populations, and could be a boon to the nascent crypto industries. But pushback from lawmakers could stunt its growth or threaten the participation of more partners. </p><p>Libra could well be the crowning achievement of Marcus' career, if it succeeds. But for now, the jury is still out.</p><p>\"I think right now we've created a lively discussion around digital money, which is great in itself because it moves things forward, but we haven't achieved anything yet,\" he said. \"We have to deliver for people, and that's what we're all here for.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The promise was enormous: Facebook was billing Libra as a way to unlock financial services for 1.7 billion people around the world who lack access to traditional banks. Not only that, but the opportunities to build products and businesses on top of the Libra network could be endless.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a big moment for both the company and Marcus. In recent years, Facebook's business breakthroughs had been driven primarily by acquisitions like Whatsapp and Instagram. Libra was arguably the biggest in-house innovation to come from the company in years. For Marcus, who headed up the project, Libra was more than just a year in the making ? he'd spent his career working to improve digital payments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>\"Everyone was anxious and excited at the same time and it was a memorable night,\" Marcus told CNN Business. \"It was great to finally, after all of this work and all of this time ... to be able to just move into a very open phase of the project.\"</p><p>The next day, Facebook announced Libra along with the Libra Association, an independent organization to manage the currency, and Calibra, a new Facebook subsidiary run by Marcus to develop products and services around Libra.</p><p>But once released into the world, it didn't take long for the world to turn on Libra.</p><p>Criticism from politicians, regulators and finance experts came swiftly. Many feared Libra could upend the global financial system, threatening the power of central banks or of government-backed currencies like the US dollar. They also worried it could give the social media giant even more power and threaten user privacy. The United States lacks a straightforward regulatory structure for cryptocurrencies, making it unclear who would be responsible for overseeing Libra.</p><p>Lawmakers called both Marcus and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress and grilled them in public hearings. Some lawmakers have even proposed legislation that aim to stop Libra altogether.</p><p>Related: See the 20 Risk Takers pushing global business forward</p><p>It would have been a challenging fight under any circumstances. But Facebook was already in hot water on other fronts ? facing an antitrust probe, pushback over its political ads policy, continued concerns over its use of user data and questions about its potential role in election interference. Even Zuckerberg conceded in his testimony that Facebook might not be the \"ideal messenger\" for Libra at the moment.</p><p>\"Deciding to pursue a major initiative despite all those dynamics was certainly a risk,\" said R.A. Farrokhnia, executive director of advanced projects and applied research in fintech at Columbia Business School. \"You have to do your risk-reward analyst, not just for business strategy, but also reputationally.\"</p><p>If Libra succeeds, it could revolutionize the way people use money, though there are questions about whether it will truly deliver all the positive benefits Facebook claims.</p><p/><p>Libra could also give Facebook access to even more information about its users. Though it says it plans to keep users' financial and social data separate, the company could potentially have a picture of people's social lives, buying habits and financial transactions.</p><p>\"The onus is going to be on us to demonstrate that we're actually worth people's trust, and we will have to make strong commitments when it comes to privacy,\" Marcus said.</p><p>If Libra fails to get off the ground, it would be a major flop not just for Facebook but also for Marcus, who has staked his career on improving digital payments, and for Facebook's partners in the effort, which include major US tech and venture capital firms. And it could mean Facebook losing out to some of the other corporations considering similar products, such as JP Morgan and Walmart. And even its failure wouldn't change the fact that Libra has invited even more antitrust scrutiny and negative attention during an already difficult period of the company's history.</p><p>Nonetheless, Marcus says he's \"very confident\" Libra will succeed.</p><p/><p>\"Look, it is really hard, and it will continue to be hard, and it might get harder before it gets easier,\" he said. \"That's what I tell my team, so that we are ready for what's to come. But this is change that is happening, and I believe that we bring a real solution to problems that billions of people are faced with everyday.\"</p><p>What is Libra?</p><p>If all goes as planned, Libra will be the sort of project that cryptocurrency proponents have envisioned for years but no one has been able to pull off, yet. Existing cryptocurrencies struggle with wide swings in price or too little adoption to make them truly useful in everyday transactions.</p><p>Libra is a purely digital currency, easily accessed from a cell phone or computer. It's universal, able to be used by people around the world with no foreign transaction fees and no centralized control by a government or central bank. It's useful for such transactions as sending money to friends or buying things online because it is a \"stablecoin\" that avoids the kind of wild volatility experienced by other digital currencies such as Bitcoin. And it can be exchanged instantaneously with little or no fees.</p><p>Here's how it would work: Users will access Libra through digital wallets on their phone. They'll get Libra by exchanging hard currency through a bank account or a local merchant, Facebook says, or by receiving it in digital transfers. The value of the currency will be backed 1:1 by a basket of government-backed assets ? likely the dollar, euro, yen and stable debt instruments, among others ? that will be managed by the Libra Association.</p><p>Libra differs from many other cryptocurrencies in one major way, in that the network it's built on will be run only by members of the Libra Association, unlike some other \"permissionless\" blockchain networks that anyone can join. This means Libra is not an entirely decentralized currency; it's simply controlled by the association rather than a government. However, this model will allow the network to scale faster and transactions to be processed and cleared more quickly.</p><p/><p>For such a product to be successful ? allowing users to send it to their friends or use it to shop online ? it needs to be easy to use and widely adopted. This is where Facebook's scale gives it an advantage over existing cryptocurrencies: If even a third of Facebook's 2.4 billion monthly users adopted Libra, the currency would serve a population more than twice the size of the United States.</p><p>Marcus said it's for precisely those reasons that Facebook had an obligation to create Libra.</p><p>\"I believe that we can add so much value because we have distribution, we have two of the largest messaging apps in the world,\" Marcus said, referring to WhatsApp and Messenger. \"And as a result, because of this distribution, because of our engineering talent, I think that those two combined can ... actually deliver the very service we think will solve many people's problems.\"</p><p>Among the people Facebook hopes to serve are under- or unbanked people around the world ? people who live far away from banks, or who can't afford account minimums or transfer or remittance fees. Many of those same people do have cell phones and use Facebook services, the company says, and would benefit from lower cost, digital access to financial services.</p><p>Globally, remittance costs average nearly 7%, according to the World Bank. Libra would make it much cheaper (if not free) and faster for people who rely on sending money to family around the world, Marcus said.</p><p>Marcus didn't want Libra, a product intended to be a global public good, to be run solely by Facebook. He created the independent Libra Association to act as a sort of buffer between Facebook and Libra. The Geneva-based group ? a coalition of 21 \"founding member\" companies and nonprofits including Facebook ? will manage Libra, oversee its launch and work with regulators.</p><p>The members include such major Silicon Valley players as Lyft, Spotify and Andreessen Horowitz. Marcus was voted into one of five board seats at the organization. He said the association plans to expand to 100 more diverse members by Libra's expected 2020 launch.</p><p/><p>Users will access Libra through digital wallets where they can send and save the currency, similar to existing products like Venmo. Calibra will create the first Libra wallet, though any company will be able to build wallets or other products and services for using Libra.</p><p>Libra is expected to enable more transactions between businesses and users within the Facebook ecosystem. In turn, Facebook hopes businesses will spend more on ads on the platform, boosting its bottom line. And while the digital wallet will be the first product to come out of Calibra, the subsidiary could eventually offer other financial services, such as loans, creating new revenue streams for the company.</p><p>\"The whole thing is part of Facebook's push to be more of a financial hub,\" said CB Insights senior intelligence analyst Nicholas Pappageorge. \"They want to be more in users' lives than just photos and a place to connect with your friends. One way to do that is definitely to be a payment hub, maybe eventually something closer to a bank.\"</p><p>Could Libra mean a future where Facebook becomes a bank? Marcus said that's not likely. Instead, Facebook plans to work with existing banks to provide such services.</p><p>The pushback</p><p>Despite Facebook's best efforts to market the product as something with the potential to change the world for the better, many regulators and politicians have not shared the company's enthusiasm.</p><p>And while many experts agree there are inefficiencies in the existing financial system ? cumbersome fees, long wait times to process transactions, for example ? not all are convinced that sidelining legacy institutions with a product developed at Facebook is the way to solve them.</p><p>\"There is this ideology of a tech fix for everything,\" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a finance expert and law professor at University of California, Irvine. \"We can bring Mark Zuckerberg to Congress and publicly shame him, but we can't vote him out. Where with the (Federal Reserve), we have some public accountability. Facebook has not demonstrated a desire or ability to be a public steward ... So why would we trust Facebook more than our own public institutions?\"</p><p>Lawmakers and regulators around the world have latched onto this question.</p><p/><p>Their concerns about Libra largely fall into three categories. There are practical questions such as how to ensure users' privacy. There are more existential questions such as what a new, universal digital currency could mean for the global financial system or the power of the US dollar. Then there are the Facebook-specific questions: Why should Facebook be trusted to mount such a major effort after its years of scandals? And could Libra further concentrate the company's power?</p><p>\"There's a big potential for a not only impacting our economy but the global economy, so we need to get the message loud and clear to Mr. Zuckerberg that he's not a country on his own,\" Sylvia Garcia, a Democratic Congresswoman from Texas, said in an interview with reporters last month.</p><p>Another major concern is that Libra could face the same abuse as many other cryptocurrencies by providing users a layer of anonymity. Bitcoin, for example, has been used by terrorist groups to skirt economic sanctions by Western governments.</p><p>Marcus said that to address that issue, all companies offering digital wallets on the Libra network, including Calibra, will follow US anti-money laundering and \"know your customer\" laws, just as banks do. Marcus also said that because all transactions on a blockchain network are permanently recorded, even when transactors' names are hidden, enforcement may be easier than with cash.</p><p>But because the Libra network runs on open-source code, it could still be possible for any person to write software for their own personal digital wallets, which would complicate enforcement.</p><p>\"We've done everything possible to make US currency to be inconvenient for drug dealers, tax evaders and terrorists,\" said Brad Sherman, a Democratic Representative from California. But Libra, he said, could be \"useful for those people.\"</p><p>Some US lawmakers are now considering legislation that would bar Facebook and other big tech companies from operating cryptocurrencies altogether. Meanwhile, leaders in several countries across the Atlantic are moving to block Libra from operating in Europe.</p><p>Thanks at least in part to that political scrutiny, seven of Facebook's early partners in the project dropped out of the effort just before the Libra Association's official launch. Many of them were major payments companies, including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal, making some experts worried the group would miss out on their regulatory expertise.</p><p>Marcus, in a Tweet after the credit card companies pulled out, thanked them for \"sticking it out until the 11th hour.\"</p><p/><p>\"The pressure has been intense (understatement), and I respect their decision to wait until there's regulatory clarity for (Libra) to proceed,\" he said.</p><p>'Why wait?'</p><p>Marcus said there would have been a cost to waiting to release Libra.</p><p>\"If you look at the people who currently are underserved or not served at all, who live on the margin of our financial system because they can't afford the cost of our current financial system, why wait?\" Marcus said. \"I understand that there is a cost for the company and for all of us to do this right now, but the cost is much greater every day that the very people that we want to serve are not served ... If you think about it that way, then there's just no better time. You have to move. You have to act.\"</p><p>Facebook has argued, too, that if the United States doesn't lead on fostering cryptocurrency innovations, other countries could. China, for example, has been working on a plan to implement a digital national currency. That argument that has succeeded in garnering some lawmaker support.</p><p>\"The fact that Facebook is launching into competition with China is positive for US national security,\" said Andy Barr, a Republican Representative from Kentucky.</p><p>Facebook and Libra's other backers have repeatedly said they won't launch the currency without regulatory approval. And during his Congressional testimony, Zuckerberg also said that Facebook could leave the effort if Libra's larger governance organization decides to move forward without US lawmaker approval, suggesting the company could risk losing out on the benefits of the project it invested in developing.</p><p/><p>But Marcus said Facebook leaving the organization is unlikely, and that conversations with global financial regulators are going better than it might appear from the outside.</p><p>\"For now the plan is to work through these issues, and certainly we don't have an indication that there's no path forward,\" he said. \"Right now, the interactions we're having with regulators, not only here in the US but around the world, are actually very constructive.\"</p><p>A career focused on digital payments</p><p>For Marcus, the success of Libra is personal.</p><p>Seeking to improve digital payments has been a throughline of his career. He founded Zong, a mobile payments provider for online companies, which he sold to then-eBay-owned PayPal in 2011. Later, Marcus worked as president of PayPal. He left his post there for Facebook in 2014, where he built payments functionality into the Messenger app. Now, he's brought on two former Zong executives to the leadership of the Libra Association.</p><p>He's been mulling the idea of Libra for years, since he first became interested in Bitcoin in 2012.</p><p>\"The hope at the time was that the volatility of Bitcoin will eventually stabilize and that, as a result, it would become a very good medium of exchange,\" he said. \"For me, now, it's clearer that Bitcoin serves a purpose of being digital gold, not a good medium of exchange. And so it felt like this was the right time for us to start thinking about how we could address the very things that blockchain and cryptocurrency were meant to do and that we had real solutions to bring to the fore.\"</p><p>As for whether Libra is the riskiest thing he's ever done, Marcus said it's definitely \"the thing that creates the most emotions\" that he's ever done.</p><p/><p>Indeed, many in the cryptocurrency world and some of Facebook's early nonprofit partners on the project think that Libra could bring real benefit to underserved populations, and could be a boon to the nascent crypto industries. But pushback from lawmakers could stunt its growth or threaten the participation of more partners.</p><p>Libra could well be the crowning achievement of Marcus' career, if it succeeds. But for now, the jury is still out.</p><p>\"I think right now we've created a lively discussion around digital money, which is great in itself because it moves things forward, but we haven't achieved anything yet,\" he said. \"We have to deliver for people, and that's what we're all here for.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191111facebook-libra-david-marcus-risk-takers1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHF-6TT1-JBPX-X0DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2862\"/><timeReceived>6:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For months, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based tech giant has been anticipating dueling lawsuits\u2014one from the U.S. Department of Justice, and one from a coalition of states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2014over potential antitrust violations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, has already faced tough questions when he testified before the House antitrust subcommittee on July 29, alongside Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the real probe into Google\u2019s potentially unfair business practices is coming from outside the halls of Congress.\u00a0</p><p>At the Justice Department, there are \u201cdozens\u201d of government lawyers working on two separate teams, according to The Wall Street Journal: One team is investigating Google\u2019s market dominance in search (its signature consumer product), while another is looking at its command of the digital advertising industry, which is said to take up 29.4% of U.S. ad revenue in 2020, according to eMarketer. Attorney General William Barr said he expects to make a decision on whether to file suit by the \u201cend of the summer.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, the group of attorneys general from 50 states and territories, a coalition led by Paxton, is focused exclusively on Google\u2019s ad business. Paxton said he hopes to have the investigation \u201cwrapped up\u201d by fall.</p><p>Ahead of any major litigation, these are the major players to watch:\u00a0</p><p>Attorney General William Barr has reportedly taken a keen interest in the Justice Department\u2019s various tech investigations, including the Google probe. Multiple outlets have reported that Barr receives regular updates on the case from Lauren Willard, whom he promoted to serve as a counselor and liaison between the tech antitrust investigations and his own office. Associate Deputy Attorney General Ryan Shores is taking lead on the investigations, reporting up to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.\u00a0</p><p>In investigating the media industry, the DoJ\u2019s antitrust division has been taking a look at high-profile mergers of large media-tech companies with an inconsistent record: Antitrust chief Makan Delrahim broadsided AT&amp;T over its acquisition of Time Warner, which ultimately failed in court; greenlit T-Mobile\u2019s merger with Sprint after significant divestitures; and signed off on Disney\u2019s purchase of most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets with limited sacrifices for the new megacompany (Disney had to sell off Fox\u2019s regional sports networks.)\u00a0</p><p>Along with Google, the division announced investigations into Facebook and Amazon, but a Google lawsuit is expected to drop first. In an interesting turn of events, however, Delrahim recused himself from the Google investigation in February because he previously lobbied the FTC for Google during its acquisition of DoubleClick.\u00a0</p><p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the effort for the 50 states and territories (all but Alabama and California, plus D.C. and Puerto Rico) to investigate Google\u2019s digital ad business. The Washington Post reports that Paxton leads an office of 800 lawyers and has played point with Google, sending the company a litany of questions on behalf of the group. </p><p>The probe\u2019s executive committee includes state AGs from both parties: Republicans Mark Brnovich of Arizona, Doug Peterson of Nebraska, Jeff Landry of Louisiana and Lynn Fitch of Mississippi; along with Democrats Doug Stein of North Carolina, Tom Miller of Iowa and Phil Weiser of Colorado. Similarly, New York AG Letitia James is leading a group of 47 attorneys general in a separate antitrust investigation into Facebook.</p><p>While uninvolved in the goings on of the two antitrust probes, Congress is also exerting pressure from the outside. The House antitrust subcommittee, led by Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., and Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc., hosted Bezos, Cook, Pichai and Zuckerbeg in July for a high-profile grilling. (The Judiciary Committee, which oversees the antitrust subcommittee, is led by chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.)</p><p>Google has plenty of critics in Congress and, while the recent hearing was scattered and unfocused, Pichai received 61 questions during the all-afternoon spectacle.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt is Google\u2019s business model that is the problem,\u201d Cicilline said at the hearing. \u201cOur documents show that Google evolved from a turnstile to the rest of the web to a walled garden that increasingly keeps users within its sites.\u201d</p><p>In the Senate, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., co-authored a letter to the Justice Department in March urging officials to include search, not just digital advertising, in their investigation. \u201cGoogle enjoys market dominance in online advertising, but it has that dominance in substantial part because of its enormous search engine market share,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cGoogle\u2019s online advertising conduct is inextricably linked to Google\u2019s search activities.\u201d</p><p>One constant critic of Big Tech is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who ran for president on a platform that called for breaking up major firms like Google, Amazon and Facebook. She also vowed to \u201cunwind\u201d Google\u2019s acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick. \u201cUnwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market\u2014which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,\u201d she wrote last year.\u00a0</p><p>Another former presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., along with Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also urged the FTC to investigate Google and Facebook last year over \u201cpotential privacy, data security, and antitrust violations involving online platforms.\u201d The FTC previously investigated Google in 2013 but ended the investigation after Google made some concessions, and it is currently investigating past acquisitions by Google and other tech firms for anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>Supporting Pichai in the fight against antitrust scrutiny isHalimah DeLaine Prado, the company\u2019s newly appointed general counsel. But Prado has worked at Google for nearly 14 years and is no stranger to its legal battles. She succeeded Kent Walker, who is now Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs. Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer, David Drummond, retired this year following a sexual misconduct scandal, and the position remains vacant.</p><p>Many companies have been critical of Google\u2019s competitive practices. Yelp has been a leading critic of Google\u2019s search tactics and recently testified before Congress against them. Audio speaker company Sonos sued Google earlier this year for patent infringement, with CEO Patrick Spence testifying to the House antitrust subcommittee soon after that Google abused its market power unfairly. Media titan Rupert Murdoch of News Corp. has been one of the most-high profile critics of Google\u2019s digital ad dominance and called on Australian regulators to break up Google last year. Bloomberg called the forthcoming DOJ lawsuit Murdoch\u2019s \u201cbiggest win yet in his war against Google.\u201d</p><p>While the pending investigations don\u2019t purport to cover Google\u2019s dominance in the mobile app marketplace, Google\u2014like Apple\u2014was sued by Fortnite creator Epic Games recently. Epic claims that Google and Apple each hold monopolies on their respective mobile operating systems, and app developers are hurting because of it.\u00a0</p><p>Yale professor Fiona Scott Morton and Omidyar Network senior adviser David Dinielli (both DOJ antitrust alums from the Obama administration) co-authored a recent paper entitled Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google, which found there is \u201csignificant reason for concern that Google has violated U.S. antitrust law.\u201d </p><p>Their paper is based on the findings of the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority, which revealed \u201ca great deal about the lack of competition in ad tech and the anticompetitive behavior of Google in recent years,\u201d Scott Morton said in a statement after the paper was published. \u201cIt adds up to a very concerning situation that warrants close scrutiny on this side of the Atlantic Ocean by U.S. antitrust authorities.\u201d However, Scott Morton\u2019s independence came under question recently when a previously undisclosed working relationship with Apple and Amazon arose.</p><p>Another Yale researcher, Dina Srinivasan, who made waves last year with her paper The Antitrust Case Against Facebook, has a forthcoming paper about Google\u2019s digital ad dominance. Gilad Edelman of Wired wrote a mesmerizingly simple summary of the argument:</p><p>When you see an ad online, the odds are very high that the advertiser used Google to buy it, the website used Google to put the space up for sale, and Google\u2019s exchange matched them together. In other words, Google both runs the largest exchange and competes as the biggest buyer and seller on that exchange. On top of that, it also owns YouTube, one of the biggest suppliers of ad inventory, meaning it competes against publishers on its own platform. And yet there are no laws governing any of it.</p><p>Interestingly, Srinivasan likens Google\u2019s ad tech to an unregulated stock exchange. \u201cIn the market for electronically traded equities, we require exchanges to provide traders with fair access to data and speed, we identify and manage intermediary conflicts of interest, and we require trading disclosures to help police the market,\u201d Srinivasan writes in the paper\u2019s abstract. \u201cBecause ads now trade on electronic trading venues too, should we borrow these three competition principles to protect the integrity of advertising?\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1195034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RG-0JP1-DYRK-H17X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Such brazen, and meticulously documented, anti-competitive behavior by the likes of <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>and Eric Schmidt was hard to believe, let alone justify. Fortunately, it's rare that those CEOs ever have to excuse their bad behavior personally. </p><p>Instead when the heads of companies like Apple, Adobe, Google, Intel, Intuit, Microsoft and others, are called upon to explain why it's okay to screw over employees\u2014or their consumers\u2014they know exactly who to call. His name is Kevin Murphy. Murphy is the University of Chicago free-market economist hired by lawyers for the defendants in the Silicon Valley wage theft lawsuit[2] (Google, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Intuit, Pixar, LucasFilm) to provide 'expert' testimony. As revealed in court documents obtained by PandoDaily, most of Murphy's testimony was focused on trying to discredit and debunk the tech workers' own expert, Edward Leamer, a UCLA labor and economics professor. Leamer provided a report to the court demonstrating how and why the tech companies' secret non-solicitation agreement\u2014whose existence was not challenged\u2014lowered their employees' wages. The big tech firms' lawyers were fighting to have Leamer's report removed from the record, an important part of their strategy to have the class action suit tossed\u2014and they knew that if anyone could discredit Leamer's work, Murphy could. Kevin Murphy has a long history of trying to convince courts that workers are not being screwed and that dominant monopoly corporations are good citizens, despite evidence to the contrary. By the standards of the economics guild, Murphy is a respected figure: Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago[3], senior fellow at the Hoover Institute[4], prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of and longtime collaborator with U. Chicago economist Gary Becker, a far-right loon[5] notorious for proposing an unregulated human organs commodities exchange[6], and a bigtime fan of Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet[7]. In 2007, on the eve of the financial crash, Murphy and Becker co-authored a paper celebrating America's record inequality, 'The Upside of Income Inequality.'[8] Less well-known, and less respectable, is Murphy's work for a sleazy restaurant industry front group, the Employment Policies Institute[9], set up to fight minimum wage raises and run by a PR kingpin named Rick Berman. Over the years, Berman, whom 60 Minutes nicknamed 'Dr. Evil'[10], has been paid by everyone from Big Tobacco companies to the ultraconservative Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation[11] to wage war on nonsmoking laws, minimum wage hikes, teachers unions[12], the Humane Society[13], ACORN[14]\u2026 Berman was even paid to attack and discredit the documentary film 'Supersize Me.'[15] Earlier this month, the New York Times conclusively exposed[16] the Employment Policies Institute as a restaurant-industry funded propaganda front to fight against minimum wage hikes: 'The nonprofit group is run by a public relations firm that also represents the restaurant industry, as part of a tightly coordinated effort to defeat the minimum wage increase that the White House and Democrats in Congress have pushed for. '\u2026What is clear is that the reports by the Employment Policies Institute are a critical element in the lobbying campaign against the increase in the minimum wage, as restaurant industry groups, in their own statements and news releases, often cite the institute's reports, creating the Washington echo chamber effect that is so coveted by industry lobbyists.' According to Employment Policy Institute literature obtained by PandoDaily, Murphy officially sits on the group's advisory board[17]. <br/> In fact, Murphy's work with the Employment Policy Institute stretches back to at least early 1995, shortly after Princeton economists Alan Krueger (later Obama's chief economist[18]) and David Card published a\u00a0landmark paper[19] proving that raising the minimum wage does not lead to job cuts in the fast food industry. The Krueger-Card study was heresy to the free market economics guild as preached by Milton Friedman and Gary Becker; and so Kevin Murphy was tapped to play the role of free-market Inquisitor. Shortly after Krueger and Card published their paper on minimum wage, they were subjected to a blistering smear campaign designed to destroy their credibility, a campaign that initially was believed to be an honest academic spat between competing economists\u2014Krueger-Card on one side, Kevin Murphy and co-authors on the other. As first described in a February 1995 article in the Christian Science Monitor, 'Maximum Debate On Minimum Wage'[20]: More than a year ago, Professor Card and Alan Krueger, a Princeton colleague now working in the Department of Labor, took a new tack. Rather than looking at nationwide statistics for employment, they studied the impact of changes in the minimum wage by individual states on one industry - the fast-food establishment\u2026. They found the wage hike in New Jersey produced no job losses for either teenagers or adults. Nor did the minimum-wage rise result in restaurants closing their doors. Then last month Deere, Finis Welch, a colleague at AM, and Kevin Murphy from the University of Chicago, delivered a paper looking at the last increase in the minimum wage - from $3.35 to $3.80 on April 1, 1990 and then to $4.25, the present level, on April 1, 1991. They found that the 27 percent jump chopped teenage jobs 8 to 9 percent - an apparently big employment loss. What the public didn't know until later was that Murphy's pushback against Krueger and Card was part of a campaign led by his colleagues at the Employment Policies Institute. As described in the American Prospect[21], 'In early 1995 a vicious counterattack began, substantially underwritten by the fast food industry. In March the Employment Policies Institute, the leading employers group opposing the minimum wage, unveiled a counter study\u2026. Berman's allegations kicked off a public op-ed and private whispering campaign to undermine the credibility of the study and the reputations of Card and Krueger.' Kevin Murphy paper slamming Alan Krueger's minimum wage study, 'Sense and Nonsense on the Minimum Wage,'[22] was published in the Kochs'\u00a0CATO Institute[23] journal, 'Regulation,'[24] in early 1995. As noted, Murphy's paper was timed perfectly to synch with Berman's and the restaurant industry's PR campaign to smear Krueger's reputation, and discredit any heretical thought that a higher minimum wage may not hurt\u2014indeed, may actually help\u2014employment. Helping the low-wage restaurant industry might pay Murphy's rent but, as any expert-for-hire knows, Silicon Valley is where the real money is. In 2002, Murphy was called upon to testify on behalf of Microsoft in the US antitrust suit first launched in the late Clinton era. He argued that Microsoft's monopoly power and behavior did not hinder competition and had no measurable anti-competitive effect on, for example, Netscape's browser. Unfortunately for Microsoft, the judge ruled[25] that Murphy's testimony 'could not be given much weight.' More recently, Murphy was brought in to defend Apple against the DoJ's antitrust suit[26] over Apple's ebook price-fixing. Murphy's expert opinion \u2014 an opinion shared by Apple's lawyers \u2014 was that Apple could not have been acting like an illegal monopoly when it fixed ebook prices, because Apple was always acting in its economic self-interest \u2014 and according to the free-market faith that Murphy peddles, if a company is acting in its own economic interest, it is by definition competitive, and therefore not acting like a monopoly. That may sound clinically insane to the uninitiated, but in the University of Chicago and across much of the economics guild, it's the Word of God. The DoJ filed two interesting motions[27] to have Murphy's quackery tossed: 'Having no case law support\u2026Apple instead relies on its economic expert, Dr. Kevin Murphy, to suggest that Apple's erroneous legal standard\u2014i.e., whether Apple's conduct was in its own interests\u2014is of some significance for this case. 'Dr. Murphy's economic self-interest test is nothing more than a fa\u00e7ade\u2026Apple appears to believe that merely because Dr. Murphy's opinions are those of an economist, it follows necessarily that he is offering 'economic analysis.' But this is no more necessarily true than claiming a prediction that the Mets will win the World Series this year constitutes a 'legal opinion' if it is made by a lawyer.' And yet, despite court after court rejecting Murphy's 'expert' opinions, he was the man Silicon Valley titans once again turned to in 2013, this time to 'prove' that their secret non-solicitation agreement[28] did not lower employees' wages. Unsurprisingly, as in so many previous cases, Murphy's testimony fell on deaf ears. As Judge Lucy Koh wrote in her opinion: 'Before the Court turns to an analysis of the competing methodologies of Dr. Leamer and Defendants' expert, Dr. Murphy, the Court notes that the importance of these statistical models is diminished in light of the extensive documentary evidence that supports Plaintiffs' theory of impact. In other contexts, courts have long noted that statistical and anecdotal evidence must be considered in tandem\u2026.This Court could not identify a case at the class certification stage with the level of documentary evidence Plaintiffs have presented in the instant case.' In other words: There was so much real-world evidence\u2014in emails, depositions, the Department of Justice antitrust settlement\u2014proving that the Big Tech secret non-solicitation pacts were designed to suppress wages, that abstractions spun by the economics guild were essentially superfluous, especially when they contradicted what Silicon Valley's Masters of the Universe themselves already said and wrote. So given Murphy's low strike rate, why do tech companies still call on him to defend their attempted wage fixing? One answer could be that he's one of the few 'experts' who is able defend Silicon Valley's most egregiously anti-competitive CEOs while keeping a straight face. That makes Kevin Murphy a valuable asset for the billionaire class in the era of inequality.

Miami FC were the best team in NASL, Spring and Fall Champions, and their reward is not promotion but punishment: NASL has been de-sanctioned by the US Soccer Federation (USSF) and they have nowhere to play all year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the unfair reality of the game in the United States, where the only way into the top flight is with a $150m buy-in. Every other footballing country, Australia aside, provides a ladder to the top, and even the A League is going to bring one in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Standing alone against the world, this is a footballing form of American exceptionalism. One that raises questions about the universality of the game, the muscle of Fifa, the survival of domestic league pyramids, and suggesting an explanation to why the world's biggest economy still underachieves, and will not be sending a team to this year's men's World Cup.</p><p>Because this closed-shop arrangement, and the cosy protection the USSF gives to MLS, is under threat like never before. Two football club owners, faces pressed up against the window of MLS, are bringing a new legal challenge this spring. Hoping to force Fifa to finally impose promotion and relegation on the USSF, bringing American soccer into line, more than 20 years late.</p><p>Riccardo Silva is an Italian investor and founder of MP &amp; Silva, a sports media agency he set up with Andrea Radrizzani, who now owns Leeds United. Silva set up Miami FC and is distraught that, after NASL's desanctioning, they have nowhere to play this year. But his financial stake in this is potentially even bigger than that: last year MP &amp; Silva offered $4bn for the next 10 years of MLS rights, quadrupling the current value of the current deal, as long as they introduced promotion and relegation. They said no.</p><p>But Silva still wants to find a way to shake up football in the US, to make it fairer, more open, and more marketable than it is right now. \"Broadcasters always say they don't believe MLS is real soccer because it's a closed league,\" he explains to The Independent from his central London office this week \"There isn't really a competition. It's not perceived as real football, real soccer, it's something a bit artificial. Where there is no sporting merit, no competitiveness. This is what everybody thinks.\"</p><p>Dennis Crowley is the founder of location app FourSquare and a huge soccer fan, who has set up his own semi-professional team, Kingston Stockade FC, in upstate New York. Silva and Crowley met up last year and shared their frustrations about the state of the football in the US, the lack of a fair pyramid and the damage that does to the standard of the national team.</p><p>Those were the problems that drove Crowley to create Kingston Stockade in the first place, back in 2015. \"Part of the thinking was, what can we do to make soccer better in the US?\" Crowley tells The Independent over the phone from San Francisco. \"Manifested in another selfish goal: what has to happen for me, at 40 years old, to see the US win a World Cup in my lifetime? Is that possible? It's very easy to sit around and complain: what things can I do, as a fan, to inch us a little bit closer to that? And we hit on this idea: let's make a club, and help other people make clubs.\"</p><p>Kingston Stockade play in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), effectively the fourth tier in the US. But no matter what they achieve, the closed system means they will never go anywhere. Nothing will be ever be enough to reach the top flight, the Concacaf Champions League or the Club World Cup. Football is meant to be meritocratic, except in the US.</p><p>\"Every other part of American culture is very much driven by the entrepreneurial spirit,\" explains Crowley. \"You make something great, you try to win against your competitors, and then you move to face off against bigger and better competitors. My other job is I work at a tech company. It started as a tiny little tech company, and over 10 years we built it into a big tech company. And this idea that you can't do that in soccer, it feels fundamentally broken.\"</p><p>Nowhere is the weakness of the system clearer than in the failure of the national team to reach this year's World Cup, for the first time since 1986. The USA, remember, finished fifth in a 10-game six-team league, behind Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras. It all ended in Trinidad last October as the USA disastrously lost 2-1, shocking soccer fans across the country.</p><p>This underperformance is what inspired Crowley and Silva, who ascribe the side's struggle to the lack of a proper football system in the US: \"A country of 300 million people, where soccer exists for a long time, and is very followed, should be constantly among the top 10, if not the top five in the world. It is the result of the disrespect of the rule of competition. Since it is not a competitive system, it's an anticompetitive system.\"</p><p>But how do you get USSF to change? The first hope of the promotion-relegation lobby was Eric Wynalda, who ran to replace Sunil Gulati as USSF president, advocating radical change, including 'pro-rel', to shake up soccer in the US. But in last month's election he failed and was beaten by Carlos Cordeiro, vice-president under Gulati, an establishment candidate but not quite as pro-MLS as Kathy Carter. But Cordeiro, in words that have encouraged reformers, has pledged to end the 'conflict of interest' at the heart of American soccer.</p><p>What exactly does he mean by that? Reformers see the overly-cosy relationship between USSF, MLS and Soccer United Marketing (SUM), who sell MLS TV rights, as the heart of the problems in the American game. USSF protects MLS' Division 1 status but sets harsh professional league standards for its competitors. They have de-sanctioned NASL for 2018, leaving Silva's Miami FC and the popular New York Cosmos with nowhere to play this year. NASL tried to reverse that decision in a court case in New York but they lost their appeal this week. So Miami FC's second team will play in the NPSL this year while their first team, now managed by Paul Dalglish, have to search for another competition to sign up for.</p><p>USSF, it is increasingly clear, are in no mood to compromise or to help any team or league outside of their protected bubble. So Silva and Crowley are taking a different legal approach. Article 9 of Fifa's statutory regulations enshrines promotion and relegation, ordering that a club's \"entitlement to take part in a domestic league championship shall depend principally on sporting merit\". Of course this is not the case in the US, where the only way into MLS is with a cheque. Silva and Crowley, or rather, Miami FC and Kingston Stockade FC, are bringing a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), appealing for arbitration, calling on Fifa to finally impose its own rules on the US and bring them into line with the rest of the world.</p><p>\"Ultimately, you can't ask the USSF politely to do this,\" Crowley says. \"They're not interested. What we're trying to do with the CAS filing is to say 'listen, USSF has to play by Fifa's rules.' People have been trying to do this for years, and USSF has not been forced to respond. The thinking is that the CAS filing forces the issue, forces them to articulate their position, and hopefully forces them to make some changes here. The USSF has to acknowledge that this is part of Fifa's rules.\"</p><p>The question for Fifa is whether they have the stomach to forcibly impose this on the US. The fact that they have not done so yet, with MLS about to start its 23 season, is revealing enough. But there is a bigger issue at stake here even than whether the US will ever have its own pro-rel pyramid, whether Miami FC will ever get to play top flight football, or reach the Champions League, and how an open system, rather than a closed one, would improve the US men's national team.</p><p>And that is whether football has to be organised the same way in every country or not. Football's universality has always been its strength. But if Fifa is going to ignore such a huge exception - and even to defend its right to do so - then which other laws and tenets of the game are negotiable? \"There cannot be any discrimination between countries,\" Silva insists. \"If a rule is valid in Europe, it should be valid in the US. Otherwise, let's start playing in the US with 20 players. With bigger goals. With helmets. With hands. If FIFA have rules, they should be valid everywhere. Without discrimination of countries.\"</p><p>That might sound dystopian but there is a more immediate threat to the structure of football if Fifa do not act. Which is that if Fifa allow the USSF to run their own closed shop, ignoring the sporting merit criteria, then how can Fifa stop a lucrative trans-national super league from setting up?</p><p>\"If a closed league, where teams pay to be promoted, is formally accepted, then I think it would be the end of football in Europe,\" warns Silva. \"Basically only 20 teams in Europe will survive, and hundreds would die because the others would form a super league. And football as it is, as an inclusive, open system, will die. It will only be a little private club of the 20 richest teams in Europe. And hundreds of teams, with their tradition, with their importance to the community, will disappear. If there isn't an open system, football will disappear.\"</p><p>With additional reporting by Hugo Greenhalgh</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000030203138-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RST-69J1-JCS0-D545-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1586\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 4, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Gaming &amp; Lotteries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzJGRTBFOEMyOENBNDQ5MTg1NTA2NDdFQjhCNzhERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JFMDdFQkREMkFENDRFMEFGRkJEQ0E4OTg1NEM5RTc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Gaming &amp; Lotteries</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzJGRTBFOEMyOENBNDQ5MTg1NTA2NDdFQjhCNzhERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001587</classCode><className>SOCCER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813990GM</classCode><className>SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRX</classCode><className>FIFA WORLD CUP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A3NR</classCode><className>SOCCER TOURNAMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CFE3</classCode><className>SPORTS FANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

WLLL VOTERS GET BEHIND THEM?</p><p>This much can be said for Democrats heading into 2020: if their candidate manages to defeat Donald Trump, the new president will enter the White House having promised the boldest domestic policy agenda in more than a generation. At least six presidential hopefuls are all in on single-payer; an overlapping set of six cosponsored the Green New Deal legislation; and three have even said they support reparations for slavery.</p><p>But while these proposals may help curry favor with the left, they don't squarely address what was arguably Hillary Clinton's biggest substantive weakness in 2016: the inability to offer a compelling alternative to Trump's hateful and mendacious argument about the origins of American middle-class decline. The party is still haunted by the memory of a candidate who didn't have a way to explain the broad sense that economic opportunity for average people has been shrinking for decades, nor a realistic plan for what to do about it. In that vacuum, Trump's crude xenophobia spread easily.</p><p>That's not to say, however, that the present Democratic field is bereft of such an idea. It turns out that three of the leading presidential hopefuls--Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar--already have their arms around a concept that both makes sense of voters' economic frustrations and provides a blueprint for a future administration to start reversing the rising tide of inequality: fighting corporate monopoly.</p><p>It's a concept that might sound (other than to faithful readers of this magazine) like a relic from a bygone era; in 1912, Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt competed over who would most aggressively confront the oligarchs of the era. But what's old is new again. We are living in a moment in which ownership of the American economy, along with the global economy, is more highly concentrated than at any time since the original Gilded Age. Four airlines control our skies, one of three national chains probably owns your corner pharmacy, and one tech giant accounts for half of all e-commerce and a third of all cloud storage. This is more or less the direct result of the abandonment of antitrust enforcement beginning in the 1970s and the resulting four decades of ever-increasing mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>It stands to reason that the concentration of corporate power would go hand in hand with the concentration of wealth. And indeed, economists have recently connected the dots between the rise of new monopolies and the staggering rise in inequality over the same time period. With less competition, monopoly firms can charge higher prices and funnel the money back to their own shareholders and executives, rather than giving workers a raise or investing in innovation. Fewer companies also means that workers are at the mercy of fewer employers, headquartered in fewer cities. All in all, the clustering of corporate power goes a long way to explaining the clustering of wealth and opportunity among the top 1 percent.</p><p>Two thousand twenty is unlikely to be a replay of 1912, but there are indications that at least some presidential contenders will make the anti-monopoly issue a featured part of their campaigns. Warren has already changed the race by proposing to break up Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. As the first big candidate to offer a substantive--and splashy--economic plan, Warren thrust monopolies into the conversation early, all but assuring that antitrust will be a topic in the Democratic primary debates.</p><p>If the issue continues to gain traction, it could offer a way to unite the warring tribes of socialist and liberal, leftist and centrist. You don't have to be antibusiness to be anti-monopolist. The Green New Deal has a provision that calls for \"ensuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies.\" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has tweeted about the threat that tech monopolies like Google and Facebook pose to journalism. Even Bernie Sanders has lately gotten on board. In March, he unveiled his plan for rural America during his first campaign rally in Iowa. One of his main proposals was to enforce antitrust laws against consolidated corporate agribusiness.</p><p>The forces of monopoly have been kicking the American people's asses for four decades. If any of the would-be trustbusters earns the nomination, 2020 could be the year when the Democratic Party finally starts to fight back.</p><p>The first major Democrat to jump into the 2020 race was also the first to talk publicly about the threat of modern monopolies. A former Harvard Law professor, Elizabeth Warren cut her progressive teeth thinking of ways to limit the power of corporations and financial institutions to hurt the little guy--most notably, coming up with the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2007. Warren's interest in the structural causes of unfair economic outcomes--an interest that, in its wonkish intensity, distinguishes her from most of her Senate colleagues--eventually brought her to the demise of antitrust enforcement and the increase in corporate concentration.</p><p>In early 2016, Warren's team reached out to a Yale Law student named Lina Khan, who was already making a name for herself in academic circles by questioning the founding assumptions of modern antitrust law, which is based on a quasi-religious faith that mergers lead to efficiencies that lead to lower prices and thus must never be questioned. That led to a dinner meeting in Washington, D.C., between Warren, Khan, and Khan's former boss, Barry Lynn, the head of Open Markets, an anti-monopoly organization then based at New America. (Today it's an independent think tank called the Open Markets Institute.) In June 2016, Warren came to New America to give a speech on the issue, becoming the first national elected official to address the monopoly problem in generations. Widespread consolidation, Warren declared, was \"hiding in plain sight all across the American economy.\"</p><p>Warren has since remained the most consistent national voice speaking out about the effects of monopoly power--including the way it distorts democracy--and the government's failure to restrain it. She was as harsh on Barack Obama as on George W. Bush; while Bush set the record for the fewest antitrust cases brought to trial by any president in American history, Obama wasn't far behind. Indeed, when congressional Democrats unveiled their Better Deal platform in 2017, with Warren standing beside Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, it included rare implicit rebuke. \"In recent years,\" the document said, \"antitrust regulators have been unable or unwilling to pursue complaints about anti-competitive conduct.\"</p><p>In the Senate, Warren scored a modest achievement by shepherding a bill through Congress that made hearing aids available over the counter. The previous FDA regulations were helping to artificially inflate the price of hearing aids, which typically cost thousands of dollars--fattening the profit margin of the highly concentrated hearing aid industry. The measure, which passed by a vote of 94-1, could help new, smaller competitors break into the sector and offer lower-priced alternatives.</p><p>Warren's greatest contribution so far to the antimonopoly cause is her role in bringing it from the periphery of American politics to something approaching the mainstream. In her official announcement on February 9, she pledged to \"break up monopolies when they choke off competition.\" And in March, she held a campaign event in Long Island City--the site of Amazon's aborted New York campus--where she rolled out her regulatory plan to break up big tech. If taking on tech monopolies remains part of her stump speech, it will elevate the issue even more.</p><p>Cory Booker grew up in northern New Jersey, the most densely populated slice of the most densely populated state in the country. Before becoming a U.S. senator, he served as the mayor of Newark, the state's biggest city. So it makes sense that his entry point into anti-monopoly politics would be ... farming?</p><p>Joe Maxwell, the former lieutenant governor of Illinois, now directs the Organization for Competitive Markets, a nonprofit that advocates against Big Ag. He approached Booker in early 2018. While it's better known for its boardwalks, beaches, and spray tans, South Jersey is an important producer of fruit. Maxwell believed he could get Booker, a member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, to understand that agribusiness mergers threatened farmers in his home state and around the country.</p><p>In July 2018, Maxwell took Booker on a tour through the rural Midwest, meeting with the president of the Illinois Farmers Union, a cattle rancher in Missouri, and residents of rural, farming-dependent communities. It seems to have done the trick. One month later, Booker introduced legislation in the Senate to place an eighteen-month moratorium on mergers between large agribusiness, food and beverage manufacturers, and grocery retailers.</p><p>Shortly after, in October 2018, Booker gave a speech at Open Markets--a seeming rite of passage for the new crop of aspiring trustbusters--laying out what he'd learned about the rampant monopolization of American food production. \"Today just a small number of giant companies control every single link of the American food chain,\" he said. \"The farmer's share of every retail dollar has plummeted ... and small family farmers are being driven to bankruptcy.\" (Sanders made many of the same points in his speech to Iowa farmers last March.)</p><p>If Booker's listening tour helped him understand the plight of America's small farmers, he also had a more personal connection to the monopoly issue. As he was working with staff on the draft of the speech, an aide gave him a 2017 Washington Monthly story titled \"The Decline of Black Businesses,\" which detailed the way the conglomerate Service Corporation International was eating up small family-owned black funeral homes. The National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, which represents black funeral directors, had seen its membership decrease by 40 percent since 1997. That was a revelation to Booker, whose father grew up in Jim Crow-era North Carolina. \"When he didn't have any family to take care of him, he was taken in and raised by another family,\" Booker said in his Open Markets speech. \"Who was the family? They were running a successful black funeral home.\"</p><p>The upshot was clear: Thanks to the demise of independent black-owned businesses, Booker's father, had he been growing up in today's America, might have had nowhere to turn. Booker's candidacy could test the extent to which the anti-monopoly argument can resonate with constituencies that, on the surface, have little in common, from African Americans in big cities to rural farmers.</p><p>If Warren has done the most to talk the talk, Amy Klobuchar has a claim to walking the walk. In September 2017, the Minnesota senator and ranking Democratic member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee introduced two of the most significant antitrust bills in decades. (Cory Booker was a cosponsor, as was fellow 2020 hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand.) One would give the federal monopoly-fighting agencies greater leverage to block anticompetitive mergers under existing law. The other would amend the main federal antitrust law to prohibit mergers that created \"monopsonies,\" or market situations in which there is only one buyer. Other provisions in the bills would require companies that enter a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to make the details of that agreement public and would create a size threshold that determined when an acquisition would hurt competition.</p><p>According to Michael Kades, the director of markets and competition policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, Klobuchar learned from her perch as the Democrats' ranking member on the Senate's antitrust subcommittee that more needed to be done to thwart the surge in industry consolidation. Kades, who served as an expert for the panel's Democrats starting in 2015, worked on the bills for Klobuchar.</p><p>Eventually, Klobuchar started toying with ways to make her antitrust agenda appeal to younger voters. In a March 2017 speech at the Center for American Progress, Klobuchar found a relatable example of the way in which competition spurs innovation: beer. \"For years, there were a few dominant breweries, and they all sold similar mass market beer,\" she explained. But the craft beer explosion has forced brewers to compete by producing more variety and higher-quality beer. \"Our goal is to make antitrust cool again,\" she told the crowd. At an event this past March, she returned to the theme. The problem of monopoly power, she said, \"has to become part of the political dialogue. I'm hoping it will in this 2020 election.\"</p><p>It's early. The jury is still very much out on whether antitrust will remain front and center throughout the campaign. But Klobuchar, like Warren and Booker, has made it clear that if she ends up in the White House, corporate monopolies will have something to worry about.</p><p>Eric Cortellessa is digital editor of the Washington Monthly.</p><p>Caption: Break 'em up: Senators and presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar have all made noise about reviving antitrust enforcement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-583693503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 583693503</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0V-6CY1-JCBJ-K29X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Washington Monthly Company</copyright><publicationName>Washington Monthly</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0043-0633</issn><volume>Vol. 51</volume><issueNumber>No. 4-6</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Booker, Cory</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>General interest</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Monopolies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political activity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political parties</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Public affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The Harvard business professor emerita had already spent years developed a damning theory. It found a big audience with U.S. publication in January of her 700-page 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,' which skewers tech giants led by Facebook and Google. </p><p>Zuboff hasn't stood still since.Her unflattering indictment of Big Tech evokes how they harvest the details of our lives and make billions from that data, all the while glueing our attention more firmly to their platforms.A bestseller in Canada and Britain, the book published is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired a pair of small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit. She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. Zuboff has 'put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,' says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. 'She's a rock star.'AdvertisingEarly on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect \u2014 where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it 'digital exhaust.'But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. 'It is the product.'Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior \u2014 effectively molding individual behavior.Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. 'By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,' Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.AdvertisingZuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches. That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of 'free' apps with a hearty appetite for your data. Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine Her next book, 'The Support Economy' \u2014 co-written with her late husband James Maxmin \u2014 predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an 'antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,' she writes.  In the name of personalization, she says, 'it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.'Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly. Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book 'paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.'In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.  Most Read Business Stories She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.'I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.'

It found a big audience with U.S. publication in January of her 700-page \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" which skewers tech giants led by Facebook and Google.</p><p>Zuboff hasn't stood still since.</p><p>Her unflattering indictment of Big Tech evokes how they harvest the details of our lives and make billions from that data, all the while glueing our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p>A bestseller in Canada and Britain, the book published is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired a pair of small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect -- where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior -- effectively molding individual behavior.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine Her next book, \"The Support Economy\" -- co-written with her late husband James Maxmin -- predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an \"antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPV-YVR1-DY58-F009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 15, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a \"soul-sucking\" rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.</p><p>Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. \"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,\" she says.</p><p>Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.</p><p>She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.</p><p>Submit a Letter to the Editor</p><p>If you're interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor, click here.</p><p>Submit<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Send Letter to the Editor</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a 'soul-sucking' rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. 'I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,' she says.Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theater productions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior - effectively molding individual behavior.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine Her next book, \"The Support Economy\" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an \"antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIBAN-UNB12122019000531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIBAN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRD-9321-JCH9-G4NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400851</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 United News of Bangladesh All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>United News of Bangladesh</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Scott Applewhite, File)A year ago, Shoshana Zuboff dropped an intellectual bomb on the technology industry. She hasn't stood still since. In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: 'surveillance capitalism.' The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms. A bestseller in Canada and Britain, 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two theaterproductions (if by small companies). Zuboff, meanwhile, has spoken to audiences from Los Angeles to Rome and counseled politicians across Europe and North America. She has offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is looking into Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. In early November, she received the Axel Springer award, a four-year-old honor for technology luminaries offered by the eponymous German publisher. (Its first recipient was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; last year Amazon's Jeff Bezos got it.) Zuboff has 'put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,' says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. 'She's a rock star.' Early on, Zuboff realized that researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect \u2014 where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it 'digital exhaust.' Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. 'It is the product.' Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book. But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry. In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet. In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.  And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as 'behavioral surplus,' 'prediction markets' and 'instrumentarianism.'  Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase \u2014 and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat. Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are molding our behavior. Worse, she says, they're spreading. 'By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,' Zuboff told Canadian parliamentarians in May. The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure \u2014an obvious stand-in for IBM \u2014 lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists. Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches \u2014such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked. That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut. Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of 'free' apps with a hearty appetite for your data. Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us. 'When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening \u2014 maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'' said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology. One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book ' In the Age of the Smart Machine ' highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces. Her next book, ' The Support Economy ' \u2014 co-written with her late husband James Maxmin \u2014 predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers. To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.  It is an 'antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,' she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, 'it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.' Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in 2011, but Facebook didn't get critical attention from Congress until two years ago, when Russian election interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal linked its voracious data collection to the election of President Donald Trump. Not everyone agrees with the Zuboff prescription, to put it mildly. Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book 'paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.' The vice president of an industry-affiliated think tank, Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said an alternative explanation to Zuboff's arguments is that 'consumers are generally satisfied with the tradeoffs they make.' That's not what the Pew Research Center found in a June U.S. poll. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits. In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a 'soul-sucking' rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards. Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work. She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. 'I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,' she says. Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says. She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has spoken to audiences from Los Angeles to Rome and counseled politicians across Europe and North America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She has offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is looking into Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. In early November, she received the Axel Springer award, a four-year-old honor for technology luminaries offered by the eponymous German publisher. (Its first recipient was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; last year Amazon's Jeff Bezos got it.)</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized that researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet.</p><p>In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.</p><p>And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as \"behavioral surplus,\" \"prediction markets\" and \"instrumentarianism.\"</p><p>Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase - and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are molding our behavior. Worse, she says, they're spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure -an obvious stand-in for IBM - lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches -such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us.</p><p>\"When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening - maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book \" In the Age of the Smart Machine \" highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces.</p><p>Her next book, \" The Support Economy \" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.</p><p>It is an \"antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in 2011, but Facebook didn't get critical attention from Congress until two years ago, when Russian election interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal linked its voracious data collection to the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Not everyone agrees with the Zuboff prescription, to put it mildly. Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>The vice president of an industry-affiliated think tank, Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said an alternative explanation to Zuboff's arguments is that \"consumers are generally satisfied with the tradeoffs they make.\"</p><p>That's not what the Pew Research Center found in a June U.S. poll. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a \"soul-sucking\" rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.</p><p>Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. \"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,\" she says.</p><p>Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.</p><p>She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to note that Zuboff spoke in May before international parliamentarians, not just Canadian lawmakers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-68e73fe9c328fc4548d051e0d56b1b7f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-FMM1-JC65-53H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1556\"/><timeReceived>5:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theater productions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior - effectively molding individual behavior.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine Her next book, \"The Support Economy\" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an \"antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-a35264e36a09a3d2b35eec670ee10345</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-FKK1-JC65-52YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has spoken to audiences from Los Angeles to Rome and counseled politicians across Europe and North America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She has offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is looking into Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. In early November, she received the Axel Springer award, a four-year-old honor for technology luminaries offered by the eponymous German publisher. (Its first recipient was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; last year Amazon's Jeff Bezos got it.)</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized that researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet.</p><p>In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.</p><p>And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as \"behavioral surplus,\" \"prediction markets\" and \"instrumentarianism.\"</p><p>Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase - and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are molding our behavior. Worse, she says, they're spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure -an obvious stand-in for IBM - lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches -such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us.</p><p>\"When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening - maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book \" In the Age of the Smart Machine \" highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces.</p><p>Her next book, \" The Support Economy \" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.</p><p>It is an \"antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in 2011, but Facebook didn't get critical attention from Congress until two years ago, when Russian election interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal linked its voracious data  collection  to the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Not everyone agrees with the Zuboff prescription, to put it mildly. Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>The vice president of an industry-affiliated think tank, Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said an alternative explanation to Zuboff's arguments is that \"consumers are generally satisfied with the tradeoffs they make.\"</p><p>That's not what the Pew Research Center found in a June U.S. poll. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a \"soul-sucking\" rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.</p><p>Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. \"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,\" she says.</p><p>Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.</p><p>She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to note that Zuboff spoke in May before international parliamentarians, not just Canadian lawmakers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In this Wednesday, March 27, 2019 photo, author Shoshana Zuboff speaks to a reporter in her home in Maine.

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theater productions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior - effectively molding individual behavior.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine Her next book, \"The Support Economy\" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an \"antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-a35264e36a09a3d2b35eec670ee10345</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-FM51-DYN6-W2DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has spoken to audiences from Los Angeles to Rome and counseled politicians across Europe and North America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> She has offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is looking into Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. In early November, she received the Axel Springer award, a four-year-old honor for technology luminaries offered by the eponymous German publisher. (Its first recipient was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; last year Amazon's Jeff Bezos got it.)</p><p> Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p> Early on, Zuboff realized that researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect \u2014 where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p> Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p> Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p> But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p> In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet.</p><p> In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.</p><p> And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as \"behavioral surplus,\" \"prediction markets\" and \"instrumentarianism.\"</p><p> Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase \u2014 and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat.</p><p> Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are molding our behavior. Worse, she says, they're spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told international parliamentarians in May.</p><p> The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure \u2014an obvious stand-in for IBM \u2014 lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists.</p><p> Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches \u2014such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked.</p><p> That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut.</p><p> Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p> Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us.</p><p> \"When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening \u2014 maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p> One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book \" In the Age of the Smart Machine \" highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces.</p><p> Her next book, \" The Support Economy \" \u2014 co-written with her late husband James Maxmin \u2014 predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p> To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.</p><p> It is an \"antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p> Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data.

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has spoken to audiences from Los Angeles to Rome and counseled politicians across Europe and North America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She has offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is looking into Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. In early November, she received the Axel Springer award, a four-year-old honor for technology luminaries offered by the eponymous German publisher. (Its first recipient was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; last year Amazon's Jeff Bezos got it.)</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized that researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet.</p><p>In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.</p><p>And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as \"behavioral surplus,\" \"prediction markets\" and \"instrumentarianism.\"</p><p>Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase - and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are molding our behavior. Worse, she says, they're spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure -an obvious stand-in for IBM - lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches -such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us.</p><p>\"When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening - maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book \" In the Age of the Smart Machine \" highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces.</p><p>Her next book, \" The Support Economy \" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.</p><p>It is an \"antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in 2011, but Facebook didn't get critical attention from Congress until two years ago, when Russian election interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal linked its voracious data collection to the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Not everyone agrees with the Zuboff prescription, to put it mildly. Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>The vice president of an industry-affiliated think tank, Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said an alternative explanation to Zuboff's arguments is that \"consumers are generally satisfied with the tradeoffs they make.\"</p><p>That's not what the Pew Research Center found in a June U.S. poll. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a \"soul-sucking\" rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.</p><p>Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. \"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,\" she says.</p><p>Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.</p><p>She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago.

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \"surveillance capitalism.\" The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theaterproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has spoken to audiences from Los Angeles to Rome and counseled politicians across Europe and North America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She has offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is looking into Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance. In early November, she received the Axel Springer award, a four-year-old honor for technology luminaries offered by the eponymous German publisher. (Its first recipient was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; last year Amazon's Jeff Bezos got it.)</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized that researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate. They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet.</p><p>In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.</p><p>And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as \"behavioral surplus,\" \"prediction markets\" and \"instrumentarianism.\"</p><p>Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase - and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are molding our behavior. Worse, she says, they're spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure -an obvious stand-in for IBM - lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches -such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us.</p><p>\"When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening - maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book \" In the Age of the Smart Machine \" highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces.</p><p>Her next book, \" The Support Economy \" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.</p><p>It is an \"antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in 2011, but Facebook didn't get critical attention from Congress until two years ago, when Russian election interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal linked its voracious data collection to the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Not everyone agrees with the Zuboff prescription, to put it mildly. Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>The vice president of an industry-affiliated think tank, Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said an alternative explanation to Zuboff's arguments is that \"consumers are generally satisfied with the tradeoffs they make.\"</p><p>That's not what the Pew Research Center found in a June U.S. poll. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a \"soul-sucking\" rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.</p><p>Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. \"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,\" she says.</p><p>Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.</p><p>She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to note that Zuboff spoke in May before international parliamentarians, not just Canadian lawmakers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-68e73fe9c328fc4548d051e0d56b1b7f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-FKK1-JC65-52YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1556\"/><timeReceived>5:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She hasn't stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: 'surveillance capitalism.' The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they've learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A best seller in Canada and Britain, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism was published in the US in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theater productions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending US privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has 'put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,' says BeebanKidron, a film director and UK House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. 'She's a rock star.'</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect-where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it 'digital exhaust.'</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. 'It is the product.'</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the US government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior-effectively molding individual behavior.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. 'By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,' Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of 'free' apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book, In the Age of the Smart Machine. Her next book, The Support Economy-co-written with her late husband James Maxmin-predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an 'antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,' she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, 'it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.'</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group Net\u00adChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book 'paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.'</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>'I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSMIR-BMIRROR1412201900002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSMIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRG-G1Y1-JCH9-G3P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410350</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Mirror All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Mirror (Philippines)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It found a big audience with U.S. publication in January of her 700-page \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" which skewers tech giants led by Facebook and Google.</p><p>Zuboff hasn't stood still since.</p><p>Her unflattering indictment of Big Tech evokes how they harvest the details of our lives and make billions from that data, all the while glueing our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p>A bestseller in Canada and Britain, the book published is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired a pair of small theatreproductions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counselling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel is studying Big Tech's potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has \"put the language of economics around the experience that we all know we're having,\" says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \"She's a rock star.\"</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect - where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behaviour - effectively moulding individual behaviour.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine Her next book, \"The Support Economy\" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an \"antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice-President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she's heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a35264e36a09a3d2b35eec670ee10345</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-WYP1-DY9S-T4VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><timeReceived>11:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They were calling it \"digital exhaust.\"</p><p>Zuboff saw that this data wasn't just an unexpected byproduct of online services, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \"It is the product.\"</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff's thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole and argue that consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don't cost them a cent. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism and the U.S. government's first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it's become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>In her slashing diagnosis, the dark-maned, fashionably bespectacled academic describes how Silicon Valley's once-utopian promises degenerated into the like button and that shoe advertisement that follows you around the internet.</p><p>In person, Zuboff is focused and precise. She speaks in composed paragraphs and brooks no interruption until she has unfurled a thought. The effect is of a highly structured thinker compelled to make complete arguments before she can move on to the next topic.</p><p>And her book can be a difficult read. Open to a random page and you're likely to confront phrases such as \"behavioural surplus,\" \"prediction markets\" and \"instrumentarianism.\"</p><p>Cut through the jargon, though, and Zuboff's indictment is straightforward: Tech companies put out new apps designed to suck up our data trails; companies then use those insights to steer us toward our next YouTube video or Facebook interaction or Amazon purchase - and to develop their next apps. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Such manipulations aren't unique to tech companies, although Zuboff argues that the industry has refined them to such a frightening degree that they are moulding our behaviour. Worse, she says, they're spreading. \"By now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\" Zuboff told international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism strikes a sharp contrast with Silicon Valley's hallowed self-image as a champion of personal autonomy, creativity and liberation. In an iconic 1984 television ad introducing the Macintosh computer, Apple portrayed itself as a lone runner smashing the grip of a Big Brotherish figure -an obvious stand-in for IBM - lecturing rows of stone-faced conformists.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches -such as what you searched for, when and where you searched and which results you clicked.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users' family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual persuasion and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and the company became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google's example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world's information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \"free\" apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Your smart TV might read how you react to shows or ads. Smart speakers can capture unguarded chatter. Behind the scenes, artificial-intelligence systems comb through that data to compile dossiers on each of us.</p><p>\"When you walk people through all this at first it can feel really alarming, and (they) go into denial and say, 'This isn't happening - maybe that guy was just exaggerating,'\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.</p><p>One of the first women professors to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world. Her 1988 book \" In the Age of the Smart Machine \" highlighted how automation might lead to less hierarchical, more collaborative workplaces.</p><p>Her next book, \" The Support Economy \" - co-written with her late husband James Maxmin - predicted that out-of-touch corporations run from isolated boardrooms would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses a deep and existential threat, one whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by executives much more eager to talk about new features than data-collection strategies.</p><p>It is an \"antidemocratic and anti-egalitarian juggernaut,\" she writes. In the name of personalization, she says, \"it defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\"</p><p>Consider, for instance, how long it took to energize public concern about Facebook's sloppy handling of user data. The company was sanctioned by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in 2011, but Facebook didn't get critical attention from Congress until two years ago, when Russian election interference and the Cambridge Analytica scandal linked its voracious data collection to the election of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Not everyone agrees with the Zuboff prescription, to put it mildly. Vice-President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \"paints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\"</p><p>The vice-president of an industry-affiliated think-tank , Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said an alternative explanation to Zuboff's arguments is that \"consumers are generally satisfied with the tradeoffs they make.\"</p><p>That's not what the Pew Research Center found in a June U.S. poll. Eighty-one per cent of respondents said they feel they have little or no control over the data companies collect on them and that the potential risks of that data-collection outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In a lengthy polemical review of Zuboff's ideas, socialist cultural critic Evgeny Morozov said some of her conclusions on surveillance capitalism outrun her evidence. Among other things, he argued that she failed to prove that surveillance capitalism is a \"soul-sucking\" rebirth of totalitarianism that makes people puppets of manipulative data wizards.</p><p>Zuboff acknowledges there is no simple way to undo surveillance capitalism. Breaking up technology giants, she says, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU's year-old data protection rule and California's new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start. So is a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington. \"I think it's the very early stages of a sea change,\" she says.</p><p>Whatever form it takes, change will take time, Zuboff says.</p><p>She takes heart from an unlikely source: the free-market economist Milton Friedman, who taught one of her classes when she was a student at the University of Chicago. Friedman, she says, frequently noted that the law can take decades to catch up with societal change.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to note that Zuboff spoke in May before international parliamentarians, not just Canadian lawmakers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-68e73fe9c328fc4548d051e0d56b1b7f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-WYP1-DY9S-T4V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1557\"/><timeReceived>12:28 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In practice, he didn't look the part. Unlike many of his peers in the twenty-something founder set, Holesh never raised funding from venture capitalists, and he spent little time in the industry's corridors of power in the Bay Area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, Holesh operated a one-man business out of the remodeled 188-square foot Momentum Fifth Wheel camper he and his wife and and their four pets have long called home. When he wasn't kayaking in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan or gazing at the rocky coast of the Pacific from the RV's roof, Holesh built an app called Moment to help people curb excess screen usage by tracking which apps consume the most of their time.</p><p>At its core, Moment was \"anti-Silicon Valley,\" Holesh says. He ran the company on his own terms and focused on tackling \"screen time addiction problems created by the big tech companies.\" In 2014, when the app launched, that stance was unusual. People were still sleeping peacefully with the belief that their apps and devices --- and the technology companies behind them --- were generally forces for good. By 2017, that had changed. Suddenly the headlines were all about fake news, election meddling, filter bubbles and technology addiction. </p><p>That's when Holesh received a one-line email out of the blue from Tim Kendall asking him to talk. Holesh didn't know who Kendall was, but it didn't take long to find out. Kendall was most recently the president of Pinterest, one of the most valuable startups in the US. Before that, he helped build Facebook's billion-dollar ad machine as its director of monetization for four years.</p><p>Holesh knew Facebook, of course. It frequently topped Moment's list of the most used apps and also ranked high on the list of apps that made users unhappy. As Holesh recalled recently in an interview with CNN Business, his first reaction to Kendall's email was: \"Oh, is Tim seeking redemption or something for his past sins?\" </p><p>Little did he know that Kendall had just undergone an awakening of his own, which would lead him to leave his job at Pinterest, delete the Facebook app and commit his time and resources to crusade against what he saw as a phone-addiction epidemic that could \"crush\" an entire generation.</p><p>Three months later, in February, 2018, the unlikely pair sat at a coffee shop along the Colorado River in Austin and hammered out a deal for Kendall to acquire Moment and invest $7 million of his own money in it. No lawyers or M&amp;A team were present. Just one man buying another man's company, with plans to work together to save us from our screens.</p><p>The Silicon Valley insider and outsider team up</p><p>The history of the tech industry was written in large part by power duos. Bill Hewlett and David Packard at HP. Bill Gates and Paul Allen at Microsoft. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple. For years, the marriage of opposites at Apple served as a recipe for other companies to follow: pair a business savvy founder who can push the brand forward in the public eye with a brilliant technical founder who operates largely behind the scenes. </p><p>Holesh, 29, and Kendall, 42, may offer a new template. In an era of growing concern about the unintended consequences of technology, the winning formula to affect change may just be pairing a founder who has an outsider's perspective of the industry, with a consummate insider like Kendall who speaks its language. </p><p>If an artificial intelligence program were tasked with imagining Silicon Valley as a person, it might churn out someone like Tim Kendall. He was known for wearing the same T-shirt daily, with the word \"Focus\" on it. He periodically tried to hack his life by fasting for a day or taking ice baths in the morning. And his resume included stints at two of the big five tech companies, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>He is also a father of two young children. One day, as he recalled to CNN Business, he found himself \"holed up in the pantry\" watching videos on his phone while his children were out in the family room. \"And I can't get off my phone,\" he remembers. </p><p>\"I wasn't mainlining heroin, but I was doing something I knew wasn't good,\" Kendall said. \"I had this epiphany that Jesus, this thing is really a problem.\"</p><p>True to form, Kendall began experimenting on himself. He \"radically reduced\" his social media usage --- eventually deleting apps like Facebook entirely --- and checked his email less frequently, which isn't necessarily ideal for a tech executive. \"There are still a lot of people, unfortunately, in Silicon Valley who conflate two-minute response times with intelligence,\" he says. \"It actually may be counter correlated.\"</p><p>In November, 2017, Kendall announced he was leaving his job at Pinterest with plans to launch his own company that would tackle the screen time problem. That same month, he reached out to Holesh for the first time and soon began talks to buy Moment.</p><p>Moment is \"a mission-driven company that is focused on counteracting, quite frankly, a lot of the things that [I] was a part of helping to create,\" Kendall says.</p><p>\"I absolutely see the fault in our thinking,\" Kendall said of his work with Facebook in particular. \"The thinking was very much like: more more more. More peoples' attention. More people. More money.\" </p><p>In his telling, Facebook and others in the industry for too long saw themselves as upstarts doing whatever was necessary to grow. \"I think we were all guilty of being Goliath and not realizing it.\"</p><p>Moment has its moment </p><p>Now, five years after Moment launched, even the Goliaths are acknowledging the problem. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the company is less focused on boosting the total time spent on its platform than ensuring it is \"time well spent.\" Apple and Google unveiled tools to track screen time, similar to the original Moment app. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, said it showed he was using his phone too much. </p><p>The increased attention to the issue has been a boon to Moment, Kendall says. Thousands of people now download the app daily, despite the company spending nothing on marketing. More than seven million people have used the app so far. And Moment's data makes it clear the problem isn't going away. The average American spends nearly four hours a day on their phone and checks it 47 times a day, according to the company. </p><p>\"I don't believe the incumbents --- Facebook, Apple, Google --- have the incentive to actually solve the problem,\" Kendall says. He compares some of their efforts to soda companies putting dietary labels on their cans. \"It gets them off the hook with regulators, but it has no impact on sales.\"</p><p>In addition to tracking phone usage down to the app level, Moment now offers guided coaching, options to set up phone-free time for the entire family and a shareable bulletin to tell the world you are about to get off your phone for the next couple hours. Holesh also credits Kendall with getting Moment to focus on the number of times people pick up their phone as a key metric.</p><p>Under Kendall, Moment has stopped being a one-man shop. It now has six staffers, with openings for several more, and an office by the San Francisco International Airport. Sometimes you'll find Holesh there too in his role as head of product. </p><p>Beyond shaping the app, he has also shaped Kendall's work habits. At Facebook, Kendall says, it was \"all about how many hours are you going to log. Let's throw hours at this problem and you will solve it.\" Holesh, he says, rejects that thinking outright and advocates for unplugging on weekends and vacations. \"I now really go along with how he operates,\" he says.</p><p>Holesh has been inspired too. On one RV trip to Yellowstone National Park not long after the deal closed, Holesh decided to \"be Tim for a week\" and \"take ice baths in the raging Yellowstone River.\" It felt good, he said, but then he took out a thermometer and discovered the water was actually a balmy 68 degrees. </p><p>Hacking your habits is hard, whether it's weening off your phone or immersing yourself in a pool of freezing water.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

That's when the problems started.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It didn't really track my face that well,\" says Buolamwini, who is a black Ghanaian-American woman. \"Then lighter-skinned people would use my system and it would run away and I was like, 'Hey! I built this for me. But it works for you'.\"</p><p>She laughs. Hectoring, it quickly becomes apparent, is not her style. Sitting in the Barbican, where she has an exhibit at the recently-opened show, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">AI: More than Human</url>, she guffaws infectiously at the near comic outrageousness of the tech world's injustices, preferences and prejudices, which together reveal a combination of immense power and astonishing immaturity. It's a world in which algorithms help decide every facet of our lives: who gets a mortgage, or a place at university, or a job, or stopped by the police, or parole. And yet those algorithms are themselves unchecked by the basic safety protocols that we would expect in any other industry of comparable importance.\u00a0</p><p>\"We just assume because it's a machine or because we've used data that decisions are going to be somehow fair or neutral,\" she says. \"But then we find when you look under the hood, something's rotting, and no one was checking in the first place.\" It was a realisation brought home to Buolamwini at Halloween. As part of her costume she put on a white face mask. The Aspire Mirror instantly whirred into action. \"The mask was detected so quickly compared to my real face. That was the moment I realised there was something going on\".\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">Facial recognition technology | At a glance</url></p><p>She swiftly read a report called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">The Perpetual Line-up</url>, by the Georgetown Center for Law and Privacy, which revealed the extent of unregulated facial recognition by the FBI and police in America. The scale of its findings caused shockwaves: more than 117 million American adults were affected - about one in two - their faces, whether captured by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">surveillance cameras</url> or driver's license databases, all being scrutinised by algorithms, says Buolamwini, \"that haven't been audited for accuracy\".\u00a0</p><p>She wondered if it wasn't just her having problems with facial recognition. \"What about all of these people who are in these police data sets - could they be falsely mismatched?\" The real-world implications could be huge. \"When your face gets mistakenly associated with something you haven't done, are you going to be believed or is the machine going to be believed?\"</p><p>The impact is most obvious upon what Buolamwini describes as the \"under-sampled majority\" - women and people of colour, who don't appear proportionally in the data-sets on which AI algorithms are trained.\u00a0 She recalls a spat she had with Amazon over AI used in the early stages of its hiring process. \"It was trained on 10 years of hiring data for software developers,\" she explains, \"and what they found was that a resume containing the word 'women's',\" - be they members of a women's hockey, or debating team, say - \"would be categorically ranked lower than those that didn't.\"\u00a0</p><p>The problem was that in the previous 10 years most developers had been men. Of course, that didn't mean the best developers are always men. \"So instead of actually finding patterns that are saying you're good for the job, it's finding patterns that are characteristic of those who had been in the job in the past.\"</p><p>Amazon disputed Buolamwini's conclusions. But it scrapped the AI system. Do we want to live in a world, she asks, where \"you don't get a job, you don't get into college, not because you were unworthy but because AI rendered you irrelevant?\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">Telegraph Readers | Is facial recognition technology safe?</url></p><p>The problem is not usually down to malice. Rather, study after study reveals how dramatically under-represented women and minorities are in the big tech companies - \"the G-Mafia\" as Buolamwini calls them. And that can lead to so-called \"unconscious bias\". She happily admits she is not free of it herself, telling a story about one research project she conducted involving the Fitzpatrick scale, used by dermatologists to measure skin response to UV radiation. \"I had no idea you could get sunburn in different ways. But sunburn is just not my world or something I have to think about.\" \u00a0</p><p>She calls the translation of such blindspots to the digital world, \"the coded gaze\" - where users simply don't think about the injustices others face because they aren't exposed to them. \u00a0 Some fixes, Buolamwini says, are obvious: improve the ethnic and gender balance of teams creating AI algorithms in the first place; assume bias and bake mitigation processes into development itself; subject AI to the same ongoing, verified standards and norms applied to engineering components or pharmaceuticals.\u00a0</p><p>\"Right now you just take your AI model without a lot of information, shake it around and sniff it to see if it smells funny and hope it works. We have an industry that doesn't have due diligence. We can do so much better.\"\u00a0</p><p>Not, she says, that we can rely on industry to self-regulate. Which is why Buolamwini founded the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">Algorithmic Justice League</url>, a collective to highlight coded discrimination. The superhero-style name is a classic touch of communications genius from a sharply-dressed woman who styles herself \"the poet of code\", and is leveraging her rapidly-rising profile to make a political impact at Davos, the UN, and serving on the EU Global Tech panel.\u00a0</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">I can't believe what I'm seeing!

By contrast, Buolamwini, who was born in Canada to an artist and a professor of medicinal chemistry, then grew up in Ghana and Oxford, Mississippi, before winning a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, England, and finally heading to MIT for her PhD, has a background that oozes authority.\u00a0</p><p>Her main message, she insists, is against \"technological determinism\" - the idea that the march forwards is both inevitable and immutable. Look at IBM and Microsoft, she says, which changed their facial recognition software in response to her work; look at the UK, where this week, police use of facial recognition will be challenged in court for the first time; look at Amazon's activist shareholders, who are voting on Wednesday on whether to ban the continued development of the company's own facial recognition software.</p><p>\"At the end of the day it is up to us to define what the future will look like. To have the political will. Ultimately, AI is not a tech issue. It is a people issue.\" Is she an optimist? \"The San Francisco decision has made me more optimistic than I've ever been,\" she says, referring to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/ai-human-review-barbican-fascinating-questions-robotic-answers/\">last week's vote in the city to ban use of facial recognition</url> technology by police and government agencies altogether.\u00a0</p><p>Yet the fact that the West Coast capital of Silicon Valley has taken such a step, she thinks, should give us all pause. \"The city where the sausage is made does not want to eat the sausage,\" she says, laughing again. \"That tells you something.\"\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-53180212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W54-T911-JCJY-G1HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1335\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Brown, partner in Wiley\u2019s National Security, Privacy, Cyber &amp; Data Governance, and Telecom, Media, &amp; Technology practices, co-authored \u201cTechlash and National Security: The Need for U.S Leadership on Privacy and Security,\u201d a new law and policy paper published today by the National Security Institute (NSI) at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School. The publication\u2019s announcement coincided with today\u2019s congressional hearings on major online platform players, and with the launch of NSI\u2019s Technology, Innovation, and American National Security program. NSI Senior Fellow Dr. Andrea Little Limbago serves as co-author on the paper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cAs policymakers consider tech policy, from privacy to cyber to encryption, they should resist a populist temptation to punish or regulate tech companies in a way that makes the U.S less open to innovation, creativity, and investment,\u201d said Ms. Brown. \u201cAs we see in recent congressional and Executive branch actions, including today\u2019s antitrust hearing and yesterday\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration petition to the Federal Communications Commission to revise Section 230, some are targeting our own tech sector while other countries promote national champions to promote their ideas around the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need thoughtful policies that tackle our very real security and privacy challenges in order to promote innovation and lead on the global stage,\u201d Ms. Brown added. \u201cThe United States must be an active counterweight to geopolitical rivals. And it must so do in a way that keeps the U.S private sector engaged and empowered to take a leading role in global technology markets.\u201d\u201cData is foundational to our national and economic security, and is at risk of manipulation, theft, and exposure from a broad range of state and non-state actors,\u201d said co-author Dr. Limbago, who is Vice President of Research and Analysis at Interos. \u201cThe ongoing revelations of data-sharing scandals by tech companies has prompted growing interest in new data regulations. Given the foundational role of data to our national and economic security, this is a welcome shift, but risks weakening instead of strengthening national security and data protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis paper highlights the essential role the U.S must play in shaping a data protection strategy that supports both privacy and security, and provide the leadership to demonstrate how innovation and data protection can co-exist as a foundational component of a digital democracy,\u201d Dr. Limbago added.</p><p>The paper has direct relevance to today\u2019s hearing because it:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Summarizes how \u201cTechlash\u201d (defined as the \u201cstrong and widespread negative reaction to the growing power and influence that large technology companies hold\u201d) and criticism of Big Tech are realigning the regulatory instincts of policymakers and companies. This dynamic may embolden government action to regulate in the name of lawful government access and national security, among other goals.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Describes how movements to regulate technology companies may undermine privacy and security protective end-to-end encryption and erode Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Suggests that policymakers should prioritize data protection as essential for national security in the digital era, and urges U.S  global leadership to inspire digital democracies and counter digital authoritarianism.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Proposes actionable recommendations for policymakers to address encryption, federal data protection regulation, cybersecurity expertise, and global leadership.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The paper is available here.
