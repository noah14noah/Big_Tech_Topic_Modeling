Sixteen State Attorneys General, including the Attorney General for the State of Georgia, Sam Olens, are now responding to the proposed rules. </p><p>The Attorneys General are advising the FCC to drop its ISP plan to spare providers from regulatory confusion and unnecessary burdens. According to the FCC, the proposed rules are meant to further protect consumers, particularly broadband subscribers, by giving them more control over how their information is used and shared by ISPs. The proposed rules would require providers to obtain 'opt-in' consent from consumers before using any of their information for a non-communications-related purpose (i.e., third-party marketing purposes). The FCC assumed authority over ISP customer privacy issues in 2015 when it reclassified ISPs as common carriers. The Commission has emphasized, though, that the proposed rules will not apply to the privacy practices of 'edge providers' like Google or Facebook, over which the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') has authority. In their September 9th letter[2] to the FCC, the State Attorneys General argue that the separate (yet overlapping) authorities of the FCC and FTC over ISPs create unnecessary confusion. According to the letter, '[c]rafting a patchwork of regulations imposes extra burdens on all who seek to protect consumer privacy, forcing them to navigate artificial distinctions before they can determine what rules do or do not apply in a particular circumstance.' In other words, it actually hurts consumers to create regulations over ISPs while exempting big tech companies, and vice versa. The letter explains, '[c]onsumers value their privacy and the security of their personal information, period. They do not differentiate between who has access to their information in the online environment.' Moreover, the Attorneys General are concerned that the FCC's rules could preempt state laws, which already 'protect consumers' privacy' on the internet. The letter states, '[i]t is of paramount importance that any federal regulations not impair states' ability to vigorously protect their citizens.' State laws governing the practices of ISPs, the Attorneys General argue, have 'distinct advantages over new prescriptive regulatory approaches.' Rather than create regulations piecemeal, the letter recommends that the FCC 'engage with the [FTC] and state attorneys general to determine the most effective path forward to protect consumers and their privacy.' The FCC is scheduled to address both these concerns at its next open meeting this Thursday, September 29th.

Gray Davis is promising his own stimulus plan to create 500,000 jobs and lift the state -- particularly the hard-hit, tech-heavy Bay Area -- from its economic funk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But how Davis can stimulate the economy while at the same time raising taxes and slashing spending to close a $35 billion budget deficit is a source of wonder to many economists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Like many governors, Davis is obligated by law to close the budget gap. Despite his vows to stimulate the California economy by speeding up school and other construction projects and increasing training for the jobless, these measures will be swamped by the contractionary effects of closing the deficit, which is bigger than the combined deficits of all the other states.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>Chronicle Washington Bureau</p></bodyText></section><p>Yet politically Davis, who gives his State of the State speech tonight, is in a win-win situation. If the Bush plan succeeds, Davis will bask in the same glow enjoyed by the president; if it fails, Davis can join other Democrats in blaming Bush for a sputtering economy.</p><p> The sweeping White House proposal is aimed at goosing business investment, which drove the late 1990s boom and now is muffling the recovery, particularly in Silicon Valley.</p><p> The plan would eliminate the double tax on corporate dividends, make all the future income tax rate cuts approved in the 2001 tax bill, including those for the top brackets, effective retroactive to Jan. 1, and triple the amount small businesses can write off as expenses.</p><p> $100 BILLION KICK</p><p> Combined with tax cuts targeted at the middle class -- a higher child tax credit, faster \"marriage penalty\" relief, expansion of the lowest income tax bracket and an extension of unemployment benefits -- the White House calculates about a $100 billion kick to the economy this year.</p><p> But there's a big problem: The combined state deficits are close to $100 billion over the next two years, roughly the same size as Bush's stimulus plan in its first year, according to Chris Atkins, director of fiscal policy for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national group of state lawmakers. Bush's plan provides no money for those states that, like California, will be trying to close their deficits with sharply contractionary policies.</p><p> \"Every time the country goes into a recession, states start accumulating deficits, their sales tax and income tax revenues decline, and they run into trouble,\" said David Levine, an economist at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. \"Most states have a balanced budget amendment, and so a very common response is to cut spending and raise taxes. That makes recessions worse, and it's a disastrous fiscal policy for the nation to have each state raising taxes, laying off workers and cutting programs just when unemployment is high.\"</p><p> In the first year of the Bush 2001 tax cut, states raised taxes an estimated $10 billion, completely offsetting the $10 billion worth of first-year tax cuts in the Bush plan, Atkins said.</p><p> DOT-COM BUBBLE</p><p> The pattern is all the worse in California, where the dot-com boom larded the state's treasury at the start of Davis' first term thanks to the state's capital gains tax.</p><p> Now, taxpayers are claiming big capital losses, draining both the state and federal treasuries.</p><p> \"California got enormous revenue from the dot-com zillionaires cashing in their options,\" Levine said.</p><p> To be sure, states can, and do, compete for businesses and growth on the basis of lower taxes and a milder regulatory climate than their neighbors.</p><p> \"The fact is, California already has a very high tax burden, and if it wants to get serious about doing all they can to sponsor growth, they need to re-examine the tax burden and the way they spend money,\" Atkins said.</p><p> But it is difficult for states facing budget deficits to do their own economic stimulus, Levine said. Bond rating agencies often downgrade the debt of states that cut taxes or raise spending while running deficits, digging states into a deeper hole as their interest costs rise.</p><p> Another problem is that much of the benefit from any single state's stimulus goes to people in other states.</p><p> MIDWEST AUTOWORKERS</p><p> \"To the extent Californians go out and buy a car because they didn't get laid off, that might be wonderful for all the autoworkers in the Midwest, but the benefits don't stick around to feed back into California jobs and California tax revenue,\" Levine said. \"At a basic level, countercycle anti-recessionary stimulus has to be a federal program.\"</p><p> Likewise, Davis' plan to speed up school construction won't necessarily leave all that spending in state.</p><p> \"For the nation, it is great for California to maintain or even accelerate school construction and other useful public spending,\" Levine said. \"I just hope that other states do the same thing, because many of those construction supplies will come from overseas, and an even larger supply will come from other states.\"</p><p> If the Bush plan successfully recharges business investment -- and there is hardly a consensus among economists that it will -- few states will benefit more than California with its big tech industry.</p><p> But much will depend on what California and other states do.

The \"long-awaited\" rebranding of Flybe as Virgin Connect would mark the start of the airline's \"journey into the future as part of the extended Virgin family\" under a \"tremendously re-energised team\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now comes a detour on that journey, a trip to two government business departments <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/flybe-in-rescue-talks-to-stave-off-collapse\">to ask for emergency financing</url>. The airline, the departments for business and transport and Flybe's shareholders, including Virgin Atlantic, would not comment on       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/flybe-in-rescue-talks-to-stave-off-collapse\">the reports</url> but, since all parties would have a strong incentive to quash any untrue tale, one must assume high-stakes bargaining is at a critical point.</p><p>Flybe can't afford the negotiations to be leisurely. Credit card providers, who can find themselves on the hook for cancelled flights, tend to panic in these situations. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/flybe-in-rescue-talks-to-stave-off-collapse\">Last February's \u00a32.2m purchase of Flybe</url> by the Connect consortium had to be accelerated in its final stages because lenders were withholding money from the airline to protect themselves from the risk of default. So clarity is needed, and quickly.</p><p>The main obstacle to a rescue, one must assume, is deep reluctance to risk public money by lending to a private company where the owners bought the business less than a year ago and, as the quotes above indicate, revved the engines confidently last autumn. Indeed, the Connect consortium, having bought Flybe at a knockdown headline price, said they were willing to invest \u00a3100m. They spoke excitedly of the potential of Flybe to feed Virgin's long-haul network out of Heathrow and Manchester. What's changed?</p><p>Increased trading losses? Higher fuel costs after sterling's decline last summer? Brexit uncertainty? None of those risks were unimaginable 12 months ago, so it would be hard for Virgin and its consortium partners - Stobart Air and the US investment firm Cyrus Capital - to plead that they've been struck by exceptional events. Flybe has suffered many crises in many forms in its 40 years of flying.</p><p>A better card to play in front of ministers would be to point to Flybe's role as the main operator of UK domestic flights, and thus its contribution to regional connectivity. The government is preaching a gospel of \"levelling up\" between regions, so presumably would be reluctant to see Flybe fail. In that sense, the airline is a more \"deserving\" case than Thomas Cook, where the hole in the package holiday market can be filled by rivals. Besides, Flybe's numbers will be substantially smaller than Thomas Cook's.</p><p>Yet the bare-minimum requirement for any public support should be this: Virgin and its partners should have to dig deep themselves. So no more talk about an intention to invest in improving Flybe. Only upfront, at-risk capital will do.</p><p>Even with that qualification, it's impossible from outside to tell if there's a sensible deal to be done that protects the public purse. But the underlying principle ought be clear: Virgin and its partners cannot expect a free ride.</p><p>                   Fines in their billions are fine for big tech                   </p><p>As Alphabet, as Google calls itself these days, shapes up to become the fourth of the US big tech firms to reach a stock market capitalisation of $1tn, it's worth recalling old legal battles.</p><p>One, which was naively regarded as breathtaking at the time, was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/flybe-in-rescue-talks-to-stave-off-collapse\">the (EURO)2.42bn fine from the EU</url> in 2017. Google abused its dominance of the search engine market in building its online shopping service and \"denied other companies the chance to compete on merits and to innovate,\" the competition policy commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said.</p><p>Include various other fines and the EU has fined Google about (EURO)8bn for anti-competitive practices over the years. It's a stunning sum in and of itself but, versus $1tn in corporate worth, it can almost be lost in the wash.</p><p>It's hard to believe regulators would be able easily to add a zero to their penalties to deter monopolist behaviour by digital giants. But a billion here, and a billion there, now looks puny.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-59372098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYX-1111-JCJY-G3RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><timeReceived>7:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The resolution of some high-profile investigations into big tech is also expected in the new year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">State involvement</p><p>More than a dozen state attorneys general are engaged in a trial in federal district court in New York contesting the Sprint Corp./T-Mobile US Inc. merger, alleging the deal would harm innovation and lead to higher prices for consumers. The state-led effort is ongoing, despite the fact that both federal regulators reviewing the deal   the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and U.S. Department of Justice   have approved the deal with conditions.</p><p>This type of state-led challenge is \"entirely unprecedented,\" according to Jonathan Chaplin, who leads the U.S. communications services research team for New Street Research, a telecommunications and technology-focused research firm.</p><p>Logan Breed, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, who focuses on antitrust and has experience in the telecommunications, media and hardware sectors, noted state-level antitrust enforcers are getting \"increasingly aggressive.\" \"We've seen state AGs join the FCC or the DOJ in suits before,\" Chaplin said in an interview. \"We've never seen a state AG or a group of state AGs sue to block a deal that's been approved by the DOJ and the FCC.\"</p><p>\"If the state AGs decide they are going to conduct independent merger reviews of significant transactions, rather than coordinating with the DOJ or FTC and letting the federal agency take the lead on most investigations, that would have a significant impact on the merger review process and the risk of M&amp;A activity in the United States,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>According to Chaplin, the state-led challenge to the Sprint/T-Mobile deal, in fact, could reshape how the wireless industry pursues and structures mergers.</p><p>\"There's a completely different calculus going forward, whether this deal is successful or not, where one has to consider not just what would be required from the federal regulatory agencies in order to get a deal approved, but how individual states may react, what it might take to get their support for a deal,\" he said.</p><p>Big tech</p><p>One antitrust area where both state regulators and federal regulators are actively involved is in investigations into large technology companies. State regulators are engaged in antitrust probes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google LLC and Facebook Inc., while federal antitrust regulators at the DOJ and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission are also engaged in probes of large technology companies.</p><p>On Dec. 12, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC, which has an open antitrust probe into Facebook, is contemplating pursuing a preliminary injunction against Facebook due to competition concerns related to its practices for integrating apps and how that impacts competitors. In January, Facebook confirmed plans to unify the messaging infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. Executives said the move was intended to improve security and privacy.</p><p>The resolution of some of these probes, according to one antitrust attorney who works on tech, media and telecom issues, are likely to be a key development in 2020.</p><p>\"The fact that the FTC on Facebook is far enough along to potentially be seeking a preliminary injunction regarding integrating some of those apps ... that must mean it's pretty far along in its analysis,\" said the attorney. \"I would expect that, if it's actually going to sue to unwind those transactions, I would think that would be next year.\"</p><p>The attorney noted it would be much more difficult for the FTC to attempt to sue to unwind previous Facebook acquisitions after the social media company already has integrated its operations and activities.</p><p>Other trends</p><p>Breed said it also is likely that the administration's approach to \"behavioral remedies\" will continue and that it could complicate future vertical transactions.</p><p>The DOJ's litigation in the AT&amp;T Inc./Time Warner merger served as a high-profile example in 2019. In that case, Breed noted the DOJ \"refused to enter into the kind of behavioral remedy that has typified previous vertical transactions,\" such as the Comcast Corp./NBCUniversal Media LLC deal.</p><p>Makan Delrahim, the head of the DOJ's antitrust division, has said he prefers to focus on \"structural relief\" to remedy mergers that are viewed as harmful for consumers and in violation of the law. While structural remedies typically involve a tangible change to an organization such as a divestiture, behavioral remedies rely on stipulations that regulate a company's future conduct.</p><p>\"The DOJ's policy on behavioral remedies has changed from the previous administration and the administrations before that,\" Breed said. \"The effect of that change could be felt most acutely in industries where those kinds of vertical transactions are more likely, which include the tech industry and the media industry.\"</p><p>According to Charles Naftalin, who leads the communications practice at the law firm Holland &amp; Knight LLP, the DOJ also has been more active in looking at radio and television transactions that do not necessarily meet the threshold under a law, known as the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, that requires parties in certain large transactions to file detailed information related to the proposed deal with federal antitrust regulators.</p><p>\"My sense is there's more interest in looking at smaller transactions and examining them for local market concentration than there used to be,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-56215167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTJ-P4H1-JDVW-N071-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

REICH, PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] My name is Robert Reich. I am Chancellor`s Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. I served as Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, Director of Policy Planning for the Federal Trade Commission in the Carter Administration, and Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Ford Administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am pleased to discuss with you the question whether America has a monopoly problem. My answer is it does. Let me explain. Not long ago I visited some farmers in Missouri whose profits are disappearing. Why? Monsanto alone owns the key genetic traits to more than 90 percent of the soybeans planted by farmers in the United States, and 80 percent of the corn. Which means Monsanto can charge farmers much higher prices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farmers are getting squeezed from the other side, too, because the food processors they sell their produce to are also consolidating into mega companies that have so much market power they can cut the prices they pay to farmers.</p><p>This doesn`t mean lower food prices to consumers. It means more profits to the monopolists.</p><p>Monopolies All Around</p><p>America used to have antitrust laws that stopped corporations from monopolizing markets, and often broke up the biggest culprits. But antitrust has faded. The result has been hidden upward redistributions of money and power from the majority of Americans to corporate executives of and major investors in huge concentrations of economic power.</p><p>Consumers may believe they have lots of choices, but take a closer look and choices are far more constrained:</p><p>1. The four largest food companies control 82 percent of beef packing, 85 percent of soybean processing, 63 percent of pork packing, and 53 percent of chicken processing.</p><p>2. There are many brands of toothpaste, but 70 percent of all of it comes from just two companies.</p><p>3. Consumers may think they have their choice of sunglasses, but almost all sunglasses are from one company: Luxottica - which also owns nearly all the eyeglass retail outlets.</p><p>4. Practically every plastic hanger in America is now made by one company, Mainetti.</p><p>5. Cat food appears to come in many brands, but behind them are basically just two companies.</p><p>6. Consumers can get low-cost generic versions of pharmaceuticals. But drug companies in effect pay the makers of generic drugs to delay cheaper versions. Such ``pay for delay`` agreements are illegal in other advanced economies, but they are commonplace in America. They cost consumers an estimated $3.5 billion a year.</p><p>7. Health insurers are consolidating, too. Which is one reason health insurance premiums, copayments, and deductibles are soaring.</p><p>8. Anyone who thinks they have a lot of options for booking discount airline tickets and hotels online should think again. They have only two. Expedia merged with Orbitz, so that`s one company. And then there`s Priceline.</p><p>9. How about cable and Internet service? At most, consumers have a choice of just four companies; many consumers are served by just one or two.</p><p>10. Today, four airlines control 80 percent of domestic airline seat capacity. In 93 of the top 100 airports, either one or two airlines manage a majority of all seats sold.</p><p>11. What about choice of bank? The five biggest commercial banks now control nearly half of all banking assets, as well as ATM networks.</p><p>12. Three rating agencies control 95 percent of the market for rating bonds and other financial instruments: Moody`s, Standard &amp; Poor`s, and Fitch.</p><p>The problem with all this consolidation is that giant firms don`t have to compete very much, if at all. Which means they can - and do - raise prices higher than they`d be if they faced more competition. But it`s not just prices we should worry about.</p><p>Such consolidation can also depress wages. Workers with less choice of whom to work for have a harder time getting a raise.</p><p>When local labor markets are dominated by one major big box retailer, grocery chain, and a handful of fast-food restaurants, those firms essentially set wage rates for the area.1 Researchers have found that wages drop when fewer employers in a geographic area list most jobs in an occupation.2 Non-compete clauses can also hold down wages. 3 These massive corporations also possess substantial political clout.</p><p>That`s one reason they`re consolidating: They don`t just seek economic power; they also seek political power.</p><p>Antitrust laws were supposed to stop what`s been going on.</p><p>We`ve Forgotten History</p><p>In America`s first Gilded Age, at the end of the nineteenth century, the public viewed with growing alarm the economic and political power of the huge railroad, steel, telegraph, and oil cartels - then called ``trusts`` - that were essentially running America. A handful of corporate chieftains who came to be known as ``robber barons`` presided over these trusts - collecting great wealth at the expense of workers who toiled long hours often in dangerous conditions for little pay. Corporations gouged consumers and corrupted politics.</p><p>America responded to these abuses of power with antitrust laws that allowed the government to break up the largest concentrations. Antitrust was viewed not only in narrow economic terms but also as a means of preventing giant corporations from undermining democracy. ``If we will not endure a king as a political power,`` thundered Ohio`s Senator John Sherman, the sponsor of the nation`s first antitrust law in 1890, ``we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale`` of what the nation produced. (It is worth noting that when Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act, no separate discipline called ``economics`` existed; the field was known as ``political economy.``)</p><p>Then in 1901 the progressive Republican reformer Teddy Roosevelt became President. By this time, the American public was demanding action. In his first message to Congress in December 1901, only two months after assuming the presidency, Roosevelt warned, ``There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as the trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare.`` Roosevelt used the Sherman Antitrust Act to sue the Northern Securities Company, a giant railroad trust run by J. P. Morgan, the nation`s most powerful businessman. The U.S. Supreme Court backed Roosevelt and ordered the company dismantled.</p><p>In 1911, John D. Rockefeller`s Standard Oil Trust was broken up, too. But in its decision, the Supreme Court effectively altered the Sherman Act, saying that monopolistic restraints of trade were objectionable if they were ``unreasonable`` - and that determination was to be made by the courts. What was an unreasonable restraint of trade? In the presidential election of 1912, Roosevelt, running again for president but this time as a third party candidate, opined that some concentration of industries should be allowed where there were economic efficiencies due to large scale; but these firms should be regulated the public benefit. Woodrow Wilson, who ended up winning the election, and his adviser Louis Brandeis, took a different view. They didn`t think regulation would work, and thought all monopolies should be broken up.</p><p>For the next sixty-five years, both views dominated. America had strong antitrust enforcement along with regulations that held big corporations in check. Most big mergers were prohibited. Even large size alone was thought to be a problem. In 1945, in the case of United States v. Alcoa (1945), the Supreme Court ruled that even though Alcoa hadn`t pursued a monopoly, it had become one by becoming so large that it was guilty of violating the Sherman Act.</p><p>All this changed in the 1980s, after Robert Bork - with whom, incidentally, I studied antitrust law with at Yale Law School, and then worked for when he became Solicitor General under President Ford - wrote an influential book called The Antitrust Paradox, which argued that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act is consumer welfare. Bork believed that mergers and large size almost always create efficiencies that lower prices, and therefore should be legal. Bork`s ideas were consistent with the conservative Chicago School of Economics, and found a ready audience in the Reagan White House.</p><p>Since then, even under Democratic administrations, antitrust has all but disappeared.</p><p>The Particular Problem of Big Tech</p><p>America`s first Gilded Age began with a raft of innovations - railroads, steel production, oil extraction - but culminated in mammoth trusts. We`re now in a second Gilded Age - ushered in by semiconductors, software and the Internet - which has spawned a handful of giant hi-tech companies.</p><p>Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches now go through Google.4 Facebook and Google dominate advertising, carrying 58 percent of all digital ads; Amazon accounts for 4.2 percent of the digital ad market.5</p><p>Facebook and Google are also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 percent of Americans receive news online).6 Apple dominates smartphones, with over 40 percent of the U.S. market.7 Google`s Android accounts for 55 percent of all smartphone operating systems in the U.S.; Apple`s iOS, for 44 percent.8 Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything - and responsible for an estimated 45 percent of all retail e-commerce in the United States.9</p><p>This consolidation at the heart of the American economy is contributing to five problems that go far beyond narrow concepts of consumer welfare.</p><p>First, it stifles innovation. Contrary to the conventional view of a US economy bubbling with inventive small companies, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the United States has been halved since 2004, according to the Census Bureau.10 A major culprit: Big Tech.</p><p>Big Tech`s sweeping patents and copyrights, huge and growing data collections, dominant networks and platforms, and capacities for predatory behavior -- combined with legions of lawyers ready to sue for infringement of intellectual property, or the poaching of employees -- have become formidable barriers to new entrants. The most that many startups can hope for is to be purchased by Big Tech; but in any such negotiations, Big Tech has the advantage of a monopsony.</p><p>The second problem is that such large size and gigantic capitalization translate into political power. They allow vast sums to be spent on lobbying, political campaigns, and public persuasion. To take one example, although the European Union filed fined Google a record $2.7 billion for forcing search engine users into its own shopping platforms, American antitrust authorities have not moved against the company.</p><p>Why not? In 2012, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission`s Bureau of Competition recommended that the Commission sue Google for conduct that ``has resulted and will result in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets,`` but the commissioners chose not to pursue the case, and gave no explanation for their decision. As a former official of the commission, I can tell you it`s unusual for the commissioners to decide against a staff recommendation without comment.</p><p>We can`t be sure why the FTC chose not to pursue Google. After all, section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 gives the Commission broad authority to prevent unfair acts or practices. One distinct possibility concerns Google`s political power. It has one of the biggest lobbying powerhouses in Washington, and the firm gives generously to Democrats as well as Republicans.</p><p>A clearer example of an abuse of power was revealed last November when the New York Times reported that Facebook executives withheld evidence of Russian activity on their platform far longer than previously disclosed.</p><p>Even more disturbing, Facebook employed a political opposition research firm to discredit critics.11 How long will it be before Facebook uses its own data and platform against critics? Or before potential critics are silenced even by the possibility? As the Times`s investigation made clear, economic power cannot be separated from political power.</p><p>A third problem is the ease by which misinformation can be ``weaponized`` through these giant networks. Facebook attracts most of the criticism, but Google`s YouTube is generating similar problems. A number of research and news reports have shown how easily YouTube users get sucked into conspiracy theories.12 One recent study showed that after watching YouTube conspiracy videos, a significant number of people became skeptical that the earth is round.13</p><p>As long as Facebook and YouTube possess a virtual duopoly over information flows, the only choice for dealing with systematic misinformation flowing through these networks appears to be either requiring that Facebook and YouTube regulate - and therefore censor -- what they consider to be misinformation, or having government do the regulating and censoring. Obviously, neither of these choices is desirable in a democracy. If government does the censoring, democracy would be directly threatened. But democracy would also be threatened if Facebook or Google did the censoring. What`s to prevent them from using their power to suppress political views they disagree with?</p><p>The best alternative would be to end the information duopoly itself. Absent these networks, information (and misinformation) would have to be distributed through a large number of independent channels, without a centralized platform giving them apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach.</p><p>Maintaining competition gets government out of the role of censorship. An analogy would be the Federal Communications Commission, which prohibits common ownership of a full-power broadcast station and daily newspaper if the station`s reach encompasses the newspaper`s city of publication, in order to maintain competition in communication markets.</p><p>The fourth problem is privacy. Big Tech is amassing huge amounts of data about the personal behavior of virtually everyone. The sheer quantity of data will soon become an entry barrier of its own, further entrenching the giants. Facebook`s Mark Zuckerberg predicts that ``Facebook will know every book, film, and song you ever consumed, and its predictive models will tell you what bar to go to when you arrive at a strange city, where the bartender will have your favorite drink waiting.`` Google`s Eric Schmidt says, ``you give us more information about you, about your friends, and ... we don`t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you`ve been. We more or less know what you`re thinking about.``14</p><p>Privacy is a cornerstone of personal freedom. As Senator Lee recognized in 2011,``the combination of behavioral and personal information enables Google to generate consumer data that is unprecedented in scale and scope. These activities raise serious privacy concerns and may be indicative of an important market that is largely unconstrained by competition. Antitrust enforcement may unlock beneficial competition for the protection of user privacy and avert the need for additional privacy regulation.``15</p><p>Which brings us to the fifth problem: The concentration of data, information, and power in a few giant corporations threaten to undermine civil society. As Senator Lee has said, ``free enterprise and civil society operate in the natural human space between the isolated individual and the impersonal state where we live, and love, and flourish . . . where everyone can earn a good living and build a good life . . . where the strong and the vulnerable alike can pursue their happiness, and find it . . . together.``16</p><p>But the Big Tech is undermining civil society. Consider, for example, the nonprofit sector, an essential part of civil society. Google is exercising its power to stifle criticisms coming from independent researchers in that sector. As reported by The New York Times, the New America Foundation, an influential think tank, fired researcher Barry Lynn, a sharp critic of platform monopolies like Google`s. Why? Lynn had posted a congratulatory note to European officials on their Google decision, and called for American antitrust officials to follow suit. Since its founding in 1999, the New America Foundation received more than $21 million from Google (and its parent company, Alphabet) and from the family foundation of Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet who previously served as chairman of New America`s board. According to the Times, Schmidt didn`t like Lynn`s comments and communicated his displeasure to the president of the New America Foundation. She then accused Lynn of ``imperiling the institution as a whole,`` and fired him, along with his staff.17</p><p>Colleges and universities are another important cornerstone of civil society. Big Tech is threatening their independence and integrity as well. The Wall Street Journal reports that Google has quietly financed hundreds of professors at universities such as Harvard and Berkeley to write research papers that help Google defend itself against regulatory challenges to its market dominance -- paying them from $5,000 to $400,000 on a wish-list of topics developed by Google. Google uses the resulting research in courtrooms, regulatory hearings, and congressional hearings. Some professors have allowed Google to see the papers before they are published, Journal. The professors` research papers have not disclosed that Google sought them out, and do not necessarily reveal Google`s backing.18 Big Tech is also undermining civil society by draining communities of their vibrancy and functions. Amazon draws customers away from local and retailers. Google and Facebook take advertising dollars away from local and regional media. Big Tech`s social media platforms drain attention and interactions away social capital within our communities, on which voluntary civil society is built.</p><p>There is no easy answer to these five problems. They have become endemic to life in the twenty-first century. But I believe antitrust enforcement can help mitigate them. The biggest of Big Tech should be broken up, or at least be required to make their proprietary technology and data publicly available and to share their platforms with smaller competitors, and should be barred from further acquisitions. There would be little cost to the economy, since these giant firms rely on innovation rather than economies of scale - and, as noted, they`re likely to be impeding innovation overall.</p><p>It`s Time to Revive Antitrust</p><p>Antitrust is - or should be -- about more than welfare economics. The problems it should be addressing go far beyond helping individual consumers get the best possible deal for themselves.</p><p>Most fundamentally, antitrust is about maintaining a free market. As the late Robert Pitofsky, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, noted: ``Antitrust is a deregulatory philosophy. If you`re going to let the free market work, you`d better protect the free market.``19 Antitrust is also about protecting and fostering civil society - robust communities in which individuals have multiple sources of information, deep connections to one another, roots in local and regional economies, abiding commitments to the institutions they share, and freedom from intimidation, whether from a giant government or giant corporations that know everything there is to know about them.</p><p>Freedom depends on a free enterprise economy and a voluntary civil society. Antitrust enforcement is the key to both. It is time to revive antitrust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200005072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:529H-CX61-JCRM-B10Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3292\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Data Licensing, LLC.

Such scams try to trick people into giving away passwords and other personal information by sending emails that look as if they come from a legitimate bank, retailer or other business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To combat that, 15 major technology and financial companies have formed an organization to design a system for authenticating emails. The new system is called DMARC - short for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance. DMARC builds upon techniques designed to verify that an email actually came from the sender in question. The problem is there are multiple approaches and no standard way of dealing with emails believed to be fake.</p><p>Firm to buy Pep Boys for about $791M</p><p>NEW YORK | The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe &amp; Jack, an auto parts chain founded more than 90 years ago, has agreed to be taken private by the investment firm The Gores Group for about $791 million.

That's down from $174.1 million a year earlier. The company said its results reflected $63.6 million in charges related to workforce restructuring and facility consolidations at properties in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Revenue fell 5 percent to $1.39 billion.</p><p>U.S. expands Jeep Liberty air bag probe</p><p>DETROIT | Federal safety regulators have stepped up their investigation into the Jeep Liberty SUV after 50 people reported they were hurt when the air bags inflated even though the vehicle wasn't involved in a crash.</p><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration started investigating Liberty SUVs made by Chrysler GroupLLC from the 2002 and 2003 model years in September.

Still, the imbalance is on pace to top $1 trillion for the fourth consecutive year, which could be an issue in this year's presidential election.</p><p>The Treasury Department said Monday that the deficit grew by $232 billion in February. That increased the imbalance through the first five months of the budget year to $581 billion, or 9 percent less than the same period in fiscal 2011. The Obama administration expects the deficit will reach $1.3 trillion when the budget year ends on Sept. 30. That would nearly match last year's gap. The government ran a record deficit of $1.41 trillion in 2009 and a $1.29 trillion gap in 2010.</p><p>Feds investigate sticky throttles in Fords</p><p>DETROIT | Federal safety regulators have launched an investigation into sticky accelerators in more than 1.9 million Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans.</p><p>The probe includes cars from the 2001 through 2006 model years. The Taurus and Sable are nearly identical.</p><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has received at least 14 complaints about the problem. No crashes or injuries have been reported. Drivers have said it was difficult to stop the car. Several said they had to shut off the engine or shift into neutral in order to stop. At least two ran red lights before they could bring the cars under control. The safety agency says the cruise control cable may become detached and hold the throttle open.</p><p>Yahoo sues Facebook over 10 patents</p><p>NEW YORK | Yahoo is filing a lawsuit against Facebook over patents, following through on a threat it made last month. Yahoo Inc.said in a court filing Monday that Facebook has infringed 10 of its patents covering advertising, privacy controls and social networking.</p><p>Yahoo threatened to sue Facebook last month, insisting that the social network license its patents. Facebook said it is disappointed in Yahoo and pledges to defend itself against what it calls \"puzzling actions.\"</p><p>The patent claims could cast a spotlight on Facebook's vulnerabilities as the company tries to complete an initial public offering of stock this spring. At the end of 2011, only 56 U.S. patents had been issued to Facebook. That's a relatively small number compared with other big tech companies.</p><p>Exelon closes $7.9B Constellation deal</p><p>CHICAGO | Exelon Corp. said Monday that it has completed its $7.9 billion takeover of Constellation Energy, creating one of the largest competitive power suppliers in the United States. With the completion of the deal Monday, Christopher Crane, who previously served as Exelon's president and chief operating officer, became the combined company's president and CEO. Mayo Shattuck III, Constellation's president and chief executive, was named executive chairman.</p><p>The addition of Baltimore-based Constellation gives Exelon a coast-to-coast presence with about 6.6 million customers and operations in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Canada. The two companies are combining operations immediately.</p><p>- From wire reports</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-1023717977</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:555K-3SB1-JC86-13VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition> The Virginian-Pilot Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>March 13, 2012 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, February 5th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings are in focus this morning. Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results. Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today. Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening. Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&amp;P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact. The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent. The S&amp;P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent. And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq. Big tech did well.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher. Take a look at the European indices. FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent. CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent. And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points. Better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight. It is the lunar holiday. Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year. However, Japan is open. And it was down a fraction.</p><p>It is celebrating the Year of the Pig. How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year. We've got the details there coming up.</p><p>And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight. President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight. Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency. It has never been his preferred option. At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings. It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate. Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion. We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter. Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning. Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address. President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: What's the state of the Trump administration? The state of the Trump administration is chaos. It is sad -- the State of the Union. And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President. I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman it's always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it chaos? I mean walk us -- you're there. You're the minority leader. Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA. We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before. I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating. Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security. What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way? They celebrate status quo. So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean they say that they are for border security. But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him? They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona. You got to El Paso. El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America. So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time. And I think that's what America look for -- common ground. But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you had conversations. How are the conversations going now? Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week? You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY: They've only met one time. And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall. Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before. But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you going to do? I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight. Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible? And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years? That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I hope not. I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics. We can always have a campaign. We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first. And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want. But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing. But that's really not where all her members are. More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that. Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so. But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border. I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego. And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego? It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there. This is what's really backwards in their thinking. You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas. And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it. I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do. Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue. And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I can guarantee you this. If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes. But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do. We've got infrastructure. We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that going to be approved though? I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA. So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY: America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation. Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech. The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name. Democrats are getting political. Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that. I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else. I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us. Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years. We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before. So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others. America is in a point to make the next century ours. The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right. What about the issue around trade? China, for example. A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean. What about the IP issue? Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY: They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process. This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before. And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right. We're finding China for the first time coming to the table. But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal. This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place. You heard us on the program. Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy. Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY: There's areas that it hurts. There're areas that it supports. If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going. But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term. Will we be stronger long-term? Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY: -- 100,000. And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time. I mean this president has put the American worker first. Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going. But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: So this is more than buying more soybeans. This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And I asked the question earlier. If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY: They have a closed society. They still have a communist individual in every business. Government controls the businesses where they go. That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick on your tax plan. Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year. And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Some want to go to 90 percent. The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I don't know. If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Let's hope. Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What were you going to say? I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more. They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it. That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America. Are we moving toward socialism? Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union. We'll see if all of this comes up. Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Be sure to stay tuned to Fox Business today. We will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight. It starts at 7:00 p.m. And then at 8:00 p.m. We've got \"CAVUTO LIVE\". Tomorrow I'll be live in D.C. with highlights from the President's address.</p><p>Also, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in the 7:00 a.m. hour tomorrow morning, live from Washington.</p><p>All that coming up.</p><p>But first, a Twitter fight. Freshmen lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw get into it, trading Twitter barbs over tax policy.</p><p>Then, ringing in the Lunar New Year, millions around the world celebrating the Year of the Pig. We have more of the stunning images.</p><p>Plus details on how Xi Jinping celebrated, right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: They just hit the tape -- Maria. Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate. Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction. Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading. So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close. Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix. It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company. Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning. The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production. The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year. Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas. British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union. In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland. The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th. We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig. It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family. He also tried out riot gear with police. The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning. Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning. We've got the details next up. The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out. Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street. Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue. However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization. He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer. Good to see you -- sir. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION: Hi, Maria. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion. That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria. I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction. And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Eric -- Lindsey Bell here. Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us? That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business. Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER: That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed. But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS. But again, that's a very competitive area. But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating. Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else. There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars. But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad- based. It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be. How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER: Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed. But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow. They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins. But these are competitive areas. Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves. But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that. It just stinks to high heaven. This new -- I'm not beta. I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels. It is great. This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. And it's all about video. We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram. I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL: @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF: I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday. Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network. He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way. Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.</p><p>What a story over the last 15 years. Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?</p><p>SCHIFFER: Oh is this to me? Look, I think that it's an incredible story. I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER: That they caused. But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people. I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They can't say they didn't sell our data. They sold our data. They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Absolutely. Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story. We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers. Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning. It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media. What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter. More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills. Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning. It is Tuesday, February 5th. Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Viacom released mixed earnings this morning. The company beating on earnings per share but missed on revenue. The stock is down 1-1/2 percent right now. Disney and Snap among the other names reporting later today. We will bring you the very latest on earnings coming up.</p><p>The markets are expected to trade higher this morning certainly at the open. Futures indicating a gain of about 87 points on the Dow Industrials, a third of a percent. S&amp;P is up 5-1/4 and the NASDAQ is up 20 points, a third of a percent.</p><p>This after a great day yesterday for stocks, the indices finishing at the highest close in two months with the Dow Industrials picking up 175 points. Three-quarters of one percent. The S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ was up 83 points, that was better than one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, gains across the board there as well. The FT-100 up about 90 points -- 97 points higher, 1-1/3 percent higher. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up one percent, 48 points higher and the DAX Index in Germany up 122 points, better than one percent.</p><p>Asian markets most of the markets closed in celebration of the Lunar New Year. It is the Chinese New Year and as you see all markets were closed with the exception of Japan. It was down a fraction.</p><p>We're on countdown mode to the State of the Union tonight.

The state of the Trump administration is chaos.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fox Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight. It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern. And we will be live throughout the speech and after.</p><p>Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State. I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.</p><p>Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl. The fallout coming up.</p><p>Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning. Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well. All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union. President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there. Good to see you both ladies. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION: Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush. Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this. What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN: Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it. It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process. That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink. So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump. But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process. But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president. The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good. So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing. Talk about the tax cut. We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this. I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade. American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER: Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade. When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER: And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And employment grew at 1.7 percent. The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be. And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table. That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what you said earlier was so smart. He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going. You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF: Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left. It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days. How would you take that as a speech writer? What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN: Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery. If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well. But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room. One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands. It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what about all these guess? I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address. Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake. Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal? Asking for a friend. Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate. The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though. What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners. You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math. She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending. But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it. We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER: Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying. But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR: I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER: Exactly right. If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class. You need a vat. You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF: Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right.</p><p>WOLF: That is Republicans and Democrats going there. That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right.</p><p>WOLF: So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER: You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes. The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on. Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent. Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right. And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is. Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies. Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address. Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour. Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states. They're leaving in droves. We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Still talking about this, Maria. It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday. The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e- mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted. And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case. If we could, the facts were not there, period. Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case. Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000. The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country. One of the biggest winners is Miami. Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win. I guess it just doesn't get old. Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown. More than a million fans are expected. The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way. The team tweeted out this image. It shows -- it shows five championship trophies. You can see them right there on the plane's tail. They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida. So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI: A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I lot of fun. I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states. I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen. What's your take on this? Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile. It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion. Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York. Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I feel like that's what's happening in Texas. I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure. I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets. Slack makes it official yesterday, filing. We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market. Slack confirmed it is ready to go public. And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley. And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY: Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong. We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now. So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else? What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY: Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY: Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting? Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork. You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations. But where do you think these come out? Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY: I think so. I mean, the foundations are really strong. So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks. Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up. Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal. So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF: Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY: That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY: Well, there's a race going on. Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first. Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again. They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding. Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown. So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY: They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go. I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file. But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF: Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY: You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA: Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY: I think it's a handful. We'll have a handful of direct listing. These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital. But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public. So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there. Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY: Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling. You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks? How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY: I think it is. You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game. If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned. But these companies are going to be around for the while. They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jackie, thank you so much. Jackie Kelley. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019020502cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBY-YH71-DXH2-6433-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001VM7</classCode><className>VIACOM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings are in focus this morning.  Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results.  Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today.  Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening.  Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&amp;P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.</p><p>This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact.  The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent.  And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq.  Big tech did well.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher.  Take a look at the European indices.  FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent.  CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points.  Better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight.  It is the lunar holiday.  Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year.  However, Japan is open.  And it was down a fraction.</p><p>It is celebrating the Year of the Pig.  How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year.  We've got the details there coming up.</p><p>And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight.  Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency.  It has never been his preferred option.  At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings.  It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate.  Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion.  We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address.  President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.  It is sad -- the State of the Union.  And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President.  I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it chaos?  I mean walk us -- you're there.  You're the minority leader.  Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA.  We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before.  I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security.  What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way?  They celebrate status quo.  So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean they say that they are for border security.  But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him?  They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona.  You got to El Paso.  El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America.  So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time.  And I think that's what America look for -- common ground.  But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you had conversations.  How are the conversations going now?  Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week?  You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've only met one time.  And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall.  Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before.  But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do?  I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight.  Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible?  And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years?  That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I hope not.  I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics.  We can always have a campaign.  We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first.  And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want.  But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing.  But that's really not where all her members are.  More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that.  Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so.  But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border.  I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego.  And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego?  It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there.  This is what's really backwards in their thinking.  You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas.  And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it.  I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do.  Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue.  And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I can guarantee you this.  If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes.  But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do.  We've got infrastructure.  We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that going to be approved though?  I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA.  So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation.  Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech.  The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name.  Democrats are getting political.  Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that.  I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else.  I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us.  Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.  We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before.  So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others.  America is in a point to make the next century ours.  The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right.  What about the issue around trade?  China, for example.  A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean.  What about the IP issue?  Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process.  This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before.  And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right.  We're finding China for the first time coming to the table.  But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal.  This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place.  You heard us on the program.  Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy.  Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  There's areas that it hurts.  There're areas that it supports.  If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going.  But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term.  Will we be stronger long-term?  Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time.  I mean this president has put the American worker first.  Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going.  But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So this is more than buying more soybeans.  This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And I asked the question earlier.  If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They have a closed society.  They still have a communist individual in every business.  Government controls the businesses where they go.  That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on your tax plan.  Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year.  And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Some want to go to 90 percent.  The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't know.  If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Let's hope.  Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?  I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more.  They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it.  That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America.  Are we moving toward socialism?  Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union.  We'll see if all of this comes up.  Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Be sure to stay tuned to Fox Business today.  We will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight.  It starts at 7:00 p.m.  And then at 8:00 p.m.  We've got \"CAVUTO LIVE\".  Tomorrow I'll be live in D.C. with highlights from the President's address.</p><p>Also, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in the 7:00 a.m. hour tomorrow morning, live from Washington.</p><p>All that coming up.</p><p>But first, a Twitter fight.  Freshmen lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw get into it, trading Twitter barbs over tax policy.</p><p>Then, ringing in the Lunar New Year, millions around the world celebrating the Year of the Pig.  We have more of the stunning images.</p><p>Plus details on how Xi Jinping celebrated, right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They just hit the tape -- Maria.  Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate.  Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction.  Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading.  So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close.  Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix.  It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company.  Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning.  The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production.  The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year.  Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union.  In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland.  The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker.  The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th.  We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig.  It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family.  He also tried out riot gear with police.  The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning.  Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning.  We've got the details next up.  The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out.  Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street.  Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue.  However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization.  He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION:  Hi, Maria.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion.  That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria.  I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction.  And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Eric -- Lindsey Bell here.  Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us?  That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business.  Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed.  But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS.  But again, that's a very competitive area.  But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating.  Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else.  There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars.  But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based.  It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be.  How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed.  But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow.  They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins.  But these are competitive areas.  Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves.  But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:   Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that.  It just stinks to high heaven.  This new -- I'm not beta.  I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels.  It is great.  This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  And it's all about video.  We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram.  I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL:  @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday.  Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network.  He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way.  Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.</p><p>What a story over the last 15 years.  Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Oh is this to me?  Look, I think that it's an incredible story.  I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That they caused.  But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people.  I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't say they didn't sell our data.  They sold our data.  They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Absolutely.  Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story.  We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers.  Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media.  What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter.  More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills.  Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning.  It is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Viacom released mixed earnings this morning.  The company beating on earnings per share but missed on revenue.  The stock is down 1-1/2 percent right now.  Disney and Snap among the other names reporting later today.  We will bring you the very latest on earnings coming up.</p><p>The markets are expected to trade higher this morning certainly at the open.  Futures indicating a gain of about 87 points on the Dow Industrials, a third of a percent.  S&amp;P is up 5-1/4 and the NASDAQ is up 20 points, a third of a percent.</p><p>This after a great day yesterday for stocks, the indices finishing at the highest close in two months with the Dow Industrials picking up 175 points. Three-quarters of one percent.  The S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ was up 83 points, that was better than one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, gains across the board there as well.  The FT-100 up about 90 points -- 97 points higher, 1-1/3 percent higher.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up one percent, 48 points higher and the DAX Index in Germany up 122 points, better than one percent.</p><p>Asian markets most of the markets closed in celebration of the Lunar New Year.  It is the Chinese New Year and as you see all markets were closed with the exception of Japan.  It was down a fraction.</p><p>We're on countdown mode to the State of the Union tonight.

It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern.  And we will be live throughout the speech and after.</p><p>Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State.  I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.</p><p>Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl.  The fallout coming up.</p><p>Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well.  All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union.  President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there.  Good to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION:  Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush.  Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this.  What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it.  It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process.  That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink.  So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump.  But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process.  But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president.  The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good.  So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing.  Talk about the tax cut.  We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this.  I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade.  American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade.  When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And employment grew at 1.7 percent.  The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be.  And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table.  That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what you said earlier was so smart.  He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going.  You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left.  It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days.  How would you take that as a speech writer?  What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery.  If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well.  But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room.  One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands.  It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about all these guess?  I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address.  Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake.  Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal?  Asking for a friend.  Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate.  The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though.  What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners.  You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math.  She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending.  But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it.  We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying.  But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR:  I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class.  You need a vat.  You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF:  Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That is Republicans and Democrats going there.  That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER:  You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes.  The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on.  Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent.  Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is.  Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address.  Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour.  Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states.  They're leaving in droves.  We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Still talking about this, Maria.  It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday.  The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted.  And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case.  If we could, the facts were not there, period.  Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case.  Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000.  The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country.  One of the biggest winners is Miami.  Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win.  I guess it just doesn't get old.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown.  More than a million fans are expected.  The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way.  The team tweeted out this image.  It shows -- it shows five championship trophies.  You can see them right there on the plane's tail.  They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida.  So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I lot of fun.  I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states.  I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen.  What's your take on this?  Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile.  It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion.  Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York.  Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel like that's what's happening in Texas.  I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure.  I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets.  Slack makes it official yesterday, filing.  We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market.  Slack confirmed it is ready to go public.  And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley.  And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong.  We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now.  So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else?  What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY:  Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY:  Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting?  Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork.  You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations.  But where do you think these come out?  Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think so.  I mean, the foundations are really strong.  So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks.  Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up.  Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal.  So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF:  Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY:  That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY:  Well, there's a race going on.  Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first.  Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again.  They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding.  Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown.  So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY:  They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go.  I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file.  But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF:  Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY:  You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA:  Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it's a handful.  We'll have a handful of direct listing.  These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital.  But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public.  So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there.  Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling.  You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks?  How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it is.  You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game.  If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned.  But these companies are going to be around for the while.  They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jackie, thank you so much.  Jackie Kelley.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2176330732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCB-D7K1-JBHT-D490-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

It has never been his preferred option.  At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings.  It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate.  Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion.  We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address.  President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.  It is sad -- the State of the Union.  And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President.  I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it chaos?  I mean walk us -- you're there.  You're the minority leader.  Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA.  We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before.  I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security.  What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way?  They celebrate status quo.  So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean they say that they are for border security.  But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him?  They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona.  You got to El Paso.  El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America.  So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time.  And I think that's what America look for -- common ground.  But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you had conversations.  How are the conversations going now?  Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week?  You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've only met one time.  And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall.  Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before.  But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do?  I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight.  Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible?  And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years?  That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I hope not.  I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics.  We can always have a campaign.  We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first.  And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want.  But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing.  But that's really not where all her members are.  More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that.  Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so.  But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border.  I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego.  And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego?  It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there.  This is what's really backwards in their thinking.  You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas.  And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it.  I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do.  Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue.  And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I can guarantee you this.  If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes.  But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do.  We've got infrastructure.  We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that going to be approved though?  I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA.  So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation.  Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech.  The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name.  Democrats are getting political.  Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that.  I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else.  I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us.  Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.  We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before.  So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others.  America is in a point to make the next century ours.  The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right.  What about the issue around trade?  China, for example.  A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean.  What about the IP issue?  Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process.  This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before.  And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right.  We're finding China for the first time coming to the table.  But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal.  This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place.  You heard us on the program.  Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy.  Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  There's areas that it hurts.  There're areas that it supports.  If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going.  But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term.  Will we be stronger long-term?  Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time.  I mean this president has put the American worker first.  Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going.  But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So this is more than buying more soybeans.  This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And I asked the question earlier.  If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They have a closed society.  They still have a communist individual in every business.  Government controls the businesses where they go.  That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on your tax plan.  Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year.  And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Some want to go to 90 percent.  The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't know.  If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Let's hope.  Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?  I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more.  They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it.  That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America.  Are we moving toward socialism?  Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union.  We'll see if all of this comes up.  Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.

Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They just hit the tape -- Maria.  Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate.  Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction.  Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading.  So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close.  Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix.  It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company.  Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning.  The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production.  The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year.  Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union.  In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland.  The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker.  The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th.  We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig.  It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family.  He also tried out riot gear with police.  The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning.  Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning.  We've got the details next up.  The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out.  Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street.  Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue.  However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization.  He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION:  Hi, Maria.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion.  That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria.  I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction.  And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Eric -- Lindsey Bell here.  Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us?  That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business.  Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed.  But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS.  But again, that's a very competitive area.  But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating.  Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else.  There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars.  But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based.  It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be.  How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed.  But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow.  They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins.  But these are competitive areas.  Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves.  But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:   Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that.  It just stinks to high heaven.  This new -- I'm not beta.  I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels.  It is great.  This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  And it's all about video.  We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram.  I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL:  @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday.  Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network.  He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way.  Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.</p><p>What a story over the last 15 years.  Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Oh is this to me?  Look, I think that it's an incredible story.  I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That they caused.  But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people.  I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't say they didn't sell our data.  They sold our data.  They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Absolutely.  Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story.  We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers.  Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media.  What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter.  More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills.  Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning.

The fallout coming up.</p><p>Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well.  All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union.  President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there.  Good to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION:  Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush.  Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this.  What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it.  It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process.  That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink.  So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump.  But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process.  But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president.  The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good.  So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing.  Talk about the tax cut.  We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this.  I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade.  American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade.  When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And employment grew at 1.7 percent.  The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be.  And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table.  That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what you said earlier was so smart.  He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going.  You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left.  It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days.  How would you take that as a speech writer?  What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery.  If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well.  But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room.  One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands.  It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about all these guess?  I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address.  Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake.  Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal?  Asking for a friend.  Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate.  The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though.  What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners.  You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math.  She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending.  But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it.  We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying.  But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR:  I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class.  You need a vat.  You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF:  Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That is Republicans and Democrats going there.  That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER:  You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes.  The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on.  Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent.  Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is.  Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address.  Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour.  Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states.  They're leaving in droves.  We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Still talking about this, Maria.  It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday.  The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted.  And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case.  If we could, the facts were not there, period.  Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case.  Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000.  The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country.  One of the biggest winners is Miami.  Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win.  I guess it just doesn't get old.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown.  More than a million fans are expected.  The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way.  The team tweeted out this image.  It shows -- it shows five championship trophies.  You can see them right there on the plane's tail.  They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida.  So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I lot of fun.  I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states.  I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen.  What's your take on this?  Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile.  It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion.  Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York.  Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel like that's what's happening in Texas.  I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure.  I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets.  Slack makes it official yesterday, filing.  We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market.  Slack confirmed it is ready to go public.  And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley.  And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong.  We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now.  So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else?  What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY:  Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY:  Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting?  Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork.  You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations.  But where do you think these come out?  Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think so.  I mean, the foundations are really strong.  So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks.  Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up.  Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal.  So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF:  Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY:  That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY:  Well, there's a race going on.  Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first.  Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again.  They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding.  Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown.  So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY:  They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go.  I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file.  But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF:  Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY:  You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA:  Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it's a handful.  We'll have a handful of direct listing.  These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital.  But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public.  So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there.  Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling.  You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks?  How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it is.  You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game.  If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned.  But these companies are going to be around for the while.  They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jackie, thank you so much.  Jackie Kelley.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2176330732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-B721-JBHT-D44P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings are in focus this morning.  Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results.  Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today.  Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening.  Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&amp;P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.</p><p>This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact.  The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent.  And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq.  Big tech did well.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher.  Take a look at the European indices.  FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent.  CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points.  Better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight.  It is the lunar holiday.  Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year.  However, Japan is open.  And it was down a fraction.</p><p>It is celebrating the Year of the Pig.  How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year.  We've got the details there coming up.</p><p>And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight.  Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency.  It has never been his preferred option.  At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings.  It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate.  Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion.  We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address.  President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.  It is sad -- the State of the Union.  And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President.  I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it chaos?  I mean walk us -- you're there.  You're the minority leader.  Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA.  We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before.  I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security.  What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way?  They celebrate status quo.  So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean they say that they are for border security.  But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him?  They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona.  You got to El Paso.  El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America.  So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time.  And I think that's what America look for -- common ground.  But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you had conversations.  How are the conversations going now?  Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week?  You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've only met one time.  And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall.  Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before.  But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do?  I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight.  Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible?  And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years?  That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I hope not.  I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics.  We can always have a campaign.  We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first.  And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want.  But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing.  But that's really not where all her members are.  More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that.  Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so.  But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border.  I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego.  And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego?  It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there.  This is what's really backwards in their thinking.  You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas.  And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it.  I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do.  Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue.  And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I can guarantee you this.  If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes.  But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do.  We've got infrastructure.  We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that going to be approved though?  I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA.  So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation.  Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech.  The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name.  Democrats are getting political.  Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that.  I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else.  I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us.  Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.  We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before.  So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others.  America is in a point to make the next century ours.  The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right.  What about the issue around trade?  China, for example.  A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean.  What about the IP issue?  Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process.  This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before.  And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right.  We're finding China for the first time coming to the table.  But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal.  This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place.  You heard us on the program.  Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy.  Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  There's areas that it hurts.  There're areas that it supports.  If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going.  But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term.  Will we be stronger long-term?  Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time.  I mean this president has put the American worker first.  Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going.  But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So this is more than buying more soybeans.  This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And I asked the question earlier.  If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They have a closed society.  They still have a communist individual in every business.  Government controls the businesses where they go.  That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on your tax plan.  Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year.  And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Some want to go to 90 percent.  The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't know.  If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Let's hope.  Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?  I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more.  They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it.  That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America.  Are we moving toward socialism?  Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union.  We'll see if all of this comes up.  Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Be sure to stay tuned to Fox Business today.  We will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight.  It starts at 7:00 p.m.  And then at 8:00 p.m.  We've got \"CAVUTO LIVE\".  Tomorrow I'll be live in D.C. with highlights from the President's address.</p><p>Also, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in the 7:00 a.m. hour tomorrow morning, live from Washington.</p><p>All that coming up.</p><p>But first, a Twitter fight.  Freshmen lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw get into it, trading Twitter barbs over tax policy.</p><p>Then, ringing in the Lunar New Year, millions around the world celebrating the Year of the Pig.  We have more of the stunning images.</p><p>Plus details on how Xi Jinping celebrated, right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They just hit the tape -- Maria.  Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate.  Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction.  Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading.  So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close.  Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix.  It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company.  Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning.  The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production.  The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year.  Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union.  In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland.  The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker.  The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th.  We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig.  It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family.  He also tried out riot gear with police.  The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning.  Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning.  We've got the details next up.  The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out.  Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street.  Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue.  However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization.  He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION:  Hi, Maria.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion.  That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria.  I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction.  And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Eric -- Lindsey Bell here.  Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us?  That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business.  Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed.  But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS.  But again, that's a very competitive area.  But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating.  Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else.  There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars.  But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based.  It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be.  How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed.  But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow.  They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins.  But these are competitive areas.  Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves.  But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:   Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that.  It just stinks to high heaven.  This new -- I'm not beta.  I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels.  It is great.  This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  And it's all about video.  We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram.  I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL:  @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday.  Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network.  He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way.

Look, I think that it's an incredible story.  I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That they caused.  But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people.  I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't say they didn't sell our data.  They sold our data.  They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Absolutely.  Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story.  We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers.  Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media.  What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter.  More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills.  Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning.

It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern.  And we will be live throughout the speech and after.</p><p>Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State.

Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well.  All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union.  President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there.  Good to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION:  Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush.  Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this.  What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it.  It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process.  That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink.  So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump.  But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process.  But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president.  The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good.  So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing.  Talk about the tax cut.  We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this.  I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade.  American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade.  When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And employment grew at 1.7 percent.  The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be.  And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table.  That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what you said earlier was so smart.  He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going.  You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left.  It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days.  How would you take that as a speech writer?  What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery.  If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well.  But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room.  One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands.  It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about all these guess?  I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address.  Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake.  Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal?  Asking for a friend.  Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate.  The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though.  What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners.  You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math.  She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending.  But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it.  We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying.  But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR:  I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class.  You need a vat.  You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF:  Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That is Republicans and Democrats going there.  That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER:  You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes.  The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on.  Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent.  Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is.  Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address.  Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour.  Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states.  They're leaving in droves.  We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Still talking about this, Maria.  It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday.  The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted.  And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case.  If we could, the facts were not there, period.  Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case.  Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000.  The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country.  One of the biggest winners is Miami.  Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win.  I guess it just doesn't get old.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown.  More than a million fans are expected.  The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way.  The team tweeted out this image.  It shows -- it shows five championship trophies.  You can see them right there on the plane's tail.  They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida.  So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I lot of fun.  I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states.  I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen.  What's your take on this?  Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile.  It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion.  Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York.  Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel like that's what's happening in Texas.  I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure.  I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets.  Slack makes it official yesterday, filing.  We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market.  Slack confirmed it is ready to go public.  And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley.  And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong.  We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now.  So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else?  What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY:  Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY:  Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting?  Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork.  You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations.  But where do you think these come out?  Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think so.  I mean, the foundations are really strong.  So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks.  Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up.  Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal.  So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF:  Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY:  That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY:  Well, there's a race going on.  Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first.  Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again.  They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding.  Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown.  So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY:  They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go.  I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file.  But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF:  Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY:  You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA:  Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it's a handful.  We'll have a handful of direct listing.  These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital.  But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public.  So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there.  Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling.  You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks?  How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it is.  You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game.  If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned.  But these companies are going to be around for the while.  They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jackie, thank you so much.  Jackie Kelley.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2176330732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF7-BYG1-DY0W-43RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, February 5th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings are in focus this morning.  Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results.  Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today.  Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening.  Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&amp;P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.</p><p>This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact.  The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent.  And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq.  Big tech did well.</p><p>Global markets this morning mostly higher.  Take a look at the European indices.  FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent.  CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points.  Better than 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight.  It is the lunar holiday.  Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year.  However, Japan is open.  And it was down a fraction.</p><p>It is celebrating the Year of the Pig.  How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year.  We've got the details there coming up.</p><p>And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight.  President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight.  Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency.  It has never been his preferred option.  At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All the details coming up.</p><p>And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings.  It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate.  Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion.  We will take a look at the stock coming up.</p><p>Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address.  President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.</p><p>It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.  It is sad -- the State of the Union.  And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President.  I hope he changes in the next two years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman it's always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it chaos?  I mean walk us -- you're there.  You're the minority leader.  Tell us what government looks like today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA.  We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before.  I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.</p><p>The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating.  Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security.  What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way?  They celebrate status quo.  So it does not solve the DACA problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean they say that they are for border security.  But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.</p><p>So is this all just resist because they hate him?  They want him out?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona.  You got to El Paso.  El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America.  So there's an ability to do this</p><p>But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.</p><p>And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time.  And I think that's what America look for -- common ground.  But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you had conversations.  How are the conversations going now?  Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week?  You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've only met one time.  And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall.  Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before.  But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to do?  I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight.  Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.</p><p>Is a compromise even feasible?  And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years?  That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I hope not.  I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics.  We can always have a campaign.  We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first.  And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work</p><p>Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want.  But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing.  But that's really not where all her members are.  More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that.  Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think so.  But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border.  I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.</p><p>California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego.  And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego?  It's pretty obvious, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there.  This is what's really backwards in their thinking.  You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas.  And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it.  I think everybody in America believes that.</p><p>The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do.  Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue.  And the Democrats are saying no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I can guarantee you this.  If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes.  But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.</p><p>We've got so much more to do.  We've got infrastructure.  We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that going to be approved though?  I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA.  So what happens if you can't ratify that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation.  Why would they oppose that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech.  The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name.  Democrats are getting political.  Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.</p><p>Tell us about that.  I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else.  I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.</p><p>We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us.  Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.  We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.</p><p>We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before.  So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others.  America is in a point to make the next century ours.  The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right.  What about the issue around trade?  China, for example.  A lot of people want to see a deal done.</p><p>But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean.  What about the IP issue?  Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process.  This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before.  And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.</p><p>And I think this President is right.  We're finding China for the first time coming to the table.  But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal.  This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place.  You heard us on the program.  Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy.  Has it hurt the economy?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  There's areas that it hurts.  There're areas that it supports.  If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going.  But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term.  Will we be stronger long-term?  Will there be more American jobs?</p><p>Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes -- 304,000.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCCARTHY:  -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time.  I mean this president has put the American worker first.  Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.</p><p>So we're stronger where we're going.  But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So this is more than buying more soybeans.  This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. And I asked the question earlier.  If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They have a closed society.  They still have a communist individual in every business.  Government controls the businesses where they go.  That's not the world we look to for freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on your tax plan.  Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year.  And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Some want to go to 90 percent.  The understanding here --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would that ever pass?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't know.  If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President would veto it.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Let's hope.  Yes, he would very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What were you going to say?  I'm sorry.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more.  They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it.  That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America.  Are we moving toward socialism?  Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?</p><p>I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union.  We'll see if all of this comes up.  Good to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.</p><p>Be sure to stay tuned to Fox Business today.  We will have live coverage of the President's State of the Union tonight.  It starts at 7:00 p.m.  And then at 8:00 p.m.  We've got \"CAVUTO LIVE\".  Tomorrow I'll be live in D.C. with highlights from the President's address.</p><p>Also, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo in the 7:00 a.m. hour tomorrow morning, live from Washington.</p><p>All that coming up.</p><p>But first, a Twitter fight.  Freshmen lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw get into it, trading Twitter barbs over tax policy.</p><p>Then, ringing in the Lunar New Year, millions around the world celebrating the Year of the Pig.  We have more of the stunning images.</p><p>Plus details on how Xi Jinping celebrated, right here.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They just hit the tape -- Maria.  Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate.  Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.</p><p>Let's take a look at reaction.  Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading.  So that is a stock you want to watch today.</p><p>Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close.  Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix.  It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company.  Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.</p><p>Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning.  The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production.  The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year.  Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.</p><p>Let's go overseas.  British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union.  In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland.  The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker.  The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th.  We'll see if that happens.</p><p>And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig.  It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family.  He also tried out riot gear with police.  The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you Lauren.</p><p>Coming up earnings are in focus this morning.  Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning.  We've got the details next up.  The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>And then the force is strong with these two, check them out.  Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street.  Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue.  However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.</p><p>Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization.  He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION:  Hi, Maria.  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion.  That was double the same period a year ago.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria.  I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.</p><p>So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction.  And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Eric -- Lindsey Bell here.  Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us?  That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business.  Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed.  But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS.  But again, that's a very competitive area.  But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating.  Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else.  There's a chase for content.</p><p>And then on the R&amp;D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars.  But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.</p><p>So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based.  It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be.  How do you see it?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.</p><p>It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed.  But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow.  They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.</p><p>And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins.  But these are competitive areas.  Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.</p><p>So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves.  But we don't have full clarity on all the details.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  What a growth story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:   Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that.  It just stinks to high heaven.  This new -- I'm not beta.  I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels.  It is great.  This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You're right.  And it's all about video.  We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram.  I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.</p><p>Are you on Instagram?</p><p>BELL:  @LCBell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Are you on Instagram?</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday.  Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network.  He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society.\"</p><p>So they've come along way.  Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.</p><p>What a story over the last 15 years.  Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Oh is this to me?  Look, I think that it's an incredible story.  I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  That they caused.  But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people.  I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.</p><p>The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They can't say they didn't sell our data.  They sold our data.  They sold us out, let's face it.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Absolutely.  Of course they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eric -- thank you so much today.</p><p>I mean it's an incredible story.  We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers.  Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  It's good to see you, sir.</p><p>SCHIFFER:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media.  What they said, next up.</p><p>Then, heading south, not just for winter.  More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills.  Wait until you see the numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning.  It is Tuesday, February 5th.  Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Viacom released mixed earnings this morning.  The company beating on earnings per share but missed on revenue.  The stock is down 1-1/2 percent right now.  Disney and Snap among the other names reporting later today.  We will bring you the very latest on earnings coming up.</p><p>The markets are expected to trade higher this morning certainly at the open.  Futures indicating a gain of about 87 points on the Dow Industrials, a third of a percent.  S&amp;P is up 5-1/4 and the NASDAQ is up 20 points, a third of a percent.</p><p>This after a great day yesterday for stocks, the indices finishing at the highest close in two months with the Dow Industrials picking up 175 points. Three-quarters of one percent.  The S&amp;P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ was up 83 points, that was better than one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, gains across the board there as well.  The FT-100 up about 90 points -- 97 points higher, 1-1/3 percent higher.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up one percent, 48 points higher and the DAX Index in Germany up 122 points, better than one percent.</p><p>Asian markets most of the markets closed in celebration of the Lunar New Year.  It is the Chinese New Year and as you see all markets were closed with the exception of Japan.  It was down a fraction.</p><p>We're on countdown mode to the State of the Union tonight.  The president's expected to call for unity in tonight's address.  After the recent government shutdown over border wall funding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, DONALD TRUMP ADMINISTRATION:  He's calling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, c-o-m-i-t-y and also compromise.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  What's the state of the Trump administration?  The state of the Trump administration is chaos.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight.  It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern.  And we will be live throughout the speech and after.</p><p>Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State.  I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.</p><p>Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl.  The fallout coming up.</p><p>Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning.  Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well.  All those details coming up.</p><p>But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union.  President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there.  Good to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION:  Of course.</p><p>JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush.  Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this.  What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it.  It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.</p><p>I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process.  That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink.  So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump.  But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process.  But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president.  The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.</p><p>But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good.  So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing.  Talk about the tax cut.  We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this.  I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade.  American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Competitiveness.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.</p><p>Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade.  When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And Dagen --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And employment grew at 1.7 percent.  The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be.  And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table.  That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because that will hurt investment in the venter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what you said earlier was so smart.  He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going.  You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Is Jennifer still on?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.</p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left.  It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days.  How would you take that as a speech writer?  What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery.  If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well.  But we probably don't remember a single line.</p><p>What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room.  One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands.  It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about all these guess?  I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address.  Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.</p><p>Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake.  Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal?  Asking for a friend.  Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate.  The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though.  What's your reaction to this, Mattie?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners.  You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math.  She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending.  But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it.  We know that's simply not the case.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Off about.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying.  But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's also --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.</p><p>DUPPLR:  I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's not enough money.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.  If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class.  You need a vat.  You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.</p><p>WOLF:  Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  That is Republicans and Democrats going there.  That they want to see a tax on the rich.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that President Trump once supported that idea.</p><p>DUPPLER:  You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes.  The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on.  Frankly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent.  Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is.  Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.</p><p>And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address.  Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour.  Join us for that special interview tomorrow.</p><p>First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states.  They're leaving in droves.  We've got the details next up.</p><p>Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation.  Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Still talking about this, Maria.  It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday.  The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI:  There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted.  And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case.  If we could, the facts were not there, period.  Full stop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case.  Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000.  The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country.  One of the biggest winners is Miami.  Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.</p><p>Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win.  I guess it just doesn't get old.  Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown.  More than a million fans are expected.  The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way.  The team tweeted out this image.  It shows -- it shows five championship trophies.  You can see them right there on the plane's tail.  They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.</p><p>And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida.  So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of stories there.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I lot of fun.  I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states.  I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen.  What's your take on this?  Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile.  It will go where it's treated best.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion.  Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.</p><p>So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York.  Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel like that's what's happening in Texas.  I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure.  I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.</p><p>First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets.  Slack makes it official yesterday, filing.  We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market.  Slack confirmed it is ready to go public.  And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.  The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.</p><p>Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley.  And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong.  We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now.  So, really, really robust.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else?  What are the big ones?</p><p>KELLEY:  Lots of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Airbnb.</p><p>KELLEY:  Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting?  Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork.  You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations.  But where do you think these come out?  Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think so.  I mean, the foundations are really strong.  So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks.  Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up.  Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal.  So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.</p><p>WOLF:  Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?</p><p>KELLEY:  That's a very good question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.</p><p>KELLEY:  Well, there's a race going on.  Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first.  Everybody wants to be first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again.  They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding.  Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown.  So, what's your take on that?</p><p>KELLEY:  They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go.  I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file.  But there are companies pushing through right now.</p><p>WOLF:  Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.</p><p>KELLEY:  You have a direct listing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like Slack.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA:  Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it's a handful.  We'll have a handful of direct listing.  These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital.  But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public.  So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there.  Has that changed?</p><p>KELLEY:  Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling.  You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.</p><p>But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks?  How do they perform after the IPO?</p><p>KELLEY:  I think it is.  You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game.  If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned.  But these companies are going to be around for the while.  They're very big and disruptive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jackie, thank you so much.  Jackie Kelley.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2176330732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W58-13H1-JBHT-D09F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Hi, everybody. Thanks for being here. I'm Maria Bartiromo. We're coming to you live, once again, from our Nation's Capital. It is Wednesday, January 31st. Your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast: President Trump delivers in his first State of the Union Address. He took an optimistic tone calling on the country to come together and touted his economic achievements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This in fact is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So, to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President also laid out an aggressive agenda for his second year in office focusing on immigration, on trade, and the war on terror. The highlights from his speech coming up this morning. Markets in focus once again after a huge sell-off on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing at its lows, down 362 points yesterday, 1-1/3 percent, that is the worst decline since May. The NASDAQ down almost a percent, 64 point high -- lower yesterday. After back-to-back losses for the Dow, the S&amp;P, Futures this morning, pointing to a bit of a bounce, a rebound of sorts. Dow Industrials expected to be up at the open this morning about 80 points, a third of a percent. NASDAQ also higher by a quarter of a percent. We are looking at markets higher across the board.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed performance, FT-100 is down a fraction but the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent. And the DAX Index in Germany is up a quarter of a percent. Check Asian markets overnight, mixed performance there, I should see, the markets were largely lower with the exception of Hong Kong which was up almost one percent on the Hang Seng Index.</p><p>Release the memo: another step closer, President Trump is supporting the move when he was caught on a hot mic after the State of the Union Address - - we'll tell you what was said. Earnings in focus on Wall Street, once again, this is the busiest week so far for fourth-quarter numbers. Dow components Boeing and AT&amp;T due to report this morning. Investors are eyeing big tech though with Facebook and Microsoft, after the close tonight, we will preview all of the above.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook taking a stand on cryptocurrency. Why the company is banning all advertising for Bitcoin and its competitors, coming up. Plus, a rare lunar event not seen in 150 years. You will be able to see it on this program. Find out when and how you can see the super blue blood moon. All the stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to talk about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell and Townhall.com political editor and Fox News Contributor, Guy Benson. Great to see you.</p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big day. What'd you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You want to go first?</p><p>BENSON: Look, I thought he did a pretty good job. I thought that his message hit the notes that it needed to. I think the Democrats didn't do themselves a lot of favors by sitting on their hands looking grumpy about everything the entire night.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've been working on my Nancy Pelosi imitation.</p><p>BENSON: Oh, can we see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: As my father would say, why did she have her nose out of joint the entire speech? She looked like the church lady, right? It's true. When she was biting the inside of her mouth, but I guess --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was pretty incredible. I mean, I was actually sitting in the chamber watching from that vantage point and it was so stark to watch, half the room not getting up. They refused to stand up even when he spoke about the military, spoke about, you know, the crises in terms of drug overdose, they wouldn't get up.</p><p>BENSON: Yes. And it's not unusual for half the chamber to sit and half the chamber to stand on controversial lines and controversial policies. That's a long-standing tradition. I mean, look at them. But this was -- when Trump was going through and reciting chapter and verse, unambiguously good news for the American people, the Democrats were just glowering.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He really built on the speech in Davos with a message of unwavering optimism in this country, in our people and then the road ahead and in our future, and I think that was -- that was how I felt walking away from it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very optimistic.</p><p>BENSON: And, you know, Maria, I can sometimes be critical of this President. I'm not always a huge fan of his, but I'm sitting, watching the speech in my living room, I'm watching the Democrats' reaction, thinking there's a disconnect right now between the people in that room who are Democrats and even average Americans who might be Democrats and the polling is bearing that out this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I took notes throughout the entire speech, and I didn't look at Twitter once. I didn't want to -- I wanted my opinion or feeling about it to be completely unvarnished, and I was literally shocked at the takeaway by my liberal friends and people here in the media.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to talk more about that, that's a really great point. Joining the conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise is with us this morning. Georgia's Senator David Perdue is with us, along with former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. The Trump organization, executive vice president, and the president's son, Eric Trump is here as well. Plus, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us this morning along with Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. We've got a big show ahead, don't miss a moment of it. And let's kick it off right here with this, President Trump making a bold statement last night with his first State of the Union Address. Take a look at some of the top moments from last night's speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The state of our union is strong because our people are strong. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time. The great news for Americans, 401(k), retirement pension and college savings accounts has gone through the roof. We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses. The era of economic surrender is totally over. It is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. We will do it with American heart and American hands and American whiff.</p><p>My duty and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American dream. Because Americans are dreamers, too. The coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory, just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. The people dreamed this country, the people built this country, and it's the people who are making America Great Again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump extending an olive branch to Democrats but they didn't take it, slamming the commander-in-chief after the State of the Union. Adam Shapiro was live this morning at the White House with that reaction. Adam, good morning.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: And a good morning to you, Maria. Yes, the President's speech talking directly to the American people. Hit on big themes of this administration, Making America Great Again, and improving the economic clout for the majority of Americans. That's something the President talked about during the speech. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: But the Democrats also took their message directly to Middle America, and Representative Joe Kennedy III speaking in Massachusetts at a technical college before a live audience, responded to the President's speech with this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOE KENNEDY III (D), MASSACHUSETTS: We all to the fractured faultlines across our country. Bullies may land a punch, they may leave a mark, but they have never, not once in the history of our United States, manage to match the strength and spirit of a people united in defense of their future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So, this morning, the President will have somewhat of a busy day. He'll be meeting with taxpayers, talking about tax reform, but he's also going to be meeting with Secretary Mnuchin from the Treasury. There was the big discussion about infrastructure last night. Now, the discussion perhaps shifts to how do we pay for the roughly $200 billion to leverage the 1.5 trillion in building over the next 10 years the President called for. And then, Vice President Pence, he'll be heading to the Republican retreat in West Virginia. He'll address members of the Republican Caucus later this evening. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Adam, thanks very much. So, the President is going to be following up on some of the things he said last night. Guy Benson, what's your take from the Democratic side?</p><p>BENSON: Well, I mean, they couldn't have looked more grave throughout the evening. And, you know, I was just sitting there saying, just taking off my conservative hat for a minute, I'm like, you guys, we get it. You don't like this President, you don't support his policies, but even from the beginning where many of them didn't even stand up to applaud as is the tradition as he walked into the chamber, many of them did stand, but stood there not clapping, and then that continued throughout the entire night. It looks, I think, just weird to normal Americans when the President is saying unemployment is at a 17-year low, black unemployment at an all-time low, lowest ever recorded, and they looked like someone just shot their dog. It's weird.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. And Dagen, I think it's going to hurt them going into the '18 Elections. I think people at this point want to be done with the games, just work together and get progress going in this country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And what was also very stark in the Democrats' reaction to this: number one, is that the theme from the speech was America's greatness is in her people, in the sacrifice, in the drive, in the triumph in the face of adversity, and in our strength. And he wove statistics with these very personal stories of the police officer who adopted this child of a heroin addicted mother.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. That's true.</p><p>BENSON: That part was amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it was like, time and again, the ICE agents, C.J. Martinez, staff sergeant Justin Peck, the parents of the two girls killed by MS-13 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then Otto Warmbier.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Otto Warmbier. And also, the North Korean defector, Ji Seong- ho. And him holding up those crutches, I know that this was stagecraft, but you couldn't -- you couldn't avoid being moved by these incredible stories of strength. And I think -- and then when you -- they would cut to Nancy Pelosi and she's biting the inside of her mouth, I just thought that that was just appalling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Chuck Schumer as well, just sort of staying there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did see him clap once.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But --</p><p>MCDOWELL: If that -- if that's all you've got for the American people and these incredible stories, that's pretty sad.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, some of them got up when he mentioned infrastructure. But, I mean, immigration, there were boos, and they just wouldn't -- we -- they wouldn't budge.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look, I have made some notes. There's a number of things that the President touched on that were straight from President Obama's speeches. So, I don't know how they couldn't get onboard with infrastructure $1.5 trillion, reducing the price of prescription drugs is going to be of top priority for this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Priority. Yes. And that was unexpected.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Vocational schools and paid family leave. That's Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BENSON: And by the way, the Republicans were grumpy about those ideas when they were Obama's and they're all giving standing ovations because Trump is saying it. There is something about this town that is super tribal and annoying and silly, I think, a lot of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is.</p><p>BENSON: But it is odd to see President Obama for eight years talk about crumbling roads and bridges and the need for more infrastructure spending, and then Trump comes out and says let's do it and the Democrats are sitting there with their arms crossed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I used -- I used to joke that President Obama literally mentioned infrastructure spending in every single speech he gave on the economy over an eight-year period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, why couldn't he get it done?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But -- well, again, on the Republican side, you had people who were deficit hawks that's worried about driving up the debt but now they're all for filling potholes. To your point, the hypocrisy in D.C.</p><p>BENSON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He had a good story to tell on the economy. So, stressing the tax cuts and the package there, stressing the economic progress, economic growth as well as the rollback and regulation. We expected that, but that is real hard data of the progress we've seen this year.</p><p>BENSON: It would've been malpractice not to mention all of that good news. He did, and I loved his lengthy defense of the tax reform. That was really good. Yes, it was. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, 100 percent, those words by the president in a caugh-on-tape moment about releasing the memo which allegedly discloses FBI surveillance of uses. Details on that coming up next. And then earnings season rolling on. We are watching Bluechips, Boeing, AT&amp;T and Microsoft this morning. Facebook on tap after the close tonight. What to expect right after this short break. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Turns out that that false alarm about a missile attack in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago was not an accident. Cheryl Casone with the details in New York and the headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: Good morning, Maria. This is incredible, officials say the worker who sent out that alert thought an actual attack was happening. A state investigation revealed that emergency management officials knew for years that the employee had problems performing his job and colleagues were not comfortable working with him, but they still kept him in his position. He has now been fired. He thought it was real.</p><p>OK. President Trump is living up to one of his campaign promises. At last night's State of the Union, he announced that he signed an executive order keeping the controversial Guantanamo Bay prison open.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We must be clear, terrorists are not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. So today, I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis who is doing a great job, thank you, to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, the move marks a form of reversal of President Obama's eight-year effort to close Guantanamo.</p><p>Well, it's another busy day for earnings today. You got Boeing, Dow component, reporting their results before the opening bell. Earnings per share expect a decline 17 percent from a year ago. Boeing, the best performing Dow stock last year, its shares are higher in the premarket, up more than 1-1/2 percent. We're going to hear from Facebook and Microsoft after the bell today. Facebook expected to report a sharp increase in their earnings per share, up nearly 40 percent from a year ago. Shares moving higher in the premarket up more than half a percent. And analysts are looking for Microsoft's earnings per share to increase by nearly three percent. That stock right now little bit lower in the premarket down more than 1 percent.</p><p>Well, Facebook rolling out a new policy. They're now banning misleading financial ads, including those that involve cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A new policy says that ads cannot promote any cryptocurrencies. Facebook says examples of fraudulent ads include phrases like use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin. Share of Facebook up more than 40 percent from a year ago. Let's show you Bitcoin. One Bitcoin is worth about $10,000 right now. But remember, it'd been as high as 20,000 last year, and hits keep coming for Bitcoin, Maria. And those are your headlines. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point, big sell-off there, Cheryl. Thank you so much. Meanwhile, markets sold off yesterday. Futures are bouncing this morning after that 350 plus sell-off yesterday. As you can see, the market is now looking higher by 90 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still record territory for some of the averages. We'll take a look at what's behind the slide, coming up. And we're just a few minutes away from a heavenly show, thanks to a rare super blue blood moon. We'll tell you about your best shot at seeing it, coming up. Back in a moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The stock market has smashed one record after another gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time. The great news --</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: The great news for Americans, 401(k), retirement pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was President Trump last night touting America's market milestones since he's taken office during his State of the Union last night. Futures this morning are bouncing after two days of heavy selling. Take a look, we're expecting a gain at the start of trading after the Dow tumbled 363 points yesterday, the worst day since May. Joining us right now is Scott Wren, Senior Global Equity Strategist with Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Scott, it's good to see you, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Hi, Maria, how are you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good. So, first, let's talk about the sell-off that we've seen in the last two days. What is behind this heavy selling from your standpoint?</p><p>WREN: Well, you know, I tell you, it was funny because as you look at the headlines, people are trying to -- it was kind of a blame game the last couple of days. And a lot of people attributed to rising rates which I completely don't agree with or, you know, what's the President going to say and I don't think that had anything to do with it. I think most of the reason why we had a sell-off was because from right before Christmas until last Friday, the market, S&amp;P 500 was up almost 12 percent. It was a completely vertical move, and whenever that happens, you're going to get some volatility to the downside at some point. And I think that's all we saw.</p><p>We saw a little bit of selling, people taking some money off the table. I think from the low yesterday, we're still not even down two percent from the highs. So, I think this is the kind of volatility that we should expect in 2018. And really, to be honest with you, for retail investors, still with cash on the sidelines, which is plenty of those. You know, you have a five, seven percent pullback, that's nothing but an opportunity. And if I was a retail investor, I'd be hoping that we see a little bit more downside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, we talked about this yesterday, after a $7-1/2 trillion in gains from the election in terms of market value, people look for an excuse to sort of lighten up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Risk appetite at a record high, by some measures the price to earnings ratio, the median for all stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and AMX at a record high as well, due for a pullback indeed. And going into this new year, we've been talking about this literally every day that you have to watch bond yields. That if you have an economy that is picking up steam, moving into the new year, J.P. Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon telling you he sees four percent as easily doable here. You have to worry about what kind of headwind, rising yields will be near a four-year high yesterday, close to tenure yield hit at 2.725 percent. Not that this is bad news if the yields are going up because the economy is doing better, but nevertheless, that could be a drag on stocks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. What about you, Scott, you said you don't believe that its interest rates a minute ago. You're worried about higher rates. What's your magic number that actually would push you to tell clients, OK, lighten up on stocks because rates are becoming more competitive?</p><p>WREN: Well, I think, you know, Dagen was right. You know, when -- typically, when you're coming out of a recession, the economy is accelerating, rates are rising, inflation is going up a little bit, you know, the market loves that. It's a sign of things -- sign of things accelerating. But really, if you look at it, Maria, from the high in December which was about 250 on the tenure, you know, we're really only about 20 basis points higher. So, I don't view that as a large move. I think if you start to move north of three percent and you don't get, you know, we're looking for 2.9 percent GDP this year, which, you know, is a lot better than what we've seen lately -- I think in that kind of an acceleration, you can -- you can justify higher rates in the bond market reflecting higher rates, but I still think that it's highly likely that at some point here, the Fed makes a mistake. We're calling for two rate hikes here this year. You know, the Fed saying they're going to do three -- two or three, the markets can adjust that, but four -- yes, four more, that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, that's what you think -- then that's what you think is going to be the catalyst then for a sell-off or the Fed going overboard.</p><p>WREN: I think it could. Yes, I think it could.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We should point out that today is the Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen's final policy meeting as head of the Central Bank. So, we'll see what she has to say at the end of today's meeting. But you think there's a real chance they could blow it this year with too many rate increases?</p><p>WREN: Well, I do. I -- you know, I mean, Maria, you look over the last 30 years. I mean, the ebb and flow of the economy is caused by -- on the upside. You know, the Fed leaves rates too high for too long. They hike them too quick. And it's a headwind and we roll over. You know, that's what happens virtually in every cycle. And I think that's -- I think that's a high probability this year. I mean, I think the tax cuts extend - - they had the potential to extend this expansion for probably a couple more years. And I think this year is going to be a lot about global central banks. What are they going to do, how much tighter are they going to get? You know, if we're wrong and let's say GDP is north of three percent and inflation stays low, we're probably too conservative. But if, you know, the Fed can spoil the party, this is a big year to see what the Feds are going to do. The ECB, you know, you got to watch central banks this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll do that. Monetary policy going away, fiscal policy taking front and center. Scott, thank you, thanks very much. Scott Wren joining us there.</p><p>WREN: All right, guys, have a great day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to you. Coming up, demanding answers, days after abruptly leaving his post at the FBI, there are new questions this morning about whether Deputy McCabe purposely delayed part of the probe into Hillary Clinton's e-mails in the final weeks of the election, he sat on it. And then, making his case on immigration reform, the President outlined his plan last night. We discuss making his vision a reality, coming up next. Back in a moment.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition of Mornings with Maria, live, from Washington D.C., for President Trump's State of the Union Address.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. It is Wednesday, January 31st; your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast. President Donald Trump delivered his first State of the Union speech last night, renewing his vow to improve life for all Americans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country, anywhere in the world, to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern, is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President also touted his plan for a second year in office, focusing on border security, on infrastructure, and national security. More highlights of the speech, coming up this morning. Markets in focus and it looks like we are getting a little stabilization and a bounce after a second day of selloff yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 300 points yesterday, the worst decline since May, down one and a third percent.</p><p>Futures, however, this morning, are bouncing after those two heavy days of selling. Dow Industrials expected to be up about 80 points, a third of a percent, NASDAQ also higher this morning by 17 points, a quarter of a percent higher. So we are looking at gains across the board. In Asia -- and Europe this morning, the picture looks like this. The European markets are mixed, FT 100 down a fraction, CAC Quarante in Paris, up a fraction, as is the DAX Index in Germany.</p><p>Check Asia overnight, markets were mixed there, mostly lower with the exception of Hong Kong., the Hang Seng index up, almost one percent. Earnings in focus once again, Dow components, Boeing and AT&amp;T are due to report their fourth quarter this morning. And technology titans, Facebook and Microsoft, are set to report after the bell tonight. We are previewing all of the above, this morning.</p><p>Insurance company, Anthem, beating earnings and revenue expectations this morning, driven by a rise in membership, that stock has had a great year as you can see. Turning to concerns over privacy, President Trump overheard last night, telling a lawmaker that he is 100 percent behind releasing the FISA memo, when it could be released, coming up this morning.</p><p>Plus, the fallout for Andrew McCain, the DOJ reportedly probing, why the former FBI Deputy Director seemingly delayed an investigation of Hillary Clinton's e-mails during the 2016 presidential campaign, details on that investigation, coming up. And the Super Blue Blood Moon has arrived, when to take the perfect photograph of this rare sighting, later this hour.</p><p>But first, we begin this half an hour with this, President Trump's powerful State of the Union Address, the commander-in-chief called for unity and reached out to Democrats on immigration, last night, urging lawmakers to come together to make America safe again. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Finally closed the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country. My duty and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American dream, because Americans are dreamers too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Americans are dreamers too. Joining us right now to react is Senator David Perdue of Georgia. Senator, it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DAVID PERDUE (R), GEORGIA: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Your reaction to the speech last night, how would you grade the President?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, I think, if mobile-rated speeches, he had a five-star rating last night. This is a very confident, optimistic President. He laid out his agenda, he talked about his agenda last year and what the results are looking like right now, and I think he told the world America is open for business again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Matt Schlapp, I want to introduce you, thanks very much for joining us, chairman --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: It's good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: of CPAC, let's have you join the conversation this morning. Senator, do you think we'll get an immigration deal? Will the two sides come together?</p><p>PERDUE: You know, in the last 50 years, this is the best chance we've had to fix our archaic immigration. So this President went out on a limb and laid out a framework that we believe we should get Democratic support for, we'll see, between now and March the 5th.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Senator, good to see you. But I want to know how you get, though, with the most far right members of congress and even in the senate, in terms of the 1.8 million people who would be given a pass to citizenship, Dreamers in this country over a 12-year period. How do you reassure those Republicans that they won't get in front in line of other individuals in this country and how do you characterize that as not being amnesty, which it is?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, when you look at the entire situation, what we want to do, and the President said this before, is we want to end DACA and give them a certainty. But the only reason that makes sense is if you close the door to this happening again, and to do that, you have close more security, you have to build a wall and you have to end this chain migration issue and the diversity lottery. So if you do that, then this is a very conservative solution to a 50-year problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And these are the four pillars that we want to show that the President brought up last night, including a legal pathway to citizenship for the DACA eligible little legal immigrants, building a border wall, and ending the Visa lottery program and chain migration. As you just went through that, Senator, the Democrats are pushing back, though, on money for the border wall, on ending some of these programs.</p><p>PERDUE: Well, we have all the evidence we need to show that they are totally out of touch with the American people. They closed the government down over this issue, for goodness sakes. You can do a lot of things in America, but you cannot close the government down over this issue. And so, what we've seen is two thirds of Americans want the solution the way the President has laid it out. Seventy -- over 70 percent believed that immigration should be the individual worker, the spouse, and the immediate minor children.</p><p>BENSON: It does seem, Senator, like the chain migration piece is the nonstarter for a lot of Democrats. Is there any discussion about, maybe, softening on that or at least pushing that off to another discussion and maybe bring out something like e-verify, that a lot of Democrats signed on to, even as recently as 2013.</p><p>PERDUE: Well, what we decided to do early on was, the reason immigration efforts have failed three times in the last 11 years, is they tried to do too much. They try to make it too comprehensive. So, this attempt is just to deal with legal immigration. So e-verify, temporary work visas, we can do that step two. The problem with chain migration is if you don't solve that problem, you still have the open door to the next generation of illegal immigrants.</p><p>And so, this is a -- this is a tough one. And all we are really talking about our parents and siblings. The immediate family and children are still protected. So this is family reunification. We are going to make sure they don't get ahead of the $4 million they are in the line right now as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Was there something last night that the President did not get across that you would've liked to hear with regard to this subject or any other at the State of the Union?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, what's troubling to me is the fact we had so many people sitting on their hands last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. We were talking about that earlier.</p><p>PERDUE: it was so disrespectful and it was very noticeable even on things that we don't agree on, we know they agreed they did not support this President. So I think that's a real problem. It does not bode well for this bipartisan effort that we have on immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Matt Schlapp, your thoughts?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes, I think that there are concerns from Democrats and immigration but there are concerns from Republican and immigration. This is the legislative process. By the way, there are some conservatives who hang out with you, Senator, in the house, who are going to see -- want to see some changes too. Everybody should just understand that is the process. I give the President great credit for giving us his principles and giving us some details, and now, we're off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, you know, people say bills die in the senate. I mean, when you -- really, I mean, you know that. When you look at what's on the agenda for 2018, what can you get done?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, we've got to get this done, I mean, what we did last year, we focused on -- President said job one is getting the economy going, so he focused on regulations, energy and tax. We checked those boxes and look what's happening. This year, he wants to focus on immigration, infrastructure, and trade, and those are things we're focused on right now in addition to potentially rebuilding our military.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We needed to hear more about fixing Obamacare, which we did not. He mentioned repealing the individual mandate but that is a morass and it could come to haunt the republicans in November this year.</p><p>PERDUE: Dagen, I totally agree. You know, the American people -- I hear this all the time, you've got to do something about the rising premiums out there. But don't misunderstand, the individual mandate is so perverse, what we saw in 2014, eight million people were fined $2 billion and half of those people make less than $25,000, the President referred to that last night. So, I agree 100 percent, we've got to continue to work to get these premiums down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But repealing it, though, you leave the sickest, getting insurance and those who were well and healthy, no longer buying it. So, you could create that downward spiral where premiums really now, skyrocket.</p><p>PERDUE: Well, that's exactly right and that's why we have to work on this. We have some bipartisan efforts going right now, but, we'll see. This is a higher priority for people back home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, what were your thoughts? What is your thought on what we heard on the private sector yesterday with Amazon and J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway, coming up with a plan for employee health costs?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, you know, this is what happens when government doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point.</p><p>PERDUE: These great federal programs like the war on poverty and the great society have all failed. And so what happens is, people out there in the real world, step up and take care of their people. Look at Wal-mart, they're giving a $5,000 bonus to people who won't adopt. Whoever talked about that in the American private sector before?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so the private sector should continue to come up with ideas, I guess.</p><p>PERDUE: Well, the proof is, is that it works. We just went through eight years of examples of where great big government failed, the lowest economic performance in our history, so we know what we don't want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, we'll leave it there. Senator, it's good to see you.</p><p>PERDUE: Good to see you, guys, stay warm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Senator David Perdue joining us here. Coming up, President Trump has overheard saying that he will 100 percent release the classified FISA memo alleging FBI abuses, the controversy there, coming up. And then the lunar trifecta taking shape right now over the skies at the Eastern seaboard. Check this out, the first pictures of the Super Blue Blood Moon, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes, The Marcels, singing \"Blue Moon\". It is finally here. The super moon show in the sky is about to reach best viewing. Lauren Simonetti with all the details right now. Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: All right, watch the clock, and when I tell you when to look up. We're showing to you any second now live pictures of this rare lunar event that we call \"Super Blue Blood Moon\". You don't need special glasses like those silly solar eclipse glasses to see this.</p><p>Right now, it looks white. But it will eventually change in shade. It's a phenomenon that happens every 150 years. It's happening today. So, when the moon is closest to Earth, that's the \"Super Moon\". When it's the second full moon in the month -- this being the last day of January -- that's your \"Blue Moon.\"</p><p>And the red tint that you'll eventually see is when the Earth's shadow cast on the moon, and then you have the sun, the earth, and the moon aligned. It's going to light up all 50 states this morning. If you are living on the East Coast, the moon is going to be glowing completely at 6:48 a.m. Eastern Time, so 90 seconds from now.</p><p>If you're in the center of the country, the eclipse will enter totality around 6:15 local time. Mountain Standard Time zone, it's starts at 6:29 in the morning. And the best and the longest views, those are on the West Coast, it starts at 4:51 Pacific, it last until 6:05.</p><p>So, you have an hour and 14 minutes of totality. Here's what Ivanka Trump just tweeted out yesterday: \"Tomorrow,\" today, \"will be the coolest state event of the year. Three lunar events will come together for a Super Blue Blood Moon -- the first in over 150 years.\" So, if you wanted your once in a blue moon chance, it's here.</p><p>And aside from just being totally cool, it's important to NASA's scientists because the way the moon's surface responds during the eclipse provides insight about where to land a rover on a future mission. So, they monitor the surface temperature and how those change. Different types of materials on the moon, they heat and they cool differently, and that could be key for landing a mission, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is really cool. I love the shots of the moon. We can't see it behind us, actually. The sun is actually coming up now. But looks beautiful.</p><p>SIMONETTI: 15 seconds away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you say somebody was looking at over there, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know. The entire crew was standing at the door.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, we will get up in the commercial break.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You guys see anything out those windows?</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I mean, it's on the other side. So, we're being told you can see it, right? It's 6:48, you said that's the time.</p><p>SIMONETTI: That's now! Can I go? I'm going to the window.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lauren Simonetti, thank you so much. Check it out, everybody. Coming up, the classified FISA memo on tap. President Trump overheard last night, saying he will 100 percent release it. We will discuss the alleged FBI abuses right here next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Let's release the memo. Oh, don't worry. A hundred percent.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP: Could you imagine that? He'd be too angry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was President Trump last night caught on a hot Mike as he was exiting the hall supporting a congressman calling for the release of the -- yes, surveillance abuses. The decision to release the controversial FISA memo now resting in the hands of the president. He has four days to - - or technically choose to do nothing, which would ultimately mean it's release. Joining me now at Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Oh, good morning from our nice warm studio here in New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, thank you for that. What do you think about this memo? Is there anything so clandestine in it? What's so secret that the Democrats are pushing back by saying not to release the memo because, clearly, we know there have been massive abuses at the top of the FBI.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think that's pretty much given, Maria, that there've been abuses of the government's spying power, not just by the FBI but by the NSA. What we do know, and none of us have seen this is this is a four-page summary of raw intelligence data. Raw intelligence data is the actually transcript of a phone call or the actually series of text message or e- mails between and among intelligence agent or from their various sources. We know that these abuses occurred mostly in the last year of the Obama administration, what was going on then, the presidential campaign, and in the first year of the Trump administration. What was going on then, Bob Mueller's investigation of the president.</p><p>The controversy about releasing this, and I have been a champion for its release, because, as you know, I believe as most of us do in governmental transparency, the public has the right to look at the stuff would make up its own mind. The controversy is that there is another four-page memo written by the Democrats which the committee has voted not to release. There are 13 Republicans and 9 Democrats on the committee. The Democrats say, that they have written their memo based on the same raw data as the four-page Republican written memo. So, I've been arguing release both memos, and release the raw data on which it is based. That, of course, causes a problem, but we can't release the raw data, because that reveals how we get our secrets, and who gives them to us. Well, you can do that. You can take certain key words and key names out of there so as not to harm sources, so as to allow the American people to decide for themselves: who in the government has abused power, who knew about it, who tolerated it, who looked the other way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. It's pretty clear that they tried to tip the scales. I mean, first, you have these text messages between two FBI agent -- Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, saying, you know, we need an insurance policy should Donald Trump win the election. And then, there's the controversy around Andrew McCabe. According to the Washington Post this morning that the Justice Department is investigating whether McCabe, former FBI Deputy Director, sat on newly found Hillary Clinton e-mails ahead of the 2016 election. So, he sat on this knowing that there were e-mails found on Andrew -- on Mr. Weiner's laptop, but he didn't do anything about it for weeks. What do you think of that?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I don't know that sitting on it helped Mrs. Clinton at all, but if he did sit on evidence, this incendiary have to have a law enforcement based justification for it. If the justification for it is, well, the campaign going this way, and I don't want disrupt the apple cart. That, obviously, is making decision based on politics which would constitute misconduct in all of us. As we know, FBI agents are our choir boys, and we don't want to be. And they're entitled to political opinions like the rest of us, but if their politics animates their decisions with respect to the gathering of evidence and the making of judgment cause on the evidence, that got to get off of the case. Many of us argued for months that McCabe had no business investigating Hillary because of his wife's connection to Hillary's fund-raisers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's that as well. His wife, what, got $700,000 for a Terry McAuliffe group.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, and Terry McAuliffe, of course, was the governor of Virginia at the time, a champion of the Clintons, and the former chief of staff of President Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right. Guy?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You can't make this stuff up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, you can't, this should be a movie.</p><p>BENSON: Hey, judge, Guy Benson, so, the thing that seems significant in this is the change of heart of Christopher Wray, the FBI Director, who had reported said he would resign rather than forcing McCabe out just a few days ago, a week ago. And now, he obviously saw something concrete and force McCabe out of that position. Doesn't that seem like evidence that there's more fire beyond just the smoke?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think you're right. It's a great observation, Guy. The backstory is, when the DOJ learned that the House Intelligence Committee was likely to release the memo, the DOJ said don't release it, it's incendiary, it'll reveal our national secrets. And then, suddenly, everyone at the DOJ said, has anybody here read it? And I wanted to read it. So, Chris Wray, the Director of the FBI, went over there on Sunday evening to the House Intelligence Committee Vault. Read it, and whatever he saw, within 12 hours, Andrew McCabe was gone after a 30-year career at the FBI.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it certainly seems like there's something there.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It's coming about 5:00 on Friday after.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Napolitano, match slap. Good to see you. Thank you so much. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018013101cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJ2-X3M1-JB20-G3KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 31, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp; SPACE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp; ENGINE PARTS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC3761 GUIDED MISSILES &amp; SPACE VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>BOE (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>BA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Super Blue Blood Moon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Boeing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>AT&amp;T</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Microsoft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anthem</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FISA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>State of the Union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DACA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chain Migration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Visa Lottery</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Border Wall</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>J.P.

Trump is on his way to Tennessee to rally for Rep. Marsha Blackburn on Sunday night. Advertisement Conservative websites and accounts are complaining that Rep. Marsha Blackburn's campaign is being shadowbanned by social media platforms. Fox News has the representative seeking the state's Senate seat up by eight or nine points but other polls show the race nearly tied or within the margin of error. According to a new poll, Blackburn's eight-point lead in the state of Tennessee is now a virtual tie with her Democratic opponent. Pres. Trump is supposed to visit on Sunday night to rally his base to get out and vote for Rep. Blackburn. If you don't know about Marsha, she was the candidate who asked for amoment of silence to pay respects to the massacre in Pittsburgh, and when everybody bowed their heads, a progressive yelled out in a demeaning fashion.250,000 new jobs in October.

That said, we don't want the government doing it. The current 'deep state' will always exist, and government censorship is their way of doing the same thing big Tech is doing.Advertisement Source: Washington Examiner[3]One of the polls, from East Tennessee State University, shows the candidates at 44 percent apiece among likely voters, according tothe Tennessean[4]. The second, from Nashville-based Targoz Strategic Marketing, found 48 percent of likely and early voters support each candidate. Early voting ended in the state on Thursday. Republicans view Tennessee as a 'firewall' state protecting them from the loss of the chamber. With the current balance of power 51 to 49 and Democrats looking highly likely to lose North Dakota, the GOP could afford to lose Arizona and Nevada while failing to pick up Florida, Missouri or Indiana and still survive with 50 seats and Vice President Mike Pence's casting vote. That calculation would be swept away by losing Tennessee. The new polling is a break from the recent slate of surveys showing Blackburn with an advantage. The RealClearPolitics average of recent polls, which does not include these two new surveys,shows[5]Blackburn up 6.8 percentage points. The Tennessean notes that the ETSU poll shows Bredesen has an advantage with independent voters, 46 percent to Blackburn's 35 percent, as well as with women, 51 percent to 38 percent. Blackburn, meanwhile, leads with men 57 percent to Bredesen's 35 percent.

But state investigators plan to do so soon, though the precise timing is not yet set, said the two people familiar with the states' plan. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  A smaller group of the state representatives met last month in Washington with antitrust officials at the Justice Department, which has started a broad antitrust review of the technology industry. The Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook, and it is reviewing the actions of other companies as well.</p><p>  Lawmakers in Congress are investigating the industry as well. An antitrust hearing last month included executives from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>  The states' plan to move forward with an investigation was first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>  The states can play a key role, often in concert with federal regulators and Congress, in building evidence and public support for major investigations. That was the pattern in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.</p><p>  But major antitrust investigations can take years, whether they result in legal action or not. And unlike the Microsoft case, which focused on a single company, the pursuit of today's tech giants is more wide-ranging.</p><p>  The review by the Justice Department, for example, is of competitive behavior by the dominant digital companies. Each of the big four that regulators are focused on -- Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple -- operates in somewhat different markets, including internet search, online advertising, e-commerce and social networks.</p><p>  The states' plan, though still taking shape, seems to be along the lines of the broader Justice Department review. The states have not formally agreed on a specific plan of action and details are still being discussed, said a senior attorney at one state attorney general office who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was barred from discussing the investigation.</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>  An Apple spokesman pointed to the company's previous statements, which have said that Apple faces fierce competition and helps thousands of companies reach customers. A representative for Google pointed to testimony from Adam Cohen, its director of economic policy, to Congress in July.</p><p>  ''In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,'' Mr. Cohen said at the time. ''We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world.''</p><p>  The state attorneys general offices did not make any formal comments on plans for an investigation. The tentative timing is that an announcement will be made in early September.</p><p>  But the states did form a bipartisan, multistate unit called the Tech Industry Working Group months ago.</p><p>  ''As attorneys general, we need to evaluate and address specific conduct, utilizing our existing antitrust and consumer protection laws,'' Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, a Democrat, said in a statement. He added that the working group was ''looking at the intersection of technology and antitrust.''</p><p>  What action, if any, should be taken to curb the market power of the big tech companies is uncertain. Proposals vary from breaking them up, a step endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her presidential campaign, to forcing them to share data to make it easier for rivals to compete.</p><p>  But there is a growing criticism of the big tech companies, and increasing calls to rein them in.</p><p>  In a congressional hearing last month, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, and chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, said that the tech companies had brought innovation and growth to the economy.</p><p>  But he added that their rise had come with too few restraints.</p><p>  ''In an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,'' Mr. Cicilline said.

The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the legislature to pass them.</p><p> Although last-minute changes threaten \"death by a thousand paper cuts,\" the California law will clearly establish a consumer's right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p> \"There are new rights and it's clearly a big win,\" she said. \"You'll have a big red button on a web page to opt out. A lot of companies will choose to comply.\"</p><p> Bills are still pending that would amend California's law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \"selling\" data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \"consumer.\"</p><p> In Illinois, a law signed last month bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine's new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada's law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p><p> The issue is more important than ever, as shown not only by the Equifax and Facebook fines, but also by the implications for voter manipulation using profiling with personal data in 2020, said Lee Tien, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The organization supported both California's law and a New York proposal to allow consumers to sue over privacy.</p><p> Privacy rights advocates were caught off guard by the intense state-by-state battle, Tien said.</p><p> \"The big tech players have a lot of funding and they can be everywhere at once, popping up in all these states, and we're a little more stretched thin,\" Tien said.</p><p> Hundreds of small pension funds in Illinois face troubling debt. Is consolidation the way to go?</p><p>New York state's pending legislation would go even further than California's law _ establishing a consumer's right to sue over privacy or security breaches, and a \"fiduciary duty\" for companies to act in the customer's best interests, even if it means forgoing profits from selling personal information.</p><p> \"They have to put customer privacy above the company's profit-making,\" said state Sen. Kevin Thomas, the Long Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Consumer Protection and sponsored the New York bill.</p><p> Possible abuses might include insurance companies using genetic information from testing to raise rates, Thomas said, or employment agencies using financial data to offer lower pay.</p><p> Thomas' bill didn't make it out of committee this year, but he said he plans public hearings before the 2020 legislative session to gather more information from constituents.</p><p> \"Companies don't need all this information that can be used against you and there's no oversight,\" Thomas said. \"States have to stand up because there's no regulation, and it's not going to come from the federal government, as divided as this country is right now.\"</p><p> The Internet Association opposed the New York bill. The law is \"unworkable for businesses that want to comply,\" said John Olsen, a regional state government affairs director for the association, citing the law's mandate to get consumer consent before selling data.</p><p> While Vermont established a data broker registry, requiring businesses that buy data to register with the state, many other states saw proposed laws wither under business opposition.</p><p> Amid sexual harassment allegations in his organization, House Speaker Michael Madigan trumpets signing of anti-harassment law</p><p> In Connecticut, state Rep. David Michel, a freshman Stamford Democrat, said his constituents wanted more data privacy, so he sponsored a bill that would have made genetic testing data confidential.</p><p> \"Generally speaking, companies are making money on people's private data without them knowing. I don't agree with that,\" Michel said. The state did establish a task force to study future laws.</p><p>Connecticut's business community was opposed to that bill and other Connecticut privacy measures that failed, said Louise DiCocco, an attorney for the Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Association.</p><p> \"The businesses we represent around the state think this is not the way to go. The bills that were drafted are too vague,\" DiCocco said. \"Businesses need to know exactly what's expected of them.\"</p><p> Opposition from tech, cellphone and general business organizations doomed a number of state laws.</p><p>Hawaii was a typical case: A bill banning sales of cellphone location data without consent, blamed in news reports for creating detailed records of personal lives by so-called location aggregators, passed both houses of the Democratic legislature with little dissent and was set to take effect July 1.</p><p> But after opposition from the cellphone industry, Democratic Gov. David Ige vetoed the bill and called for a task force, telling legislators a \"lack of clarity\" about regulation of a \"complex national industry\" would make the law too hard to enforce.</p><p> CTIA, the association that represents the wireless industry, objected to the bill, complaining of \"further fragmentation of consumer privacy laws.\" And because location data is often anonymous, the group said, obtaining required consent can be impossible.</p><p> In Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Dakota and Texas, task forces or advisory committees were set up after privacy legislation was defeated.</p><p> Privacy legislation was delayed for consideration next year in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. Similar bills failed outright in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana and New Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-832b604ca59da224b5dc7bb8e0442cf4917c43f7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D5FB3B967499 NWBKIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT8-G2M1-DXVP-V3BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Journal Gazette and Times-Courier<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the legislature to pass them.</p><p> Although last-minute changes threaten \"death by a thousand paper cuts,\" the California law will clearly establish a consumer's right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p> \"There are new rights and it's clearly a big win,\" she said. \"You'll have a big red button on a web page to opt out. A lot of companies will choose to comply.\"</p><p> Bills are still pending that would amend California's law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \"selling\" data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \"consumer.\"</p><p> In Illinois, a law signed last month bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine's new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada's law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p><p> The issue is more important than ever, as shown not only by the Equifax and Facebook fines, but also by the implications for voter manipulation using profiling with personal data in 2020, said Lee Tien, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The organization supported both California's law and a New York proposal to allow consumers to sue over privacy.</p><p> Privacy rights advocates were caught off guard by the intense state-by-state battle, Tien said.</p><p> \"The big tech players have a lot of funding and they can be everywhere at once, popping up in all these states, and we're a little more stretched thin,\" Tien said.</p><p>New York state's pending legislation would go even further than California's law _ establishing a consumer's right to sue over privacy or security breaches, and a \"fiduciary duty\" for companies to act in the customer's best interests, even if it means forgoing profits from selling personal information.</p><p> \"They have to put customer privacy above the company's profit-making,\" said state Sen. Kevin Thomas, the Long Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Consumer Protection and sponsored the New York bill.</p><p> Possible abuses might include insurance companies using genetic information from testing to raise rates, Thomas said, or employment agencies using financial data to offer lower pay.</p><p> Thomas' bill didn't make it out of committee this year, but he said he plans public hearings before the 2020 legislative session to gather more information from constituents.</p><p> \"Companies don't need all this information that can be used against you and there's no oversight,\" Thomas said. \"States have to stand up because there's no regulation, and it's not going to come from the federal government, as divided as this country is right now.\"</p><p> The Internet Association opposed the New York bill. The law is \"unworkable for businesses that want to comply,\" said John Olsen, a regional state government affairs director for the association, citing the law's mandate to get consumer consent before selling data.</p><p> While Vermont established a data broker registry, requiring businesses that buy data to register with the state, many other states saw proposed laws wither under business opposition.</p><p> In Connecticut, state Rep. David Michel, a freshman Stamford Democrat, said his constituents wanted more data privacy, so he sponsored a bill that would have made genetic testing data confidential.</p><p> \"Generally speaking, companies are making money on people's private data without them knowing. I don't agree with that,\" Michel said. The state did establish a task force to study future laws.</p><p>Connecticut's business community was opposed to that bill and other Connecticut privacy measures that failed, said Louise DiCocco, an attorney for the Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Association.</p><p> \"The businesses we represent around the state think this is not the way to go. The bills that were drafted are too vague,\" DiCocco said. \"Businesses need to know exactly what's expected of them.\"</p><p> Opposition from tech, cellphone and general business organizations doomed a number of state laws.</p><p>Hawaii was a typical case: A bill banning sales of cellphone location data without consent, blamed in news reports for creating detailed records of personal lives by so-called location aggregators, passed both houses of the Democratic legislature with little dissent and was set to take effect July 1.</p><p> But after opposition from the cellphone industry, Democratic Gov. David Ige vetoed the bill and called for a task force, telling legislators a \"lack of clarity\" about regulation of a \"complex national industry\" would make the law too hard to enforce.</p><p> CTIA, the association that represents the wireless industry, objected to the bill, complaining of \"further fragmentation of consumer privacy laws.\" And because location data is often anonymous, the group said, obtaining required consent can be impossible.</p><p> In Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Dakota and Texas, task forces or advisory committees were set up after privacy legislation was defeated.</p><p> Privacy legislation was delayed for consideration next year in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. Similar bills failed outright in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana and New Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-eef6e34cf58f5eaa68abf7e8b1a55424fbce168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E113A10985CF6 NWBKIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT8-G2P1-DXVP-V3SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the Legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the Legislature to pass them.</p><p>Although last-minute changes threaten \"death by a thousand paper cuts,\" the California law will clearly establish a consumer's right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p>\"There are new rights, and it's clearly a big win,\" she said. \"You'll have a big red button on a web page to opt out. A lot of companies will choose to comply.\"</p><p>Bills are still pending that would amend California's law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \"selling\" data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \"consumer.\" In Illinois, a law signed last month bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine's new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada's law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p><p>The issue is more important than ever, as shown not only by the Equifax and Facebook fines, but also by the implications for voter manipulation using profiling with personal data in 2020, said Lee Tien, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The organization supported both California's law and a New York proposal to allow consumers to sue over privacy.</p><p>Privacy rights advocates were caught off guard by the intense state-by-state battle, Tien said.</p><p>\"The big tech players have a lot of funding, and they can be everywhere at once, popping up in all these states, and we're a little more stretched thin,\" Tien said.</p><p>New York state's pending legislation would go even further than California's law - establishing a consumer's right to sue over privacy or security breaches, and a \"fiduciary duty\" for companies to act in the customer's best interests, even if it means forgoing profits from selling personal information.</p><p>\"They have to put customer privacy above the company's profit-making,\" said state Sen. Kevin Thomas, the Long Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Consumer Protection and sponsored the New York bill.</p><p>Possible abuses might include insurance companies using genetic information from testing to raise rates, Thomas said, or employment agencies using financial data to offer lower pay.</p><p>Thomas' bill didn't make it out of committee this year, but he said he plans public hearings before the 2020 legislative session to gather more information.</p><p>\"Companies don't need all this information that can be used against you and there's no oversight,\" Thomas said. \"States have to stand up because there's no regulation, and it's not going to come from the federal government, as divided as this country is right now.\"</p><p>The Internet Association opposed the New York bill. The law is \"unworkable for businesses that want to comply,\" said John Olsen, a regional state government affairs director for the association, citing the law's mandate to get consumer consent before selling data.</p><p>While Vermont established a data broker registry, requiring businesses that buy data to register with the state, many other states saw proposed laws wither under business opposition.In Connecticut, state Rep. David Michel, a freshman Stamford Democrat, said his constituents wanted more data privacy, so he sponsored a bill that would have made genetic testing data confidential.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, companies are making money on people's private data without them knowing. I don't agree with that,\" Michel said. The state did establish a task force to study future laws.</p><p>Connecticut's business community was opposed to that bill and other Connecticut privacy measures that failed, said Louise DiCocco, an attorney for the Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Association.</p><p>\"The businesses we represent around the state think this is not the way to go. The bills that were drafted are too vague,\" DiCocco said. \"Businesses need to know exactly what's expected of them.\"</p><p>Opposition from tech, cellphone and general business organizations doomed a number of state laws.</p><p>Hawaii was a typical case: A bill banning sales of cellphone location data without consent, blamed in news reports for creating detailed records of personal lives by so-called location aggregators, passed both houses of the Democratic legislature with little dissent and was set to take effect July 1.</p><p>But after opposition from the cellphone industry, Democratic Gov. David Ige vetoed the bill and called for a task force, telling legislators a \"lack of clarity\" about regulation of a \"complex national industry\" would make the law too hard to enforce.</p><p>CTIA, the association that represents the wireless industry, objected to the bill, complaining of \"further fragmentation of consumer privacy laws.\" And because location data is often anonymous, the group said, obtaining required consent can be impossible.</p><p>In Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Dakota and Texas, task forces or advisory committees were set up after privacy legislation was defeated.</p><p>Privacy legislation was delayed for consideration next year in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. Similar bills failed outright in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana and New Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-cf3d5e92bad411e9b0f600163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5N-2T31-DYTR-43CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1358\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Union Leader Corp.

The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the Legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the Legislature to pass them.</p><p> Although last-minute changes threaten \u201cdeath by a thousand paper cuts,\u201d the California law will clearly establish a consumer\u2019s right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p> \u201cThere are new rights, and it\u2019s clearly a big win,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a big red button on a web page to opt out. A lot of companies will choose to comply.\u201d</p><p> Bills are still pending that would amend California\u2019s law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \u201cselling\u201d data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \u201cconsumer.\u201d In Illinois, a law signed last month bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine\u2019s new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada\u2019s law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p><p> The issue is more important than ever, as shown not only by the Equifax and Facebook fines, but also by the implications for voter manipulation using profiling with personal data in 2020, said Lee Tien, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The organization supported both California\u2019s law and a New York proposal to allow consumers to sue over privacy.</p><p> Privacy rights advocates were caught off guard by the intense state-by-state battle, Tien said.</p><p> \u201cThe big tech players have a lot of funding, and they can be everywhere at once, popping up in all these states, and we\u2019re a little more stretched thin,\u201d Tien said.</p><p>New York state\u2019s pending legislation would go even further than California\u2019s law  establishing a consumer\u2019s right to sue over privacy or security breaches, and a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d for companies to act in the customer\u2019s best interests, even if it means forgoing profits from selling personal information.</p><p> \u201cThey have to put customer privacy above the company\u2019s profit-making,\u201d said state Sen. Kevin Thomas, the Long Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Consumer Protection and sponsored the New York bill.</p><p> Possible abuses might include insurance companies using genetic information from testing to raise rates, Thomas said, or employment agencies using financial data to offer lower pay.</p><p> Thomas\u2019 bill didn\u2019t make it out of committee this year, but he said he plans public hearings before the 2020 legislative session to gather more information.</p><p> \u201cCompanies don\u2019t need all this information that can be used against you and there\u2019s no oversight,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cStates have to stand up because there\u2019s no regulation, and it\u2019s not going to come from the federal government, as divided as this country is right now.\u201d</p><p> The Internet Association opposed the New York bill. The law is \u201cunworkable for businesses that want to comply,\u201d said John Olsen, a regional state government affairs director for the association, citing the law\u2019s mandate to get consumer consent before selling data.</p><p> While Vermont established a data broker registry, requiring businesses that buy data to register with the state, many other states saw proposed laws wither under business opposition. In Connecticut, state Rep. David Michel, a freshman Stamford Democrat, said his constituents wanted more data privacy, so he sponsored a bill that would have made genetic testing data confidential.</p><p> \u201cGenerally speaking, companies are making money on people\u2019s private data without them knowing. I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d Michel said. The state did establish a task force to study future laws.</p><p>Connecticut\u2019s business community was opposed to that bill and other Connecticut privacy measures that failed, said Louise DiCocco, an attorney for the Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Association.</p><p> \u201cThe businesses we represent around the state think this is not the way to go. The bills that were drafted are too vague,\u201d DiCocco said. \u201cBusinesses need to know exactly what\u2019s expected of them.\u201d</p><p> Opposition from tech, cellphone and general business organizations doomed a number of state laws.</p><p>Hawaii was a typical case: A bill banning sales of cellphone location data without consent, blamed in news reports for creating detailed records of personal lives by so-called location aggregators, passed both houses of the Democratic legislature with little dissent and was set to take effect July 1.</p><p> But after opposition from the cellphone industry, Democratic Gov.

The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the legislature to pass them.</p><p> Although last-minute changes threaten \u201cdeath by a thousand paper cuts,\u201d the California law will clearly establish a consumer\u2019s right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p> \u201cThere are new rights and it\u2019s clearly a big win,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a big red button on a web page to opt out. A lot of companies will choose to comply.\u201d</p><p> Bills are still pending that would amend California\u2019s law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \u201cselling\u201d data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \u201cconsumer.\u201d</p><p> In Illinois, a law signed last month bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine\u2019s new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada\u2019s law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p><p> The issue is more important than ever, as shown not only by the Equifax and Facebook fines, but also by the implications for voter manipulation using profiling with personal data in 2020, said Lee Tien, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The organization supported both California\u2019s law and a New York proposal to allow consumers to sue over privacy.</p><p> Privacy rights advocates were caught off guard by the intense state-by-state battle, Tien said.</p><p> \u201cThe big tech players have a lot of funding and they can be everywhere at once, popping up in all these states, and we\u2019re a little more stretched thin,\u201d Tien said.</p><p>New York state\u2019s pending legislation would go even further than California\u2019s law \u2014 establishing a consumer\u2019s right to sue over privacy or security breaches, and a \u201cfiduciary duty\u201d for companies to act in the customer\u2019s best interests, even if it means forgoing profits from selling personal information.</p><p> \u201cThey have to put customer privacy above the company\u2019s profit-making,\u201d said state Sen. Kevin Thomas, the Long Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Consumer Protection and sponsored the New York bill.</p><p> Possible abuses might include insurance companies using genetic information from testing to raise rates, Thomas said, or employment agencies using financial data to offer lower pay.</p><p> Thomas\u2019 bill didn\u2019t make it out of committee this year, but he said he plans public hearings before the 2020 legislative session to gather more information from constituents.</p><p> \u201cCompanies don\u2019t need all this information that can be used against you and there\u2019s no oversight,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cStates have to stand up because there\u2019s no regulation, and it\u2019s not going to come from the federal government, as divided as this country is right now.\u201d</p><p> The Internet Association opposed the New York bill. The law is \u201cunworkable for businesses that want to comply,\u201d said John Olsen, a regional state government affairs director for the association, citing the law\u2019s mandate to get consumer consent before selling data.</p><p> While Vermont established a data broker registry, requiring businesses that buy data to register with the state, many other states saw proposed laws wither under business opposition.</p><p> In Connecticut, state Rep. David Michel, a freshman Stamford Democrat, said his constituents wanted more data privacy, so he sponsored a bill that would have made genetic testing data confidential.</p><p> \u201cGenerally speaking, companies are making money on people\u2019s private data without them knowing. I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d Michel said. The state did establish a task force to study future laws.</p><p>Connecticut\u2019s business community was opposed to that bill and other Connecticut privacy measures that failed, said Louise DiCocco, an attorney for the Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Association.</p><p> \u201cThe businesses we represent around the state think this is not the way to go. The bills that were drafted are too vague,\u201d DiCocco said. \u201cBusinesses need to know exactly what\u2019s expected of them.\u201d</p><p> Opposition from tech, cellphone and general business organizations doomed a number of state laws.</p><p>Hawaii was a typical case: A bill banning sales of cellphone location data without consent, blamed in news reports for creating detailed records of personal lives by so-called location aggregators, passed both houses of the Democratic legislature with little dissent and was set to take effect July 1.</p><p> But after opposition from the cellphone industry, Democratic Gov. David Ige vetoed the bill and called for a task force, telling legislators a \u201clack of clarity\u201d about regulation of a \u201ccomplex national industry\u201d would make the law too hard to enforce.</p><p> CTIA, the association that represents the wireless industry, objected to the bill, complaining of \u201cfurther fragmentation of consumer privacy laws.\u201d And because location data is often anonymous, the group said, obtaining required consent can be impossible.</p><p> In Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Dakota and Texas, task forces or advisory committees were set up after privacy legislation was defeated.</p><p> Privacy legislation was delayed for consideration next year in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. Similar bills failed outright in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana and New Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-4008995</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A19702D6C4C NWBKMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSM-J3R1-JBCN-43K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald News/Sunday Herald News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Robert Hertzberg, a Democrat, during debate on a state data privacy bill. California led the way with a 2018 law but is still struggling to fix flaws before the law takes effect next year. Rich Pedroncelli/The Associated Press</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is Part Three of Stateline's 2019 Legislative Review.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Discomfort over the collection and sale of personal data led to a flurry of consumer data privacy bills in 2019, as state legislatures vied to follow California's lead in giving users more control of personal information.</p><p>But the legislative year ended with more of a whimper than a bang as well-funded tech giants and other business concerns rushed to oppose the bills, and even California is scrambling to fix details of its data privacy law before it takes effect in January.</p><p>Of the 24 states that considered data privacy legislation this year, only Illinois, Maine and Nevada enacted new laws.</p><p>There will be even more pressure for legislatures to act next year: Since sessions ended in most states, a $5 billion fine against Facebook and a $700 million settlement with Equifax over data breaches have brought even more public attention to the issue, as have continued revelations about election manipulations by Cambridge Analytica, which used personal data to profile voters.</p><p>Despite enthusiasm for more privacy rules by legislators and their constituents, many states found themselves bogged down this year in both the details of high tech operations and industry complaints, said Pam Greenberg, a senior fellow for the National Conference of State Legislatures who collected information on state consumer data privacy legislation.</p><p>\"The issue is complex,\" Greenberg said. \"And legislators are concerned about the impact of privacy legislation on both consumers and business.\"</p><p>The Internet Association, representing tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, has lobbied for a national approach, arguing that one federal standard like Europe's 2018 General Data Protection Regulation would be fairer and stronger.</p><p>States should \"allow for a national privacy law to take shape that applies to the entire country,\" said Robert Callahan, the association's vice president of state government affairs.</p><p>\"If a person is video chatting with a grandmother in Florida, while they're in New York, they both should benefit from the same privacy protections,\" Callahan said.</p><p>Many states are waiting for last-minute wrangling over details in the California law before setting their own policies, said Mary Stone Ross, a former CIA analyst who as president of the Californians for Consumer Privacy helped draft that state's legislation as a ballot initiative. The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the legislature to pass them.</p><p>Although last-minute changes threaten \"death by a thousand paper cuts,\" the California law will clearly establish a consumer's right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p>\"There are new rights and it's clearly a big win,\" she said. \"You'll have a big red button on a web page to opt out. A lot of companies will choose to comply.\"</p><p>Bills are still pending that would amend California's law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \"selling\" data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \"consumer.\"</p><p>In Illinois, a law signed last week bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine's new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada's law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p><p>The issue is more important than ever, as shown not only by the Equifax and Facebook fines, but also by the implications for voter manipulation using profiling with personal data in 2020, said Lee Tien, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The organization supported both California's law and a New York proposal to allow consumers to sue over privacy.</p><p>Privacy rights advocates were caught off guard by the intense state-by-state battle, Tien said.</p><p>\"The big tech players have a lot of funding and they can be everywhere at once, popping up in all these states, and we're a little more stretched thin,\" Tien said.</p><p>New York state's pending legislation would go even further than California's law -- establishing a consumer's right to sue over privacy or security breaches, and a \"fiduciary duty\" for companies to act in the customer's best interests, even if it means forgoing profits from selling personal information.</p><p>\"They have to put customer privacy above the company's profit-making,\" said state Sen. Kevin Thomas, the Long Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Consumer Protection and sponsored the New York bill.</p><p>Possible abuses might include insurance companies using genetic information from testing to raise rates, Thomas said, or employment agencies using financial data to offer lower pay.</p><p>Thomas' bill didn't make it out of committee this year, but he said he plans public hearings before the 2020 legislative session to gather more information from constituents.</p><p>\"Companies don't need all this information that can be used against you and there's no oversight,\" Thomas said. \"States have to stand up because there's no regulation, and it's not going to come from the federal government, as divided as this country is right now.\"</p><p>The Internet Association opposed the New York bill. The law is \"unworkable for businesses that want to comply,\" said John Olsen, a regional state government affairs director for the association, citing the law's mandate to get consumer consent before selling data.</p><p>While Vermont established a data broker registry, requiring businesses that buy data to register with the state, many other states saw proposed laws wither under business opposition.</p><p>In Connecticut, state Rep. David Michel, a freshman Stamford Democrat, said his constituents wanted more data privacy, so he sponsored a bill that would have made genetic testing data confidential.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, companies are making money on people's private data without them knowing. I don't agree with that,\" Michel said. The state did establish a task force to study future laws.</p><p>Connecticut's business community was opposed to that bill and other Connecticut privacy measures that failed, said Louise DiCocco, an attorney for the Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Association.</p><p>\"The businesses we represent around the state think this is not the way to go. The bills that were drafted are too vague,\" DiCocco said. \"Businesses need to know exactly what's expected of them.\"</p><p>Opposition from tech, cellphone and general business organizations doomed a number of state laws.</p><p>Hawaii was a typical case: A bill banning sales of cellphone location data without consent, blamed in news reports for creating detailed records of personal lives by so-called location aggregators, passed both houses of the Democratic legislature with little dissent and was set to take effect July 1.</p><p>But after opposition from the cellphone industry, Democratic Gov. David Ige vetoed the bill and called for a task force, telling legislators a \"lack of clarity\" about regulation of a \"complex national industry\" would make the law too hard to enforce.</p><p>CTIA, the association that represents the wireless industry, objected to the bill, complaining of \"further fragmentation of consumer privacy laws.\" And because location data is often anonymous, the group said, obtaining required consent can be impossible.</p><p>In Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Dakota and Texas, task forces or advisory committees were set up after privacy legislation was defeated.</p><p>Privacy legislation was delayed for consideration next year in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. Similar bills failed outright in Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana and New Mexico.</p><p>___ (c)2019 Stateline.org Visit Stateline.org at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stateline.org\">www.stateline.org</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20190731-SH-States-Battle-Big-Tech-Over-Data-Privacy-Laws-20190731SH</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Stateline KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-FK01-JC6P-C435-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Stateline</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Stateline.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The group agreed last year to drop its push for a ballot question in return for a similar state law passed by the legislature.</p><p>California passed a bill under time pressure in June 2018, giving consumers the right to see any of their data collected by a company or website, and the ability to opt out of having it sold to third parties. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it into law. But many amendments fine-tuning the law are still pending with a deadline of September for the legislature to pass them.</p><p>Although last-minute changes threaten \"death by a thousand paper cuts,\" the California law will clearly establish a consumer's right to know what personal data has been collected, and a further right to opt out of any sale of that data, Stone Ross said.</p><p>Bills are still pending that would amend California's law, including measures that would exclude some advertisements from the definition of \"selling\" data and exclude people like job applicants from the definition of a \"consumer.\"</p><p>In Illinois, a law signed last month bans insurers from using genetic testing information to set health or accident insurance rates. Maine's new law bans internet providers from selling personal information without consent, and Nevada's law requires websites and other businesses to provide a way for consumers to opt out of sales of personal information.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9384598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW5-W0R1-F039-F0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 22, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS561440 COLLECTION AGENCIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS541613 MARKETING CONSULTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC8742 MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7323 CREDIT REPORTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7322 ADJUSTMENT &amp;

The alleged violation could reportedly impact up to 7 million users.</p><p>Anyone aggrieved by a violation of the law has the ability to claim $1,000 for negligent violations and $5,000 for intentional or reckless violations. That means Facebook could face billions in damages in Illinois alone. But the law in that state is unique in that it gives private citizens the right to sue, rather than the government, in what is called a private right of action.</p><p>If new biometric privacy laws follow Illinois as a model and include a private right of action, tech companies will have a \"very confusing world that they're going to try to exist in,\" according to Ian Fisher, chair of the biometric privacy practice at law firm Hahn Loeser &amp; Parks LLP.</p><p>On the other hand, Fisher said biometric privacy laws without a private right of action pose less risk to companies that collect biometric data.</p><p>\"If there is not [a private right of action], and it's left to government agencies to enforce, one sees the government agencies generally exercising some discretion and judgment and only going after situations where they perceive harm,\" said Fisher. \"I think where a private right of action is created, you have a totally different group of actors bringing the actions, and they don't have an incentive to exercise the discretion that government agencies would exercise.\"</p><p>Three states   Washington, Texas and Illinois   have biometric privacy laws, though Illinois is the only one with a private right of action.</p><p>Other states are modeling proposals after Illinois' law, said Karla Grossenbacher, co-chair of the biometric privacy compliance and litigation practice at law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP.</p><p>Pending biometric privacy legislation in at least two states   Massachusetts and New York   would allow for some type of a private right of action against private companies. A proposal in California would also allow citizens to bring an action for relief against law enforcement for violating biometric surveillance rules.</p><p>Meanwhile, a California privacy legislation that has already been passed into law and takes effect in 2020 will allow for a limited private right of action. That law will enable consumers to bring civil actions against a business that subjects a consumer to unauthorized access, exfiltration, theft or disclosure of their personal data by not maintaining certain security measures to protect user data.</p><p>Another challenge for tech companies is that biometric privacy laws have unresolved questions in a relatively new legal area, according to Grossenbacher.</p><p>\"The bigger issue with these biometric privacy laws are nothing is defined in them,\" she said. \"What we really need are lawsuits that tell us, 'Okay, what are the parameters of, say, consent, under the Illinois law?'\"</p><p>Fisher echoed a similar sentiment, noting that the Illinois law, which was passed in 2008, presents a lot of challenging legal questions and scenarios that are difficult to answer because the law is the only one of its kind.</p><p>\"It has this incredible exposure to businesses to class claims, but it's young, it has very little guidance,\" he said.</p><p>The solution for companies is a national biometric privacy law that preempts states, Fisher said. Despite chatter from a U.S. Senate working group of bipartisan members, no proposal has yet emerged for a comprehensive federal privacy bill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-53693379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX0-1FK1-JDVW-N1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

With which interlocutors do you intend to work with and how?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We had extensive discussions today, we had them with President Mattarella and Prime Minister Conte as well about Libya. Our mission set is very similar. We recognize that the first and most important thing we need to do is take down the level of violence, achieve a cease fire to convince all the relevant parties that are on the ground there's as well as those that have been supporting from the outside that a political solution is the only one that provides any real opportunity to create an outcome in Libya that is remotely adequate for Italy. But most importantly, for the people of Libya as well.</p><p>So our mission set alongside our Italian partners is to convince all of the relevant parties that the political process must move forward. And I'm hopeful that whether it's the Berlin conference or some of the other work that's going to take place over the coming weeks, that we can achieve that outcome.</p><p>LUIGI DI MAIO, ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): This topic was obviously one which was discussed during all the talks we had last week in New York during the U.N.G.A. And we agree on the principle that in order for there to be a cease fire, there should be no countries which stimulate this conflict on the one side and on the other.</p><p>And the moral suasion that a country like Italy can have is very important on some of the players involved in the conflict, be they Libyan players or non-Libyan players. But of course the role, the moral suasion that a world power like the U.S. can exercise is just as important.</p><p>And we believe that the Berlin conference, if prepared adequately, and by involving the players in the conflict as much as possible, we feel that this can lead to a further step forward. Of course, the step forward has to lead to a cease fire and has to lead towards a political process that can lead to the stabilization of Libya.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vincenzo Nigro -- La Republicca.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning. I'd like to ask both of you to discuss the Iran issue in greater detail. Secretary Pompeo -- do you think that returning to negotiation, be it a direct or indirect negotiation, we all read about the alleged phone call between President Trump and President Rouhani at the U.N.</p><p>But does the Department of State favor a renewal in talks? And is it willing to reduce this maximum sanctions policy against Iran.</p><p>And I'd also like to ask Mr. Di Maio -- in your introductory speech you said that Italy continues to prefer a diplomatic and political discussion to the most serious crisis in the world and as far as the Mediterranean is concerned, of course, the most serious crisis is the Iranian one.</p><p>Secretary Pompeo also mentioned Mahan Air, an Iranian airline company. I didn't understand if Italy will be willing to sanction that airline too.</p><p>And one final remark, today I think marks the anniversary of the killing of the Saudi journalist, Mr. Khashoggi. Do you think that murder will have an influence on the way in which our governments looks towards the main players in the Middle Eastern region?</p><p>DI MAIO: Let me start answering by saying that it's obvious, it's clear that we agree on the fact --</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We are listening to the leadership there in Italy as well as Secretary of State Pompeo. We will get back to that as news develops.</p><p>So far, we heard the Secretary talk about Venezuela as well as Iran. No question so far about this impeachment inquiry. We'll get back to that as news develops there.</p><p>Want to bring in Tennessee Congressman and member of the Homeland Security and Oversight Committees, Mark Green. And Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. MARK GREEN (R-TN): Good to see you -- Maria. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what you heard from Secretary Pompeo. And then we want to broaden out and ask you about the happenings in Washington.</p><p>GREEN: Sure. I really appreciate his stand with Iran and of course the issues in Libya. I think the Berlin conference is going to move us down the road there. What he didn't mention of course, North Korea launching the ballistic missile this morning. I'm sure that will come out -- hopefully it will come out. There will be a question on that.</p><p>And then the impeachment mess, I mean his comments recently have been very strong and I really appreciate his stand there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we've been talking about that this morning. And we want to get your take in terms of how this progresses --</p><p>GREEN: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why there hasn't been an overall House vote to actually vote to launch the inquiry? And is this all about just putting on a show which is what Andrew McCarthy just said when he came on the show. The Democrats just putting on a show to try to delegitimize President Trump?</p><p>GREEN: Absolutely -- Maria. This is a travesty of democracy. I mean every single member of that House, the People's House represents 800,000 people. And when we vote, we're letting the voice of the American people be heard.</p><p>Yet the tyrannical leader of the House, the Speaker of the House is not letting us have a voice in this issue. She's just initiating this inquiry which really isn't official because we should have the opportunity to vote. The process is we vote and then committees go to work, forming articles of impeachment and doing their investigation.</p><p>We're not doing it that way because there are 31 Democrats sitting in seats that Trump won and they don't want to put those individuals on the hot seat. They're afraid they'll lose those seats, lose control of the House.</p><p>So she is going about this without letting the people have a voice or a say in it. And that is a threat to democracy. It is insane. It's crazy. I can't believe it's happening.</p><p>Leader McCarthy has tried multiple times to force a vote and they keep tabling it so that they don't have to vote. It's terrible. It's egregious. It should not be happening in America.</p><p>DON PEEBLES, CHAIRMAN, PEEBLES CORPORATION: Congressman -- Don Peebles.</p><p>GREEN: Hey -- Don.</p><p>PEEBLES: Good morning.</p><p>Doesn't Congress have more important things to do to move the country forward? Don't Americans have other very pressing issues right now? And are any of those things being addressed in this Congress?</p><p>GREEN: So I'll give you an example. I have a bill that would help rural hospitals. I think everybody knows I'm a physician. I'm a businessman --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- stay with us for one moment. I'm sorry -- we want to get back to Italy because the Secretary --</p><p>GREEN: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- just got a question on Ukraine. Let's hear his answer.</p><p>(LIVE EVENT)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- or the accounts that we've all seen of it including the transcript or partial transcript released by the White House accurate and complete. And if you were on the call did you hear anything on that in the conversation that raised a red flag, anything inappropriate or anything that gave you any concerns?</p><p>And then secondly, you told -- you said last week that you -- as far as you knew, everyone at the State Department has acted appropriately in regards to Ukraine and including yourself. And so is that still the case? Is that still your belief?</p><p>If it is, why object to the demand for deposition from the House committees on the hill? And then do you have any -- any concerns at all about what the State Department inspector general is going to be briefing to Hill staffers later today?</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>POMPEO: Thanks -- Matt. I'll try and answer questions four through seven first and then one through three after that.</p><p>Back to, first principles. The predicate of your final question about objecting to what the folks on Capitol Hill have asked is fundamentally not true.</p><p>What we objected to was the demands that were put that are deeply violating fundamental principles of separation of powers. They contacted State Department employees directly, told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department. That's been reported to us.</p><p>They said that the State Department wouldn't be able to be present. There are important constitutional prerogatives that the executive branch has to be present so that we can protect the important information so our partners -- countries like Italy -- can have confidence that the information that they provide the State Department will continue to be protected.</p><p>And so the response that I provided to them was, one that acknowledge that we will of course do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co- equal branch but we're going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system.</p><p>And we won't tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying, intimidating State Department employees. That's unacceptable and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen.</p><p>As for was I on the phone call, the phone call was in the context of now I guess I've been Secretary of State for coming on a year-and-a-half. I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It's been remarkably consistent and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes.</p><p>It's what our team including Ambassador Volker were focused on, was taking down the threat that Russia poses there in Ukraine. It was about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government and to help now this new government in the Ukraine build a successful thriving economy.</p><p>It's what the State Department officials that I have had the privilege to lead have been engaged in and it's what we will continue to do even while all this noise is going on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ok. Chris O'Day -- \"National Review\".</p><p>CHRIS O'DAY, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Thank you both for being here.</p><p>I'd like to I guess address the question to both of you. You can kind of take it in whichever order -- whoever wants to kind of go first.</p><p>Primarily oriented towards I guess what is conveniently termed kind of the belt-and-road these days. But on a somewhat broader basis, not just with Huawei, but does the U.S. have any specific plans in terms of how to counter China's investment in these major critical infrastructure assets.</p><p>And I ask that here because it seems like there is a very wide degree of those assets that are financed or operated in Italy by Chinese companies and in particularly in ports and in Trieste under the you new BRI memorandum that was signed -- bridges, roads and highways as well.</p><p>So it seems like a great deal of Italy's economic infrastructure is kind of moving in the direction of sort of Chinese influence and the I guess underlying point is those types of things tend to require the Chinese companies to work very closely with Italian government and financial institutions and get more deeply embedded in the way decisions are made and the way budget and resource --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ok. Thanks -- Chris.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are watching the press conference in Rome. We just heard secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that one of the issues was that the Democrats contacted staffers directly in the State Department and told them don't hire your own legal counsel.</p><p>I just want to point out that that did not work out well for Carter Page. That's what they did to Carter Page in 2016. They told him, come in, we want to talk to you. Don't have any legal counsel. And then they wiretapped him.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This goes back to what Andy McCarthy was talking about though. Again this is not a formal process. This is a show.</p><p>And it's a stunt by Congress to use this as a political weapon. We won't tolerate the bullying and intimidation of State Department employees. Congress is a co-equal branch of government and what they're doing violates the separation of powers, according to the secretary of state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely right.</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CKE RESTAURANT CEO: Who do these people think they are? The American people need to stand up to this and it needs to show up in the polling. What's going on here is ridiculous. It's horrific. It's anti-American.</p><p>This is -- I can't believe what's going on in Washington D.C. right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's absolutely extraordinary. And we are talking this morning with Congressman Mark Green. Congressman, your reaction to what you're hearing here as well as you were in the middle of a thought on Don Peebles question of doesn't Congress have better things to do. You've got a lot of things hanging in the balance.</p><p>GREEN: Yes. I mean you look at the belt-and-road issue that they're talking about right now. I mean there are incredibly complex issues facing America and facing the world and China's belt and road agreement with Italy is very concerning. I'd love to dig into that.</p><p>But I'll give you another example. I have a bill that would save rural hospitals. It's a 35-mile exclusion and access -- critical access dollars and yet I can't get that bill heard. I even have a Democrat committee chairman who has signed on to co-sponsor the bill. I can't get that bill heard to help rural hospitals in America because the committees are all tied up investigating this president. And investigating with no authority from the House itself.</p><p>So the people of America have no voice. She has shut that down and basically initiated this process on her own as the Speaker of the House. It's unconscionable and as someone said earlier un-American.</p><p>PEEBLES: Congressman -- I think the Democrats though would argue that something similar, the obstruction approach was what was confronting Barack Obama. So when Barack Obama was president, and Republicans had control over Congress during his term, there was obstruction as well.</p><p>Is this the new way politics is done and we have lost the bipartisanship way of governing? Is this what we can see going forward? Or how do the American people get their government to work for them?</p><p>GREEN: You elect Republicans. That's how you do it because you look when we had control of the House, we passed tax reform that has blown this economy up. We passed in the House at least healthcare reform and sent it over to the Senate and there was a little hiccup over there but we did things when we had control of the House.</p><p>And that's what needs to happen. We need to take back control of the House. I mean, Leader McCarthy, as I was -- I think I was starting this thought when you jumped over to Mike's comments, you know, Leader McCarthy has tried multiple times to get a vote on this issue so that the people's voice can be heard in it.</p><p>Every time they table the motion and there's no vote taken. So it's not the way to do business in a democracy.</p><p>PUZDER: Mark -- this is Andy Puzder and by the way, being my congressman, I feel free to ask you these questions.</p><p>GREEN: Fire away -- Andy.</p><p>PUZDER: Impeachment's going to have to be bipartisan. They're going to need the support of some Republicans. The polling is showing that Republicans in the general public are very supportive of the President. Are you seeing any weakness in the Republican caucus on the Hill as far as support for the President in this process goes?</p><p>GREEN: No, I've seen -- I think our caucus is standing pretty firm together. And I will tell you that in the district, in my district, it's hugely supportive of the President and very, very angry about this process.</p><p>So both the caucus is standing together and I think at least in my district the folks who support me are 100 percent behind the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think USMCA has any shot of coming to the floor? I mean is that one of the priorities? Are you going to vote for it if it does and do you expect it?</p><p>GREEN: Absolutely I'd vote for it. It's a great deal. Even liberal economists have said that the USMCA would produce 200,000 plus jobs in America.</p><p>I mean it is a fantastic agreement for farmers. It even helps union members, people that -- you know, typically Republicans, you know, have not reached out to, but I mean this is a fantastic, a fantastic opportunity and we have to get it passed. I'd absolutely support it.</p><p>Do I see it happening? No. I don't have a whole lot of hope that the Democrats are going to do anything but investigate the President. I told the President the other day, he needs to go find his lemonade stand permit from when he was 12 years old because they're coming after that too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. This is an extraordinary moment in time -- Congressman.</p><p>GREEN: It's unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It is unbelievable and we'll see how the voters react. I mean it looks like the President's not having any trouble raising money but, you know, there's an election next year. We'll see how that plays out.</p><p>GREEN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>GREEN: Thanks. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Green joining us there.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back we're talking about big tech, Mark Zuckerberg hitting back. The technology chief sounds off on competition and potential regulation. The legal battle for Facebook coming up.</p><p>Then the best states for your money, Florida attracting residents for sand, sun and tax relief. We're looking at the least taxed states in the country.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are focused on big tech now. Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the hot seat after the company meeting conversation leak. It revealed his hypothetical plan to push back against an Elizabeth Warren presidency over her proposal to break up big tech. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Elizabeth Warren thinks that the right answer is to break up the company. I mean if she gets elected president and I would bet that we would have a legal challenge and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. Does that still suck for us? Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge -- good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you think about Facebook and regulation?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I think his fear is legitimate. I mean here's how it would work. A President Warren can't get legislation from the Congress to break up Facebook because the Fifth Amendment protects -- insulates them from that.</p><p>But she could direct her Department of Justice to commence an anti-trust investigation which would have to show, one, that Facebook monopolizes the market so that's pretty obvious and two, that this monopoly harms consumers.</p><p>Now, the product is delivered for free. So it's hard to find a way that the courts will conclude that it harms consumers. But this type of litigation, think of the Microsoft litigation, think of the AT&amp;T litigation.</p><p>If Elizabeth Warren were elected president and were reelected, I think the case would survive both of her terms. That's how long these things take and that's how expensive they are.</p><p>The government's goal would be to break up Facebook as they broke up the Bell System into many competing entities. They would have to persuade a judge that that is best for consumers and it would take years to make that argument.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is something that both sides agree on. You've got Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz basically both saying that they want to break up.</p><p>Business is shaking in their boots over the potential of Elizabeth Warren winning this. What do you think?</p><p>PEEBLES: Oh yes. Look, I think the Democratic support, the financial support of the Democratic Party are very concerned because they're business people and they're Wall Street business people by and large. And they are concerned about what would happen to their fundamental business.</p><p>I mean what this will become if she gets the nomination, which I don't believe she will is it will be socialism versus capitalism. And Trump can say, hey, you may not like me, you may not like my style, but if you want socialism, here's your person. And if you want to continue our great capitalistic democracy, I'm your only alternative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen -- it's policy over personality.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. I think that it's not just Facebook. we have the leaked audio of Mark Zuckerberg but many, if not all, major technology companies are worried about government regulation. If you were in a business that touches consumers in any way, shape or form and are a tech company, you're worried about much greater regulation. You're even worried about making acquisitions at this point because again you're going to have an FTC -- this is not just Elizabeth Warren. This is virtually any of these Democratic candidates who are running for the nomination and even President Trump, that you're worried about the FTC coming in and saying and looking at every acquisition you're potentially taking --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they even more powerful than they've ever be4en. I mean Google does -- you know, have market share of 90 percent in search.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right. So the statement that Mark Zuckerberg made tells me, that he has a legal team preparing for this already. Even though he's nowhere near any of the nomination. And I agree with you, our pic is going to get the nominee.</p><p>Well look at what the business roundtable just did the other day. Right -- I will not be able to come down to go. Guess what, profits are not our priority anymore. What?</p><p>PUZDER: I'll tell you the truth. I don't think they meant that. The things that they talked about advocating are the kinds of things that would attract millennial customers. I think they actually were, by coming out in favor of the social justice issues, they were actually trying to bring in that customer base which is in the best interest of their shareholders and actually is an exercise in capitalism.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fine but are you telling me that (INAUDIBLE) and the communities that they operate in were not important before? I mean come on, give me a break. It's all PR.</p><p>PUZDER: That's exactly right, it's all Pr. They were just trying to attract that PR --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>PEEBLES: I disagree with that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lie to me. Lie to me and tell me I don't need to lose 20 pounds.</p><p>PEEBLES: I disagree. I believe business has a greater purpose than just making a profit for its shareholders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true.</p><p>PEEBLES: Our democracy is one of the pillars is capitalism and in order for our country to work, it needs to include everybody in its economy. And if you look at how women entrepreneurs have been treated by this nation in terms of the access to capital, access to opportunity, you look at how minorities are being treated, yes corporate America needs to do a heck of a lot better.</p><p>And look JPMorgan -- Jamie Dimon is leading an effort to provide access to capital and opportunity for minorities. I mean, other banks ought to follow what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's done a great job.</p><p>PEEBLES: But this is a new demand. And in order for business to be able to have the American people support an agenda that's pro-business, they're going to have to prove that the system works for everybody. So I don't think -- it's obvious.</p><p>PUZDER: No, that's exactly how capitalism should work. There is a demand for this and businesses are responding to that demand which is in the best interest of their shareholders and will generate more business.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You can't take your eyes off of profit or you won't have a job.</p><p>PEEBLES: No, you can't. But you can be -- by the way, it is more profitable to be inclusive.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: My only point is, you've got to tell me that employees and the communities you operate are important? Really?</p><p>PUZDER: Yes, because --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I guess I made the assumption that you were considering that.</p><p>PUZDER: No but the boy no longer mattered. After Reagan fired the air traffic controller. This set the tone that employees don't really matter anymore. It's profits and it's economic reward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it was upside down with Facebook where Facebook is like kumbaya with all its employees and then with the actual users, they gave companies access to people's data to make money off of it and tried to hide the fact for years and years and years.</p><p>People were going on the live video service and murdering people. There was a man who murdered his infant child and Facebook's attitude was like we've got to figure out how to put a stop to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're a platform. And it keeps happening</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're a classic. you don't do anything about it. You asked for Elizabeth Warren to walk in your front door and rip your company up because you didn't do a better job. You're getting what you got coming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: At a minimum, these companies risk getting rid of this immunity right that they cannot be sued because they're platform companies and not content creators. I'm not buying it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's congressional. If she became president or whoever is president, Donald Trump could do this if the votes were in the congress, could enact legislation to do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nancy Pelosi could but she won't because these are liberal -- these are big Democratic donors, these technology companies and they're too busy trying to take down and annul a president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's too busy with her --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Just so eloquently summarize the resulted in $5 billion fine which was a drop in the bucket.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That sure was, for Facebook.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Biggest fine in history from the FTC.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I suspect there might be more coming -- Judge. I suspect there might be more.</p><p>Great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>PEEBLES: but the big political point i9s Facebook, he's coming out against Elizabeth Warren. This is like a big deal politically. What does it mean for the rest of Silicon Valley, who are they going to support if she's nominated.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Such good point</p><p>All right. Quick break. Quit -- exactly.</p><p>Quick break joining Napolitano. We will see you soon. Fed in focus, next up. we're going to with the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Thomas Barkin on the other side of this break. Stay with us. We're talking manufacturing in America.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. A lot going on this morning. Markets are down. Continuing the selloff yesterday.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the Federal Reserve, there are new concerns about the economy after that weak manufacturing data yesterday. President Trump slammed Fed Chair Jay Powell again.</p><p>Edward Lawrence is live this morning in Richmond, Virginia with the president of the Richmond Fed, Thomas Barkin. Over to you, Edward.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria, and this is -- I'm in a conference in Harrisonburg, West Virginia -- Harrisonburg, Virginia actually, it's the Investing in Rural America is the conference sponsored by the Richmond Federal Reserve. The president of the Richmond Federal Reserve is here, Tom Barkin.</p><p>Let's start right into this, the Fed chairman has said basically the economy is expanding, bringing in the edges of the labor force here. Are we seeing a resurgence in rural America?</p><p>THOMAS BARKIN, PRESIDENT, RICHMOND FEDERAL RESERVE: Well, we got involved in this because our district has a lot of small towns in it, mining towns, agricultural towns and manufacturing towns. And the numbers would suggest to you that employment to population in those towns is 10 to 12 points lower than it is in the bigger cities.</p><p>So, I don't think I'd say there's resurgence quite yet but we are finding a lot of very positive things happening across our district and we brought a lot of the practitioners to this things together for a couple days to share that.</p><p>LAWRENCE: And manufacturing has been in the news. President Trump has blamed the Federal Reserve for a slowdown in manufacturing. Any truth to that? I mean, the dollar is very strong. Are you seeing that with the labor force and rural America?</p><p>BARKIN: Well, Manufacturing data's been weak for some time. I think it's very much related to trade and trade related uncertainty.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Do you think that -- is manufacturing in a recession? The St. Louis Federal Reserve President Jim Bullard believes that.</p><p>BARKIN: I don't know how to define a recession on a particular industry basis. What I would say is the manufacturing performance seems to be down. The most recent numbers would be modestly contractionary.</p><p>LAWRENCE: How about for the economy? We're talking about the federal funds rate where it is, do you think the people in rural America, those folks are at the edges of the workforce coming in. Do they need a rate cut going forward in order to stimulate to keep this going?</p><p>BARKIN: What's interesting in most of these small towns is there are jobs available. But we're having trouble getting the people to the jobs. Sometimes that's education and it's matching. Sometimes that's transportation, infrastructure, sometimes that's broad band.</p><p>I think there are jobs out there but this issue of how do we connect people to jobs, that's something we're focused on.</p><p>LAWRENCE: And you don't see that as connected to the federal funds rate and lower rates (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>BARKIN: I see it much more connected to education. I see it much more connected to the ability to get to a job, the ability to have child care, to help yourself out while you're travelling to a job. Those are the kinds of issues that we're talking about at this conference.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Going forward, the next couple FOMC meetings, you're in the room on the discussions there. Will we see a rate cut going forward, do you believe? Which way is the --</p><p>BARKIN: There's a lot of time between this and the other meetings. At least for me, my posture is very balanced. I'm looking at the data on the economy and I'm looking at the data on uncertainty.</p><p>We've taken out some insurance as you know in the next couple meetings. We'll see what happens with that insurance and what kind of impact it has and importantly, there's a lot of information that's going to come in between now and then.</p><p>LAWRENCE: The expansion keep going, do you see a recession in the future?</p><p>BARKIN: I'm very hopeful we'll see an expansion on the -- to continue on the positive side, consumer spending continues to be strong, people have jobs, that's a very positive thing. Inflation seems to be firming.</p><p>On the other side, business investment has been flat for most of the year and I think that has a lot to do with confidence and in particular business confidence and what they see as significant uncertainty in the political and the geopolitical environments. And they're having trouble deciding how to invest without that certainty.</p><p>LAWRENCE: How hard is it to navigate then with that uncertainty in terms of rate cuts and what the Fed does for their tools?</p><p>BARKIN: I think it is hard to navigate with uncertainty and there's different schools of thought about, you know, whether one should move faster so that you can get ahead of the uncertainty or as William Brainard once said, you know, the higher the uncertainty, the more of a caution.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Last question here, on inflation last week you said the uncertainty is and I want to quote you here, limiting firms' ability and willingness to raise prices. So do you see inflation artificially low then?</p><p>BARKIN: I think one of the challenges we have against our dual mandate is getting inflation up to our two percent target.</p><p>I do believe as I talked to businesses, one of the big challenges they have is the confidence that they can pass on costs and price increases and they've been conditioned over many years, expectations are very anchored. But it's also the case whether it's the transparency on the internet, big box retailers and the power of the purchasing departments that they're very nervous about their ability to pass on prices.</p><p>When uncertainty is high -- human nature does suggest that we have a little bit more caution and pushing through a bigger price increase.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Tom Barkin, I appreciate your time for this.</p><p>Maria, you heard there, no recession coming up in the future there and -- from the Richmond Federal Reserve, they're looking at investing in rural America and the rural towns may benefit going forward. We'll see. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll be watching that. Great interview, Edward. Thank you Edward Lawrence and Thomas Barkin. We thank you sir.</p><p>Coming up, money saving moves, where to go if you want the biggest bang for your buck. We've got the list of the best states for taxes.</p><p>Then, on the payroll, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert is here. She's weighing in on the new California law, allowing college athletes to make some money. Stay with us, a lot to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are focused on state taxes now. Personal finance site Kiplinger out with the list of the best and worst tax states in America. Jackie DeAngelis is all over it. Good morning, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you. And it certainly pays to live in certain states according to this study.</p><p>So first let me explain how they did it, they took a hypothetical married couple that makes -- that lives in a $400,000 home and they crunched the numbers in each state. They didn't just look at income tax but they also looked at sales tax. They looked at gas tax. Syntaxes, alcohol, tobacco, etcetera.</p><p>And here is what they found. We'll start with the friendliest states first. Wyoming, Nevada, Tennessee, Florida, Alaska the top five in that order. Washington, South Dakota, North Dakota, Arizona, New Hampshire. Very interesting here, that's six of the seven states are states that don't have income tax.</p><p>Texas is the only one that didn't actually make this list in terms of the tax friendly. But also when I looked at Tennessee, North Dakota, Arizona, New Hampshire, very low state income taxes on a relative basis. Actually, New Hampshire only taxes interest and dividend income which I thought was interesting.</p><p>Let's look at the flip side in terms of the least tax friendly states. Illinois topped the list there. Connecticut, New York, as we were talking about in the break. You can imagine Wisconsin, New Jersey on that list as well.</p><p>Very interesting about New York, one of the highest for income tax. One of the highest for sales tax. Then you have the city tax, if you live in New York City. And housing prices are also falling here according to recent reports. That's because the mansion tax, then the transfer tax and you lost your SALT deduction. So, you know, it's interesting to see how many people are moving out of the state.</p><p>Don, to your point as we were talking, there's a Bloomberg article that says 277 people per day are leaving New York. And that's nearly double from a year ago.</p><p>So what I think is interesting about this conversation is people certainly think about their wallet when they're thinking about where they live. Even if their policies may be a little bit more liberal and I think when it comes to 2020, that may be something certainly that drives votes. We saw it last time and as long as the economy stays strong, that's how people are thinking right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I wouldn't even mind paying that whole litany of taxes, which I do anyway.</p><p>DEANGELIS: You do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If in fact -- if in fact things were going well in New York. There was a robbery outside the building last week. The crime is picking up. What do you think, Don?</p><p>DON PEEBLES, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, PEEBLES CORPORATION: Well, I think New York is indicative of some of the other cities that are struggling right now. New York is run poorly. There's no way to get around it. It's got --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it is about policy?</p><p>PEEBLES: Oh, I think it's definitely about policy and SALT didn't help New York. But New York is taxing fewer and fewer people because they're leaving. So the tax base is shrinking. They are raising taxes that perpetuates this exodus out of the city.</p><p>But quality of life, just like what you just said, you'd pay more and be willing to pay this if you had a good quality of life. The biggest challenge in New York is quality of life.</p><p>You look at the cities that -- and the states that we were just discussing, Wyoming, a great quality of life. Nevada, great quality of life. Florida, great quality of life. Tennessee, great quality of life.</p><p>So people are saying we're going to -- so you can go to these states, they have no state income tax and a good quality of life versus the highest tax state in the country overall for the top one percent, top 10 percent is New York and what are you getting for your money? You can't use the public school system either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you moved to Tennessee, right?</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CEO, CKE RESTAURANTS: I did, and Don and I were talking earlier, a part of this -- a big part of this is who's leaving the state, it's not just that people are leaving; it's the tax base that's leaving. It's people that pay the most in taxes who are leaving the state to go other places.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) that's what happened in California. California has I think 144 people that pay a huge percentage of tax in the state, those people if they're able to do so are leaving. Same thing's happening in New York. You have taxpayers leaving.</p><p>So, why -- you know, in California, why would you pay 13.3 percent in income tax plus 37 percent in federal tax, just that. That's over 50 percent slightly, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's not even real estate.</p><p>PUZDER: Yes, that's -- it's not gas tax, it's not syntax. You go to Tennessee, you pay 37 percent. And Nashville is a wonderful -- I can tell you, Nashville is a wonderful place to live. So it's a real problem for these high tax states. They need to either cut their taxes or cut their spending.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You know what you're doing though, you're inviting all these rich blue liberals into these low tax states and what they do is they move and then vote in people like, well, de Blasio, that changes the economic makeup of these towns and states.</p><p>PEEBLES: They don't vote for -- I can tell you that the description of voters you're talking about did not vote for de Blasio. They either didn't vote or they voted for someone else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they turning Texas blue -- are they turning Texas blue? Are they turning it purple? That's what she's talking about.</p><p>PUZDER: I go to the drycleaners or the drugstore and I have people -- you know, people ask where you're from, I'll say California. They say, well, you're not going to vote Democrat now that you're here, are you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: But look at Andrew Gillum in Florida, he was a contender and running against Ron DeSantis for the governor of that state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he got close -- he got close.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He got close. Now, (INAUDIBLE) he was in favor for Medicare for All which rips up Medicare as we know. Which I still argue is one of the reasons that he didn't win because older Americans get wind of that and they say no way, no how and they won't vote for you.</p><p>But again, these -- when these people leave New York City, they take with them their liberal political ideas and their votes and you mark my words.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's not just individuals though, right, Jackie? You had General Electric leave Connecticut, remember that? I mean, you had the big hedge fund managers leave as well, New York.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Absolutely. If you can move a corporation, if you're an employee that is using technology and you are not chained to your location, who wouldn't want a better quality of life and to keep more of what they are earning.</p><p>I have friends that just on an anecdotal basis who constantly are moving down to Florida because they don't have to pay the income tax and it's beautiful. The weather is nicer and they're happier.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The shame for the people who live in here in New York City are the residents who can't move and they are forced to wade through what is essentially an open sewer. Their lives -- they are not as safe as they were. There is excrement all over the streets. Small businesses, big businesses are being -- there are theft going on every day. People are shop lifting. They're not being arrested. And it's not going to get any worse until something changes.</p><p>PEEBLES: Yes, the pendulum will change. New York's the great -- one of the greatest cities on the planet and its resilient and New Yorkers will get engaged. They're busy. They've been focusing on other things and some people have just said we've had it, we're leaving.</p><p>But they're going to -- as things get worse, New Yorkers are not going to tolerate it. They'll change leadership. They'll change approach to governing and then you'll see what -- you know, you'll see a change. But New York tends to have this pendulum that swings to one extreme and then you get a Giuliani and then kind of calming down with a Bloomberg who we had for 12 years. Then pendulum going --</p><p>PUZDER: So are we there yet?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, by the way, that's why they took away the SALT deduction because they want to force policy to change, because they were hiding it behind these -- you know, they were hiding the high taxes behind the deduction. I know it hurt, it hurt all of us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, one other thing, a lot of these cities across the country, the smaller and mid-size cities, they are not prepared for the influx of residents. We were talking about this.</p><p>PEEBLES: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The infrastructure, just the roads in a place like the Research Triangle area of Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, even Charlotte, North Carolina, they do not have the capacity to handle the number of people who are flooding into these areas.</p><p>So in terms of the pendulum swinging back, you get more pro-business policies here. You clean up the streets. You clean up the crime in New York and you'll have a reverse migration of people from these smaller cities back here.</p><p>PEEBLES: No, I don't think you're going to have a reverse migration. I think you'll see New York stabilize at a -- at a different level and a different place. Technology is liberated, companies and individuals to work pretty much anywhere in the planet.</p><p>And so, we're going to -- there -- these other states and these other cities are going to compete for businesses and employees and it's going to be driven by quality of life and business policies.</p><p>Amazon, their second headquarters is in Crystal City, Virginia where the individual tax rate is only 5-1/2 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But worst traffic in the nation, hands down. Because I had to drive right by there going to my parents' house.</p><p>PEEBLES: And they're opening in Nashville.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to -- we're going to be talking to one individual who actually is enjoying Florida as well, Ken Langone is in the studio today. He's in New York and in Florida. We're going to talk all about that.</p><p>Jackie, great reporting. Thank you so much.</p><p>Quick break and then college stars in focus, WNBA Commissioner, former Deloitte CEO, Cathy Engelbert is here on the debate over paying university athletes, that's next. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A new California law making it OK for college athletes to earn money from endorsements. The controversial legislation could have monumental effects on the future of university sports.</p><p>Joining us right now is the commissioner of the WNBA, Cathy Engelbert. And Cathy, it's great to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>CATHY ENGELBERT, COMMISSIONER, WNBA: Great to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on the move as actually a former college athlete, right, yourself?</p><p>ENGELBERT: Yes, you know, having played, obviously this is a complex issue, much more complex that's probably being reported. I think for the WNBA players and the NBA players they're speaking out. We welcome that. We're going to monitor its impact on our league and I think I can as a former college athlete, I think the jury is still out on whether this is the right move.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what's the downside? Tell us about the downside of this.</p><p>ENGELBERT: Well, again, you know, people follow college athletics. In big part, you think about big college football programs, big college basketball programs on both the men's and women's side. And you think of the fan base for that, and they're following it because they're not paid athletes. And it isn't diluted by all the endorsements and things like that.</p><p>So I think it's about a fan base, especially a student fan base, which many of these colleges especially at the smaller D-1 where I played. So I do think there's -- it's complex and it's complex from an economic perspective around how you sell your image on in social and things like that.</p><p>PEEBLES: But isn't it -- isn't it a little bit out of balance, though when you look at the amount of money that college athletics is generating for these universities? The trade used to be you play basketball as a student athlete or you play with some other sport in college and you get a degree for free, so that was a trade-off.</p><p>And -- but college athletics is a very big business to many schools, especially many D-1 schools and so the athletes to be struggling and panhandling essentially to survive is unfair as well.</p><p>And so that's why you've had some of these suspensions and so forth, it's correct that they're struggling for money, so.</p><p>ENGELBERT: That's why I said it's a complex issue where economics comes into it for the school, for the player, and again, I think the fan base as well, but it's complicated.</p><p>PEEBLES: Yes, but it's free labor. I mean, you think about it, the players are being -- they're playing, they're generating millions of dollars for the university and they're getting nothing. And no -- most of them leave there without a degree because the schools have used them as a economic resource, as opposed to keeping their end of the bargain by educating them. And I think that because they want to keep them eligible so they can generate more money for the schools.</p><p>ENGELBERT: Right, the good news is for the WNBA and the women athletes, 95 percent are college graduates and do get their degree but I get you -- I get your point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the players in the WNBA need to get paid more. They need to figure out a way to make sure that they're compensated so these young women don't have to play overseas in the off season which puts a great strain on their bodies that comes straight from a friend of mine.</p><p>ENGELBERT: Great point, we're in active Collective Bargaining negotiations as we speak. And so that's been something coming from a three decade career over in the business world that's been great to come over and look at. We all have the same goals around Collective Bargaining, that's to work on the player experience, to bring more fans into the game and work on the economic model for the league. So that's what I'm working on now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And of course, you've got those negotiations ongoing right now.</p><p>ENGELBERT: Yes, that's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cathy, it's good to have you. Thank you so much.</p><p>ENGELBERT: Great to be here, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cathy Engelbert joining us right now.

A separate group of states announced an investigation into Facebook's dominance on Friday. The Department of Justice , the Federal Trade Commission and Congress are also conducting probes.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said only that the investigation will look at 'whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.' </p><p>Reports in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal say Google will be the primary target.Google expects state attorneys general will ask it about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday .Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many aspects of the internet that it's hard to imagine surfing the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Experts believe the antitrust probe could focus on at least one of three aspects of Google's business that have caught regulators' eyes.An obvious first place to look could be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes \u2014 because the alternative could be not reaching customers.Advertising'There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,' said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online advertising business.Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators have also investigated here \u2014 ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. But it appears regulators are growing more concerned not just with the effects on regular internet users, but on smaller companies as well.'On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'' King said. 'But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.'AdvertisingOne outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, she said.Then there's Google's smartphone operating system, Android. Another acquisition of Google's, the system is the most widely used in the world.European regulators have also fined Google to the tune of $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced handset makers to install Google apps, thereby increasing its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones. It's also possible U.S. states won't follow in Europe's footsteps. They could, for instance, focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, yet another acquisition Google made, that time in 2006.Google executive Walker emphasized that the company's products help people every day.'Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation: Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone_translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,' he wrote.

A separate group of states announced an investigation into Facebook's dominance on Friday. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress are also conducting probes.</p><p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said only that the investigation will look at \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.\" Reports in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal say Google will be the primary target.</p><p>Google expects state attorneys general will ask it about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday .</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many aspects of the internet that it's hard to imagine surfing the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Experts believe the antitrust probe could focus on at least one of three aspects of Google's business that have caught regulators' eyes.</p><p> An obvious first place to look could be online advertising. Google will control 31.1 percent of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes -- because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p> \"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.</p><p> Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p> Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online advertising business.</p><p> Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators have also investigated here -- ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. But it appears regulators are growing more concerned not just with the effects on regular internet users, but on smaller companies as well.</p><p> \"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" King said. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p> One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, she said.</p><p> Then there's Google's smartphone operating system, Android. Another acquisition of Google's, the system is the most widely used in the world.</p><p> European regulators have also fined Google to the tune of $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced handset makers to install Google apps, thereby increasing its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p> It's also possible U.S. states won't follow in Europe's footsteps. They could, for instance, focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, yet another acquisition Google made, that time in 2006.</p><p>Google executive Walker emphasized that the company's products help people every day.</p><p> \"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation: Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone_translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" he wrote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMS-dc3eca874c304cac81ba6a381e6edcb9649192</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289890E1F2A214 NWBKMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-B121-JBCN-40XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401948</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Commercial Dispatch<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p>Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama.</p><p> Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p> The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p> The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p> Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p> Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p> One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p> \"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday .

But with intense pressure building at all levels of government to combat so-called \"patent trolls\" \u2014 companies that exist primarily to sue other companies over often-questionable patent infringement claims \u2014 a growing number of states are now jumping into the fray. Officially known by the less pejorative terms \"patent assertion entities\" (PAEs) or \"non-practicing entities\" (NPEs), these companies rarely manufacture or create any real products of their own. </p><p>Rather, as the Federal Trade Commission notes, they are \"firms with a business model based primarily on purchasing patents and then attempting to generate revenue by asserting the intellectual property against persons who are already practicing the patented technologies.\" In other words, PAEs buy patents, often on the cheap, and then threaten to sue companies that may be using technology covered by those patents unless that businesses fork over significant amounts of money. The key word here is \"may.\" Critics contend that too often the patent claim doesn't actually apply to the technology in question or the patent is too vague to even know if it does. But the cost of proving that in court can be prohibitive \u2014 into the millions of dollars in many cases. In fact, the more money is on the line the higher the legal fees can be for the company defending itself. And because most patent infringement attorneys work on a contingency fee basis, the patent holder has minimal or no upfront costs. Sufficiently lodged between a rock and a hard place, many companies threatened with such litigation simply roll over and write a check for the amount the PAE is asking for...which conveniently is often just a bit less than the cost of taking the case to court. Although tech giants like Google, ATT, Verizon and Apple remain the top targets for such infringement claims, small businesses are fast getting into the crosshairs as well. A 2012 Boston University study showed that \"small and medium-sized entities made up 90 percent of the companies sued, accounting for 59 percent of the defenses, and paid about 37 percent of the aggregate costs in 2011.\" Some of those came for acts as mundane as using ubiquitous technology like WiFi. One Texas-based PAE called MPHJ Technologies, which in 2012 purchased a series of patents for the total price of $1, has sent threatening letters to over 16,000 small businesses nationwide that have copying machines with the capability of scanning a document and sending it to someone via email with a single push of a button. Those letters demand the companies pay between $1,000 and $1,200 per employee to \"license\" the machines for use or face a lawsuit. None of the companies receiving the letter actually built the scanners in question, but MPHJ claims that isn't the issue anyway; they say the infringement happens when users connect the machines to the Internet. That drew the threat of a deceptive practices lawsuit from the FTC. But MPHJ was anything but cowed; in January the company beat the agency to the punch, filing a suit against the FTC claiming it was illegally preventing it from enforcing its patent holdings. None of this has occurred in a vacuum. Congress passed a moderate reform measure in 2011, the America Invents Act, which created a \"first to file\" system that gives patent ownership to the person who filed their application first regardless of whether someone else later claims they invented the product beforehand. The first major Congressional patent reform in over half a century, it also allows vendors \u2014 for example the maker of the copying machine \u2014 to wade into the legal fight on behalf of their customers. President Barack Obama followed that in 2013 with five executive orders that, among several things, push the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to tighten up requirements for issuing patents in the first place. The U.S. House of Representatives took action as well, passing HB 3309, the Innovation Act of 2013, last December. That measure would force patent infringement litigants to name the product they say is being infringed upon by its specific name and patent number. It also would require disclosure of the entity that actually owns the patents and stands to gain financially from the litigation (MPHJ, for instance, has over 101 subsidiaries it uses to conduct its activities) and impose a fee-shifting element that would force a failed litigant to pay the winner's legal fees. A handful of bills are also pending in the U.S. Senate, though how closely whatever passes there will resemble the House version \u2014 which President Obama favors \u2014 remains to be seen. All this would naturally lead one to presume that anyone pursuing a patent infringement suit is a patent troll and that such suits have become epidemic. Neither assertion, however, is entirely correct. Many reform advocates again cite the Boston University study, which also claims that PAE suits make up about two thirds of all patent infringement cases. But that figure encompasses just suits filed by patent holders that aren't also a manufacturers of products, including universities, individual inventors and other research facilities. A 2013 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office that excludes those entities places the figure at less than 20 percent of all those filed from 2007 to 2011. \"There is a large debate right now over exactly how big of a problem this actually is,\" says Peter Lee, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who specializes in patent law. \"It really depends on the definition we use. Are universities patent trolls? And what about large incumbent technology companies? They produce products, but many also have enormous patent portfolios that they use in a leveraged manner.\" \"I would be skeptical of taking any particular figure at face value,\" he adds. Even so, states are now getting into the game as well. Last year, Vermont became the first state to pass legislation (HB 299 2013) that bars so-called \"bad faith\" infringement suits or threats. The law gives judges a variety of conditions and factors designed to help them determine what does and does not constitute a bad faith suit. The law also allows the infringement target to countersue someone found to be suing in bad faith and authorizes the attorney general to bring civil actions against that individual as well. Several states have followed suit this year, including Idaho, Oregon, and South Dakota. At least five more \u2014 Georgia, Virginia, Utah, Wisconsin and Alabama \u2014 have sent bills to the governor, with Maryland expected to do so any day now. Bills are still pending in at least 14 states, including Kentucky, Missouri and Hew Hampshire, where they have all cleared at least one chamber. \"This is an indication of how broadly the pro-reform lobby is pushing its agenda,\" says Russ Merbeth, Chief Policy Counsel for Intellectual Ventures, Inc., a PAE that is often cited as a patent troll by reform advocates. \"There are a lot of big tech companies that have found it to be much more cost effective to take their liability issues to Congress or state legislatures to deal with than to deal with them in the marketplace.\" <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-00-32/0028.2014-04_2D00_07-StateNet.jpg\">http://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-00-32/0028.2014-04_2D00_07-StateNet.jpg</url><br/> Merbeth also insists that without companies like his, many individual inventors and small businesses would not have the means to enforce valid patents they legally hold when a larger company infringes on those patents. He says most PAEs are fine with new rules that rid the playing field \"of the bad actors out there,\" but called the current Congressional bills \"omnibus, blunderbuss\" proposals that would do more harm than good. How much state actions impact what happens in Congress remains to be seen. Law professor Lee says questions still remain over how much authority states have to police bad faith infringement cases, but he believes they will play a big role in whatever reforms eventually do come out of Congress. \"This action at the state level could definitely spark more federal action,\" he says, noting that it also wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if PAEs had to deal with varying state laws. \"Not being certain of how bad faith is defined state to state could have a chilling effect on those that operate like trolls,\" he says. The United States Supreme Court is also a major player, having already heard oral arguments in multiple patent cases this year. One of those, Alice v. CLS, came just last Monday and seeks to define just how broadly a software application can be applied. Alice Corp., an Australian-owned company, claims CLS Bank illegally used Alice-patented software in some of its computer programming. CLS counters that the program in question is ubiquitous and not worthy of specific patent protection. The High Court's rulings are due in June. Some reformers believe a ruling in favor of CLS Bank would be a severe blow to PAEs, though nothing resembling a fatal one. And regardless of whatever reforms the states, the courts and Congress devise, they won't solve what Lee says is the underlying issue: too many patents already in the system. \"About 40 percent of all the patents challenged in litigation should never have been granted in the first place,\" he says. \"Even if we reduce now the number being issued, there are still tons out there that will be around for decades. So we're not really close to the end on this issue at all.\"<br/> The above article is provided by the State Net Capitol Journal.

The billions who use their services for making social media posts, uploading videos or searching ads are targeted by the tech companies for their personal data - a prized asset that enhances the companies' power. Regulators are examining whether the companies have used their market power to crimp competition, potentially raising prices and hurting consumers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dissatisfaction with what federal authorities have done so far may be pushing some states to band together to run their own investigations, possibly eyeing more aggressive sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission's recent $5 billion fine against Facebook over privacy violations, for example, was criticized by consumer advocates and a number of public officials as being too lenient. </p><p>\"The states see it as part of their role to fill a vacuum,\" said Jay Himes, an antitrust lawyer in New York. Himes, a former head of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's office, worked on the states' antitrust case against Microsoft about 20 years ago. </p><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday her probe will look into Facebook's dominance and any resulting anticompetitive conduct. </p><p>A separate group of state attorneys general is announcing Monday in Washington the launch of an investigation into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers,\" an advisory from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday. The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, citing sources they didn't identify, have reported that target will be Google. </p><p>Both groups of state attorneys general include Democrats and Republicans. Joining James, a Democrat, in the Facebook investigation are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia. </p><p>With some 2.4 billion users around the globe and a huge social media presence, Facebook has sparked outrage with a series of privacy scandals and its use by Russian operatives in the 2016 presidential campaign. </p><p>\"Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,\" James said. </p><p>Critics worry that Facebook can squash competitors either by buying them or using its enormous resources to mimic services they offer. That ultimately could reduce viable alternatives for consumers looking, for instance, for comparable services that do less tracking for targeted advertising. Businesses, including mom and pop shops, might have to pay more for ads if they have fewer choices to reach consumers online. </p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>The lawmaker leading that investigation, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said Friday the states' probe of Facebook is \"completely appropriate.\" </p><p>\"Facebook has proven time and time again that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\" Cicilline said. </p><p>The states have the power to make big changes to the tech industry - especially if enough of them band together, said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a group that advocates for the breakup of corporate monopolies. Though states have limited jurisdictions, he said, once a few of the bigger states get involved, changes can come that can affect most of the country. </p><p>\"You really have to break their power, and I think the states are more likely to do that than anyone else,\" Stoller said in an interview. </p><p>Facebook said it plans to \"work constructively\" with the state attorneys general and welcomes a conversation with policymakers about competition. </p><p>\"People have multiple choices for every one of the services we provide,\" said Will Castleberry, a vice president of state and local policy. \"We understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face, not only in the U.S. but around the globe.\"</p><p>Google said it welcomes government oversight to make sure companies comply with the law. The company said it has already responded to many government agencies around the world on how it conducts its businesses and expects state attorneys general to ask similar questions. </p><p>\"We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition,\" Kent Walker, a senior vice president for global affairs, said in a blog post. </p><p>Big Tech won't be an easy target. Current interpretations of U.S. law against monopolies don't obviously apply to companies offering inexpensive goods or free online services. </p><p>Traditional antitrust law focuses on dominant businesses that harm consumers, typically through practices that raise prices for consumers. But many tech companies offer free products that are paid for by a largely invisible trade in the personal data gleaned from those services. Others like Amazon offer consistently low prices on a wide array of merchandise. </p><p>Gordon and O'Brien write for The Associated Press.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0101593021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0H-XBW1-JBM5-R51G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 7, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That came with a simple press statement. The event on Monday, formally announcing the Google investigation and discussing Facebook, was a news conference in the nation's capital.</p><p>  Ken Paxton, the Republican attorney general of Texas, another large state with a sizable legal staff, is taking a lead role in the Google inquiry.</p><p>  In a statement, Mr. Paxton noted that there was nothing wrong with a company becoming big and powerful. But, he said, ''we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.''</p><p>  The state inquiries coincide with bipartisan scrutiny of the tech companies in Washington, by House and Senate committees, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Federal officials are examining the practices of Amazon and Apple as well as those of Facebook and Google.</p><p>  The states can play a key role, often in concert with federal regulators and Congress, in building evidence and public support for major investigations. That was the pattern in the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft, when 20 states joined the Justice Department in suing the software giant in 1998.</p><p>  The highly public declaration on Monday was partly political theater, but it was also seen as a signal of the states' commitment.</p><p>  ''This kind of high-profile announcement creates expectations, and it does put pressure on the federal agencies to follow through -- to seriously investigate these companies,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. ''And by making it bipartisan, they are wisely laying the groundwork for what could be a lengthy and far-reaching investigation.''</p><p>  The investigation into Google has been joined by 48 states as well as the attorneys general for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The states that have not joined the inquiry are Alabama and California, the home to Google and Facebook, Mr. Paxton said at the news conference.</p><p>  Major antitrust inquiries can take years, whether they result in legal action or not.</p><p>  The states have been looking at the big tech companies amid rising concerns about their power in markets and their influence in public communication and political debate. The states formed a multistate unit called the Tech Industry Working Group months ago.</p><p>  They steadily built up support, both getting bipartisan backing and enough states to marshal the legal resources to pursue in-depth investigations and potentially an antitrust suit.</p><p>  Each investigation has a smaller core group of states, evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. And they are supported by a larger collection of states that agree to join the effort.</p><p>  ''Obviously, we're just beginning, but this is going to be a thorough investigation,'' said Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado.</p><p>Colorado is a member of the core group in both the Facebook and the Google investigations, and Mr. Weiser is an antitrust expert, having served as a federal antitrust official in the Clinton and Obama administrations. ''I'm not worried about having the legal and intellectual firepower for these investigations,'' he said.</p><p>  Unlike the Microsoft case, which focused on a single company, the concerns about today's tech giants cover a range of markets and issues.</p><p>  The various investigations reach beyond the companies' size, wealth and market power -- the usual concerns of antitrust regulators. The companies' handling of consumer data, their ad-targeting practices and their role as gatekeepers of communication are all under scrutiny, both in the United States and in Europe.</p><p>  In 2017, Josh Hawley, who was the attorney general of Missouri, began an investigation of Google. At the time, it was a lonely pursuit. He said the large, bipartisan effort announced on Monday was a sign of the times.</p><p>  ''This really speaks to the increased awareness and concern'' surrounding the big tech companies, said Mr. Hawley, now a Republican senator from Missouri. ''They're hearing from people in their states.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Ken Paxton, attorney general of Texas, right, and Karl Racine, attorney general of the District of Columbia, on Monday.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama.</p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p>Several advocacy groups applauded the announcement, saying the power of tech companies has gone unchecked for too long. Antitrust enforcement \"can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive,\" the group Public Knowledge said in a statement.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday . On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post.</p><p>\"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" Walker wrote.</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>___</p><p>Lerman contributed from San Francisco.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama.</p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p>Several advocacy groups applauded the announcement, saying the power of tech companies has gone unchecked for too long. Antitrust enforcement \"can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive,\" the group Public Knowledge said in a statement.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday . On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post.</p><p>\"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" Walker wrote.</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>___</p><p>Lerman contributed from San Francisco.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states.</p><p>Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>Google expects the state authorities will ask the company about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Joining Paxton, a Republican, in the investigation are the attorneys general of almost all U.S. states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" Walker wrote. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone -- translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\"</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>Experts believe the probe could focus on at least one of three areas that have caught regulators' eyes.</p><p>A good first place to look might be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes -- because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>------</p><p>Lerman contributed from San Francisco.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama.</p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p>Several advocacy groups applauded the announcement, saying the power of tech companies has gone unchecked for too long. Antitrust enforcement \"can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive,\" the group Public Knowledge said in a statement.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday . On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post.</p><p>\"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" Walker wrote.</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>___</p><p>Lerman contributed from San Francisco.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama.</p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p>Several advocacy groups applauded the announcement, saying the power of tech companies has gone unchecked for too long. Antitrust enforcement \"can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive,\" the group Public Knowledge said in a statement.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday . On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post.</p><p>\"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" Walker wrote.</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>___</p><p>Lerman contributed from San Francisco.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states.Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. </p><p>Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.Google expects the state authorities will ask the company about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday.Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.Joining Paxton, a Republican, in the investigation are the attorneys general of almost all U.S. states and the District of Columbia.Google responseGoogle has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" Walker wrote. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone   translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\"But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"Three possible targetsExperts believe the probe could focus on at least one of three areas that have caught regulators' eyes.A good first place to look might be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes   because the alternative could be not reaching customers.\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is the most widely used in the world.European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121568063317934251762900103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X15-10R1-JB5Y-N2X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><timeReceived>9:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\"</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-centre project in Alabama.</p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p>Several advocacy groups applauded the announcement, saying the power of tech companies has gone unchecked for too long. Antitrust enforcement \"can help consumers and innovative competitors access markets for platforms that are more fair and more competitive,\" the group Public Knowledge said in a statement.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>\"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice-president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday . On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post.</p><p>\"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,\" Walker wrote.</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favouring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favouring their own services over others,\" King said.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p><p>___</p><p>Lerman contributed from San Francisco.

If you believe that populism means advocating for the interests of ordinary people over the interests of the wealthy, the answer is of course he hasn't. The fact is that actions taken by Trump during the early days of this presidency have offered up a steady and undeniable repudiation of the much-ballyhooed populist message that swept the Republican into the White House. Look at what's happened in just the first one hundred days. </p><p>The new president has trotted out one executive order after another in his rush to overturn Obama-era, consumer-friendly protections. From overturning Internet privacy rules, to freezing financial regulations requiring financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients rather than the advisers' bottom line, to proposing to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Agency that has recovered more than $11.8 billion for twenty-nine million consumers since 2011, Trump has been steadily chipping away at a system that protects privacy and supports fairness, transparency, and the bottom line of consumers, students, and small businesses. The truth is that Trump has betrayed the trust of ordinary Americans and sucker-punched nearly every American who isn't a bigwig of Wall Street, a member of the 1%, an executive at a fossil-fuel company, a multi-national corporation, a bank, or the financial industry or a member of the Trump family. Sadly, this massive deregulation scheme is going to affect the bottom line of ordinary Americans for years to come. That's the bad news. Fortunately, there's under-the-radar good news brewing in state legislatures across the country, where legislators are introducing truly populist measures called fair-repair acts. Real Populism at Work: Fair-Repair Legislation Seeking to tip the scales in favor of consumers, small business owners, and farmers, eight states\u2014Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, Tennessee, and Wyoming\u2014are currently advancing bipartisan bills guaranteeing the rights of individual owners and independent repair shops to choose where and how to repair electronic equipment\u2014like smart phones and smart appliances, computers, and high-tech farm equipment. These measures seek to break up the monopoly on after-market repairs that limit repairs to the original manufacturers. Up until now, that proprietary system has resulted in significantly higher repair costs to businesses, farms, and consumers. These state-led initiatives will not only lower costs but protect good, local jobs\u2014jobs that cannot be outsourced\u2014in the small-repair business sector that has, up until now, been effectively locked out of the electronics repair market. Not surprisingly, fair-repair legislation has drawn support from a diverse cross-section of independent business groups. Among them, associations representing farmers and ranchers, who increasingly are purchasing and using sophisticated high-tech equipment with embedded electronics, have been particularly active. And if you think that fair-repair legislation is something that only Democrats and progressives would love, think again. Among the more vocal supporters of this commonsense legislation are the American Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Union, the Iowa Farm Bureau, the Michigan Farm Bureau, the Nebraska Farm Bureau, the New York Farm Bureau, and the Texas Farm Bureau. This year legislators in New York State are hoping to lead the way and become the first in the nation to pass a fair-repair bill, called the Fair Repair Act, S618. New York's bill, like fair-repair bills in other states, requires that manufacturers provide fair access to servicing information, technical and service manuals, custom replacement parts and tools, security updates, and diagnostics. Who would oppose measures like these? Measures that would create and retain jobs, foster competition, increase business for independent repair-shop owners, save consumers money, and extend the life of electronic equipment that otherwise would end up in landfill. The answer is large manufacturers and big tech, including companies like Apple, Cisco, Xerox, and John Deere, all of whom are lobbying hard to prevent fair-repair bills from even coming up for a vote. Lobbyists Prevailed Last Time Around in New York While Massachusetts Got the Job Done The track record on fair-repair legislation is mixed. In 2016 a bill introduced in New York State, similar to the one working its way out of committee this year, was stopped in its tracks by lobbying efforts spearheaded by the big four: Apple, Cisco, IBM, and Xerox. On the positive side, in 2012 Massachusetts scored the first major success when the state passed with 87.7% voter support the Massachusetts Right to Repair Initiative\u2014a right-to-repair bill targeting independent car-repair businesses. This is how Automotive News reported that breakthrough in 2014. That was the year when carmakers struck a deal with Massachusetts to make the state's law the national standard beginning with the 2018 models. ' 'A patchwork of fifty differing state bills, each with its own interpretations and compliance parameters, doesn't make sense,' ' says Mike Stanton, president of the Association of Global Automakers. 'This agreement provides uniform clarity our industry needs.' 'Under the deal, all auto companies would make their diagnostic codes and repair data available in a common format by the 2018 model year, as the Massachusetts law requires. In return, lobbying groups for repair shops and parts retailers would refrain from pursuing state-by-state legislation.' ' Pay attention, America. Forget about the sideshow antics of the phony populist in the White House. The fair-repair fight is what real populism looks like. This fight deserves our support.

The document, first reported by Axios, says Texas' attorney general office \"anticipates litigation in this matter.\" The document does not detail the scope of the investigation, and the Texas Deceptive Practices Act covers a wide range of potential harms.  Texas is among a group of states whose attorneys general are probing Apple over potential violations of a consumer protection law, according to a document obtained by the Tech Transparency Project through an open records request and shared with CNBC.   The document, sent in March and first reported by Axios , states that the Consumer Protection Division of Texas' attorney general office \"is involved in a multistate investigation into Apple for potential violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\" It says the investigation was started \"for enforcement purposes\" and the office \"anticipates litigation in this matter.\"   The document does not detail the scope of the investigation and the Texas Deceptive Practices Act covers a wide range of potential harms. Apple shares were down more than 4% Thursday.   Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad and its CEO will face Congress on Monday alongside Big Tech peers.   A spokesperson for the Texas Attorney General's office said that due to its internal policy, \"we cannot comment on, confirm or deny any potential or ongoing investigations.\"   An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Cyber Workforce: The Trump administration is laying out a new strategy to build up and retain the federal government's dwindling cybersecurity workforce.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Not Waiting for Washington, States Move Forward on Driverless Car Regulations</p><p>In San Ramon, Calif., an effort is underway to use autonomous vehicles -- driverless cars -- to improve access to public transportation. In the parking lot of an upscale office park, a self-driving, French-manufactured minibus is being tested for use, although it's not quite ready for human passengers.</p><p>California regulations allow for testing and experimentation of self-driving vehicles, even as a lack of federal rules still prohibit commercial sales or interstate travel, reports Jacob Fischler, who was on assignment in the Golden State.</p><p>The regulations mean the minibus, which has both a license plate issued by the state Department of Motor Vehicles and a sign in the back window warning it doesn't comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, can legally operate on public streets.</p><p>States are at the forefront of the driverless car revolution. The federal Transportation Department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have so far offered only guidance and requested autonomous vehicle developers to submit voluntary safety self-assessments. And despite high-profile bills in both chambers during the 115th Congress, federal lawmakers have yet to enact an autonomous vehicle law, leaving states as the primary forces shaping policy.</p><p>Phil Ting, a Democratic member of the State Assembly from San Francisco who's written laws related to autonomous vehicles, says he's a big supporter of the technology, but doesn't want it to be rushed to the public in a way that would jeopardize safety.</p><p>\"There's no question, long-term, that this technology is here to stay. It's just a matter of when, not a matter of if,\" he says in an interview off the Assembly floor in Sacramento. \"We obviously don't want the technology to be deployed before it's 100 percent safe and people are able to fully control it.\"</p><p>Ting says states should be allowed to add their own regulations on top of a federal baseline, but \"a lot is lost\" by not having federal standards to provide regulatory certainty across the country. \"It'd be great for the feds to have one set of rules that we can all operate under and there really is a set of laws that everyone's following across 50 states,\" he says.</p><p>Read Jacob's full report here. </p><p>2. Countries Poised to Agree -- and Jostle -- Over Cryptoassets</p><p>In the age of fintech -- when entrepreneurs around the world are working to bring money into the internet age by disrupting the traditional financial services sector in ways we have yet to fully contemplate -- what could go wrong?</p><p>Regulators across the world are wary that the technology, even in its infancy, could put consumers, investors or even financial systems at risk, writes Chris Brummer, a CQ Roll Call contributor and author of Fintech Beat. Still, they see the potential for innovation and believe a national advantage could be acquired if enough of the new technology takes hold in their home countries.</p><p>Almost as interesting as fintech itself is watching the regulators react. Brummer reflects on preparations for a G-20 meeting in Japan in June. \"The preparations are meant to reflect an effort by policymakers to forge and celebrate common ground for cryptocurrency oversight,\" he writes. \"But it's also possible the meeting will reveal considerable fissures -- and how far the international community must go to figure out a truly harmonized regulatory approach.\"</p><p>Brummer guesses the diplomats will reach consensus on an important but relatively narrow area of oversight: multilateral efforts to curb money-laundering and terrorism financing. Consensus looks less promising in other areas, however.</p><p>Read more of Chris's fintech analysis here. </p><p>3. Hawley Calls Silicon Valley a 'Source of Peril' for America's Future</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri freshman who has made a name for himself in Washington by ruthlessly -- and publicly -- taking on large technology firms, is intensifying his rhetoric.</p><p>In a speech at the Hoover Institution on Thursday at Stanford University (Hawley's alma mater), the senator sought to coin the term \"attention arbitrage,\" akin to financial arbitrage -- simultaneously buying and selling an asset to capitalize on a temporary price difference -- and accused Big Tech companies of using such a strategy to exploit users.</p><p>\"Consider for a moment the basic business model of the dominant social media platforms,\" Hawley said. \"Users' attention is bought by the tech giants and then immediately sold to advertisers, for the highest price of course.\"</p><p>Hawley explained his view that \"attention arbitrage,\" unlike its financial counterpart, is, in a sense, a gift for tech companies that keeps on giving. In finance, an arbitrage gap closes when prices even out. On social media, however, \"it's preserved by hijacking users' neural circuitry to prevent rational decision making about what to click and how to spend time.\"</p><p>\"Or, just to simplify that a little bit,\" Hawley said, \"it's preserved through addiction.\"</p><p>In the speech, Hawley sought to link the ubiquity of technology platforms and social media in daily life to increased depression, loneliness and suicide, especially among teenagers.</p><p>\"All of these social consequences, these are significant, you might even say that they are severe, and the question we need to be asking is what is the role of social media in driving them, in encouraging them, in promoting them, and is this really something that is good for our society?\" he said.</p><p>Hawley's remarks are available to view in their entirety on his YouTube page. </p><p>4. Pentagon Says Chinese Cyber Threat Could Grind Down U.S. Military Power</p><p>Chinese cyber operations aimed at the Pentagon \"threaten to erode U.S. military advantages,\" according to the Defense Department's latest annual report to Congress on military and security developments in the People's Republic.</p><p>The report, released Thursday, said furthermore that the intrusions \"imperil the infrastructure and prosperity on which those advantages rely.\"</p><p>Attacks on the U.S. government by Chinese hackers continued throughout 2018, the report said, and mostly focused on spying --\"accessing networks and extracting information.\" </p><p>In addition to the military, China has targeted the diplomatic, economic, academic sectors and sought information that could \"benefit China's defense high-technology industries, support China's military modernization, provide the [Chinese Communist Party] insights into U.S. leadership perspectives, and enable diplomatic negotiations.\"</p><p>Targeted information could also allow China to gain knowledge of the military's inner workings \"that could be exploited prior to or during a crisis,\" the report said.</p><p>\"The accesses and skills required for these intrusions are similar to those necessary to conduct cyber operations in an attempt to deter, delay, disrupt, and degrade Department of Defense operations prior to or during a conflict,\" it said.</p><p>Despite the strong warnings, the report states: \"China believes its cyber capabilities and cyber personnel lag behind the United States, and it is working to improve training and bolster domestic innovation to overcome these perceived deficiencies and advance cyberspace operations.\"</p><p>The Pentagon's full report is available here.</p><p>5. Trump Signs Order to Help Bolster Cybersecurity Workforce</p><p>The Trump administration announced steps to address a shortage of cybersecurity workers across the federal government, including sponsorship of a national competition and allowing cyber experts to rotate from one agency to another.</p><p>President Donald Trump issued an executive order Thursday that directed the Department of Homeland Security to work with the Office of Management and Budget to create a rotational program that will \"serve as a mechanism for knowledge transfer\" across agencies.</p><p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of DHS, along with OMB and other agencies will also develop an annual cybersecurity competition for federal employees called the President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition, the order said. The first such challenge will be held in 2019 and will award at least $25,000 to the winner, according to the order.</p><p>The steps are intended to address a shortage of as many as 300,000 cybersecurity professionals across the federal government, according to DHS. The efforts are intended to attract cyber experts from private industry to consider working for the government and also assess whether workers currently not working in cybersecurity may have the aptitude and skills to switch jobs.</p><p>The idea of rotating cybersecurity experts across the federal government was also the aim of a bipartisan bill that passed in the Senate last week. The bill, known as the Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act (S 406), was backed by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and John Hoeven, R-N.D. Lawmakers have for years urged the DHS to find ways to fill the shortage of cybersecurity workers in the federal government.</p><p>Peters, Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I. said the administration's move was long overdue.</p><p>\"We have a serious deficit in the number of skilled cyber defenders to protect our critical assets in cyberspace, a deficit compounded by the growing threats we face,\" Langevin, a co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said in a statement. The president's order will help address shortfalls in both the government and private-sector cybersecurity workforce, Langevin said.</p><p>But it's still unclear how well the efforts will succeed, because top administration officials told reporters in a call last week that the order is not backed up by any additional funds for testing, recruiting or holding competitions. Details of how much more money the effort will need are still being worked out, a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>The executive order is available here.</p><p>  -  Gopal Ratnam </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ's daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

But some state officials feel that Washington bears some of the blame for the tech industry's string of scandals in the first place. Lawmakers in Congress long have struggled to adopt a national law targeting tech giants'data-collection practices, while federal agencies have allowed many of the headlinegrabbing mishaps at Facebook and Google to go unpunished.</p><p>In response, states like Arizona and Mississippi now are taking aim at Google for the way it collects and monetizes web users' data. The District of Columbia, meanwhile, is challenging Facebook's business practices in court. And there are \"numerous bipartisan discussions\" among Democrats and Republicans about other areas where attorneys general can coordinate their attention on big tech, Landry said.</p><p>\"We are in a moment where the federal government's level of effectiveness and engagement on a range of issues, on technology, consumer protection and privacy, is limited,\" added Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado. Absent federal intervention, he said, \"states in general or state AGs are able to act.\"</p><p>Asked about the criticisms, Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice president of state and local public policy, said the social giant has had \"productive conversations\" with state AGs. \"Many officials have approached us in a constructive manner, focused on solutions that ensure all companies are protecting people's information, and we look forward to working with them,\" he added in a statement.</p><p>Google declined comment for this story.</p><p>The appetite for action seemed apparent last week, when state officials gathered in Washington for a series of events including an annual forum with the National Association of Attorneys General, where Landry is president. Concerns about the tech industry's privacy practices were on full display, while a few miles away, the District of Columbia appeared in court to argue that Facebook had deceived its users about its approach to collecting and monetizing their data. The lawsuit stems from Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data about roughly 87 million of the social-site's users without their knowledge or permission.</p><p>Federal watchdogs have been probing the matter for nearly a year, and they could soon bring a historic fine. But D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine opted not to wait for his federal counterparts, and he filed his case in December, which Facebook has sought to dismiss on grounds that D.C. lacks jurisdiction. Both sides are set to air their next round of arguments in front of a D.C. Superior Court judge on March 22. A slew of additional states, including New York and Pennsylvania, are proceeding with Facebook probes of their own.</p><p>Other state attorneys general have set their sights on Google, fearing the search, advertising and mobile giant knows too much about consumers - and can easily squash its competitors. Some states'calls for stronger antitrust enforcement stand in stark contrast with Washington, where federal regulators investigated Google but ultimately decided in 2013 against breaking apart the company.</p><p>The latest to take aim was Arizona's GOP attorney general, Mark Brnovich, who began investigating the tech giant's data-collection practices in 2018.</p><p>Last week, Brnovich reaffirmed his concerns with Google's use of location data gleaned from Android smartphones during a private event for fellow Republican attorneys general, according to a person who attended the gathering but asked not to be identified because it was off record. Brnovich also raised new questions about Google's search practices, particularly the company's approach to surfacing results to queries about local businesses, the person said.</p><p>Asked Thursday if the states needed to open an antitrust probe of Google, Brnovich replied: \"Maybe,\" adding: \"I think there are a lot of us in the AG world that are collecting information, trying to get documents, and trying to get to the bottom of whether that's a reasonable step or a reasonable option.\" He said he could not comment on any open investigations.</p><p>Google's challenges could span far beyond Arizona. Before becoming Minnesota's attorney general, Democrat Keith Ellison argued in Congress for the federal government to embark on an antitrust probe of the tech giant. Ellison's office declined comment for this story. In Missouri, meanwhile, the state embarked on a wide-ranging antitrust and privacy investigation into Google under former Attorney General Josh Hawley, who left the office for the U.S. Senate in January. A spokesman for his successor declined to say if it's still under way.</p><p>Louisiana's Landry slammed Google last week for being \"more and more manipulative\" with its search results. And in Mississippi, Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood has sued the company for its handling of students' data. For years, the two sides have warred repeatedly, with Google at one point suggesting that the Democratic attorney general had wrongly targeted the company with the aid of its foes in the movie industry. Hood faulted Google for trying to \"send a message to other states that we will sue you.\"</p><p>\"You cannot allow this power to accumulate in the hands of this few people,\" Hood said. \"At some point, there's going to have to be a reckoning for it.\"</p><p>In these and other probes, state attorneys general are powerful in their own right: They can leverage local laws to fine companies for their misdeeds, and in some cases, their rules are tougher than what the federal government has at its disposal - especially in California under a landmark privacy statute adopted in 2018.</p><p>But they often band together to take aim at common targets, and at their most effective, state attorneys general can prod the federal government to do the same. The tech industry learned that lesson firsthand two decades ago, when state attorneys general helped drive a landmark U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft - and sought later to block a settlement out of concern the federal government had been too soft on the company.</p><p>The most recent wave of activity began in September, when the Justice Department asked attorneys general to discuss the power of Facebook, Google and online platforms. The session in Washington had been designed to probe claims that some tech companies censor conservatives - a concern Democrats don't share - but the conversation proved far more wide ranging, with Mississippi's Hood and others weighing whether to partner in a formal way to study big tech companies.</p><p>Roughly six months after that DOJ summit, Xavier Beccera, the Democratic attorney general of California, said their early talks were \"perceived as something worthwhile.\" He acknowledged there's been \"increased discussions among the state AGs\" about the privacy challenges and other troubles posed by some of the tech industry's biggest players.</p><p>Beccera added: \"I think everyone's trying to get a handle on what we can do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Citizen News Service Photos; Above, a man using a mobile phone walks past Google offices in New York.

States from Vermont to Florida, and from Michigan to California, have all been overwhelmed by the unprecedented number of workers laid off during the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Unlike Oregon, though, many other states have made dramatic changes in their benefits programs to address their backlogs and make it easier for workers to contact state employment departments.</p><p>Some states have contracted with big tech companies to accelerate claims processing. Others took steps to manage the number of calls each day to prevent their phone lines from becoming overloaded. At least one state moved to pay laid-off workers with long-delayed applications, even before the applications had been approved.</p><p>The Oregon Employment Department has resisted major changes, arguing they would actually slow down the processing of new claims while the state took time to implement new procedures.</p><p>Instead, the department has added hundreds of new staffers to process jobless claims over the past two months and opened a new processing center in Wilsonville. Reaching those centers is no easier, though \u2014 the phone lines are jammed and the few calls that get through spend an average of more than three hours on hold.</p><p>More than 400,000 Oregonians have filed jobless claims in the first months of the coronavirus outbreak and the state\u2019s jobless rate has soared to 14.2%, the highest point on record.</p><p>The state has a backlog of 38,000 regular benefits claims. That total excludes thousands of self-employed workers and contractors who are newly eligible for benefits. Oregon won\u2019t say how many of those applicants are waiting for payments.</p><p>While Gov. Kate Brown has been largely silent on the state\u2019s benefits crisis, the employment department is facing growing outrage from legislative leaders of both parties and from Oregon\u2019s congressional delegation. A state House committee plans to take up the issue at a hearing this afternoon.</p><p>\u201cOur single income households and families living month to month cannot afford to wait any longer. The system is failing them,\u201d House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, wrote in a statement late Friday. \u201cI am out of patience and our vulnerable Oregonians are out of money.\u201d</p><p>The jobless benefits situation in other states varies widely.</p><p>Florida, which faces one of the nation\u2019s largest applications backlogs, has stumbled repeatedly to address unpaid claims. The issue has become a major political liability for Gov. Ron DeSantis, who recently blamed unemployed Floridians for making mistakes on their jobless claims forms.</p><p>In Vermont, though, state officials didn\u2019t wait for the crisis to metastasize. That state, too, faced a backlog of unpaid claims and overloaded phones \u2014 so it responded in April by sending $1,200 relief checks to applicants awaiting approval. The payments apparently went outside of the bounds of federal regulation, so the state could end up responsible for covering those payments if applicants turn out not to be eligible.</p><p>Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Rhode Island, Kansas, New York and other states turned to Google and Amazon for assistance in upgrading their phone and computer systems.</p><p>California opened its phone lines to claims centers 12 hours a day, seven days a week, beginning in April. But the state still faces a severe backlog.</p><p>Illinois, Michigan, New Hampshire and New York all restricted unemployment claims to specified days based on certain letters in their names, according to Reuters. Minnesota restricted calls based on claimants\u2019 Social Security numbers.</p><p>After Congress voted in March to fund a waiver of the usual \u201cwaiting week\u201d before newly unemployed workers are eligible for benefits, many states moved immediately to implement the waiver. Oregon, though, said it would not waive the waiting week \u2014 even with federal funding \u2014 because it would take too long to reprogram the state\u2019s antiquated computers.</p><p>It\u2019s a decision that would have cost laid-off Oregon workers several hundred million dollars. The governor reversed course following news coverage of the situation under pressure from the state\u2019s congressional delegation.</p><p>But Oregon still hasn\u2019t implemented the waiver and has set no timetable for doing so. That means Oregonians are waiting indefinitely for those benefits checks from their waiting week, while workers in other states already have their benefits.</p><p>Overall, it\u2019s not clear whether the other states\u2019 measures have put their claims systems in a better position than Oregon\u2019s. All have experienced stumbles, according to news reports, though it appears the worst of the issues in other states played out in April.</p><p>Oregon ruled out paying long-delayed claims proactively the way Vermont did, employment department director Kay Erickson told The Oregonian editorial board in an email last week.</p><p>\u201cAdvancing funds is not allowed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe federal government requires states to individually determine benefit eligibility before paying any benefits.\u201d</p><p>And despite Oregon\u2019s overloaded call centers, she wrote that phone calls are still the best way to resolve unprocessed claims.</p><p>Erickson has refused interview requests for several week to address the issues with benefits payments. And she is not scheduled to speak at today\u2019s legislative hearing, either, with a deputy slated to appear instead. Neither the employment department nor the legislative committee responded to queries Tuesday on why Erickson will not testify.</p><p>On Tuesday, though, Erickson issued a statement announcing \u201cProject Focus 100,\u201d a concerted effort to address the state\u2019s claims backlog.</p><p>\u201cWe know how frustrating it has been for those who are trying to reach us about the status of their claims and have been unable to get through,\u201d Erickson wrote.</p><p>The employment department will continue adding employees to process claims, she said, and will continue prioritizing older claims by tasking more experienced employees to address outstanding issues. And beginning last week, the department began sending emails and making robocalls to notify applicants when their claims had been received.</p><p>\u201cNavigating this crisis is a collective effort,\u201d Erickson said, \u201cand Oregonians know how to work together to overcome hard challenges.\u201d</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mrogoway@oregonian.com\">mrogoway@oregonian.com</email> @rogoway</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In Michigan, the state restricted claimant calls to certain days based on their last names to reduce volume and help everyone get through.
