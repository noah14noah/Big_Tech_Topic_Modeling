She is the Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. And  as always, you make us smarter, so thank you so much for coming on. What do  you need from J. Powell? Is it more of an indication of kind of forward- looking of how many rate hikes? Is it something on the inverted yield curve  and what that means as it happens or discontinuity?</p><p>ANNE RICHARDS, CEO, M&amp;G INVESTMENTS: I think just no surprises. I think  people are not expecting any fireworks and I think delivering that would be  actually a good underpinning to the markets, particularly after the  volatility that we saw in the first quarter, and that change and tone of  the markets where you saw bonds and equities both moving down rather than  up. So that increased volatility, that correlation of the wrong way, the  way that people don't like correlations to go. So I think the fed here --  we've had those interest rate rises up to now, market isn't expecting  anything, no surprises will be good results.</p><p>LACQUA: What is the fed's main dilemma right now?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, I mean, feds always have dilemma about the path of growth,  about the expectations of markets, about inflation. Actually, corporate  earnings are doing pretty well. They've been ahead of expectations.  Inflation, we've got enough inflation. It doesn't look like we have too  much inflation. We're kind of on target on inflation, I would say. So I  don't think there are too many dilemmas. I think that the challenge is  simply don't do a misstep that spooks anybody at this point, particularly  when you set this in a wider context, so a lot of uncertainty around trade,  around some of the geopolitical relationships. I think the mantra is don't  mess up here, stead as she goes.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Anne, when you look at the M&amp;G Investments and  when you look at the mathematics of bond bear markets, I believe that is  yield higher, prices lower. It's never a smooth gradient, there're always  jump conditions. What are the kinds of jump conditions that we could see in  the bond market where we get jumps in yield and lower prices suddenly?</p><p>RICHARDS: So it's this -- always against this backdrop, there're stuffs  that could happen that would shock the market into doing different things.  It's very hard to predict what those are in advance, which is a tripe thing  to say. We all know that. But we have -- we are moving this year from a  position of net bond purchasing by central banks to a situation where we've  got net bond issuance right around the world. And the market is still  adjusting to what that looks and feel like. Actually, you've got a big  buyer who is no longer going to be buying, if you like, right around the  world. And I think that is the tipping point. It's about the demand and  supply for those bond issues that are out there. So I think, to me, that is  the big one that we're navigating this year. It is a different backdrop to  bond markets, in general.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Francine, this is really important on what she just said. Anne  Richards goes down microeconomic principles when you look at a big  macroeconomic view from 30,000 feet, I think. I really agree with that,  that this is about microeconomics here forward for Chairman Powell.</p><p>LACQUA: It is, Tom. But if we bring it back to the markets, Anne, what do  clients want? I mean, what kind of strategies do they ask of you?</p><p>RICHARDS: So I think smoothing has definitely been something. I mean,  people have got quite used to this relatively low volatile world, at least  in listed markets and so -- and conventional markets. You could argue,  there has been a lot of volatility. Non-conventional markets like digital  currencies and Bitcoin, all of that sort of stuff. But conventional  markets, volatility really had become very subdued. And suddenly there's  been that shock back into volatility worlds. So removing that volatility,  so trying to seek out where you have counter-correlated assets to kind of  smooth that path is definitely one of the things that people are out there.  Having said that, I think a lot of people are look at the underlying power  of earnings that we've got through coming from the corporate sector. And  looking at the trade-off of the risks that you now see and still not again  a lot of real yield out of bond markets and still getting quite a  powerhouse in terms of earning growth from equity markets and saying,  actually, the price of our extra volatility and equity markets might be  worth paying because you can really see the fundamentals coming through. So  I think there's a number of -- it really depends always on utility curves,  preferences. What is it that is most important to individuals? And there's  no one summary you can say, all individuals want this or all individuals  want that. So I think those are two of themes that we would see coming  through in conversations with clients.</p><p>LACQUA: I mean, has the conversation shifted in the last couple of weeks  because there's a little bit of a slowdown in economic growth worldwide?  And actually, what does that mean again for a market sentiment in the  future and the correlation with monetary policy?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's fascinating actually. See, people -- how quickly sentiment  changes and what people talk about. So some of those things that I just  perceive that people are suddenly talking about again, gold has come back,  but inflation, gold. Suddenly -- we didn't talk about that six months ago.  Suddenly, that's back on the conversation again. So that's one thing. I  think that the oil price, frankly, is another. You've seen the oil price,  which everybody said was very subdued for a very long period of time. And  it sort of snuck up on us instead of gradually, gradually, gradually been  moving into territory where despite the fact that you've not seen the  investment really start go back in again. Actually, the economics start to  make that more appealing. So there's mentioned in conversations around oil  price commodities and the knock-on effects of that. So I think we're going  to see a change in tone in some of those conversations. The whole tech  conversation of what does a successful business model look like in  technology. Again, 2016-2017, big tech was winner almost regardless of what  it did. Much more discrimination coming into the conversations with clients  about what a good business model is, what a bad business model is and  (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Anne Richards, Megan Greene writing in the FT today on where is  inflation, we're all waiting for it. I guess we'll hear about it in the  non-press conference today at the debt (ph) meeting. Where is the  inflation?</p><p>RICHARDS: Gosh, what an interesting question. Inflation comes in all sorts  of different places and unexpected places, I think. So conventional  inflation is varying country-by-country, market-by-market quite  significantly, oil price will be feeding through into inflation numbers,  that's absolutely the case. But on the other hand, if you see what's  happening on the retail high street, you can see the high street is  challenged still by falling process in many areas, where on the other side  coin, you've got internet prices actually going up in some respect. So  you've got some quite an interesting contrast there. So I think, overall in  inflation, it's still a very difficult picture, I think, for anybody to  grasp the totality of it. So oil price starting to feed through is  definitely one, and some of the big currency moves, you're actually seeing  currency induced inflation rather than fundamental underlying inflation.</p><p>KEENE: Exactly. Well, that's one of our themes here through Surveillance  this morning. Anne Richards with us with the M&amp;G Investment.</p><p>LACQUA: We're back with Anne Richards, Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments.  Anne, when you look at again what your clients want, how you position on  your portfolios, trade tensions seemed to be on the back of it because at  least Steve Mnuchin is showing up in a couple of hours I think to try and  discuss, is this still the main risk for the world economy or is it  monetary policy?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's (inaudible). So I think trade is clearly out there as  something that people are concerned about because the global economy, in  terms of the totality of the pie, if you like, has been expanded over  recent decades by global trades. That's been the big driver of much of the  global expansion. So if that is really under threat, then there is a risk  that we end up fighting over a smaller -- a share of the smaller pie as  opposed to it. And I think that is the concern that's out there. Having  said all of that, the way that America has been conducting trade policy  negotiations, and indeed other international negotiations has been about  ripping up the playbook, throwing everything up in the air, getting  everybody uncertain and then coming to a compromise at the last minute, and  you can see that. And a classic example of that is the way the North and  South Korea conversations are going. Whereas if you think back to last  year, it was all about who was going to hit the big the red button first.  And now, we actually have come far farther than anyone ever anticipated  than we would have done a year ago. So I think there's a little bit around  this whole global trade tariffs conversation which will affect -- will be  affected in the same way ultimately. On the European thing, I just  absolutely do not believe that the U.S. wants to mess up relationship with  Europe. But President Trump clearly wants to get the maximum that it  possibly can out of any bartering that it does with Europe, hence, the  conversations that have been had with Mr. Macron, with Mrs. Merkel over the  last week or so. So I think that's what we're going to play out and I think  most of that, as when we look at it, think that that is the central  scenario. But in that sense (ph), there are risks.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you worry about European growth having peaked? We're seeing --  again, the data is not that clear actually, right? It depends on kind of  some of the PMIs are better than expected in certain countries, worse than  expecting others, should we assume that it doesn't get any better than this  for your portfolios?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, I think on Europe. I mean, I think there are still a lot of  things that are going in the right direction. But there have been a few  things which have come together simultaneously. People are starting to get  concerned about the impact of Brexit on Mainland Europe. That wasn't a  concern. That is beginning to be a little bit of a concern. You will see  people deferring or shaping some of their investment plans because of that.  So that will have a feed through on that. The fact that in Germany and  France and Italy, so with the big three countries there, there are  political tensions and relatively unclear and insecure governments in  different forms and shapes in place there. Again, it doesn't help the view  that we're going to get a kind of coordinated negotiated settlement on  anything very much. So there were a few things in the background that just  make people feel a little bit less comfortable than they did six months ago  in Europe. But actually, the direction of travel is still okay.</p><p>KEENE: Anne Richards, Martin Wolf and the FT with a brilliant walkthrough  of China's attitude as the U.S. officials travel to China, I guess, to have  a big argument on trade. What does it mean for your international  investment at M&amp;G? Do you lighten up or is this an opportunity to acquire  Pacific Rim shares?</p><p>RICHARDS: So, look, on the whole China story and what is being driven  through that China story, I think the -- you are seeing a change yet again  in the outreach that's coming out of China. And that is very, very  powerful. So the ability of business to get direct access to markets that  it was not able to get direct access to before in China has been -- that's  a very significant announcement. The fact that she is in place for much  longer than might have been anticipated and will be continuing to drive  forward in that economic empowering, I think, creates a very positive  backdrop to what's going on in China. So I think we would remain positive  on the direction of travel</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there of M&amp;G stays with us.</p><p>Joining us now is Francisco Jeronimo, IDC Senior Research Director for  European mobile devices and Anne Richards of M&amp;G Investments where she's  Chief Executive. So thank you both for coming on the program. Francisco,  what do we learn about Apple?</p><p>FRANCISCO JERONIMO, SENIOR RESEARCH DIRECTOR, IDC: We learned that a  powerful brand continues to perform when they continue to deliver value  that consumers perceived as something that improves overtime. And after ten  years when the first -- after the first -- the launch of the first iPhone,  and when the market is already contracting. And then last year, the decline  for the first time, the smart phone, Apple delivering these kinds of  results at a higher price point, it's remarkable and definitely a stellar  quarter for Apple.</p><p>LACQUA: Francisco, let me talk to you about the iPhone and then I want to  ask Anne a little bit about the financial surrounding Apple. But if you  look at the iPhone year-on-year revenue growth -- Tom, bear with me. I know  you don't like candle charts, but this is a really good one. We heard from  the Chief Executive of Apple saying, look, iPhone X was stellar, best  performing, but that's what you'd expect. How does he continue on this  trend in the quarters to come?</p><p>JERONIMO: That's a challenge for them. Of course, it's a challenge. But it  really shows that the brand proposition and then the perception of the  consumers and enterprises also have about Apple is not just about the good  looking iPhones, it's about everything that comes with the device. The  ecosystem and all the services and also a very important topic that he  mentioned in the call, the privacy and security, and indeed IDC did a  recent survey to enterprise in Europe. And we found out that the top reason  that why enterprises choose an iPhone is because of security and the  perception that an iPhone brings around security. And this is a very  important value for consumers and enterprises in the smart phone,  particularly nowadays with all the news and the candles (ph) around privacy  leaks and all of those problems.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. We can take about Facebook. We also need to talk about Snap. I  know I'm going to find Tom on Snap. I'm sure it's like #tomtom or something  like that. He's keeping it secret. Anne, when you look at Apple, they have  a lot of cash. And finally, they're returning it to shareholders. Do you  like the stock (inaudible)?</p><p>RICHARDS: So hundred billion coming back to shareholders, I mean, that can  be quite nice. That could be quite nice for markets that's putting a lot of  liquidity into the system. There's a lot of central banks that would like  that sort of money, I think, knocking around. So I think that it's  tremendous. But I think the thing you have to remember with Apple is its  maturity as a business is showing through. And I don't mean maturity in  terms of the product range. But actually it's grown up company that has  proper mechanisms in place. It's not trying to make this up as it has got  larger -- unexpectedly larger, like some of the newer competitors in the  general social media tech space. You really see that strength coming  through. And what's fascinating to me is that it's still innovating but its  innovation is not a product book. It is in that ecosystem, exactly as you  mentioned. It is in the services that it's persuading us all to subscribe  to. And it's been very, very successful in doing that. Service revenue is  now really significant proportion of the overall mix. So I think when you  look in the round (ph), I mean, Apple at this valuation at this point, it  takes a strong stomach. We don't have very much exposure to it. But  nonetheless, I think you've got to give credit to it for its ability to  continue to innovate in different ways with this business model.</p><p>KEENE: That was so brilliant, folks, with the mathematics of Anne Richards  that we're going to stop the show, show a chart and continue with the  mathematician from Edinboro and the engineer from Edinboro. She used the  word, maturity. Okay. So, Anne, this on a second derivative basis is logged  (ph) concave. The media is hardwired to long convex, IDC, Francisco's  company has been brilliant with a tempered view. Is Apply basically tending  towards a utility-like cash flow, Anne Richards, which goes to the maturity  of that concave chart? I mean, they're not the normal growth company  anymore, are they? They are just, as you say, a mature company.</p><p>RICHARDS: So they're a mature company. I would probably go with the view  that they're a mature and growing company, so a company that is not going  through the stellar almost exponential growth that you see, and we might  come and talk back about Snap and how that works in reverse as well. But I  think you've got to give a lot of credit to Apple that it is managing to  innovate its business model and that is coming through in a much more  robust and sustainable model than you see in some of the (inaudible). Now,  valuation is a different thing. But nonetheless, (inaudible) business model  looks sustainable.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. This is brilliant, folks. We've got a major financial accent  in Anne Richards and Francisco Jeronimo working with IDC. Francisco, help  us with the unit partial differentials as you go up the cell phone price  point. The Apple gloom and doom crew says the iPhone X costs too much,  baloney, they're selling them like crazy. Where is the tip point per unit?  Is it $900? Is it $700? Where is the tip point where expensive phones  become a gravy train?</p><p>JERONIMO: The tipping point is when there is no additional value that  consumers are willing or are getting from a product. The criticisms that we  hear today about the iPhone X is exactly the same criticism that we heard  in 2007 when they launched the first iPhone. Everyone was saying, this is  crazy, launching a smart phone at this price point when the average selling  smart phone at that time were much lower, and it's exactly the same. Of  course, it doesn't Apple can continue to stretch the prices up because  there's definitely a limit where consumers will ask themselves whether it's  worth paying for that kind of device or not. But at the moment, Apple  continues to do very well and the $1,000 price tag continues to be an  achievable average selling price for their projects in the next quarters.  However, the market is contracting. So even if Apple wants to sell less  products or sell less products at a higher price point, there's a limit  because the market is not growing for every single person around the world  and in regions where people cannot afford these kinds price points as Apple  continues to do and invest in the older versions of their devices and  pushing those previous to those consumers at lower price points. But  clearly, if the value is there, consumers are willing to pay.</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, talk to me about Facebook. So they're going into a dating app  which actually a lot of their dating ventures (ph) are more (inaudible)  about. And this is Snap. So Snap was down, I think, 18% of premarket trade  because their redesign isn't working. I mean, what happened to Snap?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, it's burning through cash at a rate. It's got a lot of cash  on its balance sheet. So I think it's a time cash burn story. Can it turn  around the use of experience in such a way that it actually starts to put  on user growth at the same rate as it did before and get the ad revenue  going to support it before it runs out of cash? And we've seen loads of  business. They're not usually this big when they go through this but this  is a very classic program. And I think that's the situation that we're in  with Snap at the moment.</p><p>KEENE: Well, go ahead, Anne. Please continue.</p><p>RICHARDS: No, I was going to say what I think what's interesting when you  see that the Facebook, the dating app, and we see Google's recent  announcement, even you see Apple talking about what it's doing with Apple  Watch and thinking about health. The ecosystem argument is definitely  leeching out all of these companies and thinking how do we expand from our  simple one product, one business model ad revenue fuelled model into  something that is expanding. And I think at this stage, we don't know who  is going to be the winner in this. But certainly the companies that are  trying to do something different are more likely to succeed than those that  aren't.</p><p>KEENE: I can't say enough how valuable this was. Anne Richards with us with  M&amp;G. Francisco Jeronimo, thank you so much, with IDC. I look forward to  speaking to you with John Farrell on Bloomberg Radio here in a bit.</p><p>Anne Richards at M&amp;G Investments knows where national is knows it's a  cheaper venue to run a firm. Is this the future, Anne Richards? Are all the  teams like you, M&amp;G, everybody else, is this the reality as you're going to  leave the big cities?</p><p>RICHARDS: I don't think so. I think there are different reasons and  different business models why people choose to do things. And I think you  can overextrapolate what's going on. But it's -- for sure, you see that  active management has been under pressure to prove itself in recent years.  And I think -- we think that when you still continue to deliver the outcome  that customer wants, that the client wants at the end of the day, the  proposition is still very, very robust and compelling. I mean, we do have  to all challenge ourselves on our cost base in order to make sure that  we're delivering for those clients in the most efficient way that we can.  And maybe that's an area where we've underinvested. But it's not just about  location. It's much more innovative use of technology, for example, to run  our operating systems and so forth.</p><p>KEENE: One that seems interesting to me, Anne Richards, is making money in  the fixed income money management space. It's been a mystery to me for  really ten years, even longer than that. What are the margins like in fixed  income and how do you manage fixed income in the future?</p><p>RICHARDS: The key thing to being successful in fixed income markets in  their broadest sense is the flexibility to go across the boundaries. So  very, very simplistically, what I mean, by that is the ability to go  long/short duration, long/short credit to across the boundaries between  investment grade and high yield, even to go across the boundaries of public  versus private markets. And the key money has been made across those  boundaries and the ability to use that. Too often in fixed income space  historically, we've tendered to have very, very narrow buckets. So you're  really limited to one or two investment decisions. And if they go the wrong  or the market goes the wrong way, then you have nowhere else to go. So  flexibility, doing stuff that's harder to do in private markets, those are  all areas where it has been possible to deliver really good returns, and  actually I think will be in the future, but you need that flexibility.</p><p>LACQUA: And one what kind of impact has MiFID II has had at this point?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's sort of a little bit like the French Revolution. I think  sometimes we feel it's a bit too early to say. The biggest impact that  people will talk about is this fear that we've seen some liquidity, some  trading capacity taken out of the market. It's not been a major issue yet.  But I think there is a concern than in some kind of serious market  correction, it might be difficult to find the volume and the liquidity in  the market at a time when you need to in order to be able to shift things  around. I think people are worried about it. There are some signs that that  has happened. And I think we're all working behind the scenes to try and  make sure that we find a way of staying within the MiFID rules, but  nonetheless working constructively with regulators and others to make sure  we don't lose that liquidity on moments of distress.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Anne, talking about your clients, are you pitching for the  money from Lloyds that they took out as Standard Life Aberdeen?</p><p>RICHARDS: Okay. I would never talk publicly about anything that we would  (inaudible), so I'm not going to -- I'm going to plead (inaudible) on that  one, if I may.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Of course, that's a very elegant way of not answering a  question and totally respect that.</p><p>KEENE: You just killed it there, Francine. That was just absolutely  brilliant. (Inaudible) TV GO, if you're at M&amp;G Investments and you need to  dazzle Anne Richards this morning, you can do better -- look at this, come  on.</p><p>LACQUA: So, I mean, you can't relax from the market then. Do you just kind  of ignore the politics and focus on the fundamentals of BOE and the economy  for investment decisions in the U.K.?</p><p>RICHARDS: Yes, I think you have to do it. I mean, you see, there are  different parts of the market are doing well or better or worst. Retail  really struggling high street on the one hand, on the other hand, you've  got other parts of the market constructions doing a little bit better. So  the economy, as a whole, has some good parts and some less good parts.  We're not in Brexit yet. I mean, I think this is a thing that everybody  sometimes forgets. We haven't had the Brexit. So we are still benefiting  from all of the relationships that we currently have. So the question  really is what happens once we move into that new world and we still have  no real visibility in what that structure will look like. And I think the  only real tangible thing that you've seen so far which gives you sometimes  the measure that if you have seen investment flow, unquestionably, you're  seeing decisions deferred, that's not to say it's all stopped, but you have  seen that. So the longer term consequences of that if it's just a deferral  and we'll come back again once we're through this period of uncertainty or  actually hasn't permanently gone away, too early to say on that yet. So I  think the -- between now and September-October when we get the final terms  of what this limitation period looks like, what the final deal looks like,  it's desperately important to get some visibility on that.</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much.

She is the Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. And as always, you make us smarter, so thank you so much for coming on. What do you need from J. Powell? Is it more of an indication of kind of forward- looking of how many rate hikes? Is it something on the inverted yield curve and what that means as it happens or discontinuity?</p><p>ANNE RICHARDS, CEO, M&amp;G INVESTMENTS: I think just no surprises. I think people are not expecting any fireworks and I think delivering that would be actually a good underpinning to the markets, particularly after the volatility that we saw in the first quarter, and that change and tone of the markets where you saw bonds and equities both moving down rather than up. So that increased volatility, that correlation of the wrong way, the way that people don't like correlations to go. So I think the fed here -- we've had those interest rate rises up to now, market isn't expecting anything, no surprises will be good results.</p><p>LACQUA: What is the fed's main dilemma right now?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, I mean, feds always have dilemma about the path of growth, about the expectations of markets, about inflation. Actually, corporate earnings are doing pretty well. They've been ahead of expectations. Inflation, we've got enough inflation. It doesn't look like we have too much inflation. We're kind of on target on inflation, I would say. So I don't think there are too many dilemmas. I think that the challenge is simply don't do a misstep that spooks anybody at this point, particularly when you set this in a wider context, so a lot of uncertainty around trade, around some of the geopolitical relationships. I think the mantra is don't mess up here, stead as she goes.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Anne, when you look at the M&amp;G Investments and when you look at the mathematics of bond bear markets, I believe that is yield higher, prices lower. It's never a smooth gradient, there're always jump conditions. What are the kinds of jump conditions that we could see in the bond market where we get jumps in yield and lower prices suddenly?</p><p>RICHARDS: So it's this -- always against this backdrop, there're stuffs that could happen that would shock the market into doing different things. It's very hard to predict what those are in advance, which is a tripe thing to say. We all know that. But we have -- we are moving this year from a position of net bond purchasing by central banks to a situation where we've got net bond issuance right around the world. And the market is still adjusting to what that looks and feel like. Actually, you've got a big buyer who is no longer going to be buying, if you like, right around the world. And I think that is the tipping point. It's about the demand and supply for those bond issues that are out there. So I think, to me, that is the big one that we're navigating this year. It is a different backdrop to bond markets, in general.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Francine, this is really important on what she just said. Anne Richards goes down microeconomic principles when you look at a big macroeconomic view from 30,000 feet, I think. I really agree with that, that this is about microeconomics here forward for Chairman Powell.</p><p>LACQUA: It is, Tom. But if we bring it back to the markets, Anne, what do clients want? I mean, what kind of strategies do they ask of you?</p><p>RICHARDS: So I think smoothing has definitely been something. I mean, people have got quite used to this relatively low volatile world, at least in listed markets and so -- and conventional markets. You could argue, there has been a lot of volatility. Non-conventional markets like digital currencies and Bitcoin, all of that sort of stuff. But conventional markets, volatility really had become very subdued. And suddenly there's been that shock back into volatility worlds. So removing that volatility, so trying to seek out where you have counter-correlated assets to kind of smooth that path is definitely one of the things that people are out there. Having said that, I think a lot of people are look at the underlying power of earnings that we've got through coming from the corporate sector. And looking at the trade-off of the risks that you now see and still not again a lot of real yield out of bond markets and still getting quite a powerhouse in terms of earning growth from equity markets and saying, actually, the price of our extra volatility and equity markets might be worth paying because you can really see the fundamentals coming through. So I think there's a number of -- it really depends always on utility curves, preferences. What is it that is most important to individuals? And there's no one summary you can say, all individuals want this or all individuals want that. So I think those are two of themes that we would see coming through in conversations with clients.</p><p>LACQUA: I mean, has the conversation shifted in the last couple of weeks because there's a little bit of a slowdown in economic growth worldwide? And actually, what does that mean again for a market sentiment in the future and the correlation with monetary policy?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's fascinating actually. See, people -- how quickly sentiment changes and what people talk about. So some of those things that I just perceive that people are suddenly talking about again, gold has come back, but inflation, gold. Suddenly -- we didn't talk about that six months ago. Suddenly, that's back on the conversation again. So that's one thing. I think that the oil price, frankly, is another. You've seen the oil price, which everybody said was very subdued for a very long period of time. And it sort of snuck up on us instead of gradually, gradually, gradually been moving into territory where despite the fact that you've not seen the investment really start go back in again. Actually, the economics start to make that more appealing. So there's mentioned in conversations around oil price commodities and the knock-on effects of that. So I think we're going to see a change in tone in some of those conversations. The whole tech conversation of what does a successful business model look like in technology. Again, 2016-2017, big tech was winner almost regardless of what it did. Much more discrimination coming into the conversations with clients about what a good business model is, what a bad business model is and (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Anne Richards, Megan Greene writing in the FT today on where is inflation, we're all waiting for it. I guess we'll hear about it in the non-press conference today at the debt (ph) meeting. Where is the inflation?</p><p>RICHARDS: Gosh, what an interesting question. Inflation comes in all sorts of different places and unexpected places, I think. So conventional inflation is varying country-by-country, market-by-market quite significantly, oil price will be feeding through into inflation numbers, that's absolutely the case. But on the other hand, if you see what's happening on the retail high street, you can see the high street is challenged still by falling process in many areas, where on the other side coin, you've got internet prices actually going up in some respect. So you've got some quite an interesting contrast there. So I think, overall in inflation, it's still a very difficult picture, I think, for anybody to grasp the totality of it. So oil price starting to feed through is definitely one, and some of the big currency moves, you're actually seeing currency induced inflation rather than fundamental underlying inflation.</p><p>KEENE: Exactly. Well, that's one of our themes here through Surveillance this morning. Anne Richards with us with the M&amp;G Investment.</p><p>LACQUA: We're back with Anne Richards, Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. Anne, when you look at again what your clients want, how you position on your portfolios, trade tensions seemed to be on the back of it because at least Steve Mnuchin is showing up in a couple of hours I think to try and discuss, is this still the main risk for the world economy or is it monetary policy?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's (inaudible). So I think trade is clearly out there as something that people are concerned about because the global economy, in terms of the totality of the pie, if you like, has been expanded over recent decades by global trades. That's been the big driver of much of the global expansion. So if that is really under threat, then there is a risk that we end up fighting over a smaller -- a share of the smaller pie as opposed to it. And I think that is the concern that's out there. Having said all of that, the way that America has been conducting trade policy negotiations, and indeed other international negotiations has been about ripping up the playbook, throwing everything up in the air, getting everybody uncertain and then coming to a compromise at the last minute, and you can see that. And a classic example of that is the way the North and South Korea conversations are going. Whereas if you think back to last year, it was all about who was going to hit the big the red button first. And now, we actually have come far farther than anyone ever anticipated than we would have done a year ago. So I think there's a little bit around this whole global trade tariffs conversation which will affect -- will be affected in the same way ultimately. On the European thing, I just absolutely do not believe that the U.S. wants to mess up relationship with Europe. But President Trump clearly wants to get the maximum that it possibly can out of any bartering that it does with Europe, hence, the conversations that have been had with Mr. Macron, with Mrs. Merkel over the last week or so. So I think that's what we're going to play out and I think most of that, as when we look at it, think that that is the central scenario. But in that sense (ph), there are risks.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you worry about European growth having peaked? We're seeing -- again, the data is not that clear actually, right? It depends on kind of some of the PMIs are better than expected in certain countries, worse than expecting others, should we assume that it doesn't get any better than this for your portfolios?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, I think on Europe. I mean, I think there are still a lot of things that are going in the right direction. But there have been a few things which have come together simultaneously. People are starting to get concerned about the impact of Brexit on Mainland Europe. That wasn't a concern. That is beginning to be a little bit of a concern. You will see people deferring or shaping some of their investment plans because of that. So that will have a feed through on that. The fact that in Germany and France and Italy, so with the big three countries there, there are political tensions and relatively unclear and insecure governments in different forms and shapes in place there. Again, it doesn't help the view that we're going to get a kind of coordinated negotiated settlement on anything very much. So there were a few things in the background that just make people feel a little bit less comfortable than they did six months ago in Europe. But actually, the direction of travel is still okay.</p><p>KEENE: Anne Richards, Martin Wolf and the FT with a brilliant walkthrough of China's attitude as the U.S. officials travel to China, I guess, to have a big argument on trade. What does it mean for your international investment at M&amp;G? Do you lighten up or is this an opportunity to acquire Pacific Rim shares?</p><p>RICHARDS: So, look, on the whole China story and what is being driven through that China story, I think the -- you are seeing a change yet again in the outreach that's coming out of China. And that is very, very powerful. So the ability of business to get direct access to markets that it was not able to get direct access to before in China has been -- that's a very significant announcement. The fact that she is in place for much longer than might have been anticipated and will be continuing to drive forward in that economic empowering, I think, creates a very positive backdrop to what's going on in China. So I think we would remain positive on the direction of travel</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there of M&amp;G stays with us.</p><p>Joining us now is Francisco Jeronimo, IDC Senior Research Director for European mobile devices and Anne Richards of M&amp;G Investments where she's Chief Executive. So thank you both for coming on the program. Francisco, what do we learn about Apple?</p><p>FRANCISCO JERONIMO, SENIOR RESEARCH DIRECTOR, IDC: We learned that a powerful brand continues to perform when they continue to deliver value that consumers perceived as something that improves overtime. And after ten years when the first -- after the first -- the launch of the first iPhone, and when the market is already contracting. And then last year, the decline for the first time, the smart phone, Apple delivering these kinds of results at a higher price point, it's remarkable and definitely a stellar quarter for Apple.</p><p>LACQUA: Francisco, let me talk to you about the iPhone and then I want to ask Anne a little bit about the financial surrounding Apple. But if you look at the iPhone year-on-year revenue growth -- Tom, bear with me. I know you don't like candle charts, but this is a really good one. We heard from the Chief Executive of Apple saying, look, iPhone X was stellar, best performing, but that's what you'd expect. How does he continue on this trend in the quarters to come?</p><p>JERONIMO: That's a challenge for them. Of course, it's a challenge. But it really shows that the brand proposition and then the perception of the consumers and enterprises also have about Apple is not just about the good looking iPhones, it's about everything that comes with the device. The ecosystem and all the services and also a very important topic that he mentioned in the call, the privacy and security, and indeed IDC did a recent survey to enterprise in Europe. And we found out that the top reason that why enterprises choose an iPhone is because of security and the perception that an iPhone brings around security. And this is a very important value for consumers and enterprises in the smart phone, particularly nowadays with all the news and the candles (ph) around privacy leaks and all of those problems.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. We can take about Facebook. We also need to talk about Snap. I know I'm going to find Tom on Snap. I'm sure it's like #tomtom or something like that. He's keeping it secret. Anne, when you look at Apple, they have a lot of cash. And finally, they're returning it to shareholders. Do you like the stock (inaudible)?</p><p>RICHARDS: So hundred billion coming back to shareholders, I mean, that can be quite nice. That could be quite nice for markets that's putting a lot of liquidity into the system. There's a lot of central banks that would like that sort of money, I think, knocking around. So I think that it's tremendous. But I think the thing you have to remember with Apple is its maturity as a business is showing through. And I don't mean maturity in terms of the product range. But actually it's grown up company that has proper mechanisms in place. It's not trying to make this up as it has got larger -- unexpectedly larger, like some of the newer competitors in the general social media tech space. You really see that strength coming through. And what's fascinating to me is that it's still innovating but its innovation is not a product book. It is in that ecosystem, exactly as you mentioned. It is in the services that it's persuading us all to subscribe to. And it's been very, very successful in doing that. Service revenue is now really significant proportion of the overall mix. So I think when you look in the round (ph), I mean, Apple at this valuation at this point, it takes a strong stomach. We don't have very much exposure to it. But nonetheless, I think you've got to give credit to it for its ability to continue to innovate in different ways with this business model.</p><p>KEENE: That was so brilliant, folks, with the mathematics of Anne Richards that we're going to stop the show, show a chart and continue with the mathematician from Edinboro and the engineer from Edinboro. She used the word, maturity. Okay. So, Anne, this on a second derivative basis is logged (ph) concave. The media is hardwired to long convex, IDC, Francisco's company has been brilliant with a tempered view. Is Apply basically tending towards a utility-like cash flow, Anne Richards, which goes to the maturity of that concave chart? I mean, they're not the normal growth company anymore, are they? They are just, as you say, a mature company.</p><p>RICHARDS: So they're a mature company. I would probably go with the view that they're a mature and growing company, so a company that is not going through the stellar almost exponential growth that you see, and we might come and talk back about Snap and how that works in reverse as well. But I think you've got to give a lot of credit to Apple that it is managing to innovate its business model and that is coming through in a much more robust and sustainable model than you see in some of the (inaudible). Now, valuation is a different thing. But nonetheless, (inaudible) business model looks sustainable.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. This is brilliant, folks. We've got a major financial accent in Anne Richards and Francisco Jeronimo working with IDC. Francisco, help us with the unit partial differentials as you go up the cell phone price point. The Apple gloom and doom crew says the iPhone X costs too much, baloney, they're selling them like crazy. Where is the tip point per unit? Is it $900? Is it $700? Where is the tip point where expensive phones become a gravy train?</p><p>JERONIMO: The tipping point is when there is no additional value that consumers are willing or are getting from a product. The criticisms that we hear today about the iPhone X is exactly the same criticism that we heard in 2007 when they launched the first iPhone. Everyone was saying, this is crazy, launching a smart phone at this price point when the average selling smart phone at that time were much lower, and it's exactly the same. Of course, it doesn't Apple can continue to stretch the prices up because there's definitely a limit where consumers will ask themselves whether it's worth paying for that kind of device or not. But at the moment, Apple continues to do very well and the $1,000 price tag continues to be an achievable average selling price for their projects in the next quarters. However, the market is contracting. So even if Apple wants to sell less products or sell less products at a higher price point, there's a limit because the market is not growing for every single person around the world and in regions where people cannot afford these kinds price points as Apple continues to do and invest in the older versions of their devices and pushing those previous to those consumers at lower price points. But clearly, if the value is there, consumers are willing to pay.</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, talk to me about Facebook. So they're going into a dating app which actually a lot of their dating ventures (ph) are more (inaudible) about. And this is Snap. So Snap was down, I think, 18% of premarket trade because their redesign isn't working. I mean, what happened to Snap?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, it's burning through cash at a rate. It's got a lot of cash on its balance sheet. So I think it's a time cash burn story. Can it turn around the use of experience in such a way that it actually starts to put on user growth at the same rate as it did before and get the ad revenue going to support it before it runs out of cash? And we've seen loads of business. They're not usually this big when they go through this but this is a very classic program. And I think that's the situation that we're in with Snap at the moment.</p><p>KEENE: Well, go ahead, Anne. Please continue.</p><p>RICHARDS: No, I was going to say what I think what's interesting when you see that the Facebook, the dating app, and we see Google's recent announcement, even you see Apple talking about what it's doing with Apple Watch and thinking about health. The ecosystem argument is definitely leeching out all of these companies and thinking how do we expand from our simple one product, one business model ad revenue fuelled model into something that is expanding. And I think at this stage, we don't know who is going to be the winner in this. But certainly the companies that are trying to do something different are more likely to succeed than those that aren't.</p><p>KEENE: I can't say enough how valuable this was. Anne Richards with us with M&amp;G. Francisco Jeronimo, thank you so much, with IDC. I look forward to speaking to you with John Farrell on Bloomberg Radio here in a bit.</p><p>Anne Richards at M&amp;G Investments knows where national is knows it's a cheaper venue to run a firm. Is this the future, Anne Richards? Are all the teams like you, M&amp;G, everybody else, is this the reality as you're going to leave the big cities?</p><p>RICHARDS: I don't think so. I think there are different reasons and different business models why people choose to do things. And I think you can overextrapolate what's going on. But it's -- for sure, you see that active management has been under pressure to prove itself in recent years. And I think -- we think that when you still continue to deliver the outcome that customer wants, that the client wants at the end of the day, the proposition is still very, very robust and compelling. I mean, we do have to all challenge ourselves on our cost base in order to make sure that we're delivering for those clients in the most efficient way that we can. And maybe that's an area where we've underinvested. But it's not just about location. It's much more innovative use of technology, for example, to run our operating systems and so forth.</p><p>KEENE: One that seems interesting to me, Anne Richards, is making money in the fixed income money management space. It's been a mystery to me for really ten years, even longer than that. What are the margins like in fixed income and how do you manage fixed income in the future?</p><p>RICHARDS: The key thing to being successful in fixed income markets in their broadest sense is the flexibility to go across the boundaries. So very, very simplistically, what I mean, by that is the ability to go long/short duration, long/short credit to across the boundaries between investment grade and high yield, even to go across the boundaries of public versus private markets. And the key money has been made across those boundaries and the ability to use that. Too often in fixed income space historically, we've tendered to have very, very narrow buckets. So you're really limited to one or two investment decisions. And if they go the wrong or the market goes the wrong way, then you have nowhere else to go. So flexibility, doing stuff that's harder to do in private markets, those are all areas where it has been possible to deliver really good returns, and actually I think will be in the future, but you need that flexibility.</p><p>LACQUA: And one what kind of impact has MiFID II has had at this point?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's sort of a little bit like the French Revolution. I think sometimes we feel it's a bit too early to say. The biggest impact that people will talk about is this fear that we've seen some liquidity, some trading capacity taken out of the market. It's not been a major issue yet. But I think there is a concern than in some kind of serious market correction, it might be difficult to find the volume and the liquidity in the market at a time when you need to in order to be able to shift things around. I think people are worried about it. There are some signs that that has happened. And I think we're all working behind the scenes to try and make sure that we find a way of staying within the MiFID rules, but nonetheless working constructively with regulators and others to make sure we don't lose that liquidity on moments of distress.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Anne, talking about your clients, are you pitching for the money from Lloyds that they took out as Standard Life Aberdeen?</p><p>RICHARDS: Okay. I would never talk publicly about anything that we would (inaudible), so I'm not going to -- I'm going to plead (inaudible) on that one, if I may.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Of course, that's a very elegant way of not answering a question and totally respect that.</p><p>KEENE: You just killed it there, Francine. That was just absolutely brilliant. (Inaudible) TV GO, if you're at M&amp;G Investments and you need to dazzle Anne Richards this morning, you can do better -- look at this, come on.</p><p>LACQUA: So, I mean, you can't relax from the market then. Do you just kind of ignore the politics and focus on the fundamentals of BOE and the economy for investment decisions in the U.K.?</p><p>RICHARDS: Yes, I think you have to do it. I mean, you see, there are different parts of the market are doing well or better or worst. Retail really struggling high street on the one hand, on the other hand, you've got other parts of the market constructions doing a little bit better. So the economy, as a whole, has some good parts and some less good parts. We're not in Brexit yet. I mean, I think this is a thing that everybody sometimes forgets. We haven't had the Brexit. So we are still benefiting from all of the relationships that we currently have. So the question really is what happens once we move into that new world and we still have no real visibility in what that structure will look like. And I think the only real tangible thing that you've seen so far which gives you sometimes the measure that if you have seen investment flow, unquestionably, you're seeing decisions deferred, that's not to say it's all stopped, but you have seen that. So the longer term consequences of that if it's just a deferral and we'll come back again once we're through this period of uncertainty or actually hasn't permanently gone away, too early to say on that yet. So I think the -- between now and September-October when we get the final terms of what this limitation period looks like, what the final deal looks like, it's desperately important to get some visibility on that.</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there, M&amp;G Investments' Chief Executive, and David Merritt, Bloomberg's European News Director, joining us on Brexit.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

She is the Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. And  as always, you make us smarter, so thank you so much for coming on. What do  you need from J. Powell? Is it more of an indication of kind of forward- looking of how many rate hikes? Is it something on the inverted yield curve  and what that means as it happens or discontinuity?</p><p> ANNE RICHARDS, CEO, M&amp;G INVESTMENTS: I think just no surprises. I think  people are not expecting any fireworks and I think delivering that would be  actually a good underpinning to the markets, particularly after the  volatility that we saw in the first quarter, and that change and tone of  the markets where you saw bonds and equities both moving down rather than  up. So that increased volatility, that correlation of the wrong way, the  way that people don't like correlations to go. So I think the fed here --  we've had those interest rate rises up to now, market isn't expecting  anything, no surprises will be good results.</p><p> LACQUA: What is the fed's main dilemma right now?</p><p> RICHARDS: Well, I mean, feds always have dilemma about the path of growth,  about the expectations of markets, about inflation. Actually, corporate  earnings are doing pretty well. They've been ahead of expectations.  Inflation, we've got enough inflation. It doesn't look like we have too  much inflation. We're kind of on target on inflation, I would say. So I  don't think there are too many dilemmas. I think that the challenge is  simply don't do a misstep that spooks anybody at this point, particularly  when you set this in a wider context, so a lot of uncertainty around trade,  around some of the geopolitical relationships. I think the mantra is don't  mess up here, stead as she goes.</p><p> TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Anne, when you look at the M&amp;G Investments and  when you look at the mathematics of bond bear markets, I believe that is  yield higher, prices lower. It's never a smooth gradient, there're always  jump conditions. What are the kinds of jump conditions that we could see in  the bond market where we get jumps in yield and lower prices suddenly?</p><p> RICHARDS: So it's this -- always against this backdrop, there're stuffs  that could happen that would shock the market into doing different things.  It's very hard to predict what those are in advance, which is a tripe thing  to say. We all know that. But we have -- we are moving this year from a  position of net bond purchasing by central banks to a situation where we've  got net bond issuance right around the world. And the market is still  adjusting to what that looks and feel like. Actually, you've got a big  buyer who is no longer going to be buying, if you like, right around the  world. And I think that is the tipping point. It's about the demand and  supply for those bond issues that are out there. So I think, to me, that is  the big one that we're navigating this year. It is a different backdrop to  bond markets, in general.</p><p> KEENE: Yes. Francine, this is really important on what she just said. Anne  Richards goes down microeconomic principles when you look at a big  macroeconomic view from 30,000 feet, I think. I really agree with that,  that this is about microeconomics here forward for Chairman Powell.</p><p> LACQUA: It is, Tom. But if we bring it back to the markets, Anne, what do  clients want? I mean, what kind of strategies do they ask of you?</p><p> RICHARDS: So I think smoothing has definitely been something. I mean,  people have got quite used to this relatively low volatile world, at least  in listed markets and so -- and conventional markets. You could argue,  there has been a lot of volatility. Non-conventional markets like digital  currencies and Bitcoin, all of that sort of stuff. But conventional  markets, volatility really had become very subdued. And suddenly there's  been that shock back into volatility worlds. So removing that volatility,  so trying to seek out where you have counter-correlated assets to kind of  smooth that path is definitely one of the things that people are out there.  Having said that, I think a lot of people are look at the underlying power  of earnings that we've got through coming from the corporate sector. And  looking at the trade-off of the risks that you now see and still not again  a lot of real yield out of bond markets and still getting quite a  powerhouse in terms of earning growth from equity markets and saying,  actually, the price of our extra volatility and equity markets might be  worth paying because you can really see the fundamentals coming through. So  I think there's a number of -- it really depends always on utility curves,  preferences. What is it that is most important to individuals? And there's  no one summary you can say, all individuals want this or all individuals  want that. So I think those are two of themes that we would see coming  through in conversations with clients.</p><p> LACQUA: I mean, has the conversation shifted in the last couple of weeks  because there's a little bit of a slowdown in economic growth worldwide?  And actually, what does that mean again for a market sentiment in the  future and the correlation with monetary policy?</p><p> RICHARDS: It's fascinating actually. See, people -- how quickly sentiment  changes and what people talk about. So some of those things that I just  perceive that people are suddenly talking about again, gold has come back,  but inflation, gold. Suddenly -- we didn't talk about that six months ago.  Suddenly, that's back on the conversation again. So that's one thing. I  think that the oil price, frankly, is another. You've seen the oil price,  which everybody said was very subdued for a very long period of time. And  it sort of snuck up on us instead of gradually, gradually, gradually been  moving into territory where despite the fact that you've not seen the  investment really start go back in again. Actually, the economics start to  make that more appealing. So there's mentioned in conversations around oil  price commodities and the knock-on effects of that. So I think we're going  to see a change in tone in some of those conversations. The whole tech  conversation of what does a successful business model look like in  technology. Again, 2016-2017, big tech was winner almost regardless of what  it did. Much more discrimination coming into the conversations with clients  about what a good business model is, what a bad business model is and  (inaudible).</p><p> KEENE: Anne Richards, Megan Greene writing in the FT today on where is  inflation, we're all waiting for it. I guess we'll hear about it in the  non-press conference today at the debt (ph) meeting. Where is the  inflation?</p><p> RICHARDS: Gosh, what an interesting question. Inflation comes in all sorts  of different places and unexpected places, I think. So conventional  inflation is varying country-by-country, market-by-market quite  significantly, oil price will be feeding through into inflation numbers,  that's absolutely the case. But on the other hand, if you see what's  happening on the retail high street, you can see the high street is  challenged still by falling process in many areas, where on the other side  coin, you've got internet prices actually going up in some respect. So  you've got some quite an interesting contrast there. So I think, overall in  inflation, it's still a very difficult picture, I think, for anybody to  grasp the totality of it. So oil price starting to feed through is  definitely one, and some of the big currency moves, you're actually seeing  currency induced inflation rather than fundamental underlying inflation.</p><p> KEENE: Exactly. Well, that's one of our themes here through Surveillance  this morning. Anne Richards with us with the M&amp;G Investment.</p><p> LACQUA: We're back with Anne Richards, Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments.  Anne, when you look at again what your clients want, how you position on  your portfolios, trade tensions seemed to be on the back of it because at  least Steve Mnuchin is showing up in a couple of hours I think to try and  discuss, is this still the main risk for the world economy or is it  monetary policy?</p><p> RICHARDS: It's (inaudible). So I think trade is clearly out there as  something that people are concerned about because the global economy, in  terms of the totality of the pie, if you like, has been expanded over  recent decades by global trades. That's been the big driver of much of the  global expansion. So if that is really under threat, then there is a risk  that we end up fighting over a smaller -- a share of the smaller pie as  opposed to it. And I think that is the concern that's out there. Having  said all of that, the way that America has been conducting trade policy  negotiations, and indeed other international negotiations has been about  ripping up the playbook, throwing everything up in the air, getting  everybody uncertain and then coming to a compromise at the last minute, and  you can see that. And a classic example of that is the way the North and  South Korea conversations are going. Whereas if you think back to last  year, it was all about who was going to hit the big the red button first.  And now, we actually have come far farther than anyone ever anticipated  than we would have done a year ago. So I think there's a little bit around  this whole global trade tariffs conversation which will affect -- will be  affected in the same way ultimately. On the European thing, I just  absolutely do not believe that the U.S. wants to mess up relationship with  Europe. But President Trump clearly wants to get the maximum that it  possibly can out of any bartering that it does with Europe, hence, the  conversations that have been had with Mr. Macron, with Mrs. Merkel over the  last week or so. So I think that's what we're going to play out and I think  most of that, as when we look at it, think that that is the central  scenario. But in that sense (ph), there are risks.</p><p> LACQUA: Do you worry about European growth having peaked? We're seeing --  again, the data is not that clear actually, right? It depends on kind of  some of the PMIs are better than expected in certain countries, worse than  expecting others, should we assume that it doesn't get any better than this  for your portfolios?</p><p> RICHARDS: Well, I think on Europe. I mean, I think there are still a lot of  things that are going in the right direction. But there have been a few  things which have come together simultaneously. People are starting to get  concerned about the impact of Brexit on Mainland Europe. That wasn't a  concern. That is beginning to be a little bit of a concern. You will see  people deferring or shaping some of their investment plans because of that.  So that will have a feed through on that. The fact that in Germany and  France and Italy, so with the big three countries there, there are  political tensions and relatively unclear and insecure governments in  different forms and shapes in place there. Again, it doesn't help the view  that we're going to get a kind of coordinated negotiated settlement on  anything very much. So there were a few things in the background that just  make people feel a little bit less comfortable than they did six months ago  in Europe. But actually, the direction of travel is still okay.</p><p> KEENE: Anne Richards, Martin Wolf and the FT with a brilliant walkthrough  of China's attitude as the U.S. officials travel to China, I guess, to have  a big argument on trade. What does it mean for your international  investment at M&amp;G? Do you lighten up or is this an opportunity to acquire  Pacific Rim shares?</p><p> RICHARDS: So, look, on the whole China story and what is being driven  through that China story, I think the -- you are seeing a change yet again  in the outreach that's coming out of China. And that is very, very  powerful. So the ability of business to get direct access to markets that  it was not able to get direct access to before in China has been -- that's  a very significant announcement. The fact that she is in place for much  longer than might have been anticipated and will be continuing to drive  forward in that economic empowering, I think, creates a very positive  backdrop to what's going on in China. So I think we would remain positive  on the direction of travel</p><p> LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there of M&amp;G stays with us.</p><p> Joining us now is Francisco Jeronimo, IDC Senior Research Director for  European mobile devices and Anne Richards of M&amp;G Investments where she's  Chief Executive. So thank you both for coming on the program. Francisco,  what do we learn about Apple?</p><p> FRANCISCO JERONIMO, SENIOR RESEARCH DIRECTOR, IDC: We learned that a  powerful brand continues to perform when they continue to deliver value  that consumers perceived as something that improves overtime. And after ten  years when the first -- after the first -- the launch of the first iPhone,  and when the market is already contracting. And then last year, the decline  for the first time, the smart phone, Apple delivering these kinds of  results at a higher price point, it's remarkable and definitely a stellar  quarter for Apple.</p><p> LACQUA: Francisco, let me talk to you about the iPhone and then I want to  ask Anne a little bit about the financial surrounding Apple. But if you  look at the iPhone year-on-year revenue growth -- Tom, bear with me. I know  you don't like candle charts, but this is a really good one. We heard from  the Chief Executive of Apple saying, look, iPhone X was stellar, best  performing, but that's what you'd expect. How does he continue on this  trend in the quarters to come?</p><p> JERONIMO: That's a challenge for them. Of course, it's a challenge. But it  really shows that the brand proposition and then the perception of the  consumers and enterprises also have about Apple is not just about the good  looking iPhones, it's about everything that comes with the device. The  ecosystem and all the services and also a very important topic that he  mentioned in the call, the privacy and security, and indeed IDC did a  recent survey to enterprise in Europe. And we found out that the top reason  that why enterprises choose an iPhone is because of security and the  perception that an iPhone brings around security. And this is a very  important value for consumers and enterprises in the smart phone,  particularly nowadays with all the news and the candles (ph) around privacy  leaks and all of those problems.</p><p> LACQUA: Yes. We can take about Facebook. We also need to talk about Snap. I  know I'm going to find Tom on Snap. I'm sure it's like #tomtom or something  like that. He's keeping it secret. Anne, when you look at Apple, they have  a lot of cash. And finally, they're returning it to shareholders. Do you  like the stock (inaudible)?</p><p> RICHARDS: So hundred billion coming back to shareholders, I mean, that can  be quite nice. That could be quite nice for markets that's putting a lot of  liquidity into the system. There's a lot of central banks that would like  that sort of money, I think, knocking around. So I think that it's  tremendous. But I think the thing you have to remember with Apple is its  maturity as a business is showing through. And I don't mean maturity in  terms of the product range. But actually it's grown up company that has  proper mechanisms in place. It's not trying to make this up as it has got  larger -- unexpectedly larger, like some of the newer competitors in the  general social media tech space. You really see that strength coming  through. And what's fascinating to me is that it's still innovating but its  innovation is not a product book. It is in that ecosystem, exactly as you  mentioned. It is in the services that it's persuading us all to subscribe  to. And it's been very, very successful in doing that. Service revenue is  now really significant proportion of the overall mix. So I think when you  look in the round (ph), I mean, Apple at this valuation at this point, it  takes a strong stomach. We don't have very much exposure to it. But  nonetheless, I think you've got to give credit to it for its ability to  continue to innovate in different ways with this business model.</p><p> KEENE: That was so brilliant, folks, with the mathematics of Anne Richards  that we're going to stop the show, show a chart and continue with the  mathematician from Edinboro and the engineer from Edinboro. She used the  word, maturity. Okay. So, Anne, this on a second derivative basis is logged  (ph) concave. The media is hardwired to long convex, IDC, Francisco's  company has been brilliant with a tempered view. Is Apply basically tending  towards a utility-like cash flow, Anne Richards, which goes to the maturity  of that concave chart? I mean, they're not the normal growth company  anymore, are they? They are just, as you say, a mature company.</p><p> RICHARDS: So they're a mature company. I would probably go with the view  that they're a mature and growing company, so a company that is not going  through the stellar almost exponential growth that you see, and we might  come and talk back about Snap and how that works in reverse as well. But I  think you've got to give a lot of credit to Apple that it is managing to  innovate its business model and that is coming through in a much more  robust and sustainable model than you see in some of the (inaudible). Now,  valuation is a different thing. But nonetheless, (inaudible) business model  looks sustainable.</p><p> KEENE: Okay. This is brilliant, folks. We've got a major financial accent  in Anne Richards and Francisco Jeronimo working with IDC. Francisco, help  us with the unit partial differentials as you go up the cell phone price  point. The Apple gloom and doom crew says the iPhone X costs too much,  baloney, they're selling them like crazy. Where is the tip point per unit?  Is it $900? Is it $700? Where is the tip point where expensive phones  become a gravy train?</p><p> JERONIMO: The tipping point is when there is no additional value that  consumers are willing or are getting from a product. The criticisms that we  hear today about the iPhone X is exactly the same criticism that we heard  in 2007 when they launched the first iPhone. Everyone was saying, this is  crazy, launching a smart phone at this price point when the average selling  smart phone at that time were much lower, and it's exactly the same. Of  course, it doesn't Apple can continue to stretch the prices up because  there's definitely a limit where consumers will ask themselves whether it's  worth paying for that kind of device or not. But at the moment, Apple  continues to do very well and the $1,000 price tag continues to be an  achievable average selling price for their projects in the next quarters.  However, the market is contracting. So even if Apple wants to sell less  products or sell less products at a higher price point, there's a limit  because the market is not growing for every single person around the world  and in regions where people cannot afford these kinds price points as Apple  continues to do and invest in the older versions of their devices and  pushing those previous to those consumers at lower price points. But  clearly, if the value is there, consumers are willing to pay.</p><p> LACQUA: Anne, talk to me about Facebook. So they're going into a dating app  which actually a lot of their dating ventures (ph) are more (inaudible)  about. And this is Snap. So Snap was down, I think, 18% of premarket trade  because their redesign isn't working. I mean, what happened to Snap?</p><p> RICHARDS: Well, it's burning through cash at a rate. It's got a lot of cash  on its balance sheet. So I think it's a time cash burn story. Can it turn  around the use of experience in such a way that it actually starts to put  on user growth at the same rate as it did before and get the ad revenue  going to support it before it runs out of cash? And we've seen loads of  business. They're not usually this big when they go through this but this  is a very classic program. And I think that's the situation that we're in  with Snap at the moment.</p><p> KEENE: Well, go ahead, Anne. Please continue.</p><p> RICHARDS: No, I was going to say what I think what's interesting when you  see that the Facebook, the dating app, and we see Google's recent  announcement, even you see Apple talking about what it's doing with Apple  Watch and thinking about health. The ecosystem argument is definitely  leeching out all of these companies and thinking how do we expand from our  simple one product, one business model ad revenue fuelled model into  something that is expanding. And I think at this stage, we don't know who  is going to be the winner in this. But certainly the companies that are  trying to do something different are more likely to succeed than those that  aren't.</p><p> KEENE: I can't say enough how valuable this was. Anne Richards with us with  M&amp;G. Francisco Jeronimo, thank you so much, with IDC. I look forward to  speaking to you with John Farrell on Bloomberg Radio here in a bit.</p><p> Anne Richards at M&amp;G Investments knows where national is knows it's a  cheaper venue to run a firm. Is this the future, Anne Richards? Are all the  teams like you, M&amp;G, everybody else, is this the reality as you're going to  leave the big cities?</p><p> RICHARDS: I don't think so. I think there are different reasons and  different business models why people choose to do things. And I think you  can overextrapolate what's going on. But it's -- for sure, you see that  active management has been under pressure to prove itself in recent years.  And I think -- we think that when you still continue to deliver the outcome  that customer wants, that the client wants at the end of the day, the  proposition is still very, very robust and compelling. I mean, we do have  to all challenge ourselves on our cost base in order to make sure that  we're delivering for those clients in the most efficient way that we can.  And maybe that's an area where we've underinvested. But it's not just about  location. It's much more innovative use of technology, for example, to run  our operating systems and so forth.</p><p> KEENE: One that seems interesting to me, Anne Richards, is making money in  the fixed income money management space. It's been a mystery to me for  really ten years, even longer than that. What are the margins like in fixed  income and how do you manage fixed income in the future?</p><p> RICHARDS: The key thing to being successful in fixed income markets in  their broadest sense is the flexibility to go across the boundaries. So  very, very simplistically, what I mean, by that is the ability to go  long/short duration, long/short credit to across the boundaries between  investment grade and high yield, even to go across the boundaries of public  versus private markets. And the key money has been made across those  boundaries and the ability to use that. Too often in fixed income space  historically, we've tendered to have very, very narrow buckets. So you're  really limited to one or two investment decisions. And if they go the wrong  or the market goes the wrong way, then you have nowhere else to go. So  flexibility, doing stuff that's harder to do in private markets, those are  all areas where it has been possible to deliver really good returns, and  actually I think will be in the future, but you need that flexibility.</p><p> LACQUA: And one what kind of impact has MiFID II has had at this point?</p><p> RICHARDS: It's sort of a little bit like the French Revolution. I think  sometimes we feel it's a bit too early to say. The biggest impact that  people will talk about is this fear that we've seen some liquidity, some  trading capacity taken out of the market. It's not been a major issue yet.  But I think there is a concern than in some kind of serious market  correction, it might be difficult to find the volume and the liquidity in  the market at a time when you need to in order to be able to shift things  around. I think people are worried about it. There are some signs that that  has happened. And I think we're all working behind the scenes to try and  make sure that we find a way of staying within the MiFID rules, but  nonetheless working constructively with regulators and others to make sure  we don't lose that liquidity on moments of distress.</p><p> LACQUA: And, Anne, talking about your clients, are you pitching for the  money from Lloyds that they took out as Standard Life Aberdeen?</p><p> RICHARDS: Okay. I would never talk publicly about anything that we would  (inaudible), so I'm not going to -- I'm going to plead (inaudible) on that  one, if I may.</p><p> LACQUA: Okay. Of course, that's a very elegant way of not answering a  question and totally respect that.</p><p> KEENE: You just killed it there, Francine. That was just absolutely  brilliant. (Inaudible) TV GO, if you're at M&amp;G Investments and you need to  dazzle Anne Richards this morning, you can do better -- look at this, come  on.</p><p> LACQUA: So, I mean, you can't relax from the market then. Do you just kind  of ignore the politics and focus on the fundamentals of BOE and the economy  for investment decisions in the U.K.?</p><p> RICHARDS: Yes, I think you have to do it. I mean, you see, there are  different parts of the market are doing well or better or worst. Retail  really struggling high street on the one hand, on the other hand, you've  got other parts of the market constructions doing a little bit better. So  the economy, as a whole, has some good parts and some less good parts.  We're not in Brexit yet. I mean, I think this is a thing that everybody  sometimes forgets. We haven't had the Brexit. So we are still benefiting  from all of the relationships that we currently have. So the question  really is what happens once we move into that new world and we still have  no real visibility in what that structure will look like. And I think the  only real tangible thing that you've seen so far which gives you sometimes  the measure that if you have seen investment flow, unquestionably, you're  seeing decisions deferred, that's not to say it's all stopped, but you have  seen that. So the longer term consequences of that if it's just a deferral  and we'll come back again once we're through this period of uncertainty or  actually hasn't permanently gone away, too early to say on that yet. So I  think the -- between now and September-October when we get the final terms  of what this limitation period looks like, what the final deal looks like,  it's desperately important to get some visibility on that.</p><p> LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there, M&amp;G Investments'  Chief Executive, and David Merritt, Bloomberg's European News Director,  joining us on Brexit.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

She is the Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. And as always, you make us smarter, so thank you so much for coming on. What do you need from J. Powell? Is it more of an indication of kind of forward- looking of how many rate hikes? Is it something on the inverted yield curve and what that means as it happens or discontinuity?</p><p>ANNE RICHARDS, CEO, M&amp;G INVESTMENTS: I think just no surprises. I think people are not expecting any fireworks and I think delivering that would be actually a good underpinning to the markets, particularly after the volatility that we saw in the first quarter, and that change and tone of the markets where you saw bonds and equities both moving down rather than up. So that increased volatility, that correlation of the wrong way, the way that people don't like correlations to go. So I think the fed here -- we've had those interest rate rises up to now, market isn't expecting anything, no surprises will be good results.</p><p>LACQUA: What is the fed's main dilemma right now?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, I mean, feds always have dilemma about the path of growth, about the expectations of markets, about inflation. Actually, corporate earnings are doing pretty well. They've been ahead of expectations. Inflation, we've got enough inflation. It doesn't look like we have too much inflation. We're kind of on target on inflation, I would say. So I don't think there are too many dilemmas. I think that the challenge is simply don't do a misstep that spooks anybody at this point, particularly when you set this in a wider context, so a lot of uncertainty around trade, around some of the geopolitical relationships. I think the mantra is don't mess up here, stead as she goes.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Anne, when you look at the M&amp;G Investments and when you look at the mathematics of bond bear markets, I believe that is yield higher, prices lower. It's never a smooth gradient, there're always jump conditions. What are the kinds of jump conditions that we could see in the bond market where we get jumps in yield and lower prices suddenly?</p><p>RICHARDS: So it's this -- always against this backdrop, there're stuffs that could happen that would shock the market into doing different things. It's very hard to predict what those are in advance, which is a tripe thing to say. We all know that. But we have -- we are moving this year from a position of net bond purchasing by central banks to a situation where we've got net bond issuance right around the world. And the market is still adjusting to what that looks and feel like. Actually, you've got a big buyer who is no longer going to be buying, if you like, right around the world. And I think that is the tipping point. It's about the demand and supply for those bond issues that are out there. So I think, to me, that is the big one that we're navigating this year. It is a different backdrop to bond markets, in general.</p><p>KEENE: Yes. Francine, this is really important on what she just said. Anne Richards goes down microeconomic principles when you look at a big macroeconomic view from 30,000 feet, I think. I really agree with that, that this is about microeconomics here forward for Chairman Powell.</p><p>LACQUA: It is, Tom. But if we bring it back to the markets, Anne, what do clients want? I mean, what kind of strategies do they ask of you?</p><p>RICHARDS: So I think smoothing has definitely been something. I mean, people have got quite used to this relatively low volatile world, at least in listed markets and so -- and conventional markets. You could argue, there has been a lot of volatility. Non-conventional markets like digital currencies and Bitcoin, all of that sort of stuff. But conventional markets, volatility really had become very subdued. And suddenly there's been that shock back into volatility worlds. So removing that volatility, so trying to seek out where you have counter-correlated assets to kind of smooth that path is definitely one of the things that people are out there. Having said that, I think a lot of people are look at the underlying power of earnings that we've got through coming from the corporate sector. And looking at the trade-off of the risks that you now see and still not again a lot of real yield out of bond markets and still getting quite a powerhouse in terms of earning growth from equity markets and saying, actually, the price of our extra volatility and equity markets might be worth paying because you can really see the fundamentals coming through. So I think there's a number of -- it really depends always on utility curves, preferences. What is it that is most important to individuals? And there's no one summary you can say, all individuals want this or all individuals want that. So I think those are two of themes that we would see coming through in conversations with clients.</p><p>LACQUA: I mean, has the conversation shifted in the last couple of weeks because there's a little bit of a slowdown in economic growth worldwide? And actually, what does that mean again for a market sentiment in the future and the correlation with monetary policy?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's fascinating actually. See, people -- how quickly sentiment changes and what people talk about. So some of those things that I just perceive that people are suddenly talking about again, gold has come back, but inflation, gold. Suddenly -- we didn't talk about that six months ago. Suddenly, that's back on the conversation again. So that's one thing. I think that the oil price, frankly, is another. You've seen the oil price, which everybody said was very subdued for a very long period of time. And it sort of snuck up on us instead of gradually, gradually, gradually been moving into territory where despite the fact that you've not seen the investment really start go back in again. Actually, the economics start to make that more appealing. So there's mentioned in conversations around oil price commodities and the knock-on effects of that. So I think we're going to see a change in tone in some of those conversations. The whole tech conversation of what does a successful business model look like in technology. Again, 2016-2017, big tech was winner almost regardless of what it did. Much more discrimination coming into the conversations with clients about what a good business model is, what a bad business model is and (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Anne Richards, Megan Greene writing in the FT today on where is inflation, we're all waiting for it. I guess we'll hear about it in the non-press conference today at the debt (ph) meeting. Where is the inflation?</p><p>RICHARDS: Gosh, what an interesting question. Inflation comes in all sorts of different places and unexpected places, I think. So conventional inflation is varying country-by-country, market-by-market quite significantly, oil price will be feeding through into inflation numbers, that's absolutely the case. But on the other hand, if you see what's happening on the retail high street, you can see the high street is challenged still by falling process in many areas, where on the other side coin, you've got internet prices actually going up in some respect. So you've got some quite an interesting contrast there. So I think, overall in inflation, it's still a very difficult picture, I think, for anybody to grasp the totality of it. So oil price starting to feed through is definitely one, and some of the big currency moves, you're actually seeing currency induced inflation rather than fundamental underlying inflation.</p><p>KEENE: Exactly. Well, that's one of our themes here through Surveillance this morning. Anne Richards with us with the M&amp;G Investment.</p><p>LACQUA: We're back with Anne Richards, Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. Anne, when you look at again what your clients want, how you position on your portfolios, trade tensions seemed to be on the back of it because at least Steve Mnuchin is showing up in a couple of hours I think to try and discuss, is this still the main risk for the world economy or is it monetary policy?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's (inaudible). So I think trade is clearly out there as something that people are concerned about because the global economy, in terms of the totality of the pie, if you like, has been expanded over recent decades by global trades. That's been the big driver of much of the global expansion. So if that is really under threat, then there is a risk that we end up fighting over a smaller -- a share of the smaller pie as opposed to it. And I think that is the concern that's out there. Having said all of that, the way that America has been conducting trade policy negotiations, and indeed other international negotiations has been about ripping up the playbook, throwing everything up in the air, getting everybody uncertain and then coming to a compromise at the last minute, and you can see that. And a classic example of that is the way the North and South Korea conversations are going. Whereas if you think back to last year, it was all about who was going to hit the big the red button first. And now, we actually have come far farther than anyone ever anticipated than we would have done a year ago. So I think there's a little bit around this whole global trade tariffs conversation which will affect -- will be affected in the same way ultimately. On the European thing, I just absolutely do not believe that the U.S. wants to mess up relationship with Europe. But President Trump clearly wants to get the maximum that it possibly can out of any bartering that it does with Europe, hence, the conversations that have been had with Mr. Macron, with Mrs. Merkel over the last week or so. So I think that's what we're going to play out and I think most of that, as when we look at it, think that that is the central scenario. But in that sense (ph), there are risks.</p><p>LACQUA: Do you worry about European growth having peaked? We're seeing -- again, the data is not that clear actually, right? It depends on kind of some of the PMIs are better than expected in certain countries, worse than expecting others, should we assume that it doesn't get any better than this for your portfolios?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, I think on Europe. I mean, I think there are still a lot of things that are going in the right direction. But there have been a few things which have come together simultaneously. People are starting to get concerned about the impact of Brexit on Mainland Europe. That wasn't a concern. That is beginning to be a little bit of a concern. You will see people deferring or shaping some of their investment plans because of that. So that will have a feed through on that. The fact that in Germany and France and Italy, so with the big three countries there, there are political tensions and relatively unclear and insecure governments in different forms and shapes in place there. Again, it doesn't help the view that we're going to get a kind of coordinated negotiated settlement on anything very much. So there were a few things in the background that just make people feel a little bit less comfortable than they did six months ago in Europe. But actually, the direction of travel is still okay.</p><p>KEENE: Anne Richards, Martin Wolf and the FT with a brilliant walkthrough of China's attitude as the U.S. officials travel to China, I guess, to have a big argument on trade. What does it mean for your international investment at M&amp;G? Do you lighten up or is this an opportunity to acquire Pacific Rim shares?</p><p>RICHARDS: So, look, on the whole China story and what is being driven through that China story, I think the -- you are seeing a change yet again in the outreach that's coming out of China. And that is very, very powerful. So the ability of business to get direct access to markets that it was not able to get direct access to before in China has been -- that's a very significant announcement. The fact that she is in place for much longer than might have been anticipated and will be continuing to drive forward in that economic empowering, I think, creates a very positive backdrop to what's going on in China. So I think we would remain positive on the direction of travel</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there of M&amp;G stays with us.</p><p>Joining us now is Francisco Jeronimo, IDC Senior Research Director for European mobile devices and Anne Richards of M&amp;G Investments where she's Chief Executive. So thank you both for coming on the program. Francisco, what do we learn about Apple?</p><p>FRANCISCO JERONIMO, SENIOR RESEARCH DIRECTOR, IDC: We learned that a powerful brand continues to perform when they continue to deliver value that consumers perceived as something that improves overtime. And after ten years when the first -- after the first -- the launch of the first iPhone, and when the market is already contracting. And then last year, the decline for the first time, the smart phone, Apple delivering these kinds of results at a higher price point, it's remarkable and definitely a stellar quarter for Apple.</p><p>LACQUA: Francisco, let me talk to you about the iPhone and then I want to ask Anne a little bit about the financial surrounding Apple. But if you look at the iPhone year-on-year revenue growth -- Tom, bear with me. I know you don't like candle charts, but this is a really good one. We heard from the Chief Executive of Apple saying, look, iPhone X was stellar, best performing, but that's what you'd expect. How does he continue on this trend in the quarters to come?</p><p>JERONIMO: That's a challenge for them. Of course, it's a challenge. But it really shows that the brand proposition and then the perception of the consumers and enterprises also have about Apple is not just about the good looking iPhones, it's about everything that comes with the device. The ecosystem and all the services and also a very important topic that he mentioned in the call, the privacy and security, and indeed IDC did a recent survey to enterprise in Europe. And we found out that the top reason that why enterprises choose an iPhone is because of security and the perception that an iPhone brings around security. And this is a very important value for consumers and enterprises in the smart phone, particularly nowadays with all the news and the candles (ph) around privacy leaks and all of those problems.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. We can take about Facebook. We also need to talk about Snap. I know I'm going to find Tom on Snap. I'm sure it's like #tomtom or something like that. He's keeping it secret. Anne, when you look at Apple, they have a lot of cash. And finally, they're returning it to shareholders. Do you like the stock (inaudible)?</p><p>RICHARDS: So hundred billion coming back to shareholders, I mean, that can be quite nice. That could be quite nice for markets that's putting a lot of liquidity into the system. There's a lot of central banks that would like that sort of money, I think, knocking around. So I think that it's tremendous. But I think the thing you have to remember with Apple is its maturity as a business is showing through. And I don't mean maturity in terms of the product range. But actually it's grown up company that has proper mechanisms in place. It's not trying to make this up as it has got larger -- unexpectedly larger, like some of the newer competitors in the general social media tech space. You really see that strength coming through. And what's fascinating to me is that it's still innovating but its innovation is not a product book. It is in that ecosystem, exactly as you mentioned. It is in the services that it's persuading us all to subscribe to. And it's been very, very successful in doing that. Service revenue is now really significant proportion of the overall mix. So I think when you look in the round (ph), I mean, Apple at this valuation at this point, it takes a strong stomach. We don't have very much exposure to it. But nonetheless, I think you've got to give credit to it for its ability to continue to innovate in different ways with this business model.</p><p>KEENE: That was so brilliant, folks, with the mathematics of Anne Richards that we're going to stop the show, show a chart and continue with the mathematician from Edinboro and the engineer from Edinboro. She used the word, maturity. Okay. So, Anne, this on a second derivative basis is logged (ph) concave. The media is hardwired to long convex, IDC, Francisco's company has been brilliant with a tempered view. Is Apply basically tending towards a utility-like cash flow, Anne Richards, which goes to the maturity of that concave chart? I mean, they're not the normal growth company anymore, are they? They are just, as you say, a mature company.</p><p>RICHARDS: So they're a mature company. I would probably go with the view that they're a mature and growing company, so a company that is not going through the stellar almost exponential growth that you see, and we might come and talk back about Snap and how that works in reverse as well. But I think you've got to give a lot of credit to Apple that it is managing to innovate its business model and that is coming through in a much more robust and sustainable model than you see in some of the (inaudible). Now, valuation is a different thing. But nonetheless, (inaudible) business model looks sustainable.</p><p>KEENE: Okay. This is brilliant, folks. We've got a major financial accent in Anne Richards and Francisco Jeronimo working with IDC. Francisco, help us with the unit partial differentials as you go up the cell phone price point. The Apple gloom and doom crew says the iPhone X costs too much, baloney, they're selling them like crazy. Where is the tip point per unit? Is it $900? Is it $700? Where is the tip point where expensive phones become a gravy train?</p><p>JERONIMO: The tipping point is when there is no additional value that consumers are willing or are getting from a product. The criticisms that we hear today about the iPhone X is exactly the same criticism that we heard in 2007 when they launched the first iPhone. Everyone was saying, this is crazy, launching a smart phone at this price point when the average selling smart phone at that time were much lower, and it's exactly the same. Of course, it doesn't Apple can continue to stretch the prices up because there's definitely a limit where consumers will ask themselves whether it's worth paying for that kind of device or not. But at the moment, Apple continues to do very well and the $1,000 price tag continues to be an achievable average selling price for their projects in the next quarters. However, the market is contracting. So even if Apple wants to sell less products or sell less products at a higher price point, there's a limit because the market is not growing for every single person around the world and in regions where people cannot afford these kinds price points as Apple continues to do and invest in the older versions of their devices and pushing those previous to those consumers at lower price points. But clearly, if the value is there, consumers are willing to pay.</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, talk to me about Facebook. So they're going into a dating app which actually a lot of their dating ventures (ph) are more (inaudible) about. And this is Snap. So Snap was down, I think, 18% of premarket trade because their redesign isn't working. I mean, what happened to Snap?</p><p>RICHARDS: Well, it's burning through cash at a rate. It's got a lot of cash on its balance sheet. So I think it's a time cash burn story. Can it turn around the use of experience in such a way that it actually starts to put on user growth at the same rate as it did before and get the ad revenue going to support it before it runs out of cash? And we've seen loads of business. They're not usually this big when they go through this but this is a very classic program. And I think that's the situation that we're in with Snap at the moment.</p><p>KEENE: Well, go ahead, Anne. Please continue.</p><p>RICHARDS: No, I was going to say what I think what's interesting when you see that the Facebook, the dating app, and we see Google's recent announcement, even you see Apple talking about what it's doing with Apple Watch and thinking about health. The ecosystem argument is definitely leeching out all of these companies and thinking how do we expand from our simple one product, one business model ad revenue fuelled model into something that is expanding. And I think at this stage, we don't know who is going to be the winner in this. But certainly the companies that are trying to do something different are more likely to succeed than those that aren't.</p><p>KEENE: I can't say enough how valuable this was. Anne Richards with us with M&amp;G. Francisco Jeronimo, thank you so much, with IDC. I look forward to speaking to you with John Farrell on Bloomberg Radio here in a bit.</p><p>Anne Richards at M&amp;G Investments knows where national is knows it's a cheaper venue to run a firm. Is this the future, Anne Richards? Are all the teams like you, M&amp;G, everybody else, is this the reality as you're going to leave the big cities?</p><p>RICHARDS: I don't think so. I think there are different reasons and different business models why people choose to do things. And I think you can overextrapolate what's going on. But it's -- for sure, you see that active management has been under pressure to prove itself in recent years. And I think -- we think that when you still continue to deliver the outcome that customer wants, that the client wants at the end of the day, the proposition is still very, very robust and compelling. I mean, we do have to all challenge ourselves on our cost base in order to make sure that we're delivering for those clients in the most efficient way that we can. And maybe that's an area where we've underinvested. But it's not just about location. It's much more innovative use of technology, for example, to run our operating systems and so forth.</p><p>KEENE: One that seems interesting to me, Anne Richards, is making money in the fixed income money management space. It's been a mystery to me for really ten years, even longer than that. What are the margins like in fixed income and how do you manage fixed income in the future?</p><p>RICHARDS: The key thing to being successful in fixed income markets in their broadest sense is the flexibility to go across the boundaries. So very, very simplistically, what I mean, by that is the ability to go long/short duration, long/short credit to across the boundaries between investment grade and high yield, even to go across the boundaries of public versus private markets. And the key money has been made across those boundaries and the ability to use that. Too often in fixed income space historically, we've tendered to have very, very narrow buckets. So you're really limited to one or two investment decisions. And if they go the wrong or the market goes the wrong way, then you have nowhere else to go. So flexibility, doing stuff that's harder to do in private markets, those are all areas where it has been possible to deliver really good returns, and actually I think will be in the future, but you need that flexibility.</p><p>LACQUA: And one what kind of impact has MiFID II has had at this point?</p><p>RICHARDS: It's sort of a little bit like the French Revolution. I think sometimes we feel it's a bit too early to say. The biggest impact that people will talk about is this fear that we've seen some liquidity, some trading capacity taken out of the market. It's not been a major issue yet. But I think there is a concern than in some kind of serious market correction, it might be difficult to find the volume and the liquidity in the market at a time when you need to in order to be able to shift things around. I think people are worried about it. There are some signs that that has happened. And I think we're all working behind the scenes to try and make sure that we find a way of staying within the MiFID rules, but nonetheless working constructively with regulators and others to make sure we don't lose that liquidity on moments of distress.</p><p>LACQUA: And, Anne, talking about your clients, are you pitching for the money from Lloyds that they took out as Standard Life Aberdeen?</p><p>RICHARDS: Okay. I would never talk publicly about anything that we would (inaudible), so I'm not going to -- I'm going to plead (inaudible) on that one, if I may.</p><p>LACQUA: Okay. Of course, that's a very elegant way of not answering a question and totally respect that.</p><p>KEENE: You just killed it there, Francine. That was just absolutely brilliant. (Inaudible) TV GO, if you're at M&amp;G Investments and you need to dazzle Anne Richards this morning, you can do better -- look at this, come on.</p><p>LACQUA: So, I mean, you can't relax from the market then. Do you just kind of ignore the politics and focus on the fundamentals of BOE and the economy for investment decisions in the U.K.?</p><p>RICHARDS: Yes, I think you have to do it. I mean, you see, there are different parts of the market are doing well or better or worst. Retail really struggling high street on the one hand, on the other hand, you've got other parts of the market constructions doing a little bit better. So the economy, as a whole, has some good parts and some less good parts. We're not in Brexit yet. I mean, I think this is a thing that everybody sometimes forgets. We haven't had the Brexit. So we are still benefiting from all of the relationships that we currently have. So the question really is what happens once we move into that new world and we still have no real visibility in what that structure will look like. And I think the only real tangible thing that you've seen so far which gives you sometimes the measure that if you have seen investment flow, unquestionably, you're seeing decisions deferred, that's not to say it's all stopped, but you have seen that. So the longer term consequences of that if it's just a deferral and we'll come back again once we're through this period of uncertainty or actually hasn't permanently gone away, too early to say on that yet. So I think the -- between now and September-October when we get the final terms of what this limitation period looks like, what the final deal looks like, it's desperately important to get some visibility on that.</p><p>LACQUA: Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there, M&amp;G Investments' Chief Executive, and David Merritt, Bloomberg's European News Director, joining us on Brexit.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

She is the Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. And as always, you make us smarter, so thank you so much for coming on. What do you need from J. Powell? Is it more of an indication of kind of forward-looking of how many rate hikes? Is it something on the inverted yield curve and what that means as it happens or discontinuity?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  I think just no surprises. I think people are not expecting any fireworks and I think delivering that would be actually a good underpinning to the markets, particularly after the volatility that we saw in the first quarter, and that change and tone of the markets where you saw bonds and equities both moving down rather than up. So that increased volatility, that correlation of the wrong way, the way that people don't like correlations to go. So I think the fed here -- we've had those interest rate rises up to now, market isn't expecting anything, no surprises will be good results.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  What is the fed's main dilemma right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, feds always have dilemma about the path of growth, about the expectations of markets, about inflation. Actually, corporate earnings are doing pretty well. They've been ahead of expectations. Inflation, we've got enough inflation. It doesn't look like we have too much inflation. We're kind of on target on inflation, I would say. So I don't think there are too many dilemmas. I think that the challenge is simply don't do a misstep that spooks anybody at this point, particularly when you set this in a wider context, so a lot of uncertainty around trade, around some of the geopolitical relationships. I think the mantra is don't mess up here, stead as she goes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Anne, when you look at the M&amp;G Investments and when you look at the mathematics of bond bear markets, I believe that is yield higher, prices lower. It's never a smooth gradient, there're always jump conditions. What are the kinds of jump conditions that we could see in the bond market where we get jumps in yield and lower prices suddenly?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  So it's this -- always against this backdrop, there're stuffs that could happen that would shock the market into doing different things. It's very hard to predict what those are in advance, which is a tripe thing to say. We all know that. But we have -- we are moving this year from a position of net bond purchasing by central banks to a situation where we've got net bond issuance right around the world. And the market is still adjusting to what that looks and feel like. Actually, you've got a big buyer who is no longer going to be buying, if you like, right around the world. And I think that is the tipping point. It's about the demand and supply for those bond issues that are out there. So I think, to me, that is the big one that we're navigating this year. It is a different backdrop to bond markets, in general.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. Francine, this is really important on what she just said. Anne Richards goes down microeconomic principles when you look at a big macroeconomic view from 30,000 feet, I think. I really agree with that, that this is about microeconomics here forward for Chairman Powell.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  It is, Tom. But if we bring it back to the markets, Anne, what do clients want? I mean, what kind of strategies do they ask of you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  So I think smoothing has definitely been something. I mean, people have got quite used to this relatively low volatile world, at least in listed markets and so -- and conventional markets. You could argue, there has been a lot of volatility. Non-conventional markets like digital currencies and Bitcoin, all of that sort of stuff. But conventional markets, volatility really had become very subdued. And suddenly there's been that shock back into volatility worlds. So removing that volatility, so trying to seek out where you have counter-correlated assets to kind of smooth that path is definitely one of the things that people are out there. Having said that, I think a lot of people are look at the underlying power of earnings that we've got through coming from the corporate sector. And looking at the trade-off of the risks that you now see and still not again a lot of real yield out of bond markets and still getting quite a powerhouse in terms of earning growth from equity markets and saying, actually, the price of our extra volatility and equity markets might be worth paying because you can really see the fundamentals coming through. So I think there's a number of -- it really depends always on utility curves, preferences. What is it that is most important to individuals? And there's no one summary you can say, all individuals want this or all individuals want that. So I think those are two of themes that we would see coming through in conversations with clients.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  I mean, has the conversation shifted in the last couple of weeks because there's a little bit of a slowdown in economic growth worldwide? And actually, what does that mean again for a market sentiment in the future and the correlation with monetary policy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  It's fascinating actually. See, people -- how quickly sentiment changes and what people talk about. So some of those things that I just perceive that people are suddenly talking about again, gold has come back, but inflation, gold. Suddenly -- we didn't talk about that six months ago. Suddenly, that's back on the conversation again. So that's one thing. I think that the oil price, frankly, is another. You've seen the oil price, which everybody said was very subdued for a very long period of time. And it sort of snuck up on us instead of gradually, gradually, gradually been moving into territory where despite the fact that you've not seen the investment really start go back in again. Actually, the economics start to make that more appealing. So there's mentioned in conversations around oil price commodities and the knock-on effects of that. So I think we're going to see a change in tone in some of those conversations. The whole tech conversation of what does a successful business model look like in technology. Again, 2016-2017, big tech was winner almost regardless of what it did. Much more discrimination coming into the conversations with clients about what a good business model is, what a bad business model is and (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Anne Richards, Megan Greene writing in the FT today on where is inflation, we're all waiting for it. I guess we'll hear about it in the non-press conference today at the debt (ph) meeting. Where is the inflation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  Gosh, what an interesting question. Inflation comes in all sorts of different places and unexpected places, I think. So conventional inflation is varying country-by-country, market-by-market quite significantly, oil price will be feeding through into inflation numbers, that's absolutely the case. But on the other hand, if you see what's happening on the retail high street, you can see the high street is challenged still by falling process in many areas, where on the other side coin, you've got internet prices actually going up in some respect. So you've got some quite an interesting contrast there. So I think, overall in inflation, it's still a very difficult picture, I think, for anybody to grasp the totality of it. So oil price starting to feed through is definitely one, and some of the big currency moves, you're actually seeing currency induced inflation rather than fundamental underlying inflation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Exactly. Well, that's one of our themes here through Surveillance this morning. Anne Richards with us with the M&amp;G Investment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  We're back with Anne Richards, Chief Executive of M&amp;G Investments. Anne, when you look at again what your clients want, how you position on your portfolios, trade tensions seemed to be on the back of it because at least Steve Mnuchin is showing up in a couple of hours I think to try and discuss, is this still the main risk for the world economy or is it monetary policy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  It's (inaudible). So I think trade is clearly out there as something that people are concerned about because the global economy, in terms of the totality of the pie, if you like, has been expanded over recent decades by global trades. That's been the big driver of much of the global expansion. So if that is really under threat, then there is a risk that we end up fighting over a smaller -- a share of the smaller pie as opposed to it. And I think that is the concern that's out there. Having said all of that, the way that America has been conducting trade policy negotiations, and indeed other international negotiations has been about ripping up the playbook, throwing everything up in the air, getting everybody uncertain and then coming to a compromise at the last minute, and you can see that. And a classic example of that is the way the North and South Korea conversations are going. Whereas if you think back to last year, it was all about who was going to hit the big the red button first. And now, we actually have come far farther than anyone ever anticipated than we would have done a year ago. So I think there's a little bit around this whole global trade tariffs conversation which will affect -- will be affected in the same way ultimately. On the European thing, I just absolutely do not believe that the U.S. wants to mess up relationship with Europe. But President Trump clearly wants to get the maximum that it possibly can out of any bartering that it does with Europe, hence, the conversations that have been had with Mr. Macron, with Mrs. Merkel over the last week or so. So I think that's what we're going to play out and I think most of that, as when we look at it, think that that is the central scenario. But in that sense (ph), there are risks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Do you worry about European growth having peaked? We're seeing -- again, the data is not that clear actually, right? It depends on kind of some of the PMIs are better than expected in certain countries, worse than expecting others, should we assume that it doesn't get any better than this for your portfolios?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  Well, I think on Europe. I mean, I think there are still a lot of things that are going in the right direction. But there have been a few things which have come together simultaneously. People are starting to get concerned about the impact of Brexit on Mainland Europe. That wasn't a concern. That is beginning to be a little bit of a concern. You will see people deferring or shaping some of their investment plans because of that. So that will have a feed through on that. The fact that in Germany and France and Italy, so with the big three countries there, there are political tensions and relatively unclear and insecure governments in different forms and shapes in place there. Again, it doesn't help the view that we're going to get a kind of coordinated negotiated settlement on anything very much. So there were a few things in the background that just make people feel a little bit less comfortable than they did six months ago in Europe. But actually, the direction of travel is still okay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Anne Richards, Martin Wolf and the FT with a brilliant walkthrough of China's attitude as the U.S. officials travel to China, I guess, to have a big argument on trade. What does it mean for your international investment at M&amp;G? Do you lighten up or is this an opportunity to acquire Pacific Rim shares?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  So, look, on the whole China story and what is being driven through that China story, I think the -- you are seeing a change yet again in the outreach that's coming out of China. And that is very, very powerful. So the ability of business to get direct access to markets that it was not able to get direct access to before in China has been -- that's a very significant announcement. The fact that she is in place for much longer than might have been anticipated and will be continuing to drive forward in that economic empowering, I think, creates a very positive backdrop to what's going on in China. So I think we would remain positive on the direction of travel  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there of M&amp;G stays with us.  </p><p>      Joining us now is Francisco Jeronimo, IDC Senior Research Director for European mobile devices and Anne Richards of M&amp;G Investments where she's Chief Executive. So thank you both for coming on the program. Francisco, what do we learn about Apple?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JERONIMO</emphasis>:  We learned that a powerful brand continues to perform when they continue to deliver value that consumers perceived as something that improves overtime. And after ten years when the first -- after the first -- the launch of the first iPhone, and when the market is already contracting. And then last year, the decline for the first time, the smart phone, Apple delivering these kinds of results at a higher price point, it's remarkable and definitely a stellar quarter for Apple.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Francisco, let me talk to you about the iPhone and then I want to ask Anne a little bit about the financial surrounding Apple. But if you look at the iPhone year-on-year revenue growth -- Tom, bear with me. I know you don't like candle charts, but this is a really good one. We heard from the Chief Executive of Apple saying, look, iPhone X was stellar, best performing, but that's what you'd expect. How does he continue on this trend in the quarters to come?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JERONIMO</emphasis>:  That's a challenge for them. Of course, it's a challenge. But it really shows that the brand proposition and then the perception of the consumers and enterprises also have about Apple is not just about the good looking iPhones, it's about everything that comes with the device. The ecosystem and all the services and also a very important topic that he mentioned in the call, the privacy and security, and indeed IDC did a recent survey to enterprise in Europe. And we found out that the top reason that why enterprises choose an iPhone is because of security and the perception that an iPhone brings around security. And this is a very important value for consumers and enterprises in the smart phone, particularly nowadays with all the news and the candles (ph) around privacy leaks and all of those problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Yes. We can talk about Facebook. We also need to talk about Snap. I know I'm going to find Tom on Snap. I'm sure it's like #tomtom or something like that. He's keeping it secret. Anne, when you look at Apple, they have a lot of cash. And finally, they're returning it to shareholders. Do you like the stock (inaudible)?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  So hundred billion coming back to shareholders, I mean, that can be quite nice. That could be quite nice for markets that's putting a lot of liquidity into the system. There's a lot of central banks that would like that sort of money, I think, knocking around. So I think that it's tremendous. But I think the thing you have to remember with Apple is its maturity as a business is showing through. And I don't mean maturity in terms of the product range. But actually it's grown up company that has proper mechanisms in place. It's not trying to make this up as it has got larger -- unexpectedly larger, like some of the newer competitors in the general social media tech space. You really see that strength coming through. And what's fascinating to me is that it's still innovating but its innovation is not a product book. It is in that ecosystem, exactly as you mentioned. It is in the services that it's persuading us all to subscribe to. And it's been very, very successful in doing that. Service revenue is now really significant proportion of the overall mix. So I think when you look in the round (ph), I mean, Apple at this valuation at this point, it takes a strong stomach. We don't have very much exposure to it. But nonetheless, I think you've got to give credit to it for its ability to continue to innovate in different ways with this business model.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  That was so brilliant, folks, with the mathematics of Anne Richards that we're going to stop the show, show a chart and continue with the mathematician from Edinboro and the engineer from Edinboro. She used the word, maturity. Okay. So, Anne, this on a second derivative basis is logged (ph) concave. The media is hardwired to long convex, IDC, Francisco's company has been brilliant with a tempered view. Is Apply basically tending towards a utility-like cash flow, Anne Richards, which goes to the maturity of that concave chart? I mean, they're not the normal growth company anymore, are they? They are just, as you say, a mature company.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  So they're a mature company. I would probably go with the view that they're a mature and growing company, so a company that is not going through the stellar almost exponential growth that you see, and we might come and talk back about Snap and how that works in reverse as well. But I think you've got to give a lot of credit to Apple that it is managing to innovate its business model and that is coming through in a much more robust and sustainable model than you see in some of the (inaudible). Now, valuation is a different thing. But nonetheless, (inaudible) business model looks sustainable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Okay. This is brilliant, folks. We've got a major financial accent in Anne Richards and Francisco Jeronimo working with IDC. Francisco, help us with the unit partial differentials as you go up the cell phone price point. The Apple gloom and doom crew says the iPhone X costs too much, baloney, they're selling them like crazy. Where is the tip point per unit? Is it $900? Is it $700? Where is the tip point where expensive phones become a gravy train?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JERONIMO</emphasis>:  The tipping point is when there is no additional value that consumers are willing or are getting from a product. The criticisms that we hear today about the iPhone X is exactly the same criticism that we heard in 2007 when they launched the first iPhone. Everyone was saying, this is crazy, launching a smart phone at this price point when the average selling smart phone at that time were much lower, and it's exactly the same. Of course, it doesn't Apple can continue to stretch the prices up because there's definitely a limit where consumers will ask themselves whether it's worth paying for that kind of device or not. But at the moment, Apple continues to do very well and the $1,000 price tag continues to be an achievable average selling price for their projects in the next quarters. However, the market is contracting. So even if Apple wants to sell less products or sell less products at a higher price point, there's a limit because the market is not growing for every single person around the world and in regions where people cannot afford these kinds price points as Apple continues to do and invest in the older versions of their devices and pushing those previous to those consumers at lower price points. But clearly, if the value is there, consumers are willing to pay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Anne, talk to me about Facebook. So they're going into a dating app which actually a lot of their dating ventures (ph) are more (inaudible) about. And this is Snap. So Snap was down, I think, 18% of premarket trade because their redesign isn't working. I mean, what happened to Snap?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  Well, it's burning through cash at a rate. It's got a lot of cash on its balance sheet. So I think it's a time cash burn story. Can it turn around the use of experience in such a way that it actually starts to put on user growth at the same rate as it did before and get the ad revenue going to support it before it runs out of cash? And we've seen loads of business. They're not usually this big when they go through this but this is a very classic program. And I think that's the situation that we're in with Snap at the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Well, go ahead, Anne. Please continue.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  No, I was going to say what I think what's interesting when you see that the Facebook, the dating app, and we see Google's recent announcement, even you see Apple talking about what it's doing with Apple Watch and thinking about health. The ecosystem argument is definitely leeching out all of these companies and thinking how do we expand from our simple one product, one business model ad revenue fuelled model into something that is expanding. And I think at this stage, we don't know who is going to be the winner in this. But certainly the companies that are trying to do something different are more likely to succeed than those that aren't.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I can't say enough how valuable this was. Anne Richards with us with M&amp;G. Francisco Jeronimo, thank you so much, with IDC. I look forward to speaking to you with John Farrell on Bloomberg Radio here in a bit.  </p><p>      Anne Richards at M&amp;G Investments knows where national is knows it's a cheaper venue to run a firm. Is this the future, Anne Richards? Are all the teams like you, M&amp;G, everybody else, is this the reality as you're going to leave the big cities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  I don't think so. I think there are different reasons and different business models why people choose to do things. And I think you can overextrapolate what's going on. But it's -- for sure, you see that active management has been under pressure to prove itself in recent years. And I think -- we think that when you still continue to deliver the outcome that customer wants, that the client wants at the end of the day, the proposition is still very, very robust and compelling. I mean, we do have to all challenge ourselves on our cost base in order to make sure that we're delivering for those clients in the most efficient way that we can. And maybe that's an area where we've underinvested. But it's not just about location. It's much more innovative use of technology, for example, to run our operating systems and so forth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  One that seems interesting to me, Anne Richards, is making money in the fixed income money management space. It's been a mystery to me for really ten years, even longer than that. What are the margins like in fixed income and how do you manage fixed income in the future?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  The key thing to being successful in fixed income markets in their broadest sense is the flexibility to go across the boundaries. So very, very simplistically, what I mean, by that is the ability to go long/short duration, long/short credit to across the boundaries between investment grade and high yield, even to go across the boundaries of public versus private markets. And the key money has been made across those boundaries and the ability to use that. Too often in fixed income space historically, we've tendered to have very, very narrow buckets. So you're really limited to one or two investment decisions. And if they go the wrong or the market goes the wrong way, then you have nowhere else to go. So flexibility, doing stuff that's harder to do in private markets, those are all areas where it has been possible to deliver really good returns, and actually I think will be in the future, but you need that flexibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And one what kind of impact has MiFID II has had at this point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  It's sort of a little bit like the French Revolution. I think sometimes we feel it's a bit too early to say. The biggest impact that people will talk about is this fear that we've seen some liquidity, some trading capacity taken out of the market. It's not been a major issue yet. But I think there is a concern than in some kind of serious market correction, it might be difficult to find the volume and the liquidity in the market at a time when you need to in order to be able to shift things around. I think people are worried about it. There are some signs that that has happened. And I think we're all working behind the scenes to try and make sure that we find a way of staying within the MiFID rules, but nonetheless working constructively with regulators and others to make sure we don't lose that liquidity on moments of distress.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  And, Anne, talking about your clients, are you pitching for the money from Lloyds that they took out as Standard Life Aberdeen?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  Okay. I would never talk publicly about anything that we would (inaudible), so I'm not going to -- I'm going to plead (inaudible) on that one, if I may.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Okay. Of course, that's a very elegant way of not answering a question and totally respect that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You just killed it there, Francine. That was just absolutely brilliant. (Inaudible) TV GO, if you're at M&amp;G Investments and you need to dazzle Anne Richards this morning, you can do better -- look at this, come on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  So, I mean, you can't relax from the market then. Do you just kind of ignore the politics and focus on the fundamentals of BOE and the economy for investment decisions in the U.K.?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARDS</emphasis>:  Yes, I think you have to do it. I mean, you see, there are different parts of the market are doing well or better or worst. Retail really struggling high street on the one hand, on the other hand, you've got other parts of the market constructions doing a little bit better. So the economy, as a whole, has some good parts and some less good parts. We're not in Brexit yet. I mean, I think this is a thing that everybody sometimes forgets. We haven't had the Brexit. So we are still benefiting from all of the relationships that we currently have. So the question really is what happens once we move into that new world and we still have no real visibility in what that structure will look like. And I think the only real tangible thing that you've seen so far which gives you sometimes the measure that if you have seen investment flow, unquestionably, you're seeing decisions deferred, that's not to say it's all stopped, but you have seen that. So the longer term consequences of that if it's just a deferral and we'll come back again once we're through this period of uncertainty or actually hasn't permanently gone away, too early to say on that yet. So I think the -- between now and September-October when we get the final terms of what this limitation period looks like, what the final deal looks like, it's desperately important to get some visibility on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACQUA</emphasis>:  Anne, thank you so much. Anne Richards there, M&amp;G Investments' Chief Executive, and David Merritt, Bloomberg's European News Director, joining us on Brexit.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7T-2YG1-JDPT-T49W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

But...</p><p>Anne Wojcicki had planned to meet me at an Afghan restaurant in Sunnyvale, Silicon Valley, where you can usually depend on good weather. </p><p>But the day arrives stormily. The chief executive of one of the world\u2019s leading \u2014 and most contentious \u2014 consumer genetic testing companies is reluctant to drag her seven-month-old daughter through the driving rain to our lunch spot. </p><p>After a flurry of calls, we meet at 23andMe, where the sterile canteen is enlivened by colourful old sofas from employees\u2019 apartments.</p><p>Through a large porthole window, we can see the playroom. Amid tutti-frutti-coloured toys, a member of staff is watching Wojcicki\u2019s baby, the latest member of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cfirst family\u201d: Wojcicki\u2019s ex-husband, with whom she has two older children, is the Google co-founder <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Sergey_Brin\"> Sergey Brin</url>; her sister       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/search?q=susan+wojcicki\"> Susan </url>is chief executive of YouTube. The Wojcicki sisters are both comfortable putting their motherhood in the public eye, when many female leaders still feel required to hide them. This is the first baby I\u2019ve met at an interview in a decade as a reporter.</p><p>There was a time when Wojcicki was arguably eclipsed by others in her family; no longer. Her company is at the heart of some of the fiercest contemporary debates over data and science. 23andMe sells kits allowing people to send off samples of their spit for genetic analysis, either to discover more about their ancestry ($99), or their ancestry and their future health ($199). It has already sold kits to more than 10m customers worldwide, so Wojcicki sits on a potential gold mine: the largest genetic research database in the world.</p><p>But for all her certainty about the value of genetic testing, the 46-year-old faces a battle for consumers\u2019 hearts and minds. </p><p>For some, the idea of a 23andMe test is unsettling. Could we lose control of profoundly personal data, or unearth unwelcome family secrets? The company seems to be reaching a crunch point: sales growth of the spit kits, which identify genetic variants, are slowing. Days after we meet, the company announces it is laying off 100 employees.</p><p>Wojcicki is adamant that 23andMe\u2019s genetic data will lead to the development of life-changing medicines. \u201cI can see the future. I can see we\u2019re on the right side of history. This is the way the world is going. This is what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d But she does concede that \u201cpredicting timing is impossible\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Predicting anything certainly does</emphasis> seem impossible these days. When I met Wojcicki, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\"> coronavirus</url> was yet to lead to lockdown in the US. Then, it looked as if the most immediate threats to westerners\u2019 health were inherited diseases. Customers turn to 23andMe to learn their risk of suffering from cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, like our ancestors, we live in fear of an infectious disease hiding not in our genes, but on our hands.</p><p>We separate to pick up our lunch. I return from the buffet carrying a small bowl of soup and a plate of chicken teriyaki and egg-fried rice; Wojcicki has the chicken too, but has forgone the rice for extra vegetables and a salad scattered with mushrooms. There will be no dessert and no booze. Wojcicki does not drink, after discovering that she has a slightly higher genetic risk of breast cancer; alcohol is a contributing factor.</p><p>23andMe bridges the worlds of technology and science. It has inevitably been hit by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/6a112bc2-de49-4956-be12-c835b7eab4a6\">Big Tech</url> backlash. Wojcicki readily concedes there is an issue. \u201cPeople are just nervous about data. I think there\u2019s a moment where people want to pause and say, \u2018I want to understand how my data is being used.\u2019\u200a\u201d</p><p>This is all the more pressing as Big Tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple redouble their efforts to transform healthcare with data, devices, miniature sensors and computing power. Google was recently criticised for a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\"> data-sharing agreement with Ascension</url>, a network of more than 150 US hospitals, which patients only learnt about via the front page of The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>\u201cThe biggest challenge that\u2019s going to come is consent,\u201d Wojcicki says. \u201cDepending on what they want to do, the consent process is not necessarily something that is part of how a lot of those companies have operated.\u201d</p><p>Wojcicki, who worked in her twenties as a healthcare investment analyst, also suggests that the healthcare industry gets a free pass when it comes to privacy: once a patient signs a consent form at the doctor\u2019s, they have no idea how their data is used. </p><p>\u201cI think in some ways tech is so under scrutiny, I\u2019m less worried about them,\u201d she declares. \u201cBut people are not scrutinising the healthcare industry.\u201d Recent privacy laws in the EU and California provide many exemptions for healthcare providers, she adds.</p><p>Wojcicki is a born-again believer in regulation. She has spoken in the past about how, back in 2013, 23andMe \u201cpissed off\u201d the FDA by selling its kits, which the regulator designated diagnosis devices, without approval. It took two years of negotiations to get them back on the market.</p><p>Now, she says that there should be an organisation to govern the explosion of data. \u201cWhy isolate healthcare data?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs my healthcare data actually more sensitive than my search data?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I think you could probably argue that everything that\u2019s in my medical record I have searched on at some point.\u201d</p><p>My soup is warming and spicy, perfect for a wet day, although I have no idea what is in it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I tell Wojcicki that</emphasis> I bought a 23andMe kit a year and a half ago \u2014 but it is still sitting in my cupboard. Some people worry about learning they have a propensity for a devastating disease. I\u2019m anxious about uncovering more information about myself than I want to be known. I could submit my spit so 23andMe can tell me whether I\u2019m likely to get breast cancer, but eventually, after new research, my DNA could divulge that I am likely to be a violent criminal, or classify my children by their potential intelligence.</p><p>Surprisingly, Wojcicki plays down the value of genetic information. \u201cSo much of who we are is down to our environment and its interaction with genes,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf you have a propensity for criminal behaviour, which I think is a very unlikely situation here, then there\u2019s obviously a huge environmental component.\u201d</p><p>23andMe Canteen</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">223 N Mathilda Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94086</emphasis></p><p>2 x chicken teriyaki</p><p>2 x bok choy</p><p>1 x salad with mushrooms and egg</p><p>2 x small spicy soup</p><p>2 x water</p><p>The science of genetics has a long history of abuse by eugenicists, obsessed with the idea of breeding out \u201cinferior\u201d intelligence or ensuring racial \u201cpurity\u201d. As new Crispr technology opens up a world where embryos might be edited, genetic data needs to be handled more carefully than ever. 23andMe has never suggested it could detect intelligence in people\u2019s genes. </p><p>However, companies such as GenePlaza allow users to upload their genetic data and claim to show how comparatively intelligent they are. Meanwhile, members of the alt-right in the US have shared their 23andMe results on social media and boasted about their white European ancestry.</p><p>Wojcicki does not seem interested in the food, taking small bites between my questions. Pulling my now cooling chicken teriyaki towards me, I enjoy the crunch of the lightly cooked bok choy.</p><p>23andMe is making its first major moves in a new sector: drug development. At the start of 2020, it licensed its first potential treatment, an antibody to treat inflammatory diseases, to a Spanish dermatology company; and as part of its $300m partnership with UK drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, signed in 2018, it expects to have selected its first drug target and launched a clinical trial by the end of the year.</p><p>Wojcicki points out that 23andMe has information that no one else does. Nine years ago, it ran a study in partnership with large Bay Area biotech company Genentech on people who have a genetic variation that makes them more likely to get Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 but who have not developed the degenerative disease. </p><p>\u201cPreviously it would\u2019ve been almost impossible to find these patients because you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know [they had the gene],\u201d she says.</p><p>That study came to nothing. But the information held by 23andMe can in theory guide scientists where to look for targets for drugs \u2014 and hopefully make the costly and laborious process more productive. </p><p>Genes have proved good guides for rare diseases, often caused by one mistake in the genome, but biology is so complex that, for many conditions, improving our genetic understanding may be simply the first step. Or it could just be a contributing factor, as with infectious diseases such as Covid-19, where scientists are exploring how genetic variants may influence how hard the virus hits. </p><p>23andMe launched a study this week, hoping to persuade hundreds of thousands of people to participate in online surveys about their coronavirus symptoms \u2014 or lack of them \u2014 so that it can discover if there are any patterns with their genes.</p><p>If the company ends up marketing 23andMe drugs, how will it price them? US politicians and patients have condemned pharmaceutical companies for high drug prices. Participants in 23andMe would surely feel aggrieved if the company uses their data \u2014 which customers have paid to have genotyped \u2014 to create unaffordable drugs.</p><p>Wojcicki agrees that \u201creasonable\u201d pricing is even more important for 23andMe than for other drugmakers. \u201cWe think a lot about what is the right way? What are those right promises? Because ultimately people want a cure, but they don\u2019t want to be surprised,\u201d she observes. </p><p>\u201cWhat makes me sad for the pharma industry is that it\u2019s filled with really good people, and in some ways there\u2019s been some really egregious behaviour by a smaller group of people that sets an awful tone for everyone.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">As Wojcicki finishes her meal</emphasis>, she becomes more animated. I ask if her experience of Wall Street makes her want to go public. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any glory in being public before your time. I absolutely agree that being public at the right time is a necessity and it forces you to have the right kind of transparency and financial controls in place,\u201d she says. \u201cAgain, almost everything in life revolves back to children to me, but, like, my company is also my child and it\u2019s not ready.\u201d</p><p>At this point, employees have cleared the canteen and some of their children have come out to play. Not distracted by the din, Wojcicki describes the salad as \u201cdelicious\u201d and the chicken as \u201cdelicious\u201d. She barely touched her soup.</p><p>Wojcicki studied biology at university and, imagining that she might become a doctor, regularly volunteered at hospitals. \u201cI was one of the few people who\u2019d walk in and take a deep breath, like, \u2018I just love it here,\u2019\u200a\u201d she says. But she also had the sense that the medical profession did not want to empower patients; historically, she points out, doctors worried about whether women should be allowed to use pregnancy tests at home.</p><p>\u201cThe medical community fundamentally doesn\u2019t trust you. And, like, that\u2019s fascinating that I can trust you with guns but I can\u2019t trust you to treat yourself,\u201d she says.</p><p>When a customer receives their 23andMe results, Wojcicki believes there is a moment when \u201cpeople are triggered and you have an opportunity to potentially jump in and try to change behaviour\u201d. </p><p>I\u2019m not sure most people have Wojcicki\u2019s willpower. It is tough to persuade many patients to take their pills, let alone exercise and eat well.</p><p>Our time is up, but Wojcicki has hit her stride. When 23andMe was barred by the FDA from returning health reports to consumers, it focused instead on helping people map their family trees. I wonder why we are so fascinated to learn our genetic origins. </p><p>Wojcicki believes it is about \u201ca sense of purpose and connection\u201d in a world where people move around so much.</p><p>I ask if 23andMe would launch a dating app. George Church, an eminent geneticist, is starting a service that aims to match people so they can avoid having children with serious genetic diseases. </p><p>\u201cI love George\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009\u201d Wojcicki hesitates for the first time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t invest in all his ideas. I mean, I think it would definitely be interesting to look at the genetics of attraction in relationships that have been sustained. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything there yet.\u201d </p><p>Many 23andMe customers have found secret siblings or even children through the site; others have learnt that their biological parents were not who they thought they were. Wojcicki has her own experience of this \u2014 she found a cousin, a son that her uncle did not know about \u2014 but she paints it as a welcome broadening of the family.</p><p>\u201cWe always wanted cousins and now we\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, shit, we have a cousin and he has kids,\u2019 and it\u2019s been great. He comes on vacation,\u201d she says.</p><p>Last year, Wojcicki\u2019s mother Esther published a book titled<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> How to Raise Successful People </emphasis>(as well as Anne and Susan, there is a third sister, Janet, a professor of paediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco). I ask if she believes her own and her siblings\u2019 success is more down to nature or nurture?</p><p>\u201cEverything in life is a combination of the two,\u201d she says. \u201cSo clearly my parents are smart and capable, but I think it\u2019s the broader community that we grew up in\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that was amazing,\u201d she says. Her father was a Stanford physics professor, so they lived on the serene university campus, and her mother still teaches journalism at the prestigious Palo Alto High School.</p><p>The more we discover about genetics, the more we realise what a complex dance is played between our heredity and environment. A couple of years ago, the 23andMe kits were a popular Christmas present. Now, like much else borne on a wave of Silicon Valley optimism, testing for fun looks a little naive.</p><p>Wojcicki wears her power lightly, but it is she, not a government or a scientific institution, who has at her fingertips a treasure trove of our genetic history.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hannah Kuchler is the FT\u2019s US pharma and biotech correspondent</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"> @FTLifeArts</url> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

Then there is Apple (Device). In Software, the picture is a bit more encouraging with Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce.com, IBM, and a whole host of other fast growing SaaS companies still maintaining a healthy competitive dynamic.</p><p>This week's issue of The Economist has a couple of great articles on how to manage these tech titans and their anticompetitive impact on the industry: How to tame the tech titans and The tech lash against Amazon, Facebook and Google - and what they can do - A memo to big tech.</p><p>NOT long ago, being the boss of a big Western tech firm was a dream job. As the billions rolled in, so did the plaudits: Google, Facebook, Amazon and others were making the world a better place. Today these companies are accused of being BAADD-big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy. Regulators fine them, politicians grill them and one-time backers warn of their power to cause harm.</p><p>Much of this techlash is misguided.</p><p>But big tech platforms, particularly Facebook, Google and Amazon, do indeed raise a worry about fair competition. That is partly because they often benefit from legal exemptions. Unlike publishers, Facebook and Google are rarely held responsible for what users do on them; and for years most American buyers on Amazon did not pay sales tax. Nor do the titans simply compete in a market. Increasingly, they are the market itself, providing the infrastructure (or \"platforms\") for much of the digital economy. Many of their services appear to be free, but users \"pay\" for them by giving away their data. Powerful though they already are, their huge stockmarket valuations suggest that investors are counting on them to double or even triple in size in the next decade.</p><p>There is thus a justified fear that the tech titans will use their power to protect and extend their dominance, to the detriment of consumers. The tricky task for policymakers is to restrain them without unduly stifling innovation.</p><p>As suggestions, one idea that floats around is breaking up the monopolistic companies into pieces: Facebook (spin out Instagram, WhatsApp), Google (spin out YouTube, Google Cloud, Android), Amazon (spin out AWS, Amazon Marketplace).</p><p>Other ideas like increasing content liability, preventing acquisitions that can lead to further concentration of power, utility-like regulation, charging for services and giving consumers the option NOT to sell their data to advertisers - are all on the table.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SRAMIT-0036611762</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SRAMIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGB-D3M1-DXMP-K3D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365077</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Sramanamitra.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sramanamitra.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 22, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00020FE</classCode><className>SAP SE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SAP (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SAP (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SAP (BIT)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>CRM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

If you're not familiar with the kind of neighborhood South Beach is these days, in 2016 the IRS <url normalizedValue=\"http://collected\">collected</url> 7,020 returns from ZIP code 94105, and 2,180 of them were from households earning an adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 a year.</p><p>Since March 13, these households have been <url normalizedValue=\"http://packing public meetings in opposition to the plan\">packing public meetings in opposition to the plan</url>. This week they       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://shouted down\">shouted down</url> the mayor. </p><p>Their complaints have been the usual NIMBY-ish stuff about how visible poors need to go somewhere else. </p><p>After years of housing crisis, there is a growing sense in California that this kind of rhetoric won't help us solve our problems. </p><p>That's probably why the residents decided they needed insurance in the form of litigation.</p><p>On March 20, Wallace Lee created a GoFundMe campaign called <url normalizedValue=\"http://Safe Embarcadero for All\">Safe Embarcadero for All</url> to collect lawyer's fees for a fight against the city. Lee lives near many senior technology executives, Stanford professors, human resources VPs and others who have been eager to throw money at the problem of being forced to see unhoused people on a daily basis. As of Friday afternoon, the fundraiser had collected $94,500. </p><p>\"My clients are certain this is not the right spot for this,\" Andrew Zacks, the residents' lawyer, told me. \"My clients feel like they should bear some of the city's problems, but to put 200 beds on this site and not have plans for other locations for other parts of town is wrong.\"</p><p>Lee's fundraiser also caught the eye of an Outer Richmond resident named William Fitzgerald. </p><p>A former Google public policy and communications staffer, Fitzgerald is fluent in both San Francisco's passive-aggressive doublespeak as well as the language of internet trolling. He was perfectly prepared for this incident. </p><p>\"A legal fund to stop people from getting shelter just seemed crazy,\" Fitzgerald told me. \"I thought it would be a way to show that San Francisco is not this terrible place where people are just spending money to prevent other people from getting their basic human rights.\"</p><p>Fitzgerald launched his own GoFundMe fundraiser, called <url normalizedValue=\"http://SAFER Embarcadero for All,\">SAFER Embarcadero for All,</url> on March 28.</p><p>When I asked him why the proceeds are going to the Coalition on Homelessness, Fitzgerald said it is because \"they'll continue to spend this money to fight for housing for everybody in San Francisco.\"</p><p>Already, we were at Defcon Three for San Francisco's current readiness condition: wealthy, progressively minded San Franciscans claiming they supported homeless efforts everywhere but their own neighborhoods; unreasonable demands for the democratic process; the use of technology to inflict unseen violence on one's neighbors and a fundraiser as meme generator.</p><p>Then Big Tech jumped in. </p><p>GoFundMe <url normalizedValue=\"http://decided to support Fitzgerald's campaign\">decided to support Fitzgerald's campaign</url> with a $5,000 donation. San Francisco's favorite billionaire son, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://weighed in with $10,000\">weighed in with $10,000</url>. </p><p>Benioff opened the floodgates, bringing Twilio co-founder Jeff Lawson and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey along with him. The national media <url normalizedValue=\"http://started pontificating\">started pontificating</url>, and we are now at Defcon Two - the point at which a heated local spat becomes A Battle for San Francisco's Soul .</p><p>A well-worn tale is comforting. But there are a few wrinkles in this one.</p><p>The first change is the fact that Big Tech is taking part in politics at all.</p><p>It's happening under duress, of course.

Tech leaders are wising up and realizing that the best way to seem responsible is to look charitable for the right causes.</p><p>That brings us to the second change: Building homeless shelters in wealthy neighborhoods now looks like the right cause. </p><p>The South Beach residents are absolutely correct about the fact that for too long, San Francisco has forced just a few neighborhoods to bear the burden of providing the city with not just homeless services but also new housing and office space and all the growing pains that come with them. </p><p>Fitzgerald's neighborhood, for example, has no Navigation Center. His supervisor, Sandra Fewer, has no plans to welcome one. </p><p>That's unfair, and it has to change.</p><p>But it's also true that well-heeled South Beach residents have never imagined they'd be responsible for accommodating others. </p><p>Now, it's not just the city's government but their own peers saying they must. </p><p>That's a huge difference, and it's one that the rest of the city's residents are clearly relishing. Fitzgerald's fundraiser is at $167,875 and counting. </p><p>\" My clients are certain this is not the right spot for this.  \"</p><p>Andrew Zacks, lawyer for South Beach residents fighting a Navigation Center in their neighborhood</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B611018270Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTP-FNB1-DYRG-W3F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 6, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump's landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.</p><p>  President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction. </p><p>  As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on -- what some writers called ''reparations by any other name.'' He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.</p><p>  The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.</p><p>  The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the ''Accountability Clubs'' that spread across the nation's campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a ''problematic'' tweet.</p><p>  The Accountability Clubs bore the motto ''Truth and Mercy.'' Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that ''moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity.'' Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.</p><p>  The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.</p><p>  The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix -- pro-L.G.B.T.Q., pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.</p><p>  At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events -- slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.</p><p>  The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.</p><p>  The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being -- healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America's social fabric a century earlier -- the Y.M.C.A., the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.</p><p>  By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an A.F.L.-C.I.O. of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.</p><p>  In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can't run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.</p><p>  Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The G.O.P. re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party -- socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party's biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs -- the repair of America's alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.</p><p>  Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s. And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the former bank employees \"said they falsified information because of pressure to meet expectations related to the program and time constraints from other banking responsibilities. They also said they believed that doing so wouldn't hurt customers.\" The bank had said that 400,000 such meetings were scheduled last year, but it's not clear how many were made up.

According to the paper, Synovus would now resell Cabela's retail credit card portfolio to Capital One and keep about $1 billion in deposits held by Cabela's bank.</p><p>Financial Times</p><p>Ticketed: Santander Consumer USA has agreed topay $26 millionin fines and consumer relief to settle charges by the attorneys general of Delaware and Massachusetts that it knowingly gave auto loans to subprime customers who could not afford them. According to the paper, \"Santander relied on information from car dealerships about borrowers' income that it should have known was inflated in certain cases, resulting in some borrowers taking on loans they could ill afford. Despite knowing that some dealerships had ahigh default ratefor past loans due to inaccurate or inflated borrower information, Santander continued to buy loans from them, and in some cases sold those on to third parties.\"</p><p>New York Times</p><p>Narrow victory: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of five small New York businesses that want to inform customers of asurchargefor using credit cards. The court ruled the First Amendment applies to a state law concerning those fees, which credit card companies want to keep invisible to consumers. \"What the law does regulate is how sellers may communicate their prices,\" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority. The decision was a very narrow one, however. According to the paper, \"the court decided only that the law regulated their speech rather than their conduct, and it left it to an appeals court to determine whether the law violated the First Amendment.\"</p><p>Elsewhere</p><p>Big tech deal?: In an article it bills as an \"exclusive,\" the U.K. Register is reporting that Oracle has hired consultants to explore the feasibility of itsbuying Accenture, the big consulting firm. It says Oracle wants to \"explore the synergies that could be created if they bought Accenture lock stock and barrel,\" one source said. \"While these things have a habit of fizzling out there are some fairly serious players around the table,\" a source added. The website said Oracle and Accenture \"have a long history of working together, and almost two years ago launched a business group with the aim of converting more customers from old world technology to web services.\"</p><p>Quotable ...</p><p>\"For a week or so, I had my bankers try to make real appointments.

Frank[1] Recently Activist Post published an article about how Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown[2] accused the government of not being aggressive enough on antitrust issues with tech companies. On January 2, 2018, CNN published an opinion piece[3] with the same accusations. </p><p>It was written by Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in the New York AG Antitrust Bureau who heads up big tech and monopolization for The Capitol Forum. She explained in great detail how Big Tech has been violating the Sherman Act of 1890.The Sherman Act was created to combat juggernauts that ruled entire industries like oil and railroads. It was made precisely for the highly concentrated power we see today in Big Tech. When passing the law, Senator John Sherman declared[4], 'If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade'Ms. Hubbard ends the piece with perhaps the most powerful and obvious statement of how this needs to be stopped:And Congress should also step in and fix bad court decisions so that the antitrust laws can work for all of us again.Damn straight.So Congress Members (including you, Sherrod), have you all forgotten[5] that you're supposed to be protecting us from Big Tech[6] instead of the other way around[7]? We're getting awfully tired of Big Tech running[8] and ruining[9] our country with harmful and unnecessary technology[10] with your assistance[11] as well as The Federal Communications Commission's[12] (FCC).

The agency's investigators go on wide-ranging fishing expeditions seeking evidence of discrimination at large companies, most of which hold federal contracts of one sort or another. </p><p>#8216;Instead of holding firms accountable when they engage in real discrimination against their employees, the agency has become a government arm for securing high-dollar settlements on dubious grounds.#8217; In its audits demanding large back pay sums, for example, the #8216;government fails to compare like employees to like, and it doesn't control for perfectly innocent variables that explain pay differences.#8217; As OFCCP has turned into a combination social engineer and extractor of big-ticket settlements, few big companies are willing to fight back, given the breadth of arbitrary power the agency holds over them as well as the distant threat of debarment or other sanctions. But recently two big tech firms have stepped forward as exceptions: Google, in a dispute we wrote about in 2017[1] on demands for employee documents, and now Oracle, which is suing rather than accept what it considers an unreasonable settlement demand.

Lots of meaty topics this time at the TaxCast.like whether Brexit will usher in a buccaneer tax/finance regime, is depression just around the corner, and the looting of Angola. By Naomi Fowler. Originally published at Tax Justice Network The Taxcast kicks off the new decade with: the French strikes #8212; tax justice and pensions vs financialisation the EU countries who've missed the deadline on publishing registers of real corporate owners the effect of Brexit on poorer (aka plundered) countries And the IMF's stark warnings about the finance curse and another Great DepressionFeaturing:If the situation collapses in Europe then I don't think the tax havens, secrecy havens and the US will be in any rush to try and repair the situation. </p><p>~ Simon Bowers[1] of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists[2] on the failure of some EU States to meet the 10th January 2020 deadline on publishing registers of the real owners of companies  We are in the longest struggle, social conflict in France. Imagine it's something that is longer than what happened in 1968. What we are afraid of is that it's a strategy to weaken our system. In France, the social security, all the money in the system of social security is more important than the state budget of France #8212; imagine what some people of the financial place would like to do with that money. ~ Pascal Debay[3] of the CGT Union Confdration Gnrale du Travail [4]on the French strikes  It's really a question that arises now in France how all those governments and presidents that we have are not chasing tax avoiders, the big multinationals. The big multinationals, people know them and when they find out that those multinationals pay virtually no taxes in France they think it's appalling. Whether its public schools, public health, public infrastructures, the justice system, and pensions, Macron could fund them with a proper tax justice policy. ~ Marie Antonelle Joubert of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice[5] on the French strikes I'm afraid with the massive victory they got on Brexit, they are emboldened to be the capital of international secrecy. And I'm afraid they will make things worse for the rest of the world without benefiting the UK economy.#8217;  ~ Dereje Alemayehu[6] of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice [7]on the City of London finance sector and British government policy post-Brexit There's ample evidence that inequality harms the economyinequality is now actually threatening to topple the whole thing and turn the whole thing over. ~ John Christensen[8] of the Tax Justice Network on the head of the IMF's warnings on another Great Depression [embedded content] Naomi: #8216;Hello and welcome to the Taxcast, from the Tax Justice Network. And welcome not only to a new year, but to a new decade. I'm Naomi Fowler. Coming up later, we took journalists on a walk around the City of London to warn them about Britain's acceleration towards a low tax, weak regulation rogue State when it leaves the European Union, which it's due to do at the end of this month on 31stJanuary 2020:#8217; Clip: #8216;I'm afraid with the massive victory they got on Brexit, they are emboldened to be the Capital of international secrecy. And I'm afraid they will make things worse for the rest of the world without benefiting the UK economy.#8217; Naomi: #8216;More on that later. But the European Union has some work to do if it's really serious about making sure member states comply with anti-money laundering rules on setting up public registers of the real owners of companies. Simon Bowers of the Int'l Consortium of Investigative Journalists discovered that some countries have missed this month's deadline to publish their registers, which they were supposed to do under the 5thanti-money laundering directive, tell us about that Simon:#8217; Simon: #8216;Yeah. So this deadline looked pretty exciting to us. This was supposed to be the end of corporate secrecy in Europe. There would be no more anonymous companies for tax evaders and terrorist financiers to hide behind, every company would have to declare shareholders up to a certain threshold. And then the deadline came and passed and really without a murmur not from Brussels, from the commission or from pretty much any member state. These were all sort of political leaders who were slapping each other on the back about the urgent measures they'd taken to introduce these registers of corporate ownership only a few years back and now they were nowhere to be seen. So we tried to look around. We found a few, obviously the UK has had some disclosures on beneficial ownership of companies for a number of years #8212; I mean, you might say it's not verified and is poor quality, but that there has been some transparency of sorts there for a while. Luxembourg came online with a registry fairly recently. There is a registry in Germany that's just gone up and in Ireland but you have to pay for the Irish one. Other than that, there's not really much out there. So in a way, perhaps the confusion about where these registers are in each member state, and why we can find some and we can't find others no one seems to be particularly forthcoming about why there's been a delay. And part of the problem is that these registers have been set up individually by member states according to their own interpretations of the European directive rather than in conformity to a European regulation. The difference between a regulation and a directive in the EU is that a regulation is something everyone has to do and it's the same. A directive is something that is open to a good deal of interpretation. That's why you've got Ireland demanding a fee every time you search the registry there, you've got Germany taking a different route, you've got the UK taking another route. They're all in theory complying with the EU directive, but in their own distinct way. And obviously when it comes to providing an opportunity for public scrutiny that's supposed to enhance the integrity of the system and help prevent misuse of companies, this isn't particularly helpful.#8217; Naomi: #8216;Not helpful indeed! What would you like to see happen that would convince you that the EU's serious about its member states tackling tax dodging and financial crime #8212; and avoiding more Panama Papers, Paradise Papers-type scandals?#8217; Simon: #8216;Well one of the things that would help, we're talking about the fifth anti money laundering directive right now, but a good signal, a good start from the EU would be for all member States to get up to speed and transpose into law the fourthanti money laundering directive, which they still haven't done yet, I think there's something like 22 of 28 member States who are still dragging their feet on that one, the deadline for that one was I think sometime in 2017. So, whilst the politicians in Brussels are already talking about the sixthanti money laundering directive we could do with some progress on existing directives if the whole process of the fight against money laundering is to retain some credibility in Europe. I mean, I don't want to sound too negative I mean Europe has been really setting the agenda on the topic of beneficial ownership and transparency on that topic and really there are others watching closely, particularly a lot of the tax havens, the crown dependencies and overseas territories linked to the UK, several of those have insisted that they'll watch closely what Europe does, and may feel however reluctantly that they will follow suit at some stage. And of course the US will be watching closely and there are noises about a movement on beneficial ownership from a policy perspective in the US which obviously would be amazing, but if the situation collapses in Europe then I don't think the tax havens, secrecy havens and the US will be in any rush to try and repair the situation.#8217; Naomi: #8216;Thanks Simon. Simon Bowers of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. And the consortium has another big story out this month #8212; Luanda Leaks #8212; the scandal of how the daughter of the former Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santosbecame a billionaire. She denies looting the country. But leaked documents show how her vast business empire came about, her father's presidential decrees from which she benefited, and the network of offshore companies she used, more than 400 shell companies and other structures. Angola is rich in oil, but that's been of little to no benefit to most Angolans #8212; that's typical for a country suffering from the resource curse. These leaks showing mega-wealth extraction by the former president's daughter reveal how it was facilitated by armies of accountancy and law firms in financial centres like Dubai and the US. Bear in mind that Angolans have a life expectancy of about 60 (compared to nearly 82 in Portugal), and 44% of Angolans don't have access even to drinking water. Average incomes are about $5,555 a year. There's been movement on the proposed digital tax which various countries were proposing to levy on big tech, the Googles and Amazons of the world. President Macron of France has retreated on implementing a 3% tax France was due to impose after threats of retaliation from the US #8212; since the world's big tax dodging tech companies are pretty much US monopolies. France's tax would have raised an estimated $563 million a year. The UK's Finance Minister sayshe willgo ahead with its planned tax, despite being weakened by needing to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. We'll see about that. The Czech governmentwas also planning to introduce a 7% digital tax. It remains to be seen whether they'll go ahead with that. All of this because the OECD and the EU have so far failed to address the issue. Will they step up now? Let's see. There are two climate crisis developments to tell you about this month, bad news and then some good news: the British government is bailing out Flybe airline (owned by among others the very wealthy tax dodging billionaire Richard Branson). They've granted them an enormous tax holiday worth up to 100 million. Meanwhile Germany is putting a similar amount of money, not into planes but into a big push for train travel to replace plane travel, they're overhauling and updating their railways. And, in Spain they've demonstrated what political will can do #8212; they thought it'd take a decade to do it but they've taken just one year to stop using coal in popwer plants to generate electricity. Spain also stopped coal mining in 2019 after they finished subsidising their national cola mines #8212; partly due to European Union regulations and partly because their national coal deposits weren't making any money any more.So, it canbe done. And quickly. Time to speak to John Christensen now of the Tax Justice Network for his take on this month:#8217; Naomi: #8216;OK John, at the Tax Justice Network you and Nick Shaxson were the first to some up with the phrase the #8216;finance curse' to explain the harms done by finance sectors that are too big relative to the economies they're operating in. How they lead to a lack of economic diversification, more inequality and a very unhealthy race to the bottom between nations on tax and regulations. The IMF, the World Bank and others have since recognised this phenomenon. And this month we've seen interesting developments from the IMF, of all places. They put out a new report calling for the shrinking of oversized finance centres. But let's look first at what the head of IMF said when she was introducing this report, Kristalina Georgieva. She warned about the staggering rise in inequality levels globally. But she did it in very stark terms, unusually stark I thought. She said that rising inequality is now #8216;reminiscent of the early part of the 20thcentury \u2014 when the twin forces of technology and integration led to the first Gilded Age, the Roaring Twenties, and, ultimately, financial disaster and the Great Depression. Wow!#8217; John:#8216;Yeah. Wow. And a great speech and the speech has a context of course, because IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva was speaking just ahead of the world economic forum at Davos. I think this speech is a clear warning shot aimed at the world leaders meeting at Davos about their complacency. Now every year world, leaders meet at Davos and they discuss the big issues #8212; inequality last year, climate crisis this year. But the whole thing is a charade and nothing of any real substance comes forward in the way of policy reform. So it's just chat, chat. Remember the highlight of last year's forum was the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman saying the answer to rising inequality and the trend towards plutocracy was taxes, taxes, taxes. You might remember that #8212; he wasn't invited back this year. So IMF chief Georgieva said this coming decade, far from being one of milk and honey. She's warns that there's great uncertainty building up and the point she was making is that technology change, the rise of the internet and so on, plus mounting debt, also debt, corporate debt, these things are fueling inequality which in turn is fueling populism and fueling political extremism. Now in many respects, this situation mirrors the roaring twenties she was referring to this was the roaring twenties of last century when governments allowed the banks and financial markets to run wild and that led to a major market crash in 1929 which in turn collapsed wages and employment in the real economy. Some economies like Germany collapsed entirely and that in turn led to the rise of fascism, not just in Europe but also in North America. And Georgieva was really careful I think in her speech to describe how inequality harms both the economy and democracy and she was also very careful in drawing attention to the role of the finance sector in causing these harms. So I'll quote what she said #8216;too often we overlook the financial system, which can also have a profound and long lasting, positive or negative effect on inequality.#8217; Now it's that negative effect which we identify as the finance curse, when too large a finance sector starts to drain wealth away from the real economy, and it's good to have the head of the IMF drawing attention to this. We've been drawing attention to it for many years, but it's good that this is now reaching the mainstream.#8217; Naomi: #8216;So, this new IMF report warns countries shouldn't allow their financial sectors to grow too big and that regulatory policies have a crucial role to play in reining in excessive growth of the financial sector.#8217; John: #8216;Well, that's exactly right. When politicians allow the financial services sector, especially banks to grow too large, I should also mention especially banks and shadow banks, when they allow them to grow due to large and to issue too much debt into the real economy, the effects become harmful. When the banking sector came close to collapsing in 2008, 2009 politicians should have learned that lesson #8212; without tight regulation and without taxation as well, banks do not act in a disciplined way and their actions can lead to terrible harm being caused to the real economy, largely because of all this debt sloshing around and investors using that debt to turn companies into cash cows. Now this new IMF report makes clear that financial services plays an important part in delivering credit to the real economy, and none of us can deny that that is the role of financial services. But they also look at how when the financial services become sector becomes too large and is not tightly managed, then it tips from being an important prop of the economy to becoming a drag on the economy and potentially causing massive harm. So, you know, on the positive side, they look, for example, at how uh, extending credit to as really small businesses, micro businesses in China and India has helped bring many people out of poverty as small businesses create jobs and increased earnings in those countries. But also the report also makes it very clear and they issue a stark warning that the financial sector when it's not well-managed, is likely to cause economic harm. And that will lead to rising inequality. And that of course is the root of what we call the finance curse.#8217; Naomi: #8216;Right and the IMF has also accepted now that inequality is bad for economies, that's also a belated but big leap for them?#8217; John: #8216;Yeah, yeah, it's definitely belated but it's true that for years, even decades, IMF officials, but also, let's be honest, many economists and politicians across many countries have seemed pretty unconcerned about inequality. Some economists even sneered at concerns about inequality and they dismissed it as the politics of envy. Well, we now know better about that. There's ample evidence that inequality harms the economy because too many people simply don't earn enough to pay even for the basics in life, their rents and heating and food and so on. So there's not enough demand in the real economy. And there's also ample evidence now that the claims that have been made for a very long time, that neo-liberalism, the idea of the American dream, people will move upwards and we'll have great social upwards mobility, that just hasn't happened. In fact, social mobility has stalled in North America and in many parts of Europe, and many millions of young people will be worse off over the course of their lifetimes than their parents were. And that's becoming increasingly clear and leading to mounting resentment, political resentments. So it's interesting, I'm getting back to the IMF, the chief Kristalina Georgieva speech that she singled out inequality in the UK as a reason for particular concern and that she noted that the top 10% now control almost as much wealth as the bottom 50% of people in the UK. And you know, if you look at the long term, if you look at the last 40 years since Thatcher came to power and introduced Thatcherism, that's possibly the biggest and most damning indictment of that Thatcherism. Reaganism and the whole neo-liberal agenda because inequality is now actually threatening to topple the whole thing and turn the whole thing over.#8217;Naomi: #8216;Thanks John! John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network. Now it's time for the Taxcast special feature. And we're going to split it in two this month. First of all we're going to take you to the City of London where we took journalists on a walking tour of the City of London's finance sector to warn about the effect of Brexit and the current British government on poorer countries #8212; or as we like to call them, plundered countries. After that we're going to take you off to France which has been experiencing its longest transport strike action in 50 years. But first let's go to the bitter cold of London and DerejeAlemayehu of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice addressing journalists outside the City of London Corporation, near the Bank of England at the start of a new decade. A decade in which we're likely to see some serious deterioration in Britain's already bad reputation as a centre for global corruption:#8217; Dereje: #8216;When you look at Africa, maybe you have some perceptions that I come from a poor continent. Your former prime minister David Cameron was never tired of saying the major problem in Africa is the corruption of its leaders. Actually I was once invited to attend a meeting he chaired, which was with African leaders and he was very happy telling about a corrupt African leader who has, how many ferraris, who has how many what and what, and I had a chance to ask a question and I said: #8216;When you were telling all these things, why didn't you also mention, firstly that this guy did not go out of Africa with an attache case stashed with money. He must have used facilitators, who are they? Secondly, those who are selling to him real estate and precious things, why didn't they ask #8216;guy, where did you get your money from?#8217; So corruption itself is possible because there are facilitators and there are enablers of the whole thing. So the second thing we have to know is although corruption is given as the major reason for Africa's problems, in the bigger scheme of things, if you look at serious studies, it does not constitute the biggest proportion of illicit financial flows going out of Africa. There was a study #8212; a commission set up by the African Union, they came to the conclusion that 60% of illicit financial flows from Africa are happening through economic practices. There are studies which show that for example, SABMiller, one of the biggest beer companies in the world paid less taxes in Ghana than a street vendor. So all these things are driving resources out of Africa. Although people believe Africa is living on the life support it gets from the North, Africa is a net creditor to the rest of the world. Actually even the secretary general of the OECD went on record as saying #8216;for every one US dollar going to developing countries in the form of development aid, $3 leave these countries in the form of illicit financial flows.' So, what is the sum of plus one and minus three? And Africa is now supposed to develop with minus two, by financing its development with minus three. So, without the facilitation of these illicit financial flows from Africa through secrecy jurisdictions giving shelter to stolen money, talk to a friend from the Philippines, Marcos left power I don't know how many years ago. Philippines did not get even a 10th of the the stolen assets now stashed in secrecy jurisdictions. Ask Egyptians, where did Mubarak's money #8212; it is estimated he embezzled about 9 billion #8212; where, where is this money now? Not in Egypt, Abacha, 5 billion. Where is this money now? Not in Nigeria. So, pointing fingers at corruption without stopping the possibility of stashing stolen assets with impunity in your jurisdictions is not helping the fight against corruption. Enabling your multinationals through falsified accountings, actually what's happening now, the multinational companies do their accounting through a structure which enables them to make losses in countries where they make profits and to show profits in countries where they don't need to pay taxes. So all these transactions are possible because they are supported by, or at least that governments are not making the necessary measures to stop these practices. So as long as this perverse flow of resources exist, that poor countries lose resources to rich countries, there cannot be development in these countries. The resources are much more needed to develop the economy, to improve their living standards. So, supporting facilitation, making it possible for tax dodging and corruption to stash these monies in secrecy jurisdictions is one of the major causes of poverty and inequality. So one of our efforts is really to challenge governments to to take the necessary measures to stop illicit financial flows and tax dodging.#8217; Naomi: #8216;Can I ask what you'd like to see happen? What would you like the British government to do to stop what you've just been describing?#8217; Dereje: #8216;I think Brexit itself is the first move of the British government not to even follow other governments in taking some of the measures which are necessary, through our campaigns there was some progress being made. Like, for example, a public registry of beneficial ownership, which was now on the move. Making it impossible for non-residents to have accounts in your banks, sharing this information with their governments, finance authority of these governments to hold their citizens to account who might have stolen the money. So, on all these fronts on finance, on reducing financial secrecy, uh, making beneficial ownership of assets public #8212; in all these moves, my fear is that that the UK will go back. And now I'm afraid that the British government might renege on such moves that now my fear is actually that they will embolden tax dodgers and those who steal public money to not to go to Singapore but to come here. And actually the whole drive is to compete with Singapore, not to compete with countries, which are trying to stop possibility of illicit financial flows. I'm very much worried that the move in the UK under this current government because of the victory of Brexit would be to say there is no recognition here, come! I'm afraid, with the massive victory they got on Brexit, they are emboldened to be the Capital of international secrecy. And I'm afraid they will make things worse for the rest of the world without benefiting the UK economy.#8217; Naomi: #8216;That's Dereje Alemayehu of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice in the City of London's finance sector. And, off to France. Just when the world thought the days of strikes and class struggle were over, they're not#8217; [clip of French strikers protesting] Naomi: #8216;In France President Macron has faced a huge fightback against his proposals to #8216;reform' the pension system by #8216;simplifying' it #8212; which among other things seems to mean raising the retirement age and a deterioration in pension rights. Central to all this seems to be the closeness of the French government to big players in finance #8212; I'm told bankers can just pick up the phone any time to talk to Macron. This new year he gave the Legion of Honour for services to France to the director of Blackrock, a financial company which specialises in managing private pension funds, which has been advising the government on how to promote private schemes. Blackrock stands to made billions from Macron's pension reforms. Remember that Macron scrapped wealth taxes in France and introduced lower corporate taxes before getting started on the pension system he claimed was too expensive to maintain. He's just announced btw that the 3% tax France was due to impose on big tech companies is going to be delayed after threats from the US #8212; that would have raised an estimated $563 million a year. This is Marie Antonelle Joubert of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice:#8217; Marie: #8216;It's quite clear to me that Macron's politics and policies since he's in place are the opposite of tax justice. The poor he wants them to pay more, and the richer he wants them to pay less. Taking away the wealth tax, not chasing tax avoiders is the first and biggest mistake he can make. It's really a question that arises now in France how all those governments and presidents that we have are not chasing tax avoiders, the big multinationals. The big multinationals, people know them and when they find out that those multinationals pay virtually no taxes in France they think it's appalling. It's really amazing that governments wouldn't so that because I think it would be very good for their popularity so I guess it's really an issue of elites and the presidents always protecting their people which are multinational leaders who they studied with most of the time so clearly whether its public schools, public health, public infrastructures, the justice system, and pensions, Macron could fund them with a proper tax justice policy. France loses between 60 to 80 bllion euros a year in tax avoidance, this is only conservative figures, we know that France could get a lot more if it went after its main tax avoiders, the richest people and mainly the multinationals, the big French conapnies. It's really appalling that he doesn't.#8217; Naomi: #8216;Marie Antonelle Joubert of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice. I also spoke to Pascal Debay of the CGT #8212; Union Confdration Gnrale du Travail:#8217; Naomi: #8216;You know, many people said that, uh, all the big strike action was over in France since the 1980s and 1990s. This strike has been the longest for more than 50 years in transport in France. And so what does that say about what's happening in France now?#8217; Pascal: #8216;You're right. We are in the longest struggle, the conflict, the longest conflict, social conflict in France. Imagine it's something that is longer than what happened in 1968, you know. The situations of work is different, there are less industry in France as in great Britain, um, more precarity, more poverty. The first time we have this type of conflict. You know, the railway railway men and women make a strike which is incredible. Now it's been 47, 47 days that they've been on strike. Mr Macron is very very pro-business. He wants to reform France. They want to break our social system of retirement, so we think #8212; the trade unions #8212; that this is a way to go for the private system of retirement. Mr Macron, when he arrived two years ago in power, um, he made new laws to lower corporate taxes, more and more for business and less and less for workers. It's been now the third time that he refused to put up the minimum wage. What we afraid of is that it's a strategy to weaken our system, our system of pension. In France, the social security, all the money in the system of social security is more important than the state budget of France #8212; imagine what some people of the financial place would like to do with that money.#8217; Naomi: #8216;Yes, I can imagine! It's, it's almost like what Mrs Thatcher succeeded in doing in the 1980s in terms of breaking the unions and restricting people's rights to campaign for better working conditions.#8217; Pascal: #8216;Yeah, to be to be frank with you, we often use this comparison, in a way Mr Macron is like Mrs Thatcher, he wants to weaken the trade unions in France.#8217; Naomi: #8216;And in France, I believe the retirement age is currently 62 and France has three times less pensioner poverty than in Britain, but in Britain, but retirement age is going up this year to 66 and it's going to go up to 67 and nothing happened here, there was no protest and we have weak unions as you know. But the government argued, as is Macron, that it's because people are living longer that they must make this change in pensions. What do you say to that?#8217; Pascal: #8216;Yeah, what you're asking me is, is important. We are in the liberal ideology, you know, they want to make people think that. We say to the bosses, where's the logic? When the people are 50 years old in France, you fire them. You say they are not enough competitive. When there are problems in, in factories you fire the oldest workers. On the other hand, you say to the people, you must work older. There's something which is very illogical, you know, so that's what we denounce. We want, we would like that Mr macron and his government make choice for the people. For example, if women are paid the same as men, that will be six billions, I say six billions of euros in the retirement system. In the system of work in France, the bosses pay that they pay taxes for our retirement system. And it's been now 30 years that we say, okay bosses, you don't pay because that there is unemployment so if you create jobs ok, you don't pay these taxes. So laws after laws, years after year, bosses paid less and less taxes for the retirement system. We say that stop. Since you don't respect the workers, you don't create work, there are more and more precarity, you will pay more taxes for that retirement system and we think that there we can find 20 billions of euros. Indeed, uh, we have a 3rd, another proposition is for example, to say, okay, the worker, we can pay, for example, 2 euros per month more in the system and the bosses too. That will be more and more money.#8217; Naomi: #8216;There has been used time and time again as an example of how the strike is not right that train drivers can retire at the age of 52 years. This has been used by the media a lot. And I have read that yes it is possiblethey can retire at 52, but if they retire at 52 years old, they don't have much pension, and so it is not really such a good option.#8217; Pascal: #8216;You know, we are in a world when the fake news are not always from who we think, the government is lying to the people. Heaven on the French railway, you know, the drivers are notretired at 52 as the government say, it's not true. And something is interesting. We asked a, you know, a poll two weeks ago. And 60%, 60% of the French people support the strike. 44% of the people in France trust the trade unions. We have many, many messages of solidarity from trade unions of Europe, America, Africa, Asia. It's very important we communicate with the people who are in the trade unions to say that we are not alone in this struggle, but it's a big fight. Something that's important is that the far right in France is very, very present. And they try to, to take from them the hungriness of the people. You know what I mean? So they say, for example, the CGT is not a good trade union because we are fighting the far right. And they say, if you are in power in two years, if Marine le Penn is president, she promised to the workers we will retire this new law, it's difficult for us, the political left in France is very split. So that's a big problem for the trade unions to deal with the far right. I don't know if we'll win but we, we will carry on!#8217; Naomi: #8216;Pascal Debay of the CGT union Confdration Gnrale du Travail. That's it for this month. Look out for the next edition of the Taxcast, edition 98 #8212; we're going to cover the Financial Secrecy Index 2020 results #8212; we'll have some surprises, we'll bring you regional analysis and we'll reveal which countries are now the world's worst offenders when it comes to financial secrecy.

Police arrested Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer on Wednesday. He`s accused of assaulting a woman and an eighteen-month-old child in July. This comes as Adrian Peterson and the Minnesota Vikings face more fallout from the decision to put him on the sidelines. Dean Reynolds is at the Vikings practice facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Dean, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEAN REYNOLDS (CBS News National Correspondent): Good morning. It was NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell who decided to put Adrian Peterson on the exempt list at the request of the Vikings, and Peterson did not object.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>DEAN REYNOLDS: The Minnesota Vikings now admit it was a mistake to let Adrian Peterson rejoin the team.</p><p>MARK WILF: It really is about getting it right.</p><p>RICK SPIELMAN: Our focus right now today is to get this right.</p><p>KEVIN WARREN: To make the best possible decision and to make-- and to get it right.</p><p>DEAN REYNOLDS: It`s the third time the Vikings have tried to get it right. Last Friday the team deactivated Peterson. Then on Monday the team reinstated him. The Radisson Hotel chain suspended its sponsorship deal with the team. Its logo was noticeably missing from the background at Wednesday`s press conference. The Vikings insisted the corporate backlash had nothing to do with its latest play.</p><p>MARK WILF: I don`t want to Monday morning quarterback what it was. The main thing is we constantly strive as an organization to do the right thing. And-- and it`s a fluid situation here and it`s an ongoing process.</p><p>MAN: Are you sorry this happened?</p><p>DEAN REYNOLDS: Also on Wednesday, Arizona Cardinals Jonathan Dwyer was arrested at the team`s practice facility in Tempe. He was charged with aggravated assault relating to two reports of alleged domestic violence back in July.</p><p>TRENT CRUMP (Phoenix Police Department): After she was physically assaulted he had took a shoe and threw it at their eighteen-month-old child.</p><p>DEAN REYNOLDS: The Cardinals` response was swift. \"Given the serious nature of the allegations, we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities,\" the team said. Meanwhile, Adrian Peterson who was indicted last week for whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch was dropped by Nike, Castor Motor Oil and Mylan, the makers of the EpiPen. His jerseys were yanked from Target, Dick`s Sporting Goods and Sports Authority. And the NFL`s exempt list added one more player Wednesday--Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who is currently appealing his conviction for assaulting and threatening his girlfriend. Hardy`s team sounded a familiar refrain.</p><p>DAVE GETTLEMAN: We have to get this right. He has to get this right.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>DEAN REYNOLDS: Now, Peterson and Hardy are expected to stay on the exempt list and off their teams` rosters for the duration of their legal proceedings but they will be getting paid. And in Peterson`s case that`s six hundred and ninety-one thousand dollars a week. Jeff.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Dean, thanks very much.</p><p>The Senate is expected to approve a plan today to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS militants. The House passed a bill Wednesday, two hundred and seventy-three to a hundred and fifty-six, the vote cut across party lines. Eighty-five Democrats and seventy-one Republicans voted no. President Obama called the vote an important step in confronting the ISIS threats. A CBS News/New York Times Poll shows most American support airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria but more than half oppose sending U.S. ground troops.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Secretary of State John Kerry returns to Capitol Hill this morning. He told the Senate committee Wednesday that more than fifty countries are in the U.S. coalition against ISIS. Kerry said more could join next week as world leaders come to the United Nations General Assembly. Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the U.N. is with us this morning. Good morning.</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Good to be here.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: When you first became ambassador, you want-- you pushed for airstrikes in Syria. Now, we have lawmakers on records supporting engagement in Syria. How do you see this playing out?</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: Well, the American people as the polls show and members of Congress as yesterday`s vote and today`s vote will how clearly support what the President is doing in dealing with the national security imperative. While there is no threat to the homeland as the President has said at the present, this-- we have seen with the beheadings of our young journalists and with the expansionist ambitions that ISIL has, their intention to move everywhere they can. And we`ve seen what will happen to any American that crosses their path. So the President`s intention is to use our unique capabilities to support those on the ground who are fighting ISIL in Iraq and the moderate opposition in Syria. Tomorrow Secretary Kerry will be here in New York. You will see many of those fifty countries speaking about what they`re prepared to contribute to the coalition, showing support for the new Iraqi government--which is trying to avoid the mistakes of the last Iraqi government and be more inclusive. Some more people want to fight this threat.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: You know, you couldn`t get it-- that same coalition of that same actions to take down the Assad regime, which killed hundreds of thousands of its own people, and yet you can now get it to defeat ISIS or trying to defeat ISIS. Why is that?</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: Well, without getting into the past--</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Yeah.</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: --again that was about Syrian chemical weapons, which the President also deemed a great threat, and you`ll know it again because of the credible threat to military force a year ago. Syria`s declared chemical weapons program has been destroyed and-- and removed. So I think right now what you`re seeing is ISIL is obviously a movement that will not stop unless the international community mobilizes together to stop it.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: The journal is reporting this morning that President Obama wants to personally approve any airstrikes inside Syria. What is the thinking behind that?</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: Well, I`m not going to into internal deliberations beyond saying that the President this-- this is our national security at stake, this is very complicated operation. If the moderate opposition do get the support that we are seeking from Congress, we will have on the ground more professionalized troops who have been fighting ISIL for nearly a year. And- - and that`s the important ground element to the effort.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: I know there`s going to be an emergency session at the U.N. today to deal with Ebola. What is not being done that you think has to be?</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: So much. Let me note that this is the first emergency meeting of the Security Council on a public health issue ever.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Ever?</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: So this should be a wakeup call for the international community. President Obama came out, as you know, earlier this week traveling to the CDC, announcing the deployment of three thousand U.S. troops to set up a command center so as to get medical personnel beds, medicine, everything you need in order to deal with this epidemic. It is the worst Ebola epidemic we`ve seen in history. And the good news though is that we know how to stop it. But the resources the international community has put toward this to this point are woefully insignificant.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Very quickly, do you see any turning point or these are just getting worse?</p><p>SAMANTHA POWER: We have to bend the curve. We don`t have an option of not bending the curve, and we will.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Samantha Power, thank you very much.</p><p>Passions are running high in Scotland this morning. This is the day voters decide whether to break free of Great Britain or stay united. Britain`s government is offering more political power if Scotland stays. Supporters of impendence say the Scots are ready to go it alone. Results are expected tomorrow morning. In our next hour, we`ll take you to Edinburgh. Mark Phillips is there covering today`s historic vote.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: And on Wall Street, all eyes are looking to China this morning. The e-commerce giant Alibaba is expected to set an IPO price between sixty-six and sixty-eight dollars a share. Alibaba stock begins trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange. It could be the richest IPO ever, raising more than twenty-four billion dollars. CBS News contributor and analyst Mellody Hobson is here. Mellody, good morning.</p><p>MELLODY HOBSON: Good morning.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: I don`t know anything other about Alibaba, other than I read about it in the paper all the time and their leader Jack Ma. This is the world`s biggest online e-commerce site. Better than Amazon?</p><p>MELLODY HOBSON: So it`s Amazon and eBay combined when you look at their two hundred and fifty billion dollars in annual transactions. And to give you a sense of that, eighty percent-- eighty percent of all online transactions go through one of their platforms in China every single year.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Wow.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: For the average investor when you-- when you look at this today, is-- is it something Alibaba-- does it interest you?</p><p>MELLODY HOBSON: I would be very nervous. Expectations are so high on this stock that if it just trips a little bit, it has a far-- it will fall far. But what I would say also is you want to be very cognizant of their government structure which is a little unusual and also be cognizant of the fact that the ACC in the past just have friction with Chinese companies because of the differences in our regulations.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Let`s talk about that structure. The number of insiders who can sell on the first day is pretty extraordinary.</p><p>MELLODY HOBSON: Yeah. They can-- they will be able to tell sixty percent of the IPO proceeds. And that`s a lot. That`s more than the Facebook people were able to sell. It`s huge.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: What are the implications for American tech companies?</p><p>MELLODY HOBSON: Okay. This is important. Two companies I`d be watching: Yahoo and Amazon; Yahoo, because they`ve been a de facto tracking stock for Alibaba, because they own sixteen percent of the company. They`re going to unload a big portion of that. Some say their core business will have negative value.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Wow.</p><p>MELLODY HOBSON: And one big tech insider told me they may go private one day. And then Amazon, if Alibaba comes into this country, that will be a blood bath.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Fascinating.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Wow.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Mellody, thank you so much.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Thanks, Mellody.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: That`s why we say the news is back in the morning--</p><p>JEFF GLOR: There you go.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: We just gave it to you.</p><p>It`s seven nineteen, and ahead on CBS THIS MORNING, the new terror threat, the U.S. considers worst than ISIS. We`ll ask CIA insider Mike Morell about an al Qaeda cell making better bombs to blow up air planes.</p><p>But first, time to check your local weather.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER BREAK)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Social media drives the man hunt for a group of people accused in a senseless beating.</p><p>JEFF GLOR: Ahead, here the online sleuths may help crack this case.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: The news is back in the morning here on CBS THIS MORNING. Stay tuned for your local news.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBSNEW-2014091804cb410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBSNEW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D60-8GG1-JB20-G25N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 CBS Worldwide Inc.

The critics claim they are helping the little guy and that they want more competition. But, new weapons they critics seek would give federal regulators unprecedented power and undermine our democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A core tenet of antitrust law and enforcement is to protect \u201cconsumer welfare.\u201d This more-than-capable standard enabled the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to take actions against Bayer-Monsanto and Staples-Office Depot for merger concerns, American Airlines for predatory pricing, and Oklahoma Chiropractors for price fixing.</p><p> But those with an anti-tech ax to grind want to create a wholly new standard of antitrust enforcement: \u201cdangers to liberty.\u201d</p><p> This standard might be emotionally appealing, since we all want to protect \u201cliberty.\u201d And we can imagine that the FTC and the DOJ, armed with this standard, could act aggressively against any big business. Because the \u201cdangers to liberty\u201d standard is so amorphous, government regulators and prosecutors would be unencumbered by fact-finding and detailed economic analysis.</p><p> But we want fair and honest antitrust enforcement. The \u201cdangers to liberty\u201d standard would sail us into uncharted waters and be vulnerable to politics and populism.</p><p> Suppose now we had a politically-motivated FTC and DOJ no longer restrained by the \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard. Corporate political speech, protected by the First Amendment and permitted by the \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard, could be attacked if the FTC regarded it against the administration\u2019s current concept of liberty.</p><p> Likewise, many Democrats see most actions by Republicans as \u201cdangers to liberty,\u201d and vice-versa. How would a politically motivated DOJ or FTC deal with \u201cthreats to liberty\u201d based on political actions or speech?</p><p> Ironically, the Open Markets Institute, a leading advocate for the \u201cdangers to liberty,\u201d worried about this injection of politics into antitrust enforcement. In the institute\u2019s blog, the Koch brothers were the ones doing the injecting, but any partisan group could wield the same weapon.</p><p> The nation\u2019s top antitrust enforcer, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, also warned of this political \u201cdangers to liberty\u201d standard: \u201cThe message for enforcers is that in the zealous pursuit of justice through prosecution, we risk prosecuting unjustly.\u201d</p><p> Advocates of abandoning the \u201cconsumer harm\u201d standard complain that proving consumer harm is impossible when the product or service is free, such as social media platforms. But these same advocates argue that big tech\u2019s use of data can and does harm consumers _ a problem that could be addressed by the \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard.</p><p> Moreover, Delrahim explained how the \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard applies to and is actionable against no-cost businesses.</p><p> Regardless of the mechanism used against big businesses, we must also recognize the harm to small businesses from antitrust actions against large online platforms. Anti-tech advocates claim that \u201cbig is bad,\u201d but for America\u2019s small and midsize businesses, the bigger the platform the better for small businesses trying to reach a big audience.</p><p> Consider the local greeting-card and stationery store. A decade ago this business could barely afford to place an ad in a local newspaper, let alone on TV or radio. But for less than $10 spent with online platforms, this small business can reach thousands of potential customers, and target them more accurately than ever too.</p><p> Risking small businesses and giving government agencies new political powers are risks not justified by benefits promised by critics who want to break up big tech. Let\u2019s retain our consumer welfare standard until anti-tech advocates can show the genuine benefits in their approach.</p><p> Critics of big tech should put down their pitchforks before all of us get hurt.</p><p>     Carl Szabo is vice president and general counsel at NetChoice, an association of e-commerce businesses and online consumers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-3587756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28986A3A0D68DC NWBKFL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSJ-WTB1-DXVP-V47S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Commercial (Leesburg, FL)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Today, more than 4 million moms blog. And as any child knows, we can learn a lot \u2014 sometimes about the unexpected \u2014 from our mothers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what might moms teach us about regulating their online activities? Internet regulation can affect mommy bloggers as much as it does big tech companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p> Think about the sometimes-poisonous reader comments found beneath blogs and other online articles. Comments are a useful way to interact with readers and create a sense of community in the digital age. That\u2019s part of what makes many blogs successful and the reason some bloggers start or continue writing.</p><p> Still, comments can get quite nasty, which is why they are the target of plenty of jokes and more-serious criticism. It\u2019s easy to understand why a mommy blogger might want to remove certain comments, particularly if related to information or photos about someone\u2019s children.</p><p> Existing tech laws protect this right. 1996\u2019s landmark \u201cSection 230\u201d provision made clear that the provider of an internet service \u2014 whether big tech or a blogger offering a comment section \u2014 is not liable for the actions of its users when it is serving as a curator rather than a creator. It also allows bloggers to remove or otherwise moderate third party comments without fear of legal action.</p><p> This is critical for small-content generators and helps illustrate why Section 230 helped make the internet a free space for all kinds of people. How many moms would be able to do some casual blogging if a tense battle over content moderation could land them in expensive, time-consuming legal trouble?</p><p> Mommy bloggers don\u2019t just teach us the importance of maintaining internet freedom laws. They also help illustrate the building tension that can emerge between speech and privacy.</p><p> One woman stirred controversy earlier this year when, writing in the Washington Post, she described her daughter\u2019s request to stop blogging about motherhood. In publicly refusing, the author noted, \u201cmy stories will be inextricably linked to her experiences.\u201d With the children of \u201csharenting\u201d now coming online themselves, some parents\u2019 speech and their children\u2019s rights to privacy will increasingly come into conflict.</p><p> For better or worse, stories or pictures rarely exist in isolation anymore. Requests for extreme privacy measures like a \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d as already found in Europe, can quickly make a thorny question thornier. Should legal, legitimate speech be regulated because it\u2019s online? Should the child of a mommy blogger be able to grow up, invoke a right to be forgotten, and have her mother\u2019s old blog delisted? Does free speech cover the longstanding tradition of sharing embarrassing stories about a child, or should that change in the digital age, where it\u2019s no longer contained to a photo album or yearbook?</p><p> These are questions without easy answers. Ideally, families will work them out on their own. But in our haste to call for stringent new privacy rights, we should consider not just how compliance might affect large tech companies but also how it might impact more personal conversations. If we don\u2019t, courts and lawmakers could settle too many dinner-table disputes.</p><p> As we argue over whether to regulate internet content, let\u2019s not forget that fundamentally, this debate is about some of the ways in which we share information with one another each day. Maybe some of those mommy bloggers can teach us how to work out our differences of opinion.</p><p>     Jennifer Huddleston is a research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-5034218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28986A3A0D68DC NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1P-37H1-DXVP-V15T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Commercial (Leesburg, FL)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Some might have yet to embrace the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the tsunami of revelations about Russian infiltration of Facebook\u2019s platform in the 2016 presidential election and the misuse of user data by Cambridge Analytica, these members of Congress finally have woken up to the urgency to protect the personal information collected by giant social media platforms.</p><p> Regulation is needed. Everyone knows it. The uncertainty and challenge are the form and extent of new privacy rules. But they must come, because Facebook has proved time and again that the government cannot leave that task to it and others like Instagram and Twitter.</p><p> In 2011, Facebook entered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission regarding charges that it deceived users by telling them their data could remain private while allowing it to be made public and shared. Not much has changed. On the eve of Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony, advocacy and privacy groups accused YouTube, whose corporate parent is Google, of illegally collecting data on millions of child users.</p><p> The tipping point for this week\u2019s grilling of Zuckerberg \u2014 the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes its turn Wednesday \u2014 was recent news that Cambridge, the British firm that received nearly $6 million from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, improperly gained access to the data of 87 million Facebook users to develop psychological profiles for targeting voters.</p><p> Regulations should reflect basic principles. Users should have to agree to allow their data, which range from biographical information to personal interests and contacts, to be collected and shared. Users should not be forced to opt out of collection. The process of granting permission should be easy to understand. There should be limits on how data are shared with companies and how they use the information. A bipartisan Senate bill to require disclosures about who paid for online campaign ads is a starting point for a different, but similarly troublesome front. Europe is ahead of us, with privacy rules set to take effect in May. Congress must decide whether it also likes the European stick \u2014 fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies that misuse users\u2019 data.</p><p>America is at a turning point. Skepticism of big tech is growing. People are realizing that if they are not paying for something, they themselves are the product being sold. The #DeleteFacebook movement includes lots of regular folks among the platform\u2019s 2.2 billion users, and tech giants like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla/SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Privacy-oriented sites are seeing slow but steady increases in users.</p><p> Zuckerberg said he accepts responsibility for all the mistakes and spent lots of time Tuesday apologizing. We\u2019ve seen the apology tour before. And more might be necessary. Given Facebook\u2019s recent announcement that the data of vastly more people had been breached by Cambridge than originally thought, it seems unlikely that the company knows the full extent of possible data misuse by other parties.</p><p> The law, it is said, is always behind the technology. It\u2019s time for our government to catch up.</p><p>     From Tribune News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-3188907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28986A3A0D68DC NWBKFL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3K-9VP1-JBCN-40YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Commercial (Leesburg, FL)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

(Disclosure: I own only Amazon stock, and The Washington Post is owned by Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. My views on this issue long predate either purchase.)</p><p> Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn\u2019t any indication that any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues set or, crucially, even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p> No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum\u2019s rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p> I\u2019ve argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years: to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation after the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don\u2019t need to be convinced that there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.\u201d</p><p> But count me very skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the massive problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were previously not widely aired, much less debated. There\u2019s little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings \u2014 perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and exposing us to.</p><p> What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really: It\u2019s the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country\u2019s best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p> Barr knows that the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at the Treasury Department, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p> Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p><p>     Hugh Hewitt, a Post contributing columnist, hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of \u201cThe Fourth Way: The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKFL-5206385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28986A3A0D68DC NWBKFL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9C-2SB1-DXVP-V1P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Commercial (Leesburg, FL)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Company officials declined Thursday to say how much VSP Global - based in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento - will pay for the San Antonio-based chain or disclose other terms of the deal, which must obtain approval from regulators. The Visionworks acquisition constitutes VSP's largest investment in its retail network in its 65-year history and would more than double its workforce, officials said. Visionworks is the sixth-largest optical retailer in the country with more than 700 locations and 8,900 workers. </p><p>The Visionworks purchase will give VSP's 61,000 clients and 80 million-plus members in the U.S. a \"more substantial, consistent and sustainable retail experience,\" VSP CEO Michael Guyette said in a statement. Nearly 400 employees work at Visionworks' headquarters at 175 E. Houston St. VSP doesn't plan to lay off Visionworks employees or move its corporate headquarters elsewhere, company spokeswoman Jace Duval said. Visionworks is the latest San Antonio company lost to an outside merger or acquisition within the past three years - as the United States sees growing political push-back to corporate consolidation. The number of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. has steadily climbed since the Great Recession, according to data from the Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances. More than $2 trillion worth of mergers and acquisitions took place in 2018. So far this year, the U.S. has seen almost $830 million in \"M&amp;A\" transactions. Concern over the effects of growing corporate consolidation - especially among big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google - has spilled into the 2020 presidential race. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey each said they plan to beef up the country's antitrust enforcement if elected president during the first Democratic primary debate Wednesday in Miami. In San Antonio, six major companies have been bought by a private equity firm or acquired by another company since 2016. Earlier this month, Whataburger's founding family agreed to sell its majority stake in the San Antonio-based burger chain to Chicago investment firm BDT Capital Partners for an undisclosed price. Last year, Ohio-based refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp. bought Andeavor, formerly Tesoro, in 2018 for $23.3 billion with plans to operate its headquarters in Ohio. Marathon put Andeavor's $135 million headquarters on the North Side on the market in April. C.H. Guenther &amp; Son Inc. sold to Chicago private equity firm Pritzker Group in April 2018 in a deal reportedly valued at $1.4 billion. Rackspace Hosting sold to New York private equity firm Apollo Global Management for about $4.3 billion in late 2016. Convenience chain operator CST Brands Corp. also sold that year to the Canadian owner of Circle K, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., for $4.4 billion. Virginia-based Pentagon Federal Credit Union bought the former site of CST's headquarters - now Circle K's Texas division and regional distribution center - at 19500 Bulverde Road in March. Circle K has said the company will remain at the property but PenFed CEO James Schenck said in March he expects his firm to be the property's only tenant in the coming years. While it's unclear what local impact the Visionworks acquisition will have, Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff said, \"It's just very unhealthy when you narrow down competition.\" \"I don't think it's good for the country, and I don't think we're the only community that's facing this,\" Wolff said. \"In fact, I know we're not.\" <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jfechter@express-news.net\">jfechter@express-news.net</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SANTEX-MERLIN68445752</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANTEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WG1-JT01-DYRV-44YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">168424</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The Visionworks purchase will give VSP's 61,000 clients and 80-million-plus members in the U.S. a \"more substantial, consistent and sustainable retail experience,\" VSP CEO Michael Guyette said in a statement.</p><p> Nearly 400 employees work at Visionworks' headquarters at 175 E. Houston St. in downtown San Antonio. VSP doesn't plan to lay off Visionworks employees or move its corporate headquarters elsewhere, company spokeswoman Jace Duval said.</p><p> On ExpressNews.com: Whataburger sells majority ownership stake to Chicago investment firm, the end of an era for the Texas staple</p><p>Visionworks is the latest San Antonio company lost to an outside merger or acquisition within the past three years \u2014 as the United States sees growing political push-back to corporate consolidation.</p><p> The number of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. has steadily climbed since the Great Recession, according to data from the Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances. More than $2 trillion worth of mergers and acquisitions took place in 2018. So far this year, the U.S. has seen almost $830 million of \"M&amp;A\" transactions.</p><p> Concern over the effects of growing corporate consolidation \u2014 especially among big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google \u2014 has spilled into the 2020 presidential race.

A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.</p><p>Without question, social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.</p><p>Facebook, a company founded in a dorm room 14 years ago, has recently been hiring linguists, programmers and artificial intelligence experts all around the world to keep its platform from becoming a medium of violence and spreader of lies.</p><p>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma.

Avoiding a bloodbath should be a priority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Bloomberg News reported Monday, the House Judiciary Committee is gearing up to investigate unfair business practices by platform companies, while the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have divvied up Silicon Valley's big four - Amazon.com and Facebook, Apple and Google - as they probe potential antitrust violations.</p><p> The tech business has certainly had its share of mishaps and misdeeds over the years, and the concentration of power in certain digital markets is indeed a cause for concern. But the breadth of these looming probes is nonetheless worrying. As the government bears down, three things are worth keeping in mind.</p><p> One is that each of these businesses should be evaluated on its own terms, not as part of a generalized crackdown. It's true that all four companies are big, profitable and connected to the internet. Beyond that, though, their similarities aren't obvious. Google and Facebook are ad-sales companies. Amazon is a retailer. Apple makes nice phones. These are very different industries, with different competitive dynamics. They may each require distinctive reforms, or no reforms at all. A gigantic new rulebook on the telecoms model isn't the thing.</p><p> Second, the goal should be identifying specific instances of wrongdoing and devising prudent remedies. Take data. All four companies have loads of it, and in some cases may use it to gain unfair advantages. Facebook has created tools to monitor what other products its users are interested in, for example, and has acted on that information to buy out budding rivals or mimic their ideas. Likewise, Amazon's bird's-eye view into what people are buying on its marketplace may confer an undue advantage on its competing private-label goods. In both cases, regulators should intervene to stop objectionable behavior - not to put anyone out of business.</p><p> Finally, it's important to remember that, for all their faults, these companies shouldn't be vilified. After all, they're pillars of the American economy. They collectively employ almost 900,000 people. They've made it easier than ever to start a business. They've invented entirely new categories of products and services - and often charge users nothing for them. No one could argue that consumers have been harmed by Google's free apps or Amazon's aggressive cost-cutting. Quite the opposite: They now have a bounty at their fingertips that previous generations could never have dreamed of.</p><p> It's true that tech companies have generally done themselves no favors in the court of public opinion. They've often been heedless about the harms their products can cause, opaque about their data practices and dismissive of their overseers. When it comes to paying taxes, Congress has no doubt noticed that they employ savvy accountants.</p><p> On balance, though, the good vastly outweighs the bad. Most other countries would kill for an industry as productive, profitable and endlessly inventive as the American tech business. Markets can always be improved. But as Congress tries to write a new rulebook, and regulators begin to roll up their sleeves, one question above all needs to be asked: What problems are they trying to solve?</p><p>Bloomberg Opinion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-4500898</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E11409139CCD3 NWBKNY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W96-CM11-JBCN-44NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Times Herald-Record<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This concept, which has been floating around for a while, is usually applied to companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google - businesses that are selling you, the users, to advertisers as clickbait.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In many countries, consumers bank for free. Yet, like tech, there is no such thing as free banking either. Not really. In cases where a bank waives fees, someone is paying for the service. Right now, it's the poor who largely pay for banking services - the people who fall into an overdraft or need a quick loan to cover their everyday expenses. In fact, the poorer you are, the more you pay. Take a look at payday loan companies or money transmitters. If you are trying to send $100 from the U.S. to the Philippines, your family will not receive much of that $100 by the time all the fees and currency transfers are applied.</p><p>This \"free\" banking model, which is seriously flawed, is about to change - and not for the reasons some expect.</p><p>Many U.K. bankers will tell you that the free banking model is a broken idea. However, many of these bankers are under the impression that the only way the model will change will be if regulators tell the banks to change. After all, no bank wants to break ranks and say, \"Hey, here is a bank account you have to pay for!\" This pitch, after all, would not be a very attractive offer when competitors' offerings are free. So banks assume they will all, as an industry, have to switch to chargeable bank accounts when their regulator says so.</p><p>But I disagree. Fintech companies are already breaking the free banking model on their own.</p><p>Recently,I bloggedabout how the big tech giants will target the low-hanging fruit of finance, namely payments and credit - an area where many fintech startups, such as TransferWise and Zopa, have also been making a mark. As more and more technology firms eat into narrow areas of banking, the banks will be left holding the expensive aspects of deposit accounts; however, the model will no longer be viable.</p><p>As a result, fintech companies will force retail banks to end free banking and rethink their whole business model. After all, if the margins and profitability - which have historically been based upon subsidization and cross-sales for increased share of wallet - disappear, the bank will have to do something drastic. If startups take the low-hanging fruit of payments transactions and credit interest for loans, where will banks make their future money? They will not make money just by running a deposit account or a savings account. In fact, fintech firms will force most banks not only to move away from free banking, but to work out what the customer wants and is willing to pay for. This pressure will make banks reimagine their retail banking business models, and ultimately, become information providers about wealth and money, and intermediators of application programming interfaces from thousands of fintech firms that provide transactional capabilities. In other words, it's the end of free banking and the start of paid banking for services that are based on customers' financial data and add value to their lives and the bank's bottom line.</p><p>Ultimately, the end of free banking will be a good thing as it might make banking more equitable. If all of us know how much a payment, money transfer or 36-month loan costs, and we can compare apples with apples - which is not available today - then the financial system will have far more transparency. It's called the democratization of finance and it's happening whether we like it or not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000015f-2688-d770-a5df-b7c96c3d0000-202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PS0-T2J1-JCRW-50XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

This concept, which has been floating around for a while, is usually applied to companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google - businesses that are selling you, the users, to advertisers as clickbait.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In many countries, consumers bank for free. Yet, like tech, there is no such thing as free banking either. Not really. In cases where a bank waives fees, someone is paying for the service. Right now, it's the poor who largely pay for banking services - the people who fall into an overdraft or need a quick loan to cover their everyday expenses. In fact, the poorer you are, the more you pay. Take a look at payday loan companies or money transmitters. If you are trying to send $100 from the U.S. to the Philippines, your family will not receive much of that $100 by the time all the fees and currency transfers are applied.</p><p>This \"free\" banking model, which is seriously flawed, is about to change - and not for the reasons some expect.</p><p>Many U.K. bankers will tell you that the free banking model is a broken idea. However, many of these bankers are under the impression that the only way the model will change will be if regulators tell the banks to change. After all, no bank wants to break ranks and say, \"Hey, here is a bank account you have to pay for!\" This pitch, after all, would not be a very attractive offer when competitors' offerings are free. So banks assume they will all, as an industry, have to switch to chargeable bank accounts when their regulator says so.</p><p>But I disagree. Fintech companies are already breaking the free banking model on their own.</p><p>Recently,I bloggedabout how the big tech giants will target the low-hanging fruit of finance, namely payments and credit - an area where many fintech startups, such as TransferWise and Zopa, have also been making a mark. As more and more technology firms eat into narrow areas of banking, the banks will be left holding the expensive aspects of deposit accounts; however, the model will no longer be viable.</p><p>As a result, fintech companies will force retail banks to end free banking and rethink their whole business model. After all, if the margins and profitability - which have historically been based upon subsidization and cross-sales for increased share of wallet - disappear, the bank will have to do something drastic. If startups take the low-hanging fruit of payments transactions and credit interest for loans, where will banks make their future money? They will not make money just by running a deposit account or a savings account. In fact, fintech firms will force most banks not only to move away from free banking, but to work out what the customer wants and is willing to pay for. This pressure will make banks reimagine their retail banking business models, and ultimately, become information providers about wealth and money, and intermediators of application programming interfaces from thousands of fintech firms that provide transactional capabilities. In other words, it's the end of free banking and the start of paid banking for services that are based on customers' financial data and add value to their lives and the bank's bottom line.</p><p>Ultimately, the end of free banking will be a good thing as it might make banking more equitable. If all of us know how much a payment, money transfer or 36-month loan costs, and we can compare apples with apples - which is not available today - then the financial system will have far more transparency. It's called the democratization of finance and it's happening whether we like it or not.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000015f-2688-d770-a5df-b7c96c3d0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PRV-SXN1-JCRW-505K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Next, it will move to the Democratic-controlled House, where it is expected to pass.</p><p>In its statement threatening a veto, the White House argued the premise of the resolution is flawed and that it would undermine the fight against extremism. U.S. support for the Saudis does not constitute engaging in \"hostilities,\" the statement said, and the Yemen resolution \"seeks to override the president's determination as commander in chief.\"</p><p>7 killed at Brazil school</p><p>SUZANO, Brazil - Two masked men armed with guns, knives, axes and crossbows descended on a school in southern Brazil on Wednesday, killing five students and two adults before taking their own lives, authorities said.</p><p>The men, identified as former students at the school in a suburb of Sao Paulo, also shot and killed the owner of a used car business nearby before launching the attack on the school, authorities said.</p><p>Besides the five students, the dead included a teacher and a school administrator, said Joao Camilo Pires de Campos, the state's public secretary.

When it comes to voicing a contrary opinion on the most sensitive political and cultural topics, however, many of our tongues are tied and our fingers shy away from the keyboard. Better not to say anything, we reason, than to deal with the blowback.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The answer to this speech-chilling political correctness is not a new law, but personal courage, free speech attorney-turned-writer David French of the National Review Institute argued this past week in a speech in Atlanta.</p><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a position that is different from the classic defense of free speech in this country,\u201d French said.</p><p> Rather than admitting none of us knows everything, and thus some humility is in order, too many Americans won\u2019t accept they may need to change their minds from time to time. Or that they would benefit from explaining their own opinion, and not shouting down their opponents.</p><p> Much of the problem stems from what\u2019s been called \u201cthe big sort\u201d \u2013 the physical movement of people toward places where their neighbors will be more like-minded.</p><p> \u201cAmericans are less likely to live near and work with people who disagree with them than at any time since we\u2019ve been measuring that,\u201d French said.</p><p> But because people tend to become more extreme in their views when they only talk with those who agree with them, we\u2019ve lost not only our willingness to engage with others but the belief we even need to do so.</p><p> How bad has it gotten? \u201cPeople are more likely to prefer their son or daughter marry a person of a different faith than a different political party,\u201d French said, quipping that for many on the right, \u201ceternal damnation is preferable to a Democrat.\u201d</p><p> Although these attitudes concern politics, count French as someone who does not believe there\u2019s a political solution. Rather, a cultural solution is needed. And that\u2019s where the personal courage comes in.</p><p> \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated into silence,\u201d he said, because that silence becomes self-reinforcing and makes it harder to speak up the next time.</p><p> But the answer is not to fight fire with fire.</p><p> \u201cThe opposite of political correctness is not acting like a jerk,\u201d French said. \u201cIt\u2019s speaking the truth with grace and humility and fearlessness. There is such a thing as being fearlessly reasonable.\u201d</p><p> Along with that is a legal corollary to the Golden Rule: \u201cDefend the rights of others that you would like to exercise yourself.\u201d</p><p> And an answer to the \u201csnowflake\u201d mentality on many college campuses: \u201cDo your best to be un-offendable. Be a walking safe space for speech.\u201d</p><p> French takes as much abuse on social media (specifically Twitter) as anyone I observe. But while he acknowledges those platforms \u201cput human nature on blast,\u201d and not in a good way, he said they\u2019re not the root cause of these problems.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s as old as the high school cafeteria,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s peer pressure.\u201d</p><p> As in that context, the answer to political correctness is to stand up to the peer pressure rather than conform to it to stay with the \u201cin\u201d crowd.</p><p> Contrary to some pleas, however, he isn\u2019t for treating big tech companies like Facebook and Google as public utilities, or using antitrust power to break them up. \u201cIf you have one \u2018woke\u2019 Google and you break into nine pieces, what are you going to have?\u201d he posited. \u201cNine \u2018woke\u2019 Googles.\u201d</p><p> The answer here is a mix of persuading the leaders of these behemoths not to stifle speech they don\u2019t like, while encouraging entrepreneurs who want to compete with them. The worst approach would be to weaken that strong legal environment for free speech, and let government regulators decide what\u2019s OK to say.</p><p> \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we know about politics,\u201d he warned those who have the upper hand today, \u201cit\u2019s that no party maintains control for long.\u201d</p><p> Kyle Wingfield is president and CEO of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation: georgiapolicy.org.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-17951C799B3948AF</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D765F08CB393 NWBKGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y90-F441-JBCN-4100-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Community Newspapers, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

A system can generally only have up to two of these.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To complement the transition to a \"territorial system,\" the United States in December 2017 passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which included new provisions applicable to U.S. multinationals including the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), a Base Erosion Anti Abuse Tax (BEAT), the Foreign Derived Intangible Income Deduction (FDII), and a Transition Tax.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even though the goal of tax reform was to move the U.S. corporate tax system towards a \"territorial\" system, the new system cannot be defined as a purely territorial system.</p><p>Apart from the implementation of the new U.S. reforms, there are ongoing efforts in other countries and organizations including the OECD and the EU to address base erosion and profit shifting.</p><p>OECD countries with territorial systems are now looking forward to implementing additional measures to protect their tax base. Some of the new proposals are intended to address the digital economy and the design of international tax rules.</p><p>The OECD has discussed a global minimum tax as an addition to other efforts to address base erosion and profit shifting.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Most OECD countries operate what is known as a territorial or source-based tax system where foreign earnings of multinational corporations are mostly exempt from domestic taxation. Such systems allow for multinational businesses to make investments and generate earnings in multiple jurisdictions and be able to remit those earnings to domestic shareholders without extra taxation. In most cases territorial systems are based on a participation exemption that allows foreign dividends or capital gains to either be fully exempt from domestic tax liability or face a lower tax liability.</p><p>The challenge with territorial corporate income taxes is that they can be complex. The goal of a territorial tax system is to tax companies based on the location of their production, which can be difficult in today's highly globalized world. This is because production processes stretch across numerous jurisdictions and can include transactions that are difficult to price. Companies with multinational production processes take deductions and report revenues throughout the world to allocate their profits. As such, it is often difficult to determine exactly how much profit should be taxed in a given country.</p><p>Another concern with territorial tax systems is that they can lead to base erosion. The fact that production processes span multiple tax jurisdictions leaves room for companies to take advantage of country-level differences in tax policy to allocate revenues and costs across tax jurisdictions in a way that can minimize their worldwide tax liability. Because companies do not face an additional tax on foreign profits that are repatriated to the parent company, multinational corporations would have a greater incentive to avoid domestic tax liability.</p><p>Due to these concerns, countries with territorial corporate tax systems set up rules to define how and if foreign profits are taxed, as well as rules that prevent base erosion and profit shifting. These rules include Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules, limitations on interest deductibility (thin capitalization rules), and other similar measures.</p><p>Stay Updated on Tax Issues Around the World</p><p>Select Country United States Aaland IslandsAfghanistanAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguilla Antarctica Antigua And Barbuda ArgentinaArmeniaAruba Australia AustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba Bosnia and Herzegovina BotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroon Canada Cape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChile China Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands ColombiaComoros Congo Cook IslandsCosta RicaCote D'IvoireCroatiaCuba Curacao CyprusCzech Republic Democratic Republic of the Congo DenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands Faroe Islands FijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench Polynesia French Southern Territories GabonGambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland GrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaiti Heard and Mc Donald Islands HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIreland Isle of Man IsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJersey (Channel Islands) Jordan KazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldives Mali Malta Marshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexico Federated States of Micronesia Republic of MoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegro Montserrat MoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNetherlands AntillesNew Caledonia New Zealand NicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistan Palau PalestinePanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippines Pitcairn PolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRepublic of Kosovo Reunion RomaniaRussiaRwanda Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint LuciaSaint Martin Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa (Independent) San Marino Sao Tome and Principe Saudi ArabiaSenegal Serbia SeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovak RepublicSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands South KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSt. Helena St. Pierre and Miquelon SudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen Islands SwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyria Taiwan TajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTonga Trinidad and Tobago TunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Turks and Caicos Islands TuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab Emirates United Kingdom UruguayUSA Minor Outlying Islands UzbekistanVanuatu Vatican City State (Holy See) VenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands (British) Virgin Islands (U.S.) Wallis and Futuna Islands Western SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe</p><p>Email + Advertising</p><p>By subscribing, you agree to be contacted by the Tax Foundation.

Following the BEPS recommendations in 2015, many countries have adopted reforms to their territorial systems to limit some of the opportunities for tax planning by multinational corporations. In the EU, this has taken the form of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD).</p><p>The U.S. adopted some tenets of a territorial tax system as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017. These provisions included not only a participation exemption but also strong anti-base erosion protections with the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) and the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT).</p><p>Anti-base erosion rules and the extent to which countries exempt foreign profits from domestic taxation vary significantly from country to country. It is not clear that a \"perfect\" or pure territorial tax system exists. Rather, countries need to trade off among three key goals: eliminating taxes on foreign profits, protecting their tax bases, and making their tax rules as simple as possible.</p><p>The OECD work on BEPS continues with several recent proposals meant to address the challenges associated with taxing multinational digital companies. These recent options include ways to amend international tax rules to change where multinational corporations pay tax and other proposals that would layer on new anti-base erosion rules with a potential global minimum tax and a tax on base-eroding payments.</p><p>This paper reviews how the 36 OECD countries structure their territorial tax systems and construct base erosion rules. It reviews some of the changes incorporated by EU member states as part of the ATAD and the U.S. move to a territorial tax system as a result of tax reform. Finally, it briefly visits the new OECD efforts regarding the digital economy and the idea of designing a global minimum tax.</p><p>Territorial Tax Systems in the OECD</p><p>Over the last three decades, most OECD countries have shifted towards territorial tax systems and away from residence-based or \"worldwide\" systems.[1] The goal of many countries has been to reduce barriers to international capital flows and to increase the competitiveness of domestically headquartered multinational firms.</p><p>As part of setting up these territorial tax systems, countries constructed rules that determined when and if foreign profits would be exempt from taxation. They also put in place and strengthened rules that attempt to limit potential profit shifting.</p><p>There are basically three major aspects that define the scope of a country's international corporate tax system.</p><p>First are what are called \"participation exemptions.\" Participation exemptions are what create a territorial tax system. They allow companies to exclude or deduct foreign profits that they receive from foreign subsidiaries from domestic taxable income, thus exempting those profits from domestic tax. In contrast, a worldwide system has no or few participation exemptions, and subjects those profits to domestic taxation.</p><p>Second are controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules. The aim of these rules is to discourage or prevent domestic multinationals from using highly mobile income (interest, dividends, royalties, etc.) and certain business arrangements to avoid domestic tax liability. They work by defining what constitutes a \"controlled\" foreign company and when to attribute foreign income of these controlled companies to a domestic parent's taxable income.</p><p>Third are limitations on interest deductions. These rules are used to prevent domestic and foreign companies from using interest expense deductions to shift profits into low-tax jurisdictions. While these rules do not directly impact foreign profits that multinationals earn in foreign jurisdictions, they are an important part of most countries' corporate tax systems and are aimed at preventing significant base erosion.</p><p>Participation Exemptions and Dividend Deductions</p><p>Countries enact territorial tax systems through what are called \"participation exemptions\" or dividend deductions. Participation exemptions eliminate the additional domestic tax on foreign income by allowing companies to either ignore foreign income in the calculation of their taxable income or to deduct foreign income when it is paid back to the domestic parent company. Participation exemptions can also apply to capital gains. Companies that sell their shares in a CFC and realize a gain may face no tax on those gains.</p><p>Some countries, such as Luxembourg, grant full exemptions for both foreign capital gains and foreign dividend income earned by domestic corporations. Other countries offer exemptions for one type of income, but not the other. Estonia, for instance, offers a full exemption for dividend income received from foreign subsidiaries (when certain requirements are met), but taxes capital gains realized from the sale of a foreign subsidiary as ordinary corporate income.</p><p>Of the 36 OECD member states, 31 countries offer some exemption or deduction for dividend income, 24 countries offer an exemption for capital gains, and 23 countries offer an exemption or deduction for both.</p><p>Participation exemptions also range from full to partial deductibility or excludability. For example, France exempts 95 percent of foreign dividend income and 88 percent of foreign capital gains. Countries providing partial exemptions often do so because it is less complex than accounting for business expenses that don't directly correlate to physical production. Usually, companies are required to allocate overhead costs of their headquarters, such as office supplies, to foreign subsidiaries. Allocating these costs can be complex. So instead of writing rules requiring companies to allocate expenses, countries allow companies to deduct those costs domestically, but tax a small portion of their foreign profits instead.</p><p>Limitations to Participation Exemptions</p><p>While most countries have enacted participation exemptions to eliminate the domestic tax on foreign profits, these exemptions are not unlimited. Countries have a range of rules that determine whether foreign profits are subject to tax when repatriated or paid back to their domestic parent.</p><p>Many European Union (EU) member states offer exemptions only when the resident company holds at least 10 percent of the subsidiary's share capital or voting rights for some specified period of time. France and Germany are notable exceptions, with France requiring only a 5 percent holding, and Germany unconditionally exempting 95 percent of foreign capital gains.</p><p>In the case of the United States, the new participation exemption adopted under TCJA is limited to dividends received by corporations that are 10 percent owners of foreign corporations (United States shareholders) according to the tax code. The foreign portion of the dividend is allowed as a deduction. Hybrid dividends are not able to benefit from the participation exemption. A hybrid dividend is a dividend that is treated differently for tax purposes, according to the law of two jurisdictions; for example, a dividend that can be deductible for the payor (or creditable, maybe refundable) and would be deductible when received by the payee (a U.S. corporation). Tax credits for taxes paid or accrued with respect to dividends distributed from a subsidiary in a foreign country are not allowed when a deduction for the dividend is applicable in the other country. Individual taxpayers are not eligible for the participation exemption.</p><p>Countries also limit participation exemptions and dividend deductions based on foreign subsidiaries' location. EU member states typically limit exemptions to subsidiaries located in other EU member states or within the European Economic Area (EEA). Some countries publish a \"black list\" of jurisdictions where the tax regime is considered abusive and will not provide exemptions to profits earned in those jurisdictions. Others, such as Norway, impose a standard where a company needs to conduct real business activities abroad in order to qualify for a participation exemption. This directly excludes holding companies and other kinds of passive operations from receiving an exemption.</p><p>Some countries have restrictions based on the line of business a foreign subsidiary is in. For example, several countries that exempt most dividend income will not exempt profits derived from certain service-based subsidiaries such as law offices.</p><p>Controlled Foreign Corporation Rules</p><p>A common concern with moving to a territorial tax system is base erosion. Under a territorial tax system, companies no longer face an additional tax on foreign profits that are repatriated to the parent company. Because of this, multinational corporations have incentives to avoid domestic tax liability by using transactions to shift income to foreign subsidiaries in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.</p><p>Countries address this issue with anti-base erosion rules called \"CFC rules.\" These rules aim to discourage or prevent domestic multinationals from using highly mobile income (interest, dividends, royalties, etc.) and certain business arrangements to avoid domestic tax liability. CFC rules are designed to prevent profit shifting without penalizing foreign subsidiaries engaged in legitimate business practices.</p><p>CFC rules are not unique to countries with territorial tax systems. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs act, the United States had rules to prevent companies from indefinitely deferring profits that were likely being purposefully shifted out of the domestic tax base. In the United States, CFC rules were enforced by the application of \"Subpart F\" rules. With the 2017 reform an additional set of rules (GILTI) was incorporated into the U.S. tax system with the intent of eliminating some of the tax benefits of shifting income outside the U.S. tax base.[2]</p><p>CFC rules generally outline policies for taxing the undistributed income of a domestic corporation's foreign subsidiaries. This means that if a foreign subsidiary of a domestic parent corporation is deemed a CFC and subject to a country's CFC rules, all or a portion of its profits are immediately subject to domestic tax. The income can either be taxed separately from domestic income or it can be incorporated into the taxable base of the domestic parent corporation.</p><p>For example, a British corporation may own a subsidiary located in the Cayman Islands. If the British CFC rules determine that the Cayman subsidiary is a CFC and the Cayman rate is 75 percent lower than the British rate, the Cayman operation can be considered as profit shifting, and the Cayman subsidiary's profits then will immediately be taxed in the United Kingdom.</p><p>CFC rules are very common throughout the OECD. Only Switzerland does not have any formal CFC rules. Though some OECD countries enacted CFC rules in the 1970s, most enacted or modified their rules following the recommendations from the OECD BEPS project in 2015. However, some countries often have other more qualitative base erosion provisions that attempt to accomplish the same goal as CFC rules.</p><p>Basic Structure of CFC Rules</p><p>CFC rules, while complicated and highly variable, all follow a common outline. First, an ownership threshold or test is used to determine whether an entity is considered a CFC. Next, a second tier of standards is used to determine if the CFC is taxable in the parent company's country. Finally, the rules determine what types of income are taxable.</p><p>Figure 1.</p><p>Stay Updated on Tax Issues Around the World</p><p>Select Country United States Aaland Islands Afghanistan Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua And Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil British Indian Ocean Territory Brunei Darussalam Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Cayman Islands Central African Republic Chad Chile China Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands Colombia Comoros Congo Cook Islands Costa Rica Cote D'Ivoire Croatia Cuba Curacao Cyprus Czech Republic Democratic Republic of the Congo Denmark Djibouti Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Estonia Ethiopia Falkland Islands Faroe Islands Fiji Finland France French Guiana French Polynesia French Southern Territories Gabon Gambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland Grenada Guadeloupe Guam Guatemala Guernsey Guinea Guinea-Bissau Guyana Haiti Heard and Mc Donald Islands Honduras Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Iran Iraq Ireland Isle of Man Israel Italy Jamaica Japan Jersey (Channel Islands) Jordan Kazakhstan Kenya Kiribati Kuwait Kyrgyzstan Lao People's Democratic Republic Latvia Lebanon Lesotho Liberia Libya Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Macau Macedonia Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Maldives Mali Malta Marshall Islands Martinique Mauritania Mauritius Mayotte Mexico Federated States of Micronesia Republic of Moldova Monaco Mongolia Montenegro Montserrat Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands Netherlands Antilles New Caledonia New Zealand Nicaragua Niger Nigeria Niue Norfolk Island North Korea Northern Mariana Islands Norway Oman Pakistan Palau Palestine Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Pitcairn Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Republic of Kosovo Reunion Romania Russia Rwanda Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint Lucia Saint Martin Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa (Independent) San Marino Sao Tome and Principe Saudi Arabia Senegal Serbia Seychelles Sierra Leone Singapore Sint Maarten Slovak Republic Slovenia Solomon Islands Somalia South Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands South Korea South Sudan Spain Sri Lanka St. Helena St. Pierre and Miquelon Sudan Suriname Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syria Taiwan Tajikistan Tanzania Thailand Timor-Leste Togo Tokelau Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Turks and Caicos Islands Tuvalu Uganda Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom Uruguay USA Minor Outlying Islands Uzbekistan Vanuatu Vatican City State (Holy See) Venezuela Vietnam Virgin Islands (British) Virgin Islands (U.S.) Wallis and Futuna Islands Western Sahara Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe</p><p>Email + Advertising</p><p>By subscribing, you agree to be contacted by the Tax Foundation. We respect the privacy of all our subscribers and you can learn more about our privacy policy here.</p><p>Tier 1: Determination</p><p>The first set of rules is meant to determine whether a foreign corporation is \"controlled.\" The idea is that if a foreign company isn't controlled by a domestic corporation, the domestic corporation isn't necessarily responsible for profit shifting that may be occurring. What constitutes control varies by country and some countries have ownership thresholds that more easily trigger CFC status than others.</p><p>The most common standard is a 50 percent ownership threshold. Twenty-nine OECD countries use this standard. This means that if one or more related corporations together own more than 50 percent of a foreign corporation's shares, that corporation is considered a CFC. For example, if a Finnish corporation independently owned 30 percent of shares in a foreign subsidiary and two of its domestic affiliates owned another 40 percent of shares in the subsidiary, then the foreign subsidiary would be considered a CFC.</p><p>Some countries narrow the scope of CFC determination by combining these total ownership thresholds with single-ownership thresholds. Single-ownership thresholds apply to the level of ownership for a single individual or corporation. For example, the United States combines its 50 percent ownership threshold with a 10 percent single-ownership threshold. This means that a foreign entity is considered a CFC if 1) more than 50 percent of the shares are owned by a U.S. corporation and its affiliates and 2) each affiliate owns at least 10 percent. France has a similar rule, but the single-ownership threshold is 5 percent. In total, there are five OECD member states with such hybrid systems.</p><p>The United States broadened the reach of the control standard after tax reform. The 2017 tax law expanded the combined standard and the 50 and 10 percent thresholds are now not only limited to voting power of all classes of stock of a shareholder in the corporation but there is also the option to determine control using the total value of shares of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation. The test is not inclusive, and any option can determine if a corporation is considered as controlled. A set of constructive ownership rules also applies to the CFC determination in the case of the 50 percent standard.</p><p>Some countries utilize only a single-ownership test. South Korea, for example, considers a subsidiary a CFC if only more than 10 percent of its share capital is held by a single domestic corporation. In Sweden, a foreign subsidiary is considered a CFC if a single shareholder owns more than 25 percent of its shares. Of the OECD countries with CFC rules, twenty-four employ a single-ownership test.</p><p>Other countries, such as New Zealand and Australia, use an either-or-approach. In both countries a foreign entity is deemed \"controlled\" if either a single company owns more than 40 percent of the shares or five or fewer related entities own more than 50 percent of the shares.</p><p>Some countries use more qualitative assessments to determine CFC status. Mexico considers any foreign corporation where domestic entities have \"management control\" to be a CFC, and Chile considers foreign corporations to be CFCs when a domestic company has the unilateral power to alter the foreign corporation's bylaws. New Zealand and Australia also use a qualitative control standard.</p><p>Tier 2: Applicability</p><p>While many foreign corporations might qualify as a CFC, not all will be subject to domestic taxation. There are generally two ways in which countries determine whether CFC income is taxable by domestic tax authorities.</p><p>The first way is through a \"taxation condition.\" This standard is aimed at preventing profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions, or \"tax havens.\" The classification of tax havens is usually based on the effective corporate income tax rate levied against the CFC or a \"black\" or \"white\" list. Generally, a standard threshold is utilized to determine if the tax rate in the CFC's country of residence encourages tax avoidance.</p><p>The threshold can either be an arbitrarily determined rate or a metric comparing the CFC's taxation abroad to the treatment it would receive as a domestic enterprise. For instance, Mexico enforces CFC restrictions if the CFC pays an effective rate that is less than 75 percent of the Mexican statutory corporate income tax rate. Twenty-seven countries subject CFCs to regulation based on a taxation condition.</p><p>The second way in which countries determine whether CFC income is taxable is by analyzing the type of income earned by a CFC. There are two main categories that business income can fall into: active and passive. Active income arises from traditional production activities, whereas passive income comes from legal or financial activities that do not necessarily require the participation of the person who receives the income. Passive income in most countries usually includes interest, dividends, rental income, and royalty income.[3] Countries that use income tests typically tax CFCs if a majority of their revenue is derived from passive income.</p><p>Eighteen countries use the percentage of total income derived from passive sources as a benchmark to determine whether CFC rules apply to an entity. The benchmarks diverge enormously. New Zealand applies CFC rules if passive income is greater than 5 percent of total CFC income, whereas Hungary applies CFC rules if passive income is greater than 50 percent of total CFC income.</p><p>A few countries also have further conditions they use to determine whether a CFC is taxable. Some countries, like Denmark, will also apply CFC rules in cases where the foreign corporation has financial assets exceeding a determined threshold. The United Kingdom has several potential tests it uses, including length of share ownership and the foreign company's profit margin. Other countries will only tax a CFC's profits in the hands of its parent if the parent company owns a certain amount of the CFC's shares. For example, Finland will only tax a CFC's income if its domestic parent owns at least 25 percent of its shares.</p><p>Tier 3: Application</p><p>Once a country's CFC rules determines that a company's CFC's income is taxable domestically, the rules then define what income is subject to tax. These rules also vary significantly and can apply to a share of passive income or both active and passive income. Of the countries with CFC rules, seventeen countries only tax passive income earned by CFCs while eighteen countries impose taxes on both active and passive income of CFCs.</p><p>Additional Rules and Exemptions</p><p>In addition to these general rules, nearly every country has exemptions that determine when a CFC may not be subject to these rules or taxation at all. For example, the EU Constitution[4] contains freedom principles conceived to facilitate business operations between members (as is the case of the freedom of movement and freedom of establishment). There are different cases where those freedoms have been limited by the application of certain EU members' jurisdictional laws, and they have intended to tax CFC business across the EU.</p><p>As a result, the European Court of Justice issued the wholly artificial arrangements doctrine to restrict unilateral actions that limit the application of these freedoms.[5] According to this doctrine CFC taxation may limit these freedoms only when arrangements have been created with a tax avoidance purpose, the so-called \"wholly artificial arrangements.\" With the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) most EU countries have designed rules that exempt CFC income from taxation when they operate in other EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, as long as they are engaged in real economic activities. In addition to the real economic activities rule, some EU members also require that there is a signed treaty with the other member country for the CFC exemption to apply.</p><p>Non-EU countries such as Japan, Slovenia, and Korea have similar active business exemptions. Other countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Chile, exempt CFCs if they operate in \"white list,\" or treaty countries. Some countries may exempt CFCs if their profits are below a de minimis threshold. Netherlands has a minimum substance safe harbor where if a company has labor costs and an office space for 24 months, the CFC profits are exempted from taxation. Besides exemptions, countries also have provisions that seek to prevent the double taxation of income that has already been taxed through a CFC rule when repatriated.</p><p>Interest Deduction Limitations</p><p>Under most tax systems throughout the world, the interest corporations pay on loans and bonds is deductible against taxable income, while interest income is taxable. It is common practice for a multinational corporation to lend itself money, by providing loans to and from subsidiaries located in foreign countries. These cross-border loans are helpful for companies to expand and make new investments in foreign markets.</p><p>However, as with other deductible expenses, interest deductions can be used to exploit cross-country differences in corporate tax systems to reduce corporate tax liabilities. Multinational corporations have an incentive to take out loans in high-tax countries, where they can take deductions, and lend from low-tax countries, where they can realize interest income, resulting in a lower worldwide tax burden.</p><p>Interest deduction rules can be seen as supplemental to CFC rules. CFC rules apply only to resident corporations whereas interest deduction limitations apply to all corporationsforeign and domestic.</p><p>To combat potential abuse of interest deductions, countries place limitations on these expenses. Thirty-three of the 36 OECD nations place some sort of formal limitation on interest expense deductions. Ireland has informal limitations on interest deductions. The only country that does not have any widely applicable limitation on interest deductions is Israel. Austria also has no official rules on interest deduction expenses, however, there are broad judicial guidelines that usually serve to regulate interest deductions. Most of the EU members modified their regimes and included an interest expense limitation rule due to the application of ATAD. In the United States, the rules governing interest deduction limitations were tightened with TCJA and a new business interest limitation rule that resembles the OECD parameters established in BEPS action 4.</p><p>Interest deduction limitations are often implemented through rules specifically targeted at multinational corporations, called thin capitalization rules.[6] Thin capitalization rules target companies whose debt levels far exceed equity. Most of these rules are designed to apply when a company has a debt-to-equity ratio beyond a predetermined threshold. Of the twenty-three OECD nations using thin capitalization rules, fourteen members employ this method. Austria generally uses the arm's length standard since it does not have explicit thin capitalization requirements. In some cases, tax authorities also use the debt-to-equity ratio on assessments to evaluate whether interest deductions can be restricted.</p><p>A few countries with debt-to-equity-style thin capitalization rules also pair them with restrictions on interest deductions to a set percentage of income. Seventeen OECD countries with thin capitalization requirements use this rule, with Belgium, Hungary, and Turkey employing this restriction in conjunction with a debt-to-equity ratio.</p><p>In recent years, countries have introduced much broader interest deduction limitations. These limits are sometimes called \"earnings stripping\" rules and restrict interest deductions to a set percent of income. Twenty countries have these rules. For example, The United Kingdom limits corporate interest deductions to 30 percent of earnings before interest deductions and taxes (EBITDA). The standard was set up by the OECD in the BEPS project and made mandatory by the application of ATAD to all EU members.</p><p>Few OECD members have restrictions on interest deductibility that employ more qualitative assessments. Generally, these assessments examine the intent and fairness of intracompany loans. Specifically, the loan must be made for a clear commercial purpose and must have interest obligations similar to those that would be offered by a third party. Sweden, for example, denies deductions if the interest on the loan is taxed at less than 10 percent, if the loan does not serve a commercial purpose, and if the loan would not have been made by an independent third party. Most of the rules limiting interest deductions in the EU have recently changed or are in the process of changing since the European Council enacted the ATAD, which establishes a standard for interest deductions rules that should be implemented over the EU members.</p><p>Other Anti-Base Erosion Provisions</p><p>Though participation exemptions, CFC rules, and interest deduction limitations are the main supports for territorial tax systems and anti-base erosion policies, several countries have additional sets of rules that work as anti-base erosion policies. Many of these policies have been adopted relatively recently, and some of these new provisions were developed as part of the OECD's BEPS project. For example, countries have started adopting country-by-country (CbC) reporting, which requires companies to report to tax authorities information such as profits, sales, number of employees, and taxes paid in each country they operate in. Countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and the United States have also introduced some unique anti-base erosion provisions.</p><p>UK Diverted Profits Tax and IP Tax</p><p>In 2015, the UK introduced the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT), often referred to as a \"Google Tax,\" which is intended to target tax avoidance practices of large multinationals. This policy basically sits on top of all the other anti-base erosion rules in the UK and is meant to target specific transactions that tax authorities deemed to be abusive. The application of the tax in the United Kingdom, specifically, is complex and somewhat subjective in nature.[7] The DPT applies a 25 percent tax rate on taxable profits that are artificially diverted away from the UK tax base. In some instances, businesses have altered their structures to pay UK corporate tax to avoid having to pay DPT.[8]</p><p>More recently, in 2018 the UK introduced a separate tax targeted at intellectual property located in low-tax jurisdictions. This policy applies to any foreign company with more than a,10 million in sales derived from intellectual property (IP) in countries with corporate tax rates below 50 percent of the UK rate. Businesses subject to the policy need to pay UK corporate tax on their IP income. Offshore income could be exempt from the tax if there is sufficient business substance in the offshore location or if the UK has a double tax treaty with the jurisdiction that includes a nondiscrimination provision.[9]</p><p>Australia Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and Diverted Profits Tax</p><p>Australia has an additional anti-base erosion provision, titled the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), which allows the Australian Taxation Office to impose penalties of up to 120 percent of the amount of avoided tax under certain circumstances. The MAAL has been in effect since 2016 and applies to significant global entities (SGEs). SGEs are defined as multinational businesses with global revenues of $1 billion AUD or more or an entity which is part of a multinational group with at least $1 billion AUD in global revenue. The MAAL penalty applies to business structures or transaction arrangements for which one of the main purposes of the structure is to gain Australian tax benefits or both an Australian and foreign tax benefit.</p><p>Australia has had a diverted profits tax in force since 2017. Like the MAAL, the Australian DPT also applies to SGEs. The DPT applies to a penalty rate of 40 percent on profits that are deemed to have been diverted from the Australian corporate tax base through arrangements that do not reflect economic substance. As in the UK, the Australian DPT is designed to be a harsh penalty for business practices that result in corporate taxes being paid at a rate lower than what the tax authority would deem appropriate or avoiding taxes altogether.</p><p>German Royalty Barrier Rule</p><p>In 2017, Germany introduced a royalty barrier rule that impacts royalties paid on intra-group transactions that result in an effective tax rate below 25 percent. The rule denies the deductibility of those payments. However, the royalty barrier does not apply when the recipient of a royalty is covered by the CFC rules.</p><p>Proposals in the United States</p><p>Over the last decade, U.S. lawmakers and academics introduced several proposals to reform the tax treatment of foreign profits of multinational corporations. Most proposals were to enact a \"territorial\" tax system by exempting foreign profits from domestic taxation. At the same time, these proposals would have enacted significant changes to the U.S.'s anti-base erosion rules. There were significant differences in how these proposals were ultimately designed. Ultimately, lawmakers ended up taking ideas from several proposals when designing the TCJA.</p><p>The first major proposal was from former Treasury Department analyst Harry Grubert and Rutgers economics professor Rosanne Altshuler in 2013. In their paper they proposed the creation of a minimum tax along with a move to a territorial tax system.[10] In 2014, Former Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp presented a tax reform proposal to modify the U.S. worldwide system and turn it to a territorial system. Additionally, he proposed to strengthen the anti-base erosion provisions, mainly aimed at intangible income, or income derived from intellectual property (IP).[11]</p><p>Finally, former President Obama presented a proposal in 2015 that would also have moved the U.S. to a territorial tax system and strengthen anti-base erosion rules. However, rather than introducing a participation exemption, the proposal would have introduced a minimum tax on foreign earnings and any income not subject to the minimum tax would not face any additional domestic tax.[12]</p><p>The 2017 US tax reform</p><p>In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed Public Law 115-97,[13] which enacted the first major tax reform for the United State since 1986. Along with other major changes, it moved the U.S. worldwide system towards a territorial system.</p><p>In order to move to a territorial tax system, the TCJA enacted a participation exemption. The participation exemption in the TCJA eliminated the additional tax on foreign profits of U.S. companies by giving a 100 percent deduction for the dividends received by the U.S. shareholders of those companies.[14] The deduction is applicable only for domestic corporations. To be eligible for the deduction a corporation receiving a dividend needs to:</p><p>own 10 percent of the CFC stock (vote or value), and</p><p>own the stock for a period of 366 days (holding period requirement).</p><p>The deduction is not available if the dividend received is able to obtain a tax benefit in the foreign country (or it is any form of hybrid dividend).</p><p>In addition to enacting the participation exemption, the TCJA enacted a set of strong protections to reduce deferral, address base erosion, and bring investments back to the country. The new set of rules protects the tax base by creating outbound provisions such as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) and Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), and by broadening the scope of CFC rules.</p><p>The GILTI is a new category of foreign income that includes earnings exceeding a 10 percent return on a company's invested foreign assets.[15] It is subject to a worldwide minimum tax between 10.5 and 13.125 percent on an annual basis. The GILTI credit is limited to 80 percent and cannot be carried forward. The tax operates on the same platform of Subpart F income, but it is levied at the shareholder level and not at the corporate level. Different from what happens with subpart F calculations, the GILTI is calculated at a group level and the tax applies when there is net income and not in the case where there are losses. The GILTI acts as a minimum tax to protect the U.S. tax base. There is a serious component of complexity added to the system with the GILTI, and some U.S. taxpayers are finding their GILTI being taxed at rates much higher than 13.125.[16]</p><p>The BEAT is a tax created to combat earning stripping out of the United States. The tax is applied at a rate of 10 percent (5 percent for the year 2018) of modified taxable income minus the regular corporate tax liability (not below zero).[17] It targets multinational corporations with gross receipts of at least $500 million in the previous three taxable years, with base erosion payments to related foreign corporations that exceed 3 percent (2 percent for certain financial firms) of the total deductions taken during the fiscal year.</p><p>Stay Informed on Tax Policy Research and Analysis</p><p>Select State AlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDistrict of ColumbiaFlorida Georgia HawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermont Virginia Washington West VirginiaWisconsinWyoming</p><p>Along with the permanent features of the new system, the TCJA imposed a one-time tax created for the transition to a territorial system.[18] The idea is that when transitioning to a territorial system it is necessary to collect taxes on all the deferred income kept abroad by U.S. multinationals. The rate of the tax is 15.5 percent on liquid assets and 8 percent on illiquid assets. The tax can be paid in installments, with no consideration on repatriation of the deferred earnings of U.S. multinationals. From a policy standpoint the compliance burden has increased with the creation of the transition tax. The reason for this is that multinational companies must determine the amount of previously taxed income, and determine the amount of tax imposed on the assets abroad since 1986.</p><p>After the biggest policy change in U.S. history since 1986, it can be said that these measures mark a considerable step toward a territorial system. The new system is designed with measures to protect the tax base, address deferral, and provide incentives for corporations to bring investments back to the U.S. However, all these changes have not achieved the objective of making the system simpler than the prior regime. Additionally, the U.S. approach with the GILTI and BEAT is a much stronger approach to addressing base erosion than approaches by other countries.</p><p>The EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive</p><p>In January of 2016, the European Union (specifically, the EU Council[19]) presented a proposal to incorporate some base erosion measures into the EU member tax systems to level the playing field between them. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) lays down rules against tax avoidance that directly affect the functioning of the EU market. By adding the new set of rules, the Council is adding a level of complexity to each member country's tax system.</p><p>The measures to reduce the risk of base erosion and profit shifting contained in the ATAD include: [20]</p><p>Exit taxation rules: aimed to prevent tax avoidance by the transfer of assets, or other strategies, to move a business from a country to another without paying taxes in the search for a more favorable treatment.</p><p>CFC rules: aimed to prevent companies shifting taxable income by taxing passive income or highly mobile income from their subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions.</p><p>Hybrid mismatch rules: aimed to prevent corporations from obtaining benefits from different legal and tax treatment of transactions through the legislation of different jurisdictions.</p><p>General anti-avoidance rules: aimed to allow tax authorities to analyze the primary purpose of business arrangements.</p><p>Interest deductibility rules: aimed to limit allowable interest deductions, avoid thin capitalization and earnings stripping, and control the use of interests to move profits from one country to another with no tax consequences.</p><p>The ATAD measures were to be implemented by January 2019, and EU countries continue to make efforts to make them part of their systems.[21]</p><p>Digital Services Taxes</p><p>Since 2018 many EU countries have been pursuing special taxes on the revenues of multinational digital firms. Though the EU has not adopted a unified approach, countries including Austria, France, the UK, and Spain and have drafted unilateral legislation to tax digital business.[22] The political goal of these proposals is to tax digital businesses in countries where they have revenues despite a lack of physical presence. Unlike other anti-base erosion provisions, these taxes target only specific lines of business including digital advertising, online marketplaces, and sales of user data from online platforms.</p><p>OECD Proposals on the Digital Economy</p><p>Following the OECD recommendations on the BEPS project in 2015, one of the major issues left mostly unaddressed was how tax policy should evolve considering the digital economy. In some ways, digital firms and businesses that earn significant income from valuable IP are able to minimize their tax liability in easier ways than manufacturing or retail businesses.</p><p>In February 2019, the OECD began a new effort on addressing the tax challenges of the digital economy that has two separate pillars.[23] Pillar 1 is aimed at redesigning international tax rules to change where multinational companies owe tax, and Pillar 2 includes proposals for a global minimum tax and a tax on base-eroding payments. Whereas many countries adopted stricter CFC rules or interest deduction limitations following the OECD's 2015 BEPS recommendations, the Pillar 2 policies would be even stronger anti-base erosion protections.</p><p>Though the details are still being considered, the OECD has outlined the global minimum tax as an income inclusion rule similar to the U.S. tax on GILTI. Countries would be able to treat some foreign income as included in their tax base if that income is taxed below a certain minimum level. The tax on base-eroding payments would likely be structured similar to the U.S. BEAT. The OECD is working to have a finalized set of proposals by 2020.</p><p>A Territorial Tax System Requires Balancing Competing Goals</p><p>Looking at rules throughout the developed world, it is not clear that there exists a \"perfect\" or pure territorial tax system. This isn't because a territorial tax system is a bad idea. Rather, it is because the taxation of corporate profits is fundamentally challenging. Thus, countries needed to make a number of trade-offs in designing their systems.</p><p>A territorial tax system basically must balance three competing goals:</p><p>exempting foreign business activity from domestic taxation,</p><p>protecting the domestic tax base, and</p><p>creating simple rules.</p><p>It is only possible to accomplish two of these goals at the same time. Simplification is at odds with a policy that exempts foreign business activity from domestic tax while trying to protect the domestic tax base. Protecting the domestic tax base is at odds with a policy that exempts foreign business activity alongside simple rules. Finally, a policy that protects the domestic tax base with simple rules does not fit with exempting foreign business activity from domestic taxation.</p><p>No country in the OECD has a pure territorial tax system with no limits or restrictions.[24] However, there are systems with fewer rules than others. Switzerland, for example, is the only OECD country that has not enacted CFC rules, but it is in the midst of discussions on tax reform that may incorporate some restrictions.</p><p>In contrast, lawmakers could opt for a blunter solution to tax avoidance, such as a minimum tax on foreign profits, but they need to understand that this may have a disproportionate impact on certain industries and would not eliminate the incentive for companies to invert. Systems like this would be similar to what former President Obama proposed in 2015 or what exists in countries with broader CFC rules like Australia or New Zealand.</p><p>Even if a territorial system is a good idea, governments around the world are incorporating supplemental measures to address the problem of base erosion and profit shifting. These additional measures add layers of complexity to the application of taxation rules. Even if it is a good policy to address base erosion and profit shifting, creating complex rules is not a good policy.</p><p>Other efforts to protect the tax systems from base erosion and profit shifting are reflected in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive issued by the European Council, as in the new rules enacted in the United States under the TCJA that are designed to protect the tax base of U.S. multinational companies and to improve the competitiveness of the companies.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>OECD countries have made a variety of decisions as they have worked to balance issues of exempting foreign business activity from taxation and protecting domestic tax bases. Many related policies are still developing and there is some uncertainty as to how things will evolve in the coming years. The U.S. decision to adopt a territorial tax system is certainly an improvement over having a worldwide system. However, in moving to a territorial system some of the new features created with the TCJA increased the complexity of the system. From the policy perspective it is correct to combat base erosion and profit shifting but policymakers need to keep in mind that the new rules need to be simpler. When designing new rules there is also a strong necessity to avoid increasing the compliance burden on taxpayers. All OECD nations that have moved to a territorial tax system or that had one in place had rules to prevent base erosion. Apparently, the rules were not enough and that is why there are new initiatives for international tax reform on the table, some of them taking ideas out of what the United States did with tax reform.</p><p>Stay Updated on Tax Issues Around the World</p><p>Select Country United States Aaland IslandsAfghanistanAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguilla Antarctica Antigua And Barbuda ArgentinaArmeniaAruba Australia Austria AzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba Bosnia and Herzegovina BotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroon Canada Cape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChile China Christmas Island Cocos (Keeling) Islands ColombiaComoros Congo Cook IslandsCosta RicaCote D'IvoireCroatiaCuba Curacao CyprusCzech Republic Democratic Republic of the Congo DenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEthiopiaFalkland Islands Faroe Islands FijiFinland France French GuianaFrench Polynesia French Southern Territories GabonGambia Georgia Germany Ghana Gibraltar Greece Greenland GrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaiti Heard and Mc Donald Islands HondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIreland Isle of Man IsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJersey (Channel Islands) Jordan KazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldives Mali Malta Marshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexico Federated States of Micronesia Republic of MoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegro Montserrat MoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNetherlands AntillesNew Caledonia New Zealand NicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistan Palau PalestinePanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippines Pitcairn PolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRepublic of Kosovo Reunion RomaniaRussiaRwanda Saint Kitts and Nevis Saint LuciaSaint Martin Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa (Independent) San Marino Sao Tome and Principe Saudi ArabiaSenegal Serbia SeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovak RepublicSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth Africa South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands South KoreaSouth Sudan Spain Sri LankaSt. Helena St. Pierre and Miquelon SudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen Islands SwazilandSweden Switzerland Syria Taiwan TajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Turkmenistan Turks and Caicos Islands Turks and Caicos Islands TuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab Emirates United Kingdom Uruguay USA Minor Outlying Islands UzbekistanVanuatu Vatican City State (Holy See) VenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands (British) Virgin Islands (U.S.) Wallis and Futuna Islands Western SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe</p><p>Email + Advertising</p><p>By subscribing, you agree to be contacted by the Tax Foundation.

He said that spectrum license values could range from $0.30 per MHz-POP in dense urban areas to $0.003 per MHz-POP in rural areas. The MHz-POP calculation is applied to most spectrum transactions and reflects the number of people covered with the license compared with the amount of spectrum available.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the Wall Street analysts at research firm Cowen believe the upcoming 3.5GHz CBRS spectrum auction could raise more than double that total. \"Auction proceeds could be ~$4.4B in total at $0.20 per MHz-POP,\" the firm wrote in a recent report to investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And operator demand elsewhere in the world could portend even higher prices. For example, an auction of similar 3.5GHz spectrum in Taiwan just passed the $0.51 per MHz-POP mark, dramatically above most expectations. The Wall Street analysts at New Street Research noted that figure is well above the previous global high point for midband spectrum -- $0.41 per MHz-POP recorded in Italy in 2018.</p><p>\"The CBRS auction will be unlike any other ever conducted. The number of licenses being offered (over 22,000) along with the county-based license areas means there should be something for everyone,\" CommScope's Rashid Bhatti, who has been leading the company's efforts to sell Spectrum Access System (SAS) technology for the CBRS band in the US, explained to Light Reading in written comments. \"CBRS offers unique new opportunities for MNOs, MSOs, Neutral Host Network operators, private enterprises, WISPS, municipalities and many other market verticals, so there could be broad participation.\"</p><p>Bhatti noted that the CBRS band is unique in the world because it is designed to be shared between the US Navy and commercial users. Bhatti explained there are concerns that Navy users could disrupt commercial operations because they get priority access to the CBRS band, but added that \"our studies show that our SAS will be able to manage CBRS operation to minimize any impact to incumbent operation.\"</p><p>Satiating midband thirst</p><p>The FCC -- the main telecommunications regulatory agency in the US and the government arm in charge of commercial spectrum management -- plans to auction 70MHz of spectrum in the 3.5GHz CBRS band starting June 25. Although the FCC has recently auctioned off plenty of lowband spectrum and highband spectrum, the CBRS auction in June will represent the agency's first significant auction of midband spectrum in recent years.</p><p>And that's a big deal for companies in the 5G sector.</p><p>Midband spectrum has been described as ideal for 5G because transmissions in such spectrum can both carry plenty of data while also traveling significant distances. That's not true for 5G in lowband spectrum (signals can travel far but can't carry much data) or 5G in highband, millimeter-wave spectrum (signals can carry lots of data but can't travel very far). Indeed, the FCC itself said the 3.5GHz CBRS band \"will be an essential part of next generation wireless network deployments, including 5G, throughout the world.\"</p><p>Carriers ranging from Verizon to T-Mobile have bemoaned the relatively lack of available midband spectrum in the US for years now. Thus, the CBRS auction could act as a bit of a salve for that demand.</p><p>Radio frequency caveats</p><p>However, virtually everyone agrees the CBRS auction won't be much more than a band aid -- rather than a solution -- to the midband problem for 5G in the US. That's because the auction only spans 70MHz, and any single bidder will be unable to purchase more than 40MHz of spectrum in a given area. Those rules are designed to prevent a single, deep-pocketed operator like Verizon from scooping up all the licenses in the auction. And while 40MHz of midband spectrum is certainly significant, it's not nearly enough to satiate all of the big 5G players in the US. After all, the more spectrum a carrier owns, the more customers it can support and the faster speeds it can provide.</p><p>To put the upcoming US CBRS auction of 70MHz in perspective, the ongoing 3.5GHz auction in Taiwan is offering a whopping 270MHz worth of spectrum. And the big C-Band auction of midband spectrum that the FCC is currently hoping to auction at the end of this year could release up to 280MHz of spectrum. That's why some analysts expect the C-Band auction in the US to fetch up to $50 billion in total bids, while the CBRS auction may only fetch $4 billion in bids.</p><p>Bidders</p><p>So which companies might bid in the FCC's summer CBRS auctions? Plenty of companies have voiced their interest in the space via filings with the FCC. Energy entities like the Utilities Technology Council, fixed wireless providers like GeoLinks, big wireless operators like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, smaller carriers represented by the Competitive Carriers Association, and cable players like Charter have all debated exactly how the FCC should conduct its CBRS auction.</p><p>\"CenturyLink is actively exploring using spectrum in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band to provide high-speed broadband service in rural areas and thus appreciates this opportunity to comment on the planned auction of spectrum in this band,\" the company wrote in its own filing.</p><p>The analysts at Cowen believe cable companies like Charter and Comcast will finally obtain \"owner's economics\" in the wireless business by bidding on 3.5GHz spectrum licenses in heavily trafficked portions of their cable footprints.</p><p>\"We believe CBRS could be a 'gift' to Cable as they look to acquire spectrum to build out their own wireless networks, utilizing dual-SIM technology to offload traffic onto their own networks and offset the roaming costs they pay their MVNO partners,\" the analysts wrote to investors in a report, noting that Charter recently said that roughly 80% of its mobile traffic occurs in just 15% of its cable footprint. \"While CBRS may lack the capacity needs for a large wireless carrier, we believe a 2x20MHz swath of CBRS would provide more than enough capacity for a Cable player's wireless business.\"</p><p>Already Charter, Altice and Comcast have made clear their interest in the CBRS band. Charter, for example, wrote to the FCC that it is \"currently testing a variety of new technologies for mobile and fixed wireless services using 3.5 GHz spectrum in several urban and rural markets across the country, including Tampa, Charlotte, Denver, Lexington, Los Angeles, and New York -- with additional sites in the pipeline. With the information received from these trials, Charter will evaluate the use of this band in conjunction with its existing infrastructure to deploy licensed small cells using 4G LTE and 5G wireless access technologies to enhance its wireless products.\"</p><p>Cowen predicted Comcast and Charter collectively will spend $1.5 billion in the CBRS auction, which the firm said could help offset the $700 million they're expected to pay Verizon in 2023 for wholesale access to Verizon's network. Both Comcast's Xfinity Mobile and Charter's Spectrum Mobile MVNOs piggyback on Verizon's wireless network, and the two companies pay Verizon for that access based on the amount of data their MVNO customers consume on Verizon's network. If these cable companies operated their own CBRS networks for their mobile customers, they would only have to pay Verizon when their customers travel outside of their CBRS coverage areas.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that, if cable companies do end up bidding in the FCC's upcoming 3.5GHz CBRS auction, that would represent a bit of a turnaround. No cable companies are participating in the FCC's ongoing auction of 3,400MHz of millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum across the 37GHz, 39GHz and 47GHz bands. That auction has so far generated a total of $6.8 billion in provisionally winning bids, a total that isn't expected to grow much more given the cooling of bidding activity in recent days.</p><p>And, according to the Cowen analysts, cable firms might not be the only surprise in the CBRS auction. \"While we believe Cable could be among the largest spenders, we do believe there are other dark-horses that could spend meaningfully in [CBRS] Auction 105,\" the analysts wrote, specifically musing on the possibility of \"big tech\" companies like possibly Amazon bidding on licenses for industrial IoT applications. Already Amazon is working to build private CBRS wireless networks with partners like Federated Wireless and CommScope.</p><p>Cloudy crystal balls</p><p>Finally, it's important to point out that auction predictions are notoriously difficult to make. The FCC's massive AWS-3 auction in 2015, which generated an astounding $44 billion in total bids, exceeded just about everyone's expectations. Meantime, the 600MHz incentive auction in 2017 -- initially described as a \"spectrum bonanza\" that could generate up to $60 billion in total bids -- ended at just $20 billion. T-Mobile is the only big wireless network operator that is using 600MHz spectrum.</p><p>That's partly why CommScope's Bhatti declined to offer any specific predictions for the upcoming CBRS auction.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Light Reading India.

Oliver[1] Nicole Ambrosetti[2] MoginRubin[3] MoginRubin Blog[4] The Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are making good on their promises to scrutinize the world's leading technology platform providers - Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet's Google - as the cries from competitors for what they consider to be unchecked market dominance and anticompetitive practices grow in number and volume.Retailers blame Amazon and Google for an information bottleneck, the collection of third-party sales data, and the spread of counterfeit products. Independent developers say Apple favors its own apps above all others, and retailers say Amazon is doing the same with consumer products. Social media companies question whether Facebook's methods of gathering and use of consumer data, and its sheer market power, are being used inappropriately to hamper competition globally.This week the DOJ announced it is reviewing 'whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.' </p><p>The Wall Street Journal broke the story, later confirmed by the DOJ, writing that this new antitrust inquiry under Attorney General William Barr 'could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms.'WSJ reporter Brent Kendall wrote that the review will 'go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector' previously crafted by the DOJ and FTC, which have divided up which will lead separate investigations against the tech giants.'Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,' said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. He promised 'an objective and fair-minded' look at the conduct of these companies 'to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.'U.S. House of Representatives Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI) is heading abipartisan investigation, too[5]. 'Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers' for the U.S., both politically and economically, Cicilline said in announcing the probe. Hearings were held in Washington earlier this month. As reported by the WSJ, they focused on Facebook's cryptocurrency plans, Google's alleged (and hotly disputed) censorship of conservative points of view, and anticompetition practices of the Big Four, from adjusting algorithms in their favor to buying up smaller competitors.'After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge,' Cicilline said when he announced the investigation.House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) noted 'growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications . Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.'The pressure is on for Big Tech in the U.S. and abroad.This week the FTC announced a $5 billion privacy fine against Facebook, settling the case that followed the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook agreed to reinforce user privacy protections, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged, via a post on Facebook, to 'make some major structural changes to how we build products and run this company.'In April,the German competition regulatory authority[6]barred the company from combining user data with data it scrapes from non-Facebook sources \u2014 a major wellspring of Facebook's data \u2014 unless users give expressed permission. The agency said Facebook used its restrictive user agreement to dominate the German market.In March,the European Commission fined Google[7]$1.69 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. 'Google has abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites which prevented Google's rivals from placing their search adverts on these websites,' the EU Commission said. The Commission fined Google $2.7 billion in 2017 and nearly double that amount in 2018, when it hit the company with a $5 billion fine. All told, Google has been fined nearly $9.4 billion by the EU.The FTC Bureau of Competition, whichlaunched a Technology Task Force in February[8], is likely to consider privacy as a nonprice factor in assessing the online marketplace and limited access to data as a barrier to new market entrants. That's another step in the right direction for enforcers finally trying to adapt to the era of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.These investigations have been a long time coming.Article edited by Tom Hagy for MoginRubin.

Imagine further if Tesco controlled the position of each shop within these stores and retailers had to pay for the best spots. There would be howls of outrage. Yet this is the sort of power that Google exercises over the internet. More than 90 per cent of online searches are now made on the US website, meaning the company effectively controls digital access to British business.</p><p>Of course, the key difference is that consumers are choosing to visit Google rather than being forced to do so but the extent to which that is the result of familiarity and default settings rather than the company's brilliance is open to question.</p><p>Irrespective of the degree of consumer choice in Google's rise to dominance, there can be little doubt about the power it holds and that it has abused that position. Just ask any company that buys search advertising if the system is fair, transparent or competitive. Google is now slicing huge chunks of profit from almost every digital business in Britain. Economists call this rent-seeking.</p><p>Last week, the competition watchdog finally signalled it might do something about it. In an interim report, it said Google's dominance of search is so great that it may be driving up the price of goods and services. It described the company's profits as \"well above any reasonable estimate of what might be expected in a competitive market''.</p><p>However, it added that once it has published its final conclusions, the decision over what to do will be left to government. This is a concern because if there is one thing big tech is better at than making huge profits, it is lobbying. Companies such as Google have a habit of employing the friends of top politicians. They like people who can make their case to ministers at Notting Hill dinner parties rather than meeting rooms in Westminster.</p><p>The new government must see through such tactics because bold steps may be required. Capitalism is successful because it harnesses human nature but to work effectively it needs proper regulation and leaders who are prepared to intervene in the wider interests of the economy. Breaking up Google may yet be just such a necessity.</p><p>Standing up to corporate interests is not anti-business if it enables competition, the force that creates wealth and innovation for all.</p><p>Andrew Ellson is consumer affairs correspondent</p><p>Standing up against corporate interests is not anti-business</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-155980561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV0-77X1-DYTY-C2CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"410\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002ACF</classCode><className>TESCO PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The anti-establishment Zero Hedge posts articles under the moniker Tyler Durden, a nod to the anarchic 1999 film \"Fight Club.\" </p><p>Users of the libertarian financial blog Zero Hedge say[1] they were unable to post the site's links on Facebook, prompting Zero Hedge to claim Facebook is censoring its content. Late Monday evening, a Zero Hedge reader posted[2] an image of a Facebook popup message, which said one particular article \"couldn't be shared, because this link goes against our Community Standards.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1105186898232905730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Facebook has blocked all @zerohedge[3] links, throwing up the following message: pic.twitter.com/iuc3UxWgE1[4];\"We were especially surprised by this action as neither prior to this seemingly arbitrary act of censorship, nor since, were we contacted by Facebook with an explanation of what 'community standard' had been violated or what particular filter or article had triggered the blanket rejection of all Zero Hedge content,\" the founder \"Tyler Durden\" wrote [5]on the Zero Hedge site. The Durden pseudonym used on the site is a nod to Brad Pitt's character in the anarchic 1999 film \"Fight Club,\" which was based on the 1996 Chuck Palahniuk novel of the same name.  Facebook has not yet replied to a request for comment from Business Insider on the issue, but the social-media giant has been cracking down on fake news under pressure from governments [6]and regulators. Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren called out Facebook for banning an ad that called for big tech companies to be broken up. The post was later reinstated[7]. Zero Hedge is a favorite of City and Wall Street traders, known for its anti-establishment and bearish slant on financial topics. Zero Hedge authors have railed against a variety of issues, most famously their takedown[8] of Goldman Sach's high-frequency trading platforms, which were later addressed by US regulators. The founder of the site was outed in 2009 [9]as Bulgarian immigrant Dan Ivandjiiski[10], a man whom New York Magazine alleged[11] has with a penchant for conspiracy theories and was banned from working in the brokerage business for insider trading.

The Anti-...</p><p>(Bloomberg) -- An anti-big tech coalition is funneling more than $1 million into initiatives that promote stronger antitrust enforcement as U.S. regulators examine whether Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies have too much power in the marketplace.   The Anti-Monopoly Fund -- which was started last year by Facebook Inc. co-founder Chris Hughes and the nonprofit group he chairs -- said Monday that it\u2019s donating $1,625,000 to 14 research institutions, small business groups, public-interest campaigns and other organizations that examine market concentration in a variety of sectors. Since leaving Facebook in 2007, Hughes has emerged as a critic of the power of large technology companies and stunned observers when he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times last year calling for the breakup of the social media giant he helped create.   The donations are part of a larger effort announced last year by the Economic Security Project to spend $10 million on promoting more robust competition in the technology, pharmaceutical, financial services and agricultural industries.   The Fund is seeking reforms in the marketplace as antitrust scrutiny of the technology sector intensifies at federal, state and congressional levels. The chief executive officers of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Apple Inc. are poised to testify Wednesday in an extraordinary joint appearance before a congressional panel investigating competition in the technology industry.   \u201cThe upcoming Congressional hearing involving CEOs from America\u2019s biggest tech companies is a much-needed step toward oversight of an industry with virtually none of the checks on power required of other major businesses,\u201d Hughes said in a statement. \u201cWe should not rely on any corporation to self-regulate, and I\u2019m grateful political leaders are transcending party lines to take action and curtail the undue power and influence of these corporations.\u201d   Among the Fund\u2019s new grantees include the American Independent Business Alliance, which plans to work with its network of small and independent businesses to expose potential antitrust violations, according to the Fund. Liberal advocacy group Demand Progress plans to organize grassroots campaigns to promote accountability of big technology companies. Howard University\u2019s Institute for Intellectual Property &amp; Social Justice will organize entrepreneurs of color and reach out to Congress about the ways tech platforms are impeding competition in e-commerce, according to the Fund.   The groups receiving funding are adding to regulatory pressure already on the biggest tech companies. Facebook and Google both face competition inquiries by federal enforcers and nearly all 50 states. Amazon is under investigation by the FTC, the EU and California, Bloomberg has reported. Apple is also under scrutiny in Europe and by the Justice Department. in Europe and by are facing scrutiny from the European Union.   The Fund is ramping up its funding at a time when companies of all sizes are foundering in a pandemic-stricken economy.   Under the pandemic, \u201csmall businesses, which long have been a stalwart against big businesses, are really struggling to find their footing,\u201d said Anti-Monopoly Fund executive director Taylor Jo Isenberg. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an acceleration of a problem that already existed in the way that requires this even more aggressive response.\u201d   \u00a92020 Bloomberg

The tech company which presents itself as a global force for good has become a corporate concealer, covering up management blunders and the irresponsible use of data with a policy of denial, delay and cynical lobbying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Duke of Cambridge was surely right when he denounced this week the failures of the big tech companies to honour their commitment to stamp out cyberbullying. On fake news, extremism, polarisation, hate speech, trolling, mental health, privacy and bullying, said the duke, \"our tech leaders seem to be on the back foot\".</p><p>A lengthy investigation by The New York Times has, in interviews with former and serving staff, laid out how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in particular has strayed from the standards it once set itself. <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the chief executive, flatly denied that his company had played a role in the outcome of the 2016 US election. Yet months before Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>outrage, his security experts had already found a pattern of Russian hacking of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts of those linked to the presidential campaign. It collected evidence of Russian interference for more than a year before making it public.</p><p>All too often the company's first concern when a scandal looms has been to hire lobbyists and public relations companies to contain any damage to its reputation. When <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>came under fire for the way its user data had been deployed by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters, its first instinct was to install a new head of lobbying in the United States. Its primal fear, it seems, is the prospect of additional regulation, a slowing of growth and a slip in profits. Contrary to the public image it likes to project, the bottom line is all.</p><p>The investigation disclosed that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hired a public relations agency to place dozens of articles on a news site that sought to divert attention away from the damaging Cambridge Analytica claims. The planted articles attacked rivals Apple and Google and minimised <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>problems. The agency, from which <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has now parted company, was said to have sent journalists a document trying to blacken the name of the financier and philanthropist George Soros. Mr Soros, who has been the butt of antisemitic commentary in far-right media, had offended <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>by calling it a monopolist menace with \"neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of its actions\".</p><p>What seemed to many as fair comment on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>business practice was regarded by the company's reputational defenders as an assault that had to be countered. And yet it has a good story to tell. It has notched up considerable achievements and has changed daily lives across generations. It has shifted the way politics is contested and become an advertising goliath. In little more than a decade it has connected 2.2 billion people.</p><p>There is obviously nothing wrong in exploiting good ideas and growing quickly. Yet <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>power has been used to spread propaganda, generate hate speech and manipulate the democratic process. The Burmese military used it to stoke animus against the Rohingya Muslims and thus facilitate ethnic cleansing. Closer to home, teachers say that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is used by children to harass and isolate others. A company of this size and this reach into everyday lives has to accept that it is no longer a platform, it is a publisher that must be held accountable, as all publishers are. In most cases that means self-regulation as well as being bound by numerous laws.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>seemed to believe that taking responsibility for what users post was too expensive. Sir Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, will soon be taking over as its global PR chief. He will find that his employer's deep-seated problems cannot be solved by smearing lipstick on the pig.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-49295621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRT-89C1-F021-632J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 17, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The show will be much better if you go back and listen to the first two episodes. If you do not, here is the text that scrolls on the screen at the beginning of the movie.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 The United States government used to use antitrust law a lot to protect small companies against big companies in the name of competition. Then there was a backlash led by a judge named Robert Bork. He wrote a book called \"The Antitrust Paradox\" that argued antitrust enforcement had gotten out of hand and the government needed to back off. Now, in the past couple years, as a few tech companies have gotten very big and very powerful, a backlash to the backlash has begun.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 My name is Lina Khan, and I'm an academic fellow at Columbia Law School and a senior fellow at the Open Markets Institute.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And you're a lawyer.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I'm a lawyer.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 When Lina Khan was in law school two years ago, she wrote a paper for the law review.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 What was the title of the paper?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\"             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 An allusion to that Bork book, \"The Antitrust Paradox.\"             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Why did you choose that title?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I was interested in exploring how Bork's approach to antitrust had enabled Amazon's rise. And the paradox with Amazon seemed to me that here we had a company that was amassing dominance in various markets, but our current approach to antitrust law was really keeping us blind to that dominance. And so that, to me, seemed like an interesting tension.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Our current approach to antitrust law, Bork's approach, is known as consumer welfare. And the basic idea is low prices and lots of choices are good. If consumers are getting these things, then there's no antitrust problem. And clearly, Amazon has delivered low prices and lots of choices, so it hasn't run into much trouble with antitrust law in the United States.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And yet, Lina Khan argued in this paper, there are things that Amazon has done that have been bad for competition. So her wonky article comes out, she hears from a few antitrust lawyers, then her article gets mentioned in The New York Times.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 That spurred kind of a new wave of interest. And so I just started receiving more and more emails.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 I feel like you're being somewhat modest about this, which I respect a tremendous amount, even though it's not good for our story.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 What she is not saying is that this student law review article completely blew up.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 I mean, look; I know you didn't go on \"Ellen\" or whatever, but...             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Right.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Or did you go on \"Ellen\"?             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Or did you go on \"Ellen\"? Did I miss that?             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 It got big. We know it got big.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Lina Khan learned that the rise of a few giant tech companies had made this very wonky thing, antitrust policy, suddenly feel urgent and important to lots of ordinary people.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Is it bad these companies are so big? Are they a sign that the free market is failing us and competition is disappearing? Do we need to think about antitrust in a new way?             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Congressmen wanted to meet with her. The Washington Post and The Atlantic wanted to profile her - CNBC, NPR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>KORVA COLEMAN:                 And she joins me now to talk about how antitrust law handles Amazon. Lina, thank you for being with us.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Good to be here.             </p><p>KORVA COLEMAN:                 Let me first say, Amazon is among NPR's corporate sponsors.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Right. We're going to have to talk about that.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 I'm Kenny Malone. Today on the show, Amazon...             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 One of our corporate sponsors.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 ...And Facebook...             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Also a corporate sponsor.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 ...And Google.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 I think a corporate sponsor.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Not a corporate sponsor.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Oh, OK.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 But all of this is kind of the point. These three companies are suddenly everywhere. They have an incredible amount of money and power.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And Lina Khan is part of this new wave of thinkers who are starting to say, maybe the rise of these giant tech companies is a sign that antitrust is broken, and we need to fix it.             </p><p>                So the question for today's show is, what, if anything, should we do about the big tech firms? I mean, actually, that's a ridiculously large question. There's no way we could do that in a show. I mean, we're going to do a subset of that question, right? We're going to focus specifically on competition and the free market and the role of the government. We're going to focus on antitrust.             </p><p>                So the question really is, should we be using antitrust law in some way with respect to these big tech companies?             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 And the way we're going to do this - we're going to talk to two very smart people, lawyers whose job is to answer questions like these. And we're going to ask them two big questions. One, are we thinking about antitrust the right way? Does this consumer welfare standard still work? And question two, if you had all the antitrust power in the world, what would you do?             </p><p>                First up, Lina Khan.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Do you want a title? We're going to make you the ruler of antitrust in America.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 That seems kind of antithetical to the spirit of antitrust (laughter).             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Well played. Oh.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Yeah, it's fair. That's fair.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So are you sort of respectfully declining your appointment?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I'm happy to play along with the hypothetical.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 OK. Is there a reason in particular to focus on big technology firms?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 So the reason I've been focusing on big technology companies is because I think some of the blind spots of the current antitrust approach are most significant in the context of these tech companies, in part because in many instances, they're offering products or services that are nominally free, right? We're paying in data, and so that complicates how antitrust looks at these issues.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Think of Google and Facebook. You don't have to pay money to use those services, so the current antitrust approach - consumer welfare standard, which focuses largely on price - just isn't going to work very well.             </p><p>                Also, she says there's just this fundamental nature of a few key tech sectors. They just tend to be winner-take-all. Everybody's going to tend to end up using one search engine, one social network. Everybody who wants to buy or sell online is going to wind up at the one online store with the most buyers and sellers.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Can we talk about specific companies?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 OK.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 What should we do about Amazon?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Well, I think first we need to have investigations into Amazon's conduct. We have a very meager understanding of how the different parts of its businesses actually interlink and how it potentially uses data collected in one market to advantage itself in another market and that sort of thing.             </p><p>                And so I think as a first step, more investigations, more hearings just to understand what's happening. And that should then help inform what we should do.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 OK. What about as a second step?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Well, you know, I think...             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 You've written about things...             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Yes.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 ...That are way more interesting...             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Yeah (laughter).             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 ...Frankly, than investigations.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, one problem that I've been focused on is the potential conflict of interest that seems baked into some of these companies' current businesses.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Amazon - let's talk about Amazon in particular.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 OK, let's talk about Amazon.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Amazon is many things, but the main thing most people think of when they think of Amazon is this marketplace, a store where anybody who wants to can sell almost anything they want to millions and millions of potential customers. In the jargon, this marketplace is a platform.             </p><p>                And what we wound up mostly talking to Lina Khan about is, what does it mean for competition when one company winds up controlling such a huge platform?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I mean, what's so unique about platforms is that platforms end up dramatically reducing the cost of entry for all the third parties.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And what that means is platforms can be really good for competition because now there is this place where everybody in America who wants to buy, say, batteries is going to go to buy their batteries. So if I want to get into the battery selling business, that is great for me. Of course, I have to compete against all the other battery brands out there - not only Duracell and the Energizer, but also Amazon's own private-label batteries, AmazonBasics batteries.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Amazon has built out a pretty extensive private label. It has at least 120 different labels where it's now actually producing Amazon-based goods.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Now, you could argue, and a lot of people do, that these Amazon store brands are good for competition. Amazon is one more competitor in the market. But Khan argues, in the long run, Amazon selling Amazon brand stuff on Amazon may be bad for competition.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 So that, I think, can create a conflict of interest. And so far as Amazon owns the platform, it runs the platform, it decides who comes up where in the search rankings. But it's also competing with all the merchants that are now dependent on the platform.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So this problem - I mean, this seems like a fundamental, like, store brand problem, right? Like, there, you know - whatever. Walmart is a bigger retailer than Amazon, and they have store brands. And they can, you know, put the Purina dog food on the bottom shelf...             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 That's right.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 ...And the Ol' Roy or whatever their house dog food is on the top shelf. And you could imagine the same problem there - right? - a giant retailer with all this power just says, oh, look what's selling in our store. We're going to have a store brand. Is that a similar competitive problem?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I think you have to really look at the degree to which the retailer or the distributor is playing a bottleneck role in a sector. So with retailers, it's absolutely true that they have private labels. Generally speaking, there's much more competition in the retail industry than there is in online commerce. And so I think that means that the stakes of discrimination are quite different.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So you're saying I could shop at Walmart or I could shop at Kroger or I could shop at Costco. It's that level of competition that you're talking about?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 There's that level of competition. There's also the issue of how risk gets assigned.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 The issue of who is taking the risk here, the company developing a new product or the company running the store where the product is going to be sold. So let's say, Jacob, that you and I decide to go into business.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 I'm in.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 We're going to sell hats for dogs.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Yes, million-dollar idea.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 The way a lot of traditional stores work is they buy the dog hats from us in bulk.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Yes.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 And then, if the dog hats sit on the shelves and don't sell, that's not really our problem, at least not in the short run. The retail store paid us money for our hats. We have the money. The store took the risk that the hats might not sell.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Amazon does not work that way. Amazon is not going to buy the dog hats from us. We can post our dog hats for sale on Amazon, and if they don't sell, we go out of business, and it did not cost Amazon anything.             </p><p>                If the dog hats do sell, then we pay Amazon a chunk of our revenue. And if our dog hats sell like crazy, if the world suddenly goes bananas for dog hats, then Amazon is free to start selling their own line of dog hats, AmazonBasics dog hats.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 There are merchants that bring all sorts of niche products - right...             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Sure.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 ...That are not guaranteed to sell. They're - it's these third parties that are undertaking the original risk to invest in a product and see, hey, is this going to succeed?             </p><p>                What's troubling is that in some instances, when a product does start doing well, Amazon observes it and then takes that idea, produces it itself, knocks out the third party from the top search listings. And so suddenly, you know, it's Amazon that's reaping the reward of the risk that somebody else took.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Then what would you expect the sort of long-term consequence would be?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I think the long-term consequence will be that third parties will be more reluctant to invest in products to take risks to bring them to market, the idea being that even if this product succeeds, there's a good chance that Amazon will appropriate the value of that reward, and they'll just be left hanging.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 In other words, if Amazon's just going to wait and see if our dog hats sell, and if they do sell, it's going to start selling AmazonBasics dog hats, why should we get into the dog hat business in the first place? Khan argues that lots of people will think, why should I even start selling anything online if I'm just going to end up losing to Amazon? And in the long run, she says, this will mean less competition.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 You've presented this as a problem or as a potential problem. What's the solution?             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 I think one solution is separating the marketplace from Amazon to private label. I think if you're going to be a dominant marketplace, then you perhaps shouldn't be able to also sell on that marketplace, putting yourself in direct competition with all the merchants that are dependent. I mean, I think that relationship of dependence is really one to drive home here.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So you're saying that you would say to Amazon you can either sell Amazon stuff or you can be a marketplace for all these third-party sellers, but you're not allowed to do both.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 That's right.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 That's a big one.             </p><p>                It's a big one not just because it would mean the government intervening in a big way in this giant business - although, obviously, that is big. It's a big win because, really, we haven't seen antitrust enforcement on this scale in this country for decades.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 And by the way, we did reach out to Amazon, and a spokesperson argued Amazon making its own products means lower prices, better products and more competition. He also noted that private label is a relatively tiny part of Amazon's business. After the break, we talk to our second emperor, and he tells us what he would do about Facebook.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF KENDRICK LAMAR AND SZA SONG, \"ALL THE STARS\")                </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 The second person we're going to talk to today is Scott Hemphill. He's an NYU law professor. He's teaching right now an antitrust course called Big Tech and Standard Oil - perfect for the series that we're working on. And he did want us to mention that he's done some consulting work for a firm that has concerns about Amazon's conduct.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Hemphill has worked in antitrust for a long time. And for most of that time, most people were just not very interested in talking about antitrust.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Was there a moment that you realized other people were perking up and paying attention?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 When it played a role in the last presidential campaign on both sides. It was a plank in the Democratic platform and then-candidate Trump from time to time raised concerns about possible targets for antitrust intervention.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Was it, like, exciting?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 Sure, it was exciting.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 It was exciting.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So, like, what's it like working in - you know, being an antitrust expert now, having this be your field at this...             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 It's cool that people are excited about these issues.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Is there a but there?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 Well, you worry that we'll get it wrong, that we'll get too excited, that we'll pass a new law that does more harm than good, that people will have unrealistic expectations for what antitrust is about and what it can accomplish.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Scott Hemphill describes his antitrust views as middle of the road. He doesn't think the system needs to change as much as Lina Khan thinks the system needs to change.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Here's one difference between the two of them. Khan thinks the consumer welfare standard just fundamentally can't work anymore. Hemphill thinks it can. Remember; consumer welfare is a lot about prices, but companies like Google and Facebook give their product away to people for free. So it seems like under the consumer welfare standard it would be really hard to know what to do about these companies. But...             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 So we say consumer welfare and antitrust is a shorthand for situations where sometimes we don't mean consumers in the sense of individuals.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Consumers can also include companies that buy stuff, like, say, companies that buy ads on Google and Facebook. And if Google and Facebook use their market power to jack up ad prices, that can be a violation of antitrust law under the consumer welfare standard.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Scott Hemphill says generally we are thinking about antitrust in the right way. We don't need to rethink the goal of antitrust. But he is still worried about big tech companies and competition.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 We're going to make you emperor of antitrust now today. What would you do?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 Two major things. Oh - one is...             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Can I - I just want to point out, as soon as you were anointed emperor, you folded your arms in a very sort of noble fashion.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 It was good.             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 I thought a power pose would be helpful answering this question.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 It's good.             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 One place to go is to investigate. Now, this may seem like small stuff. Of course, we want to investigate.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Pretty weak. So...             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 I'm warming up here.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 OK.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 The main thing I'd want to do is to take a hard look at tech mergers that have already been consummated where there may have been an anti-competitive problem at the time.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 So the big idea for Scott Hemphill is mergers. That is the thing that worries him when he thinks about big tech and antitrust.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And specifically, what are some of those mergers?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 So the one that jumps out to me is Facebook-Instagram.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, and Hemphill says as antitrust emperor, he would try to figure out why Facebook did that.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And the why, he says, is important because mergers are not inherently an antitrust problem. He says sometimes there is a totally legit reason for two firms to merge.             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 A classic reason for mergers is if you think one firm can help successfully grow, promote, develop the technology of the other.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So Facebook already has all this data, and it has a great ad sales team or whatever, things that will really benefit Instagram. So Instagram is just going to be a more efficient business. It's going to grow better. That's going to be good for everybody.             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 That's the good news, happy story. Sure. And, you know, it might be right.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Also it might be wrong. The Facebook-Instagram merger might be a bad news, sad story. Here's how that story goes - company's already big and then it starts getting bigger and bigger by buying up other companies. That is a sign that maybe the company is trying to suppress competition, you know, to just buy up its rivals so it doesn't have to compete. That is obviously bad for competition.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Hemphill says as antitrust emperor, he would try to figure out what Facebook was thinking here. Why did it want to buy Instagram? Good news, happy story or bad news, sad story?             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 By the way, I just want to bring Lina Khan back for, like, one second here because she also mentioned the Facebook-Instagram merger as a potential antitrust problem. And she had this really interesting reason why it was bad for competition.             </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Well, let's just think about a real example, which is as revelations about Facebook's lax privacy and security protocols have been becoming clear, you've heard more people say I'm quitting Facebook. I'm just closing this down. At least I have my Instagram account.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>LINA KHAN:                 Right? I think privacy is one good example of a dimension on which consumers should be able to choose, and having more competition could provide that.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So this Facebook-Instagram merger is one place where Lina Khan and Scott Hemphill are pretty close on what they think we should do.             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 What I'm saying is that a transaction motivated at the time by avoidance of competition is a good candidate for divestiture after the fact.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Wait. Is that middle of the road consumer welfare is fine antitrust emperor Scott Hemphill saying after an investigation, depending on the findings, the government should maybe break up one of the biggest companies in the world?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 That's what I'm - that's what I'm thinking about, yes.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 OK.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 OK.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 OK, great. You're about to not be the emperor anymore. Do you have any last wishes?             </p><p>SCOTT HEMPHILL:                 No, no. It's a heavy responsibility to be emperor.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Heavy is the head.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 We did talk to people at Facebook about this whole Instagram thing, and they made the case that both Facebook and Instagram benefited from the merger. They pointed out that Instagram had infrastructure problems and just about 30 million users when they acquired the company. Six years later, there are 1 billion users. They also noted that, quote, \"relevant regulators saw no reason to stop the merger.\" So we talked about Amazon with Lina Khan and Facebook with Scott Hemphill. Now, let's talk about Google for just a minute.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Google is a big one.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 We did a whole episode a couple years ago about Google and antitrust - still online. To find it, just Google \"Google Is Big. Is That bad?\" That was the headline.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 Since then, there's been more antitrust news about Google, specifically a case in the European Union that focused on Android, on Google's operating system for smartphones, which is by far the most popular mobile operating system in the world.             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Google had told phone makers if you want to use Android, you also have to pre-install the Google search app and Google's Chrome browser on your phones. The EU looked into this and last year issued a decision. Quote, \"Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine\" - dot dot dot - \"they have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere.\" The European Union found this illegal under its antitrust rules and fined Google $5 billion. Google said in a statement afterwards, quote, \"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less.\" The company is appealing the ruling.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 So, OK, we have done these three shows on antitrust, and the first two were these historical moments when we went through really big changes as a country in the way we think about, you know, the free market and big business and competition and the role of the government. And now, you know, this episode, we have the present moment, the rise of the tech giants. And, you know, the ending question has to be, is this another moment when we need to once again sort of stop and rethink the way antitrust works?             </p><p>KENNY MALONE:                 Scott Hemphill, pretty middle of the road antitrust lawyer, says no. Maybe we could enforce the current rules better, but the rules themselves, the worldview, is basically working.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 And then there's Lina Khan She is part of this other group of thinkers who are saying antitrust is broken. You know, what the tech giants have shown us is there are these fundamental problems with competition that the current antitrust worldview just is not detecting. And she's saying the government really needs to go back to that pre-Robert Bork era. It needs to intervene more often in the free market in order to make free market competition work.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOOKING TO THE SEA\")                </p><p>IAN COTTERILL:                 (Singing) Looking to the sea.             </p><p>JACOB GOLDSTEIN:                 We know we didn't talk about monopsony.

Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the tech industry - which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world's knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button - has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that's just the beginning of the list.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \"We have a major monopoly problem.\"</p><p>At a moment when nearly everything in the U.S. seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Warren's and Klobuchar's ideas was surprisingly receptive.</p><p>\"We've got to break these guys apart,\" Warren said in an interview on Face the Nation. The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.</p><p>\"A billionaire, right?\" Warren noted.</p><p>For decades, a politician who mentioned \"antitrust\" was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \"Antitrust\" was relegated to the shelf with \"socialism\" and \"higher taxes for higher incomes.\"</p><p>It didn't help that what could be called \"maximum antitrust\" - when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up - has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its case against Microsoft in 2001. Only ATT, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government's point of view.</p><p>The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what's best for the U.S. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cosy relationship.</p><p>\"Something has definitely changed,\" said Geoffrey A. Manne, founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \"Most voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there's also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\"</p><p>Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and ATT, eviscerated Warren's proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post. They wrote that the senator's plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \"platform utilities\" would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak. And yet, Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.</p><p>\"There is a long history in America - just not a recent one - of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\" he said. \"We may be at that moment again.\"</p><p>Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Warren's proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \"The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from big tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019031953816397</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNW-0231-DY91-K4CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the tech industry \u2014 which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world's knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button \u2014 has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that's just the beginning of the list.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \"We have a major monopoly problem.\"</p><p> At a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Warren's and Klobuchar's ideas was surprisingly receptive.</p><p> \"We've got to break these guys apart,\" Warren said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\" The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.</p><p> \"A billionaire, right?\" Warren noted.</p><p> For decades, a politician who mentioned \"antitrust\" was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \"Antitrust\" was relegated to the shelf with \"socialism\" and \"wealth inequality\" and \"higher taxes for higher incomes.\"</p><p> It didn't help that what could be called \"maximum antitrust\" \u2014 when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up \u2014 has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its case against Microsoft in 2001. Only AT&amp;T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government's point of view.</p><p> The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what's best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship.</p><p> \"Something has definitely changed,\" said Geoffrey Manne, founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \"Most voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there's also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\"</p><p> Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&amp;T, eviscerated Warren's proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post. They wrote that the senator's plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \"platform utilities\" would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak.</p><p> And yet, Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.</p><p> \"There is a long history in America \u2014 just not a recent one \u2014 of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\" he said. \"We may be at that moment again.\"</p><p> Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Warren's proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \"The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\" he said.</p><p> But Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies' worries. \"A likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,\" he said. \"Even just the rhetoric can complicate their lives and put pressure going forward.\"</p><p> That is already happening. One of the anticompetitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new service from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge.</p><p>Amazon ended this practice in Europe six years ago, but it continued in the United States. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked for regulators to investigate in December. Amazon confirmed this month that it had dropped the requirement.</p><p> In this new environment, winning can soon look a lot like losing.</p><p>Amazon opposed a proposal in Seattle last spring for a corporate tax to help the homeless and succeeded in getting it cut in half. Then the retailer decided it just couldn't live with the measure at all. A repeal effort began. The City Council killed the tax just as it was going into effect.</p><p> At the time, that looked like another triumph for Amazon. But in the months since, even some of those who thought the tax was a bad idea have found their views evolving.</p><p> \"My feelings about Amazon have changed, and not in a good way,\" said Julie Shapiro, a Seattle University professor of family law. \"I think they want the ability to be a bully and, once they have it, they're quite willing to use it.\"</p><p> That is the crux of the issue: Can a company be dominant without coming off as a bully? It is no accident that the company that was the subject of the biggest antitrust action in the last quarter-century \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 had a terrible reputation in the tech community. Voters love innovation, convenience and entrepreneurs. They don't love bullies.</p><p>Amazon failed to avoid bullying behavior in its now-abandoned bid to build a headquarters in New York, and Facebook likewise failed this month when it took down Warren's posts about Facebook having too much power. The company, which said the posts had violated the use of its logo, quickly restored them, but the public relations damage had been done.</p><p> \"Curious why I think FB has too much power?\" Warren tweeted. \"Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power.\"</p><p> David Streitfeld is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-e0e7b623b61fa4bb1a8d615e26f1bebd19e477c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPS-FK81-JBCN-42FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The agencies, which share civil antitrust enforcement authority, are reportedly engaged in a turf war over investigations of companies operating in the social media, online retail, search engine and app store space. In September, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons reportedly sent a letter to Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim expressing concern about the agencies' interactions. Meanwhile, they both appear to be investigating the same Big Tech companies, contrary to a clearance agreement penned by the agencies in 2002 and, reportedly, a more recent agreement concerning Big Tech. </p><p>What is causing this largely uncharacteristic dispute and what effect will it have on enforcement?The Agency Clearance ProcessAs we discussed in June 2018, because the FTC and DOJ have concurrent civil antitrust jurisdiction, they rely on a clearance agreement to coordinate their authority. The current agreement's Appendix A seeks to prevent disputes by assigning particular industries to each agency. The quasi-independent, consumer-protection-focused FTC generally monitors industries that, as Simons recently put it, 'most directly affect consumers and their wallets.' By contrast, the DOJ, an executive branch law enforcement agency, generally oversees less consumer-facing industries and sectors impacting national defense.Because Appendix A is perfunctory, however, disputes frequently arise where a company targeted for investigation falls between Appendix A's cracks or, more commonly, straddles more than one industry.The clearance agreement lists criteria for resolving these disputes. Emphasizing specialization and conservation of resources, it grants priority to the agency 'with expertise in the product or similar product gained through a substantial antitrust investigation within the last seven years.' The agreement also enumerates a list of tie-breaking factors; for example, an agency gets more 'expertise' credit if a case was litigated to verdict than if it was filed and later settled. While the vast majority of disputes are settled with Appendix A and the tie-breaking criteria, disagreements may also be settled through a neutral evaluator and, ultimately, upon elevation to the FTC chairperson and the assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division of the DOJ.Conflicts Over Investigations Into Big TechThe agencies' turf war over Big Tech suggests they may be struggling to apply the aging clearance agreement to companies and business models that were somewhat embryonic when it was drafted in 2002. For example, social media is not explicitly addressed in the agreement, and there appears to be no obvious analogue to it in Appendix A. Although there are reports that the FTC and DOJ struck a new clearance deal concerning Big Tech, there are bound to be hiccups. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, said last month: 'What's evident from this latest institutional tug of war is that the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC are now actively battling each other to take the lead in pursuing Big Tech.'However, the emergence of Big Tech does not fully explain the discord. This summer, the DOJ and FTC publicly clashed in the FTC's monopolization case against cellular chipmaker Qualcomm\u2014a quarter-century old enterprise whose product seems to fit neatly within Appendix A's framework. The case was filed by a divided FTC commission in the waning days of the Obama administration, alleging the company licensed standard essential patents in an anticompetitive fashion. The district court ruled in the FTC's favor, but, on Qualcomm's appeal, the DOJ filed an amicus brief siding with Qualcomm's request for a stay of the lower court's ruling. It argued: 'Immediate implementation of the remedy could put our nation's security at risk, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests.'More importantly, because the standard for a stay requires a peek at the merits of Qualcomm's appeal, the DOJ found itself in the unusual position of undermining the FTC's case: 'Qualcomm is likely to succeed on the merits because the district court's decision ignores established antitrust principles and imposes an overly broad remedy.' The FTC responded in its opposition brief that the DOJ 'mischaracterized' the district court's analysis, that it offered 'unsubstantiated concerns' about R...and that it essentially asserted that Qualcomm should be immune from antitrust scrutiny.Given the current political emphasis on a variety of real or perceived controversial competition issues, it is no wonder the FTC and DOJ have prioritized investigatory action over fidelity to the clearance process. As Sen. Amy Klobuchar, ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, said in a September hearing, 'I'd rather have a split investigation between the DOJ and FTC than no investigation.' The clearance agreement itself says: 'Each agency nevertheless retains full responsibility and authority for the discharge of its statutory duties.'Finally, as former FTC chairman and architect of the clearance agreement Timothy Muris has pointed out, 'parochial interests' also necessarily play a role in the clearance process. During the ABA's 2004 Antitrust spring meeting, Muris remarked: 'I have talked to you about the clearance issue, and 90% of you were opposed to the resolution that the DOJ and I reached. The reason is you thought your agency, whatever agency you were from, got the worst of the deal. There are three classes of cases: there are the ones that clearly go to the FTC; there are the ones that clearly go to the DOJ; and there are the ones that are in dispute. If you think the ones in dispute belong to your agency, clearly it was a bad deal. That is the overwhelming view of the alumni that I have talked to from both agencies.'September's Senate Antitrust Oversight HearingAs has been widely reported, Big Tech clearance disputes played a role in a Sept. 17 Senate oversight hearing held by the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, which was attended by Simons and Delrahim. In opening remarks, Sen. Mike Lee chastised the agencies: 'In the past, the agencies have avoided too much mischief because they've generally played well together. Recently, this appears quite regrettably to have changed. From what I can tell, clearance disputes have become more frequent, more pronounced and more prolonged.'Lee asked Delrahim and Simons whether the FTC and DOJ were still operating under the 'clearance system to avoid duplicative efforts or have things broken down on this front?' Simons responded, 'for the vast majority of matters, we continue to operate under the existing clearance agreement,' but, upon further questioning, agreed with Lee that 'things have broken down at least in part.' Delrahim added: 'I cannot deny that there are instances where Chairman Simons' and my time is wasted on those types of squabbles.'Lee also quizzed the agency heads whether, hypothetically, if they were asked to provide 'advice on setting up an antitrust regime in another country that didn't already have one, would you under any circumstances recommend that they follow the U.S. model and that they have two separate agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement?' Simons responded flatly: 'No, I wouldn't.' Delrahim remarked, 'it would be hard to imagine a system being designed at the first instance like we have today.' He conceded: 'It's not the best model of efficiency.'The Hazards of Clearance DisputesDisputes over clearance can have tangible adverse effects on enforcement. First, some have commented that delays caused by clearance disputes can narrow the efficacy of remedial options, particularly with mergers. As Sen. Richard Blumenthal has commented, 'The Big Tech companies are not waiting for the agencies to finish their cases. They are structuring their companies so that you can't unscramble the egg.' Structural remedies are favored by Delrahim, who has commented that alternative, behavioral remedies should be used sparingly: 'The division has a strong preference for structural remedies over behavioral ones. The Antitrust Division is a law enforcer and, even where regulation is appropriate, it is not equipped to be the ongoing regulator.'Second, disputes over clearance and, more so, duplicative investigations waste agency resources, threaten to blunt their effectiveness and can lead to inconsistent and confusing governmental positions. In the Sept. 17 oversight hearing, Simons and Delrahim were both criticized for requesting an increase in funding: 'As you both acknowledged, both of you could use, and desperately need, more resources. That being the case, it makes no sense to me that we should have duplication of effort, when that has a tendency inevitably to undermine the effectiveness of what you're doing.' Duplicative investigations dilute the specialization that is a principle goal of the agencies' clearance agreement and raise the risk that one agency will take legal positions that undercut the other. No doubt the DOJ's amicus brief in the Qualcomm case influenced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's decision to issue a stay pending appeal.So how will the FTC and DOJ resolve their latest turf war? Perhaps they will revisit their clearance agreement and decide to split their authority by company or the business practice being investigated, based on prior agency experience, rather than by industry as Appendix A currently does. Or maybe Congress will decide to consolidate civil antitrust enforcement jurisdiction under one agency. That seems like a long shot considering the political implications. However, during the Senate's antitrust oversight hearing, Sen. Josh Hawley proposed 'cleaning up the overlap in jurisdiction by removing it from one agency' and 'clearly designating enforcement authority to one agency.' One thing is sure\u2014the agencies should not be duplicating civil antitrust investigations. Stay tuned. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111570644056109251761300244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7D-YTK1-JCMN-Y11H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1752\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

However, some have questioned whether the current antitrust laws are adequate. There has even been some discussion regarding amending the antitrust laws to address such conduct.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The DOJ and others have suggested that a template for applying antitrust law to technology firms is the 2001 decision by the DC Court of Appeals in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United States v. Microsoft Corp.</emphasis> To consider whether this case is adequate to address the conduct of Big Tech, it would be worthwhile to explore this decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The DOJ's case against Microsoft focused principally on Microsoft's conduct to unseat Netscape Navigator as the preeminent Internet browser.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among various legal theories, the government charged Microsoft with monopolizing the market for Intelcompatible PC operating systems in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Of course, just having a monopoly is not unlawful. Indeed, the antitrust laws encourage companies to obtain a monopoly through innovation and business acumen. Such encouragement includes rewarding market winners by permitting them to charge monopoly prices and obtain monopoly profits. The theory is that monopoly profits will attract new entrants to compete in the market, ultimately reducing prices to competitive levels.</p><p>In this regard, the offense of monopolization requires two elements: (1) a monopoly in a relevant market and (2) exclusionary conduct. The exclusionary conduct, however, must reduce social welfare by improperly harming rivals so as to maintain the defendant's monopoly not by competition on the merits but by anti-competitive actions.</p><p>Before considering the court's analysis and conclusions, it is necessary to consider how Microsoft's conduct to unseat Netscape Navigator threatened Microsoft's monopoly in operating systems. Operating systems accomplish many functions, including allocating computer memory and controlling peripherals. Operating systems also function as platforms for software applications. They make available to software developers routines or protocols that perform widely used functions, such as drawing a box on a screen. These are known as Application Programming Interfaces, or \"APIs.\" Software developers wishing to include a function in an application need not duplicate it in their own code but instead use the operating system's API. Operating systems usually contain thousands of APIs. Each operating system will have different APIs. Accordingly, a developer that writes an application for one operating system and wishes to sell the application to users of another operating system must modify the application to the other operating system. This process is both time consuming and expensive.</p><p>\"Middleware\" refers to software products that have their own APIs. Developers could begin to rely upon APIs in middleware for basic routines rather than relying on the APIs from the operating system. Ultimately, if developers could write applications relying exclusively on APIs in middleware, their applications could run on any operating system on which the middleware was also present. Netscape Navigator was a middleware product written for multiple operating systems. Widespread use of Netscape Navigator would thus threaten Microsoft's Windows operating system.</p><p>Monopoly power is the ability to profitably raise prices above competitive levels. Direct evidence of monopoly power is only rarely available. Consequently, courts typically examine market structure to infer monopoly power. This involves defining a relevant market, determining the market shares of participants in such market and confirming whether there are barriers to entry.</p><p>In terms of defining the relevant market, the court noted that, because the ability of consumers to turn to other suppliers restrains a firm from raising prices above competitive levels, the relevant market must include all products reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes. In this case, the court defined the relevant market as Intel-compatible PC operating systems. It found that there were no products that customers would substitute for Microsoft's operating systems currently or in the near future without incurring substantial costs. In that regard, the court rejected as substitutes non-Intelcompatible operating systems and non-PC-based competitors such as handheld devices and portal websites that host server-based software applications.</p><p>The court also rejected inclusion of middleware from the relevant market even though Microsoft was accused of exclusionary conduct directed at middleware. The court found that middleware products were nascent competitors not sufficiently developed to be able to constrain monopoly pricing in the reasonably foreseeable future.</p><p>The court found that Microsoft had 95 percent of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems.</p><p>The court also identified as a barrier to entry what it described as the \"applications barrier.\" It stemmed from two characteristics of the software market: (1) most consumers prefer operating systems for which a large number of applications are written; and (2) most application developers want to create applications for operating systems with a large customer base. The court rejected Microsoft's arguments that developers who write applications for other operating systems and consumers use only a small percentage of the applications written. The court concluded that, even if these facts were true, the applications barrier still gave consumers reason to prefer the dominant operating system. This created a \"chicken-and-egg\" situation, making it difficult for another operating system to enter the market.</p><p>The most challenging aspect of any monopolization claim is the exclusionary conduct. It is often difficult to distinguish between unlawful exclusionary conduct and lawful conduct that impacts rivals due to competition on the merits. The reason is that the result may be the same. The inefficient rival may be driven from the market.</p><p>To address this dilemma, the court of appeals developed a burden-shifting approach. The plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of an anti-competitive effect. The burden then shifts to the defendant to proffer a plausible pro-competitive justification. If it does, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to establish that the justification is pretextual in that it is not applicable to the facts of the case, or it is not cognizable under the antitrust laws. If the defendant's proffered pro-competitive justification is unrebutted, then the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of persuasion to establish that the anti-competitive effects outweigh the pro-competitive benefits.</p><p>The DOJ challenged several actions by Microsoft as violations of Section 2. Microsoft's conduct with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) regarding desktop icons, folders or \"Start\" menu entries illustrates the analysis necessary to find an antitrust violation.</p><p>Microsoft licensed its operating system software to OEMs. These licenses prohibited the OEMs from removing desktop icons, folders, or Start menu entries. The court found that such restrictions had an anti-competitive effect because they thwarted the distribution of a rival browser by preventing OEMs from removing visible means of user access to Microsoft's browser. The court found that OEMs could not practically install a second browser in addition to Microsoft's browser because doing so would significantly increase an OEM's support costs. The redundancy could lead to confusion among users who would then contact the OEM's help desk. The court found that having an OEM pre-install a browser was one of the most cost-effective methods of distributing browser software.</p><p>In terms of Microsoft's justification for the restrictions, Microsoft argued that the restrictions were justified because it was simply exercising its rights as the holder of valid copyrights. The court held that such an argument bordered upon the frivolous. The court stated that such argument was no more correct than the proposition that use of one's personal property, such as a baseball bat, cannot give rise to tort liability. Microsoft, however, asserted that a copyright holder might limit a licensee's ability to engage in significant and deleterious alterations of a work. Microsoft also argued that the license restrictions merely prevented OEMs from taking actions that would reduce substantially the value of Microsoft's copyrighted work.</p><p>The court found that neither justification, even if legally appropriate, was applicable to the license restrictions regarding the removal of icons, folders, or Start menu entries. Consequently, having found an anti-competitive effect and no proper pro-competitive justification, the court held that the DOJ had established a violation of Section 2.</p><p>As Congress and others debate the application of antitrust to Big Tech, it is helpful to understand the historical precedents. The Court of Appeals 2001 decision in the DOJ's case against Microsoft is an important part of that precedent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXCNSL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXCNSL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4J-5PT1-DYRW-V1WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383406</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nienhouse Media, Inc.

My research focuses primarily on the intersection of law and technology, including issues related to data privacy and antitrust. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to submit a statement regarding the potential need for and effect of a government intervention, via antitrust, into various digital spaces; and what the potential consequences of such an intervention might be, particularly with regards to privacy concerns.</p><p><br/>In this statement for the record, I will focus on three key points:<br/>The dynamic nature of the technology industry makes it difficult to utilize traditional antitrust tools.<br/>The focus for antitrust should remain on consumer welfare.<br/>There is no guarantee that breaking up technology giants would resolve other technology-related concerns, such as issues surrounding data privacy, and it might even exacerbate these concerns.<br/>Difficulties in Applying Traditional Antitrust in a Highly Dynamic Industry<br/>Technology is a highly dynamic industry, and it is often difficult to define the market and competitors for many of the largest and most successful companies. Just over a decade ago, headlines expressed concerns about MySpace\u2019s natural monopoly, how Yahoo won the search wars, and what to do about the potential walled gardens and lack of interoperability of AOL Instant Messenger. However, not only did competitors emerge to challenge these once seemingly invincible giants, new and different technologies changed the nature of the very markets in which they were competing. This dynamism can make it difficult to determine the relevant market when determining if a firm is a monopoly. As Geoffrey Manne and Alec Stapp point out, antitrust regulation takes a static view of the competition in the industry and can fail to anticipate the dynamic changes and innovations that change the nature of the markets and competition.<br/>Competition in many of these markets comes not only from new entrants, but from the emergence of new options that change the entire nature of the market. Antitrust can be focused only on the immediate situation, and by the time a case concludes, the dynamics of the industry may have changed substantially. As the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Ryan Young writes, \u201cMarkets are ongoing-long-term processes but antitrust cases are often short-term reactions to temporary situations\u2014even if they sometimes last so long as to outlive the problem they seek to address.\u201d For example, as my colleague Adam Thierer and I discussed, the 13-year-long case against IBM failed to foresee the emergence of new competitors via the personal computing revolution that occurred by the case\u2019s end, and the 11-year-long Microsoft case missed the emergence of today\u2019s search engines, social media, and mobile-based internet. These days few are concerned about competition in long-distance service, not only because of the breakup of AT&amp;T; via antitrust, but because of the innovations that changed the market for communications like cell phones and the internet.<br/>Such dynamic changes can occur in any field, but they seem particularly at issue when considering \u201cBig Tech.\u201d The pace of adoption of new technologies only seems to be increasing, so the market that exists for today\u2019s technology giants might look entirely different within a short time frame, owing to innovative changes as well as new entrants. In an earlier era, it was easier to determine potentially harmful monopolies in stable, established sectors; however, in the case of many of the information technologies, this determination would be more difficult.<br/>This is not to say that antitrust may never be an appropriate tool. Rather, in a rapidly changing field, market definition is difficult, and innovation may change the nature competition. In one survey, fewer than 16 percent of American consumers responded that they thought today\u2019s online giants could not be replaced by a better competitor. Some evidence indicates that individuals may already be looking for new options. For example, in a Pew Research survey of teenagers, 35 percent of respondents reported that Snapchat was the platform they use most often.<br/>Regulators and policymakers should carefully consider when antitrust is a necessary intervention and when innovation may provide a better solution for both entrepreneurs and consumers.<br/>Consumer Harm and Antitrust in the Digital Market<br/>Another key element of antitrust enforcement has been its focus on anticompetitive behavior\u2019s harm to consumers. While some practices are considered so inherently anticompetitive that they have been deemed per se violations, the current approach to antitrust enforcement mostly applies the consumer welfare standard rather than a more subjective measure that focuses on non-price-based metrics, such as a general opposition to the mere size of a large company.<br/>Prior to greater acceptance of the consumer welfare standard, a more discretion-based approach focused on the \u201crule of reason\u201d that created some uncertainty about what would be considered a violation as policy climates and judges viewed certain practices differently. Proponents of this approach express greater concern about the effect on other competitors than on the consumers themselves and are more likely to express concerns about bigness itself. However, as my Mercatus colleague Andrea O\u2019Sullivan points out in her analysis of contemporary calls to return to a more policy-focused standard, research indicates that the relationship between concentration and dynamism or competition is more complex than it may initially appear. A shift away from the consumer welfare standard focuses on a narrow view of what competition should look like rather than examining the effect on consumers of these behaviors.<br/>One benefit of the consumer welfare standard is its ability to provide more certainty while also adapting to technological changes and an increasingly global market. As the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation\u2019s Joe Kennedy argues, the consumer welfare standard is able to handle antitrust concerns about potential anticompetitive behavior such as manipulating search results to favor one\u2019s own services over a competitor\u2019s or leveraging monopoly power in specific defined relevant markets such as advertising.<br/>The adaptability of the objective consumer welfare standard includes the ability to handle questions regarding today\u2019s services offered free of charge to consumers by many tech companies. Under the consumer welfare standard, it is difficult to see where consumers are harmed by large tech companies, and consumers may even benefit from the current model for providing services. As Adam Thierer and I wrote, in order to resolve some of the concerns about these free services, a company would have to raise its prices and restrict its output, diminishing the benefits and value consumers find in its free-for-use service. Similarly, Andrea O\u2019Sullivan points out that shifting away from a consumer welfare standard could lead to keeping prices high and benefit interest groups rather than consumers. That is not to say harm could never occur for a free-of-charge service but that antitrust should continue to focus on the potential harm to consumer welfare rather than an amorphous set of policy concerns.<br/>The consumer welfare standard remains a balanced and objective approach that can respond to potentially anticompetitive behaviors while retaining the benefits for consumers and certainty for companies. It remains objective while adapting to today\u2019s digital age.<br/>The Importance of Using the Appropriate Policy Tool to Address Concerns<br/>Often conversations about antitrust and \u201cBig Tech\u201d are part of a larger \u201ctechlash\u201d conversation with a litany of complaints and concerns\u2014from data privacy and fake news to alleged political bias and \u201caddiction.\u201d Antitrust is a powerful tool, but when it comes to today\u2019s technology giants, it could be more of a sledgehammer than a scalpel. Concerns about data privacy, fake news, or online content will need a more targeted approach than antitrust would provide.<br/>Not only could a breakup of such companies fail to address these concerns, in some cases, the fractured entities might actually exacerbate the problems. For example, as Tyler Cowen argues, the currently integrated companies are able to keep certain elements less ad driven or more privacy centric because they are able to rely on the revenue earnings of the main company as a whole.Smaller entities would no longer be able to rely on such cross-subsidization and might need to pursue those same disfavored advertising or data behaviors themselves.<br/>Similarly, there is no guarantee that the smaller entities would be any better at content moderation or addressing other concerns than the current players would. In order to ensure effectiveness, the firewalls between these new separate entities would have to be strictly maintained, likely leading to increased concerns about walled gardens and interoperability. As Adam Thierer and I have discussed, this would require companies to forgo new services or capabilities that consumers want and increase costs to consumers through both direct and indirect costs such as increased search costs to find the same information or tools. At the same time, such a proposal would also require burdensome regulatory requirements that may or may not actually improve competition and consumer welfare.<br/>Policymakers should look for ways of educating and empowering consumers to make choices that reflect their own preferences for data usage and technology rather than assuming that breaking up today\u2019s tech companies will address data privacy and other technological concerns. Policymakers should consider a targeted approach by looking at existing tools for targeted enforcement and focusing on those areas of agreed-upon harm or failure when developing new tools. Antitrust is a powerful tool, but it is not a silver bullet for a plethora of policy concerns. As such, it should be used for its intended purpose of preventing anticompetitive behaviors that harm consumers rather than for resolving concerns such as data privacy, to which it is an ill-fitted tool.<br/>Conclusion<br/>America is a leader in many technologies, including the internet, in part because of the permissionless policy framework that created low barriers to entry and allowed entrepreneurs to find unique ways to serve consumers. Technology continues to evolve and change in a dynamic fashion. Sometimes the best competition comes from unexpected sources that change the nature of the market and topple once seemingly unstoppable giants. With this in mind, while antitrust laws do serve a purpose when it comes to consumer protection and competition in the free market, the focus should remain on consumer welfare rather than seeing antitrust as a way to address a variety of policy concerns for which it is ill-suited.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-75005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBV-M9R1-DY1R-B3FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Which in turn would amount to a structural separation of Facebook's social empire.<br/>That said, there's still some mileage left in the legal process - which will likely delay any enforcement for months more at least. But the federal court has put the train back on the tracks.<br/>As we've reported previously, the intervention by Germany's antitrust regulator is seen as highly innovative as it joins the dots of EU privacy rights and competition law. So this case is being closely watched by regulators around the world.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Quick recap: Last year Germany's Federal Cartel Office ordered Facebook to stop combining data on users across its different services after determining that its zero opt-out T&amp;Cs combined with Facebook's dominant market position in the social network space to make its pervasive people-profiling an \"exploitative abuse\".<br/>The order originated with an investigation by the Bundeskartellamt (FCO) into Facebook's data-gathering practices, which kicked off in March 2016. Almost exactly three years later the regulator concluded it had identified abuse - and issued the order banning Facebook from combining data on users across its own suite of social platforms without first obtaining their consent.<br/>Instead of agreeing to offer users a choice over how they're tracked, Facebook appealed - and, last August, the Higher Regional Court in Dusseldorf granted it a suspension, delaying application of the order - and seemingly derailing the chance for an innovative regulatory intervention against a rights hostile 'track and target' adtech business model.\u00a0<br/>All was not lost though, as the FCO appealed the suspension - leading to the today's fresh legal twist. In the decision, the German Federal Court of Justice provisionally confirms the FCO's allegation of an abuse of a dominate position by Facebook - opening the door to the regulator being able to enforce the ban.<br/>So it's game (back) on for the antitrust case against platform giants whose dominance stems from mass surveillance of Internet users.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>In a statement, FCO president Andreas Mundt welcomed the decision.<br/>\"I am pleased about the decision by the Federal Court of Justice,\" he said. \"Data are an essential factor for economic strength and a decisive criterion in assessing online market power. The court's decision provides important information on how we should deal with the issue of data and competition in the future. Whenever data are collected and used in an unlawful way, it must be possible to intervene under antitrust law to avoid an abuse of market power.\"<br/>We've also reached out to Facebook for comment.<br/>The Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court has still not issued a ruling on Facebook's original appeal against the FCO order - though it granted the company's request for a suspension, saying it had doubts about the legality of the order.<br/>But the Federal Court of Justice has overturned that earlier decision.\u00a0And not just overturned it - it's blasted it with a legal equivalent of a blowtorch.<br/>In a press release today (in German, which we've translated using Google Translate) the court writes [emphasis ours]: \"There are no serious doubts about Facebook's dominant position in the German market for social networks or that Facebook is abusing this dominant position with the terms of use prohibited by the Cartel Office.\"<br/>The court takes issue with Facebook's terms and condition - finding them \"abusive\" because it says users are not offered a choice over the extent of the company's tracking and targeting of them; with the court pointing out there's no option for users to have Facebook's content \"personalization\" based only on the data they reveal on Facebook.com. Instead Facebook forces users to accept what it calls \"a more intensive personalization of the user experience\", which the court further notes is \"associated with a potentially unlimited access to characteristics of their 'off-Facebook' Internet use by Facebook\".<br/>Which doesn't sound, y'know, proportionate.<br/>In additional remarks, the court writes that Facebook's super profiling of Internet users has negative impacts on people's personal autonomy - infringing their rights, not only under EU data protection law, but it asserts this also represents an antitrust abuse as a consequence of how Facebook is exploiting its dominant position in the market for social networks.<br/>Or, as it put it in the press release: \"The lack of choice for\u00a0Facebook users not only affects their personal autonomy and the protection of their right to informational self-determination, which is also protected by the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation]. Against the background of the high hurdles to change that exist for the users of the network (\"lock-in effects\"), it also represents an exploitation of the users that is relevant under antitrust law, because competition is no longer effective due to Facebook's dominant position.\"<br/>The court also points to findings by the FCO that significant numbers of Facebook users want to be able to hand over less personal information to use its service - noting that if thriving competition existed in the social network market there may well be a more privacy-friendly offer from Facebook. Instead, you get none.<br/>In another interesting observation, the court said Facebook's access to \"a significantly larger database\" - i.e. via its super profiling of users - reinforces what are already \"pronounced\" network effects keeping a lid on competition in the social media market. So a double negative.<br/>Additionally, it suggests Facebook's super profiling helps the company amass larger ad revenues - which it notes \"also depend on the scope and quality of the data available\". \"Finally, due to the negative effects on competition for advertising contracts, an impairment of the market for online advertising cannot be ruled out,\" it adds in another shot across Zuckerberg's bow.<br/>Commenting on the decision, Rupprecht Podszun, a chair for civil law, German and European competition law at Heinrich Heine University, called it \"a spectacular success\" for the FCO and an \"important step forward\" in regulating Internet giants whose empires are based on this type of rights-hostile profiling.\u00a0<br/>\"The decision is a spectacular success for the competition watchdog, and an important signal for competition on the internet. The proceedings against Facebook are regarded worldwide as a pioneering case: The FCO is attempting to tame the tech giants and to stop the build-up of economic power through integration of data to 'super profiles'. This is something new in terms of antitrust law. Exploitation of users through data aggregation, as the FCO has accused Facebook of doing, has so far been uncharted territory,\" he told TechCrunch.\u00a0<br/>\"The Federal Supreme Court said it has 'no serious doubts' that Facebook is market-dominant and abuses its market power. The court is even stricter than the competition authority: It does not require a protection of privacy laws (as in the General Data Protection Regulation), but it says that freedom of choice and autonomy of users is key in such cases. This is an important step forward -- making the users' self-determination a benchmark for competition on the internet.\"<br/>\"The FCO can now demand from Facebook to submit a plan within four months how to stop the merging of data into so-called 'super profiles',\" Podszun added. \"Facebook merges data from the group's own services such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram with other data collected on the net via so-called Facebook Business Tools. This was the Bundeskartellamt's central point of attack.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The professor remains critical of the pace of regulatory progress - dubbing it \"almost a bad joke\" for this latest twist of the legal saga to be couched an 'interim proceeding'.<br/>He also cautions against expecting any swift break-up of Facebook's data mining and mingling to follow, noting there are other legal avenues for the lawyered-up company to pursue - meaning it could be months or even years more before there's any enforcement of the FCO order.<br/>\"This is particularly problematic because economic power in digital markets consolidates extremely quickly,\" Podszun added, calling for reform of competition law so it can effectively respond to digital gatekeepers.<br/>\"The proceedings therefore show that there must be changes in the way dominance of gatekeeper companies on the Internet is dealt with. The competition authorities must be able to act more effectively and more quickly in such cases. This is where the German and European legislators are called upon to act. Plans are being developed on the national and the European level. The reasoning in the Facebook case will be a boost to competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager in her fight against these companies, too.\"<br/>The sedate pace of regional competition law vs the blistering speed of digital business has long led to calls for competition law reform - a topic that's now front of mind for EU lawmakers.<br/>After Facebook's first successful appeal of the FCO order, Podszun suggested a number of changes were needed to update EU competition law for the platform era. One of which - to evolve traditional market definitions to allow for interventions in digital markets to prevent tipping - is being actively consulted on by the Commission which is now considering whether regulators need a new tool to combat that.\u00a0<br/>It is also looking at applying ex ante regulation to so called 'gatekeepers' - aka platforms which have gained significant market power - as another step to try to ensure 'fair functioning' of digital markets.<br/>Speaking during an Atlantic Council discussion today, Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager - who both leads digital policy for the bloc and heads up its antitrust division - signalled, in her usual roundabout way, that digitally driven competition reform is indeed coming.<br/>\"We have an intense debate about competition enforcement in the digital era [and] we need to change for the times we're in because the market dynamics are different, they are faster, you have marginal prices approaching zero, you have network effects, you have the data-driven economy. So of course we need to change with the times that we're in,\" she said. \"But we will not negotiate and we will not compromise on this being built on the rule of law and the responsibility for the courts in order to make sure that we have equal treatment between businesses.\"<br/>Asked whether she'd like the power to rescind merger approvals - with the moderator citing the case of Facebook reversing a prior commitment to EU regulators who approved its acquisition of WhatsApp (that it would never combine user data between its eponymous service and the messaging app, before going on to do just that; and subsequently being\u00a0fined $122M) - she responded that that is \"a very specific situation\", before noting that EU regulators performed a competition analysis at the time - looking at whether, if Facebook did merge data between the services, would it be a \"competition problem\" or not?<br/>\"Back then they found that no that would not be the case. So in that respect... on substance this would not be a case for unscrambling 'the eggs'. And it is indeed very difficult to unscramble the eggs,\" she said, reiterating a long expressed reluctance to regulate big tech by forcing a break up of consolidated empires. Though she has previously expressed support for the idea of applying controls on platforms' data access as a market intervention.<br/>Vestager also conceded that the third component of EU antitrust decisions - \"how to make competition come back?\" - remains a \"work in progress\".<br/>\"Of course we haven't seen the effect of the Android preference menu because very few Android phones have been shipped due to the COVID crisis,\" she said on that, referring to a major EU antitrust decision against Google. \"But it remains to be seen if, when Google is preinstalled after the untying and other services can be chosen, will that work?
