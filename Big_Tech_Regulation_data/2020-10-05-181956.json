Threats to privacy and free speech grow daily. Government surveillance is legion. Big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook dominate the cyber world. Pushing back and raising legal challenges since 1990, the San Francisco based Electronic Frontier Foundation is often in the middle of the fray. The organization's mission statement: \"to make sure that technology supports freedom, justice and innovation for all the people of the world.\"\u00a0 This news organization recently talked to EFF's Executive Director Cindy Cohn, about the constant challenges of protecting digital freedoms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: How do you balance freedom and protection?\u00a0</p><p>A: We have three major tools in our tool box, law, advocacy and technology. We have a bunch of lawyers on staff, that's our biggest team, and we (file) impact litigation. We make smart commentary and make sure your rights go with you when you go online. We do policy analysis and freedom of information act work. Our advocacy team makes that work relatable for ordinary people. Specifically, I think our membership is technological people, people who work in, and understand, technology. We have a really strong core with the people who build the tools.</p><p>Q: What are some of EFF's technological achievements?</p><p>A: \"We have a tool called Privacy Badger for Firefox and Chrome that blocks third party cookies, those little pesky cookies that track you as you are going from website to website. Privacy Badger helps put you back in control of those. On the back end, we are part of a large group that built what's called a certificate authority. Certificate authorities are the ways that when you think you are going to your bank online, you know you are actually going to your bank online. We felt the web was very unsecure because people weren't using this technology. Sometimes you advocate for people to make their websites more secure, sometimes you just build them a tool to just make it dead easy and free.\"</p><p>Q: What do you do on the legal front?</p><p>A: On the legal side we do a lot of work defending coders, defending technologists. Especially in the realm of security, we find a lot of the people who are pointing out that our security is weak are finding themselves on the back end of legal threats and problems. We know that the way to get to a more secure digital world is to have a whole lot of people trying to find the holes and helping us plug them. We have a long standing relationship with the digital security community, especially the folks who are independent.</p><p>Q:\u00a0 Recently, the private equity firm Ethos Capital bought the dot-org domain designated for nonprofits from the Internet Society and is planning to monetize it. How important is the dot-org domain?</p><p>Anyone who is watching what is happening with private equity in other sectors ought to be nervous. The central place for the public interest internet is dot-org. There is a strong and thriving public interest internet that really brings us a lot of the things that I think make the internet cool and weird and funky and awesome, from Wikipedia to the Internet Archives to the website for your favorite museum to the Red Cross.</p><p>Q: What's the threat?</p><p>A: We're going to see increased prices, and probably going to see degradation of service. Dot-orgs never go down. If there's an earthquake or a hurricane and you go to the Red Cross, RedCross.org is up. If you're in a country where there is civil unrest and you need to get information out, HumanRights.org is up.</p><p>Q: What is EFF doing on this front?</p><p>A: We've stepped in to try to save dot-org. ICANN's (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) contracts with the Internet Society can be cancelled if the Internet Society wants to materially change how dot-org runs. Our first step is to try to get ICANN to put the brakes on (the purchase of the dot-org domain) and make sure who ever runs dot-org is doing it in the public interest. Silicon Valley is full of people who understand this situation and have a stake in it and they need to make their voices heard.</p><p>Q: The California Consumer Privacy Act, the toughest online protection law in the country takes effect Jan. 1. What is EFF doing to make sure it isn't weakened?</p><p>A: We have been very involved in both trying to protect that law, trying to shore it up, trying to get comments in to the Attorney General about what the regulations ought to look like. There will be ongoing efforts by the big tech companies to water down the legislation (which, among other safety measures, allows consumers to learn what data companies collect about them). Some of the threats (to the new law) will happen in California, but some of them will happen in the form of federal laws that preempt stronger state laws. It's really like four dimensional chess about privacy legislation and we're trying to participate in as many of those levels as possible.</p><p>Cindy Cohn</p><p>Title: Executive Director the Electronic Frontier Foundation since 2015</p><p>Education: B.A. in English, the University of Iowa, J.D.

The practice is becoming so large that the U.S. Senate is planning to pass a bill[1] to control its use, which can lead to addiction[2] in some extreme cases.According to Bhav Chohan[3], VP and Global Head of Design at intive[4], it is wrong to lump all UX design into the same bracket. Many companies are using User Experience (UX) design to encourage beneficial behaviors such as healthy app usage, nudging users to choose eco-friendly solutions or reduce distracted driving and so on. To discover more, Digital Journal spoke with Bhav Chohan. </p><p>Digital Journal: What is dark pattern design? Bhav Chohan: Dark pattern design harnesses the power of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) techniques with the purpose of being intentionally coercive. Through the combination of strategic visual design and persuasive micro-copy, users can be steered to make unintentional purchases, give consent to invasive privacy settings, or simply spend longer using the application than intended.  Once the reserve of magicians and hustlers, phrases such as 'misdirection' and 'bait and switch' are now commonly discussed on design forums as developers debate where customer-centric design stops and business-orientated tactics begins. These techniques are often so well disguised that users have no clue that their decisions have already been preordained by the business. This is why it's so important to raise awareness of the most common tricks being employed. DJ: Why is the US Senate passing a bill to control use? Chohan: The U.S senate is looking to tighten the reins on big web platform holders with 'over 100 million active users,' like Facebook, Google and Amazon. The act, which was dubbed 'The Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction Act,' would make it illegal for companies to 'design, modify, or manipulate a user interface with the purpose or substantial effect of obscuring, subverting, or impairing user autonomy, decision making, or choice to obtain consent or user data.'  The platforms offered by big tech have become essential parts of our lives as consumers, making the prospect of boycotting them highly unlikely for the majority of us. That's where government regulation comes in: The power that big tech wields could spiral unless it is kept under a close eye, and we need to make sure that these companies serve our best interests.  DJ: Is there any evidence that dark pattern design can cause addiction? Chohan: Causing addiction by dark pattern design is certainly a bold statement. Dark pattern design is more likely to fuel addiction: Social media platforms often deploy tools to encourage their users to endlessly scroll and stay active in the app/on the website, with even simple features such as an endless newsfeed (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) or the suggested video path of YouTube contributing to this. And it's not just on social media that we see addictive dark pattern design. Many video games build easy-to-spend models that hook players without them realizing it. There is even now a name for players that spend so much money on video game app extras - 'whales' - that actually provide most of the revenue of these gaming companies. DJ: Why do we find certain patterns so appealing? Chohan: When we get a notification from social media or go up a level on a certain game, we get a hit of dopamine in a similar way that we would after taking drugs. This fuels the appeal of dark pattern design, and it also plays a role in habit formation and addiction. That dopamine hit we get when we check social media keeps us going back and checking for another like or comment. The design of platforms that use dark pattern design is often straightforward and user-friendly, but also very visually appealing with bright colors, drawing users' attention to certain actions. The color red is often used to indicate unread notifications, giving users a sense of urgency to check it and respond. DJ: Are there examples of firms using UX to coerce positive behaviours?  Chohan: Of course, we shouldn't lump all UX design into the same bracket. Many companies are doing quite the opposite and harnessing the power of UX to encourage healthy behaviors or conscious consumerism, nudging users to choose eco-friendly solutions or reduce distracted driving to mention a few. DJ: What is it that makes UX 'Good' or 'Bad'? Chohan: The intent of the company or developer behind it. If the intent is to encourage negative behavior or mislead the user into agreeing to something unknowingly then it is pretty clear that the design is meant to benefit the company and not the end-user. However, more conscious UX can actually deter users from using certain tools for too long and encourage responsible use. Contrary to spurring on the release of dopamine, examples of responsible UX might cause the release of the 'happy' neurotransmitter, serotonin. If an app has made the user feel calm, content, or like they are progressing towards a positive goal, serotonin is released, as it accompanies moments filled with intention and mindfulness. For example, meditation apps like Headspace would fall into this bracket. DJ: What can tech companies and users do to achieve a better balance in the future?\"  Chohan: Tech companies can increasingly adopt features that help their users get their technology use under control where it needs to. For example, Apple and Instagram, have already implemented 'screen time' features within their software. Being straightforward and providing users with clear tools to monitor and control their usage goes a long way to improve balance. However, as every aspect of our lives become digitized and we look to a future of smart cities and hyper-connected IoT fuelled lives, an abundance of new challenges presents itself to designers. It falls on design teams to facilitate greater dialogue with policy makers and challenge others on unethical practices that may influence negatively or cause risk or harm. As the quantified self and proliferation of data driven fingerprints of our lives, protecting trust and baking in principles that afford individual and societal gains and inclusivity is essential. For design teams this also means building in diverse perspectives through balanced worldly teams that intrinsically bring alternative experiences and viewpoints which can build robustness to areas of ethical, social or legal influence.

In short: technology has caused humanity to worsen, and Harris wants to help fix it.</p><p>Harris recently spoke to the Associated Press about his work, the tech industry's progress so far, and why all hope is not lost. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p>Q: Could you tell us the important ideas of your work?</p><p>This isn't about addiction, it's not about time. It's about what we call \"human downgrading.\" It's a phrase that we came up with to describe something we don't think people are acknowledging as a connected system.</p><p>Technology is causing a set of seemingly disconnected things -shortening of attention spans, polarization, outrage-ification of culture, mass narcissism, election engineering, addiction to technology. These seem like separate problems, and we're actually saying that these are all predictable consequences of a race between technology companies to figure out how to scoop attention out of your brain.</p><p>Q: Where is the central place to fight this multifaceted problem that you've outlined?</p><p>A: Much like you say, \"How do you solve climate change?\" Do you just get people to turn off their light bulbs? No. Do you pass some policy? Yes. But is that enough? No. Do you have to work collaboratively with the oil companies to change what they're doing? Yes.

In it, he argued that many tech products were designed to be addictive, causing people to spend too much time on them and distracting them from living their lives. He urged designers to alter their approach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Harris spent more than two years pushing change within Google, but says he couldn't get traction. So he quit and started a movement called Time Well Spent, which eventually pushed companies such as Apple and Google to build screen time usage metrics and tools into their phones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> He has since widened his focus, having decided that many issues facing society today are actually connected and can be traced, at least partly, to the design of technologies we use every day.</p><p> The goal of his organization, the Center for Humane Technology, is to reverse human \"downgrading,\" or the idea that technology is shortening our attention spans, pushing people toward more extreme views and making it harder to find common ground. In short: technology has caused humanity to worsen, and Harris wants to help fix it.</p><p> Harris recently spoke to the Associated Press about his work, the tech industry's progress so far, and why all hope is not lost. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p> Q: Could you tell us the important ideas of your work?</p><p> This isn't about addiction, it's not about time. It's about what we call \"human downgrading.\" It's a phrase that we came up with to describe something we don't think people are acknowledging as a connected system.</p><p> Technology is causing a set of seemingly disconnected things \u2014shortening of attention spans, polarization, outrage-ification of culture, mass narcissism, election engineering, addiction to technology. These seem like separate problems, and we're actually saying that these are all predictable consequences of a race between technology companies to figure out how to scoop attention out of your brain.</p><p> Q: Where is the central place to fight this multifaceted problem that you've outlined?</p><p> A: Much like you say, \"How do you solve climate change?\" Do you just get people to turn off their light bulbs? No. Do you pass some policy? Yes. But is that enough? No. Do you have to work collaboratively with the oil companies to change what they're doing? Yes. Do you have to pass laws and mandates and bans?</p><p> You have to do all these things. You have to have a mass cultural awareness. You have to have everybody wake up.</p><p> This is like the social climate change of culture. So working on internal advocacy and having people on the inside of tech companies feel, frankly, guilty, and ask, \"what is my legacy in this thing that's happening to society?\"</p><p> We work on the internal advocacy. We work on public pressure and policy.</p><p> Q: How do you work with companies, and how are they taking to your vision?</p><p> A: Doing it from the inside didn't do anything when the cultural catch-up wasn't there. But now in a world post-Cambridge Analytica, post the success of Time Well Spent, post more whistleblowers coming out and talking about the problem, we do have conversations with people on the inside who I think begrudgingly accept or respect this perspective.</p><p> I think that there might be some frustration from some of the people who are at the YouTubes and Facebooks of the world whose business models are completely against the things we're advocating for. But we've also gotten Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Apple and Android to launch Time Well Spent features through some kind of advocacy with them.</p><p> Q: Is there a path that you try to help map out for these companies?</p><p> A: They're not going to do it voluntarily. But with lots of outside pressure, shareholder activism, a public that realizes they've been lied to by the companies, that all starts to change.</p><p> There are multiple business models \u2014 subscription is one.</p><p> Would you pay $8 a month to a Facebook that didn't have any interest in manipulating your brain, basically making you as vulnerable as possible to advertisers, who are their true customers? I think people might pay for that.</p><p> So our policy agenda is to make the current business model more expensive and to make the alternatives less expensive.</p><p> Q: Washington is now in a huge debate about privacy and data and misinformation. Will that process deal with the causes that you care about by default?</p><p> A: I actually worry that we're so mindlessly following the herd on privacy and data being the principle concerns when the actual things that are affecting the felt sense of your life and where your time goes, where your attention goes, where democracy goes, where teen mental health goes, where outrage goes. Those things are so much more consequential to the outcomes of elections and what culture looks like.</p><p> Those issues connected together have to be named as an impact area of technology. There has to be regulation that addresses that.</p><p> My concern about how the policy debate is going is everyone is just angry at Big Tech. And that's not actually productive, because it's not just the bigness that is the problem. We have to name that the business model is the problem.</p><p> Q: Don't people have individual agency? Are we really in the thrall of tech companies and their software?</p><p> A: There's this view that we should have more self-control or that people are responsible for whatever they see.</p><p> That hides an asymmetry of power. Like when you think, \"I'm going to go to Facebook just to look at this one post from a friend,\" and then you find yourself scrolling for two hours.</p><p> In that moment, Facebook wakes up a voodoo doll-like version of you in a supercomputer. The voodoo doll of you is based on all the clicks you've ever made, all the likes you've ever done, all the things you've ever watched. The idea is that as this becomes a better and more accurate model of you, I know you better than you know yourself.</p><p> We always borrow this from E. O. Wilson, the sociobiologist: the problem of humans is that we have Paleolithic brains, medieval institutions and godlike technology. Our medieval institutions can only stay in control of what's happening at a slow clock rate of every four years. Our primitive brains are getting hijacked and are super primitive compared to godlike tech.</p><p> Q: Do you feel there's awareness (within tech companies) that you wouldn't have thought existed two years ago?</p><p> A: There has been a sea change. For four years, I was watching how no one was really accepting or working on or addressing any of these issues. And then suddenly in the last two years \u2014 because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, because of \"60 Minutes,\" because of Roger McNamee's book \"Zucked.\" I would have never suspected that Chris Hughes, the co-founder of Facebook, would be saying it's time to break up Facebook.</p><p> I've seen an enormous amount of change in the last three years and I can only bank on the fact that the clip at which things are starting to change is accelerating. I just want to give you hope that I would have never expected so much to start changing that is now changing. And we just need that pressure to continue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOK-71cf13a299cfd3fdc065ac8ea048fd8bd4fcfef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28974E9D92ED57 NWBKOK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSV-H7B1-DXVP-V50S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401975</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Alva Review-Courier<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In short: technology has caused humanity to worsen, and Harris wants to help fix it.</p><p>Harris recently spoke to the Associated Press about his work, the tech industry's progress so far, and why all hope is not lost. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p>Q: Could you tell us the important ideas of your work?</p><p>This isn't about addiction, it's not about time. It's about what we call \"human downgrading.\" It's a phrase that we came up with to describe something we don't think people are acknowledging as a connected system.</p><p>Technology is causing a set of seemingly disconnected things -shortening of attention spans, polarization, outrage-ification of culture, mass narcissism, election engineering, addiction to technology. These seem like separate problems, and we're actually saying that these are all predictable consequences of a race between technology companies to figure out how to scoop attention out of your brain.</p><p>Q: Where is the central place to fight this multifaceted problem that you've outlined?</p><p>A: Much like you say, \"How do you solve climate change?\" Do you just get people to turn off their light bulbs? No. Do you pass some policy? Yes. But is that enough? No. Do you have to work collaboratively with the oil companies to change what they're doing? Yes. Do you have to pass laws and mandates and bans?</p><p>You have to do all these things. You have to have a mass cultural awareness. You have to have everybody wake up.</p><p>This is like the social climate change of culture. So working on internal advocacy and having people on the inside of tech companies feel, frankly, guilty, and ask, \"what is my legacy in this thing that's happening to society?\"</p><p>We work on the internal advocacy. We work on public pressure and policy.</p><p>Q: How do you work with companies, and how are they taking to your vision?</p><p>A: Doing it from the inside didn't do anything when the cultural catch-up wasn't there. But now in a world post-Cambridge Analytica, post the success of Time Well Spent, post more whistleblowers coming out and talking about the problem, we do have conversations with people on the inside who I think begrudgingly accept or respect this perspective.</p><p>I think that there might be some frustration from some of the people who are at the YouTubes and Facebooks of the world whose business models are completely against the things we're advocating for.

In his new book, From Gutenberg to Google: The History of Our Future, the former telecom lobbyist compares the process to other big shifts in communication technology throughout history.</p><p>Wheeler spoke with Adweek about the path forward for net neutrality, how his hopes of spurring tech regulation backfired and why the Pacific Telegraph Act of 1862 is still relevant today.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>Adweek: You started writing your book before your tenure at the FCC. What has been the biggest change in its direction since holding that job?Tom Wheeler: I think probably there were two: One was the thesis I was working on pre-FCC was how the nature of networks had moved from a centralizing force to a distributed force, and economic activity was following that force outward to the edge of the network, which indeed it certainly has. What I didn\u2019t see at that point in time before the FCC and I certainly did see at the FCC was how the distributed network would create virtual centralization, and the ability to collect information on users and centralize, for instance, virtually in order to provide to sell services was something I think I had not seen.</p><p>Point two was how do you deal with that? And I said in From Gutenberg to Google that it\u2019s never a primary network that is transformational but its secondary effects [i.e., the tech giants that operate on top of internet networks], and we saw that in history. And then what I tried to talk about based on my experience at the FCC in the second half of the book was a series of those secondary effects.</p><p>This is not, as the Trump FCC has tried to characterize it, a matter of some kind of contract relationship between an ISP and its users. This is a matter of basic concepts about how essential networks will operate. The Pacific Telegraph Act of 1862\u2014just shortly after the development of the telegraph\u2014had a section that said there had to be nondiscriminatory access to the network. In 1862, with the telegraph, there was net neutrality. And then of course that concept extended to the telephone, and somehow, this fiction has occurred where because what it transmitted is digital that somehow it makes it different because the telephone network had been analog\u2014no, it doesn\u2019t make it different.</p><p>Was there any similar political debate at the time?No, to the best of my research, with the Pacific Telegraph Act, it was kind of, \u2018Of course we want to make sure there\u2019s first come, first served nondiscriminatory access.\u2019</p><p>Are you hopeful net neutrality will eventually be solidified into law?I\u2019m hopeful on two fronts: One is the Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit. I was in the courtroom when what was scheduled to be an hour of oral arguments on the Trump FCC\u2019s repeal of net neutrality extended into four and a half hours of oral argument because the judges were very interested. So, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that they see how the Trump FCC did not make a fact-based decision and therefore did not follow the Administrative Procedure Act. And then I\u2019m also encouraged by what the Democrats are doing in Congress.</p><p>What do you think of recent calls from various lawmakers for more regulation of big tech?I think that the concepts that we were promoting at the FCC, which basically boiled down to a duty to deal\u2014what net neutrality was\u2014and a duty of care\u2014basically, what our privacy rules were\u2014ought to apply across the board, whether you are a network company or a company that rides on the network.</p><p>The reality that we faced at the FCC was that we only had jurisdiction over the networks, and I just felt that that\u2019s not a reason to wash our hands. Interestingly enough, I had hoped that we would build a model approach for networks, and then maybe the networks will turn around and say to the government that this is the same kind of rule that ought to apply to the edge providers [companies that provide online content and services like Facebook and Google]. Instead, they went to the edge providers and said, \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t want this rule to apply to you so let\u2019s work together to kill it.\u2019 And they got Congress to repeal the privacy rules, and they got the FCC to repeal the open internet rules.</p><p>Based on your historical perspective, where are we in that time line as compared to other shifts in information technology?Clearly, history tells us that the pioneers always make the rules. Their rules hold until those practices begin to infringe on the rights of others and the public interest. I think that where we are right now is we are identifying the fact that the rules thus far have been made by the digital companies, and it\u2019s starting to have an impact on the public interest and the representatives of the public therefore need to step forward and make new rules.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1032014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP1-GVK1-JC8H-T3MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Szoke, President/CEO of ID Global Solutions (OTCBB:IDGS[2]). The company's core focus is in fraud management and payment solutions. Thomas explains his company's mission and gives insight as to where he sees the market is headed and how his company plans to establish a dominant role in this space.&lt;nl/&gt; Interview:&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> Q: Investorideas.com&lt;nl/&gt; For investors that don't know your company can you give them an overview of IDGS, your various divisions and your products and services portfolio in mobile payments and fraud protection?&lt;nl/&gt; A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO&lt;nl/&gt; IDGS provides multi-functional secure payment solutions for open and closed electronic payment transaction networks. The company is focused on the growing need for fraud protection and identity verification solutions. ID Global Solutions was founded to pioneer key innovative approaches for the development, integration, and delivery of advanced digital identification and payment solutions.&lt;nl/&gt; Fraud Management and Payment Solutions are the two focus areas for IDGS. Within Fraud Management, the company offers unique Identity Verification solutions for Financial Services Organizations (IDComplete) and Governments (IDSolutions). IDComplete provides a secure real-time method for cardholder verification to eliminate fraud. IDGS' IDSolutions portfolio offers software and hardware products to deliver a wide variety of identification and verification capabilities for civilian as well as governmental applications.&lt;nl/&gt; Our Payment Solutions portfolio includes MultiPay, OnePay, and PaySpot. MultiPay provides end-to-end payment transaction processing technology. OnePay is a closed payment solution using a secure digital currency enabled by our mobile applications and backend systems for consumers and merchants in emerging markets. PaySpot is an unattended multi-functional payment collection and processing kiosk solution.&lt;nl/&gt; Q: Investorideas.com&lt;nl/&gt; Can you explain IDComplete's impact on the payment process, the issuing bank, and ultimately how the consumer is impacted to eliminate fraudulent transactions?&lt;nl/&gt; A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO&lt;nl/&gt; IDComplete aligns to all industry standards. IDComplete does not impact existing players or processes within the acquiring network external to the issuing bank. Today, prior to a transaction being authorized, issuing banks determine the approval of the transaction based primarily on the account status of the cardholder. There are other criteria employed by issuers to determine fraud that are predictive in nature including buyer behavior pattern, location, merchant type, and the transaction amount.&lt;nl/&gt; IDComplete compliments these by providing real-time cardholder verification. This is done in parallel to the issuer authorizing the transaction based on cardholder status. IDComplete is triggered to deliver a notification to a registered mobile phone to approve or deny an active transaction. Within the notification is the date, merchant's name, and the transaction amount along with the option to \"approve\" or \"decline\" the transaction through a proprietary secure pin delivery method.&lt;nl/&gt; Q: Investorideas.com&lt;nl/&gt; A lot of the big tech giants are entering the mobile payment and credit card and identity fraud protection space such as Apple, Samsung, and Google. Everyone has a different approach with levels of security in biometrics and other security measures so what differentiates your company's technology and how can you compete?&lt;nl/&gt; A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO&lt;nl/&gt; Our solution has been built to eliminate card fraud. IDComplete is the only product in the market that provides real-time verification of identity in a proactive manner. All existing fraud prevention approaches in the market are re-active and do not prevent card fraud in real-time. For example, sending a SMS or push notification after a transaction is complete asking the cardholder to contact the issuer in the event of fraud is re-active. Today, cardholders are put into a position to reconcile their transactions whereas IDComplete offers the ability for the cardholder to police their transactions by embedding cardholder verification in real-time prior to any transactions being processed.&lt;nl/&gt; Q: Investorideas.com&lt;nl/&gt; As someone in the sector, can you give us some insight and perspective as to where you see card fraud trends heading both in the US and globally? And on that note, where is your primary focus geographically?&lt;nl/&gt; A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO&lt;nl/&gt; As a backdrop, global card fraud exceeded $16 Billion in 2014, which analysts forecast to exceed $35 Billion globally by 2020. In 2014, approximately $8 Billion of card fraud loss occurred in the USA and half of $8 Billion card fraud occurred during card not present (CNP) / online purchases. This equates to more than $4 Billion of collective loss to issuers, cardholders, and merchants.&lt;nl/&gt; IDGS's geographic focus is to roll out our IDComplete solution for eliminating card fraud in the US market. Our initial strategy is to focus on the card not present (CNP) / online purchases because they are not being addressed by the implementation of the new EMV standards.&lt;nl/&gt; Q: Investorideas.com&lt;nl/&gt; You recently announced a deal with MultiPay SAS, which is headquartered in Bogota, Colombia (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.multipay.com.co/\">http://www.multipay.com.co/</url>).

Szoke, President/CEO of ID Global Solutions. The company's core focus is in fraud management and payment solutions. Thomas explains his company's mission and gives insight as to where he sees the market is headed and how his company plans to establish a dominant role in this space.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interview:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: Investorideas.com</p><p>For investors that don't know your company can you give them an overview of IDGS, your various divisions and your products and services portfolio in mobile payments and fraud protection?</p><p>A: Thomas R.

The company is focused on the growing need for fraud protection and identity verification solutions.

Within Fraud Management, the company offers unique Identity Verification solutions for Financial Services Organizations (IDComplete) and Governments (IDSolutions). IDComplete provides a secure real-time method for cardholder verification to eliminate fraud. IDGS' IDSolutions portfolio offers software and hardware products to deliver a wide variety of identification and verification capabilities for civilian as well as governmental applications.</p><p>Our Payment Solutions portfolio includes MultiPay, OnePay, and PaySpot. MultiPay provides end-to-end payment transaction processing technology. OnePay is a closed payment solution using a secure digital currency enabled by our mobile applications and backend systems for consumers and merchants in emerging markets. PaySpot is an unattended multi-functional payment collection and processing kiosk solution.</p><p>Q: Investorideas.com</p><p>Can you explain IDComplete's impact on the payment process, the issuing bank, and ultimately how the consumer is impacted to eliminate fraudulent transactions?</p><p>A: Thomas R.

Szoke, President/CEO of ID Global Solutions (OTCBB: IDGS). The company's core focus is in fraud management and payment solutions. Thomas explains his company's mission and gives insight as to where he sees the market is headed and how his company plans to establish a dominant role in this space.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interview:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: Investorideas.com </p><p>For investors that don't know your company can you give them an overview of IDGS, your various divisions and your products and services portfolio in mobile payments and fraud protection?</p><p>A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO</p><p>IDGS provides multi-functional secure payment solutions for open and closed electronic payment transaction networks. The company is focused on the growing need for fraud protection and identity verification solutions. ID Global Solutions was founded to pioneer key innovative approaches for the development, integration, and delivery of advanced digital identification and payment solutions.</p><p>Fraud Management and Payment Solutions are the two focus areas for IDGS. Within Fraud Management, the company offers unique Identity Verification solutions for Financial Services Organizations (IDComplete) and Governments (IDSolutions). IDComplete provides a secure real-time method for cardholder verification to eliminate fraud. IDGS' IDSolutions portfolio offers software and hardware products to deliver a wide variety of identification and verification capabilities for civilian as well as governmental applications.</p><p>Our Payment Solutions portfolio includes MultiPay, OnePay, and PaySpot. MultiPay provides end-to-end payment transaction processing technology. OnePay is a closed payment solution using a secure digital currency enabled by our mobile applications and backend systems for consumers and merchants in emerging markets. PaySpot is an unattended multi-functional payment collection and processing kiosk solution.</p><p>Q: Investorideas.com </p><p>Can you explain IDComplete's impact on the payment process, the issuing bank, and ultimately how the consumer is impacted to eliminate fraudulent transactions?</p><p>A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO</p><p>IDComplete aligns to all industry standards. IDComplete does not impact existing players or processes within the acquiring network external to the issuing bank. Today, prior to a transaction being authorized, issuing banks determine the approval of the transaction based primarily on the account status of the cardholder. There are other criteria employed by issuers to determine fraud that are predictive in nature including buyer behavior pattern, location, merchant type, and the transaction amount.</p><p>IDComplete compliments these by providing real-time cardholder verification. This is done in parallel to the issuer authorizing the transaction based on cardholder status. IDComplete is triggered to deliver a notification to a registered mobile phone to approve or deny an active transaction. Within the notification is the date, merchant's name, and the transaction amount along with the option to \"approve\" or \"decline\" the transaction through a proprietary secure pin delivery method.</p><p>Q: Investorideas.com</p><p>A lot of the big tech giants are entering the mobile payment and credit card and identity fraud protection space such as Apple, Samsung, and Google. Everyone has a different approach with levels of security in biometrics and other security measures so what differentiates your company's technology and how can you compete?</p><p>A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO</p><p>Our solution has been built to eliminate card fraud. IDComplete is the only product in the market that provides real-time verification of identity in a proactive manner. All existing fraud prevention approaches in the market are re-active and do not prevent card fraud in real-time. For example, sending a SMS or push notification after a transaction is complete asking the cardholder to contact the issuer in the event of fraud is re-active. Today, cardholders are put into a position to reconcile their transactions whereas IDComplete offers the ability for the cardholder to police their transactions by embedding cardholder verification in real-time prior to any transactions being processed.</p><p>Q: Investorideas.com </p><p>As someone in the sector, can you give us some insight and perspective as to where you see card fraud trends heading both in the US and globally? And on that note, where is your primary focus geographically?</p><p>A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO</p><p>As a backdrop, global card fraud exceeded $16 Billion in 2014, which analysts forecast to exceed $35 Billion globally by 2020. In 2014, approximately $8 Billion of card fraud loss occurred in the USA and half of $8 Billion card fraud occurred during card not present (CNP) / online purchases. This equates to more than $4 Billion of collective loss to issuers, cardholders, and merchants.</p><p>IDGS's geographic focus is to roll out our IDComplete solution for eliminating card fraud in the US market. Our initial strategy is to focus on the card not present (CNP) / online purchases because they are not being addressed by the implementation of the new EMV standards.</p><p>Q: Investorideas.com </p><p>You recently announced a deal with MultiPay SAS, which is headquartered in Bogota, Colombia (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.multipay.com.co/\">http://www.multipay.com.co/</url>). Can you give us a brief background for new investors and an update on the progress of the company?</p><p>A: Thomas R. Szoke - President/CEO</p><p>Multi-pay S.A.S. is a well-established multi-functional payment gateway company providing traditional credit card processing services, domestic and international wire transfer services, mobile operator pre-paid account re-charge services, and various closed system payment solutions for numerous customers in Colombia and Peru. Since the acquisition the company has been integrated into the IDGS structure and has expanded its core engineering and delivery teams to increase the capabilities of our platform and deliver more services to new and existing customers. In addition, since the acquisition the company has secured additional contracts with banks and enterprise customers for money transfer and payment processing services.</p><p>About ID Global Solutions Corporation (OTCBB: IDGS) - Fraud Management and Payment Solutions</p><p>IDGS provides multi-functional secure payment solutions for open and closed electronic payment transaction networks.

I'm Fran Van Reyk. I'm the Head of Investor Relations for Qantas, and I'd like to wish you a warm welcome to the Mascot Campus and Qantas' 2019 Investor Day. And to those of you who've chosen to join us via the webcast, a warm welcome to you, too.</p><p>Before we get started, because many of you are unfamiliar with the campus, I'd like to play a video that outlines the safety and evacuation procedures.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: I'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, I pay my respects to their elders past and present.</p><p>Before we get started today, a couple of housekeeping items. First of all, as I said, the event is being webcast and recorded. So please be aware that your image may be captured and transmitted. To those in the room, feel free to connect to our guest Wi-Fi. You would have received the details when you registered this morning. We have a couple of bathrooms on this level, just to the left of myself. And there are others throughout the campus. Just ask one of our graduate team members who are wearing gray polos today, so you'll be easy to identify them for directions to other bathrooms if you need them. And they can help you with any other questions you might have.</p><p>Finally, can I ask you to set your phones to silent for the courtesy of all of the presenters and others in the room. We have a fantastic day prepared for you, including a taste of the customer experience that Qantas is famous for. There are 3 presentation sessions in total, with Q&amp;A at the end of each of those sessions. I'd ask that you keep your questions until the end of each session, so we can keep things moving.</p><p>So our first presenters today are Alan Joyce, the Qantas Group CEO; followed by Andrew Parker; Vanessa Hudson and Rob Marcolina. To kick us off, Alan will set out the global context in which we operate, and he'll take you through our strategy to build on our sustainable competitive advantages.</p><p>Alan, please come up to get us started.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE, CEO, MD &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Thanks, Fran. Can I also acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. I pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging. I'm afraid you've -- I've got the triple whammy today. Not only have I got an (inaudible) to cope with, I speak fast, but I also have a head cold. So we were joking, we probably need close captions for this phase of it. But since I'm only giving the summary of what you're going to hear, you're going to get the details from everybody else a little bit later, which means you get a second chance or hearing what I've said.</p><p>I will start off by talking a little bit about this week. Qantas reached its 99th birthday on Saturday and having flown for that length of time, the business has adapted and changed its model, changed its approach. It's gotten its business to adapt to the situation over those decades in a quite an amazing way. And it has built up over that time, some sustainable and competitive advantages that we think are quite unique in this marketplace and give us an advantage compared to any other airline group, certainly in this market, and we think close to what's the best practice in the world of aviation.</p><p>We also -- when you look at aviation and how it's changed over that period of time, technology and the forefront of use of technology has been a big driver in giving sustainable advantage. And we're going to talk a lot about that today because you'll see how technology is also shaping all parts of our business more so than it has done at any time in the past. Of course, one of the most important things that is the focus of every discussion we have in the business is around the safety of the business. And safety for us is our #1 priority. It is part of the DNA of this company for those 99 years. If you go back to the start of that history, it was a core part of what our founders wanted in the creation of this business. And it's something that we always have to be focused on, and it's something that we try to encourage in our business to always be uncomfortable about. In fact, what we do on the safety side of this business is what I think I've been trying to replicate on the business side, never getting complacent, never getting to a stage where you assume that you're automatically the best in everything that you do. And 20 years ago, we had a very bad accident where an aircraft, a 747, ran off the runway in Bangkok, the QF1. Over 30 people were injured, and I think complacency had set into our business at the stage. And we looked in and saw that as a wake-up call and we changed a lot of what we did in the cockpit, a lot of what we did in the safety management system, and we put in place something that I think is best practice around the globe.</p><p>We also don't see safety as a competitive advantage. We have a safety conference that we do once a year. We invite our competitors into that safety conference because, for us, we want the entire industry to continue its amazing journey of continuous safety improvement. And that for us, I think, is more important than anything else that this industry does.</p><p>It's also changing landscape because in the last 5 years, I think more so than ever in our history, there's been a real focus on cyber -- security in cyber and safety online, protecting the data and protecting the information and protecting the systems that we have. And what we've done over the last few years, and we'll talk a little bit about this when we go through some of the investments that we've made, we've spent a lot of money making sure that the same safety and security focus we have in operations also apply to the cyber world. And I think we -- I hope are one of the leading companies in that space as well.</p><p>Now the aviation industry, the first flight, as you know, took place in 1903 with the Wright Brothers. The first commercial flight took place 11 years later in 1914. We've had 100 years of aviation operating commercially. And for that first 100 years, the aviation industry did not cover its cost of capital. That is a terrible statistic. But the good news is in the last 5 years, the aviation industry as a whole has covered its cost of capital. I think Warren Buffett said back in the 1980s that there should have been a farsighted capitalist at Kitty Hawk and killed Wright Brothers before they destroyed all that value. But in the last 5 years, he's invested extremely heavy in the aviation industry, knowing it has turned that corner.</p><p>And this year is probably still going to be one of the best years in aviation overall. The business has gone to make $28 billion, slightly down on last year at $30 billion. But it does vary dramatically between the different regions around the world. Over half the profitability is being made in North America with $15 billion of that profits. And what we take from the North American market is some of the capacity, discipline, the structure of the market with 4 players having 80% market share that is a (inaudible) consolidation. Decent returns to be made, which have been beneficial to consumers and customers up there because the American Airlines are now investing for the first time in a long time in product and services.</p><p>What's also interesting in Europe, there are pockets of where there are good profits to be made, and a big learning for us is particularly what IAG have done in their home strength of their markets in the U.K. with British Airways and in Ireland, with Aer Lingus, in particular, which have given them significantly good returns in a very competitive market. What also we've seen in Europe is that there has been a large creation of a large number of airlines that have, through the difficult periods we've seen in the last couple of years for higher oil price, have disappeared from the market because they've not been viable in that region.</p><p>What's also interesting in those stats is what difficulties the Middle Eastern carriers are going through. This is the second year in a row that we've seen over $1 billion worth of losses in the Middle East. And what we've seen as a consequence of that is the importance of the Qantas and Emirates partnership within that context. And you'll see a little bit later Tino talking about the benefits that both carriers get from that arrangement in that region. And I suppose the big takeaways from this is the benefits and the growth that we're seeing in the Asia Pacific region. We have a big advantage of where we're located. In our region, the profitability has taken a bit of a hit at this year. And when you think that the Qantas Group makes around 10% of that $6 billion profitability in the Asia Pacific region but less than 0.5% and of the population of the regions based here in Australia, this shows you how well the group is performing in a very high-growth region and a region that has a huge amount of potential for the future. And we will be spending a bit of time today, particularly in Gareth's presentation in talking about how we're going to take advantage of the growth in traffic that's likely to take place in Asia Pacific.</p><p>In fact, if you look at our projection on 2037, the Asia Pacific market will be bigger than the North American market and the European market put together. And we're already seeing huge growth in the region and with 17 of the top 20 routes in the world being based in Asia Pacific. And in fact, Qantas is the largest player on 2 of the top 20 routes. The second largest route in the world, Melbourne-Sydney and the 12th largest route in the world, Sydney-Brisbane. And with the population of those cities also growing, it is a very big growth opportunity for us domestic as well.</p><p>Now a couple of years ago, we talked about the global forces, the megatrends that we believe are going to shape our business into the future. Some of these can be seen as opportunities, some of them can be seen as challenges. Whether they're opportunity or challenges, your strategy and your business needs to be able to cope with them and take advantage of them when appropriate. And the ones that we're going to be talking about a bit today are still the same as a couple of years ago, they are megatrends so they shouldn't change between these investor presentations. But we're going to talk about the new centers of customer demand and political influence, and particularly through what Tino and Gareth are going to cover about the opportunities that we have in this region with that growth.</p><p>We are seeing some volatility, obviously, in the short term. We are seeing slower economic activity because of the trade wars, both internationally and domestically. But we are still seeing very significant growth in this region, not as big as we were expecting a few years ago. And we are seeing some volatility in oil prices and in the Aussie dollar, which Vanessa is going to go through how the business is going to be able to cope with that in the short term.</p><p>We will be talking a lot about digitalization and the opportunities that that creates. We will be talking a lot about the new aircraft technology, both for Jetstar and for Qantas, that changes the range of routes that we can operate and the economics of routes that we can operate, which we think is a big benefit for the business. There is a big change in customer preferences. The rise of generation Y and Z is changing. People's aspirations for the companies they want to work for and for the brands that they want to buy from. So we will be talking about our license to operate, and Andrew Parker will be going through this in quite detail and how important that is for these younger generations. And Rob Marcolina will also be talking about how we cope with the changing skill sets that we need in the future and how we're engaging the workforce of the future to be able to work with us.</p><p>And then finally, but no means least, we'll also be covering off the implications of climate change, particularly what we're doing to minimize our impact on the climate, we're -- we've been working on this for a long time. We have one of the oldest carbon offset programs of any airline on the globe. We have the largest carbon offset programs. But it's not only about carbon, it's about other activities and waste. And Andrew will be taking us through a lot of detail about what we're doing in that space.</p><p>Now I'm going to play a video for you because once we get to our 100th year, which we are in now, we look back, as you do a reflection about what we've achieved and where the company's come from. And what we're seeing is that companies that have a strong purpose, companies that are very clear on that purpose, are companies that outperform the marketplace. And it's been my fundamental belief that Qantas has always had a strong purpose. Sometimes, we haven't defined it as clearly in terms of the statement, but people knew what we represented and knew what we're trying to achieve. So we have a video that goes through our history, goes through what we've done over 100 years, defines the purpose that we've delivered for the Australian economy, the Australian people and for our employees and sets that up as the purpose for the next century. So I'll play the video, we'll go through the strategy there.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: What we do on an ongoing basis, I think that that statement that we take the spirit of Australia further covers just about everything that the company does. Whether it's helping local communities through the bushfires, which Andrew will talk about what we've done in recent times, whether it's through floods, through drought, whether it's through at the activities we do in regional communities like capping airfares or giving regional airfares for those communities or through the democratization of air travel to making air travel easier for a lot of people through the low airfares that Jetstar operates. Or whether it's through projects like Project Sunrise that overcome the tyranny of distance. Everything the company has been involved in, is being involved in and will be involved in fits under that purpose. And I think it's good for our people, good for our shareholders and good for the community, in general, to know that there is a clear purpose for the organization overall.</p><p>In order to deliver on that purpose, in order to lever for all of the stakeholder groups, we believe that it's very important for us to have a sustainable competitive advantage that we can leverage, we can use to continue on delivering. And when you look at where the group is today, there's clearly a number of areas where that sustainable, competitive advantage exists. First of all, it is in the brand. We have 2 amazing brands, probably the most iconic Australian brand. And you could see that with the direct flight that we did last week from London to Sydney. It got unbelievable coverage around the globe. It was there for major scientific reasons. We will get a lot of benefits from a safety point of view well with those flights. But we had the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition, who came to that celebration, and he said the most amazing things about the company and the brand. Why? Because they believe in it. They believe that this brand is iconic, that this brand does represent Australia on the global stage. And with a lot of the activity we do, it actually promotes the most positive things about Australia to the rest of the globe.</p><p>But we also have an amazing brand in Jetstar. It's one of the top brands in Japan, as Gareth will take you through. It's one of the top brands here in Australia. And it's seen for what it delivers every day as value for money and making air travel accessible to the global public. And I think those 2 brands and how they work together as dual brand know-how is a unique competitive advantage that no other airline in the world has.</p><p>And I wouldn't underestimate the dual brand advantage. Andrew David is going to take you through in some detail how we make that work. A lot of airlines out there have tried to create dual brands, a lot of airlines have failed in this space. And Qantas does really well in this domestic market in particular and how it uses both brands at different segments of the market to complement each other.</p><p>We've also had a look at the home strength that we have here in Australia, and the advantages that that creates for us. When I talk to our peers about the fact that 35% of all credit card expenditure in Australia is on a Qantas earning credit card, they're blown away by that stat. When we show that in the domestic market, we have over 60% capacity share that translates into over 80% revenue share and over 80% of the profitability. That home strength is unique, and doesn't exist I think in any other market around the globe. And when we look at the information and the data we have on our customers, the fact that 1 in every 2 households are members of frequent flyer scheme and we can leverage that information to provide product and services that are uniquely designed to our customers also gives us a big advantage. And of course, underpinning all of this is the culture and the people that we have, whether it's the safety culture, the customer service culture, the can-do attitude of our people that really gives us, we think, a competitive advantage in the business. And Vanessa will take you through the strength that we have on our balance sheet and our cash performance, that's the biggest strength we've had in some time that allows us to continue to invest in all of these different areas and stretch our competitive advantage even further compared to those other airlines.</p><p>And we do see this as a virtuous circle. And there are a couple of virtuous circles that are important for us to look at the dynamic associated with them. You'll hear a lot of our people here talking about the interactions with other parts of the businesses. And while we manage the business of P&amp;L, where we have a domestic P&amp;L and international one, and loyalty one, everybody knows that the businesses still interact with each other. And the strength and the performance of the businesses are achieved through leveraging that interaction. So while there is on international leveraging the corporate dealing model that we have where, for domestic passengers, we give the best network by miles domestically and using that to make sure that we have those corporates flying internationally, whether it's leveraging that international, Jetstar, and domestic network to give a proposition to our loyalty customers that gives them access to over 5 million seats each year to redeem their points on that very important family holiday. They are all interlinked and that continuous interaction is where the strength of the group comes from. But it's also important that we look at this business, not only from a shareholder point of view but also from a customer and employee point of view. And we have said now for a long time that the stakeholders in this business are equally important. And you can't, at the expense of delivering for shareholders, forget about your customers and forget about your employees. And we think we have a virtuous circle have been achieved in the business today, with record customer satisfaction just about across every part of our business, leading to record shareholder returns, which also leads back to employee engagement. And our employee engagement every year continues to improve on the previous years. And again, I think we'll talk a little bit about those interactions and how important they are for us.</p><p>What we will go through now as part of the presentations that each of the GMC is going to talk about is how we then look at the global megatrends and the global forces, translate that for us into what is 6 different components and pillars of the strategy and then how we deliver on each of those parts of our strategy. And each of the GMC members will take you through a different part of that strategy in detail with very clear targets over the next 5 years about what we want to achieve and a clear measure of what success looks like.</p><p>So let's talk about them very briefly. And you'll get a lot more detail from each of the GMC members. The first is really about the domestic business. It is the core of the profit engine of the group. We think the sustainable competitive advantage that we have on domestic can continue to be enhanced. We are working quite extensively on our transformation program. And in the next year ahead, there will be a lot more focus on cost than revenue. And over the next 5 years, we believe that there is a path for us to achieve significant improvement in margins.</p><p>We look at the best practice around the globe and we see that full-service airlines are getting to margins in the high teens. So we are and will continue to target that for Qantas Domestic. And low-cost carriers get to margins in the low 20s. I should say, well, they sound like good margins, about half of the profitability that the airports in Australia make. So there's a lot of room for us to continue to enhance margins even above those levels into the future.</p><p>International has been awarded for some shareholders in the past, that international could go back to producing the losses that it did in 2013. We think the international business has been fundamentally transformed. We think the international business has some significant upside still to come. And Tino will take you through the big benefits that we're going to get from replacing the old technology of the 747s with the 78s over the next year, the benefits we're going to get from leveraging the partnerships that we have globally, which 3 of the biggest partnerships we have are all relatively new. They have been put in place over the last few years. And there's still a significant upside, particularly for the American Airlines partnership. And we'll be talking about how this positions us well for Project Sunrise. We will be very clear that we won't do Project Sunrise unless there's a clear business case and a business case purpose to hurdles. But we'll see -- we do see Sunrise as a huge growth opportunity for us in a space where we have a unique competitive advantage, which we believe is very hard for anybody else to replicate.</p><p>Gareth will be taking you through the opportunity within the Asia market, tell you how we pick the routes that we're going to operate. We can fly to so many different destinations, but we could lose a lot of money picking the wrong destinations. So we're going to talk about how we filter the right places to fly, how we identify the right opportunities and how we can get competitive advantage in each of those areas. We also will talk about some of the significant opportunities we have in translating our dual-brand strategy into markets like Japan and how significant that opportunity is for the group going forward. Steph will be taking you through the investment in the customer experience. Again, getting this right across the entire business is going to be key to maintaining that competitive advantage. But we're also going to spend a lot of time today on a number of areas of investment that we've made in the last couple of years on distribution, on personalization and on revenue management. They go hand-in-hand. And we think we are in the lead compared to a lot of airlines around the globe, but in particular, and what we're doing in this home market to enhance our competitive strength in our home territory. And Steph is going to explain what these terms mean, what the investment is delivering and how that opportunity will allow us to achieve the targets across each of the individual businesses.</p><p>Olivia is going to take you through the loyalty program. And in 2017, we made a commitment that this business by 2022 will have earnings between $500 million and $600 million. We're going to show the progress we've made since '17 and what is in the pipeline to get us to that target and reconfirm that target. We believe that there is significant upside still in the loyalty program. It's interesting that our competitors are buying their loyalty programs back at huge cost. We have dodged a bullet by never selling it and never -- we will never sell it because that business is too valuable and too linked in to the other parts of the group. And we want to go through where we think there's upside in the loyalty business over the next few years.</p><p>And as I said, what's going to be really key to getting all of this and achieving all of this is engaging our people to move with us and making sure that we have the workforce that we need for the future. And over the last few years, we've actually hired more [digi] workers than we have pilots or engineers. And the likelihood is that when we project that out over the next 10 years, that's where huge growth for us are. So we will probably have more digi workers, then we'll have pilots or engineers in the business in the next decade. But we still need to make sure that we have the right skills in the right areas. And Rob will take you through how we can deliver on that.</p><p>We did an amazing job I think in 2013, with the $2 billion transformation program. And one of the things we continuously get around the organization is, is this transformation finished? Is transformation over? And what's very clear in our business, and has been clear for the 99-year history, is that transformation never ends. We want to show as part of today, that it is ingrained now as an ongoing program that is going to deliver over $400 million each year. It needs to be that number in order to offset the continuous inflation that we have within the business, but also to offset the continuous advantage that the consumers get with lower airfares. And so again, Rob is going to take us through a lot of detail of what those projects look like, examples of where we're getting leverage with new technology and how we position the company for digital revolution that's taking place going forward.</p><p>So when you bring all this together at the end of the day, and if you look at how we measure success, what that strategy is, we have a simple scorecard of what we think success looks like. And on this scorecard, we say that if that strategy is delivered and implemented successfully, there's no reason why Qantas Domestic shouldn't get to an 18% margin within the next 5 years, Jetstar Domestic to a 22% margin, Qantas International achieving over 10% return on invested capital during that period and Jetstar achieving over 15%, particularly given some of the investments that we're making both in Qantas International and Jetstar International in new aircraft types that we think will be significant to the potential earnings from those businesses. And we're reconfirming our commitment by 2022 that the loyalty program will have between $500 million and $600 million in EBIT earnings over that period of time.</p><p>So hopefully, by the end of the day, in each of the presentations, you can see the road map to this scorecard being achievable. We believe it is achievable. And that will mean that we will have the financial strength still to continue to return significant funds to shareholders, the financial strength to invest in new fleet and new aircraft, the financial strength to invest in customer service and customer experience and the financial strength to continue to return and invest in our people.</p><p>So that's about the outline of today and the outline of where we are. I will wrap up with one other item. And this, to us, is very important, which is our sustainability and our license to operate for the next 100 years. I look at what happened on Friday with the Prime Minister and the leader the opposition there and think of the hard work it's taking Qantas over 100 years to establish this iconic brand, and for people to absolutely being convinced and supportive of that brand. We know we have to be conscious of that every day. We know that going forward for the next 100 years, we need to make sure that we're continuing to invest in that license to operate. And that is typically doing the right thing by people every day. Andrew is going to take you through a lot of details about how we do that, how that's ingrained in the business and how the business comes up with delivering for the Australian public.</p><p>And there was one example I thought I'd wrap up on this, which is how you get this ingrained in a business. I don't know if you remember that the strawberry farmers had that problem with the pins and the strawberries. And usually, in a lot of organizations, you can have the CEO, the senior management saying we do something to help. Somebody in our catering division decided we're going to help the strawberry farmers and ordered tons of strawberries to use in strawberry daiquiris in the lounges and on strawberries on the aircraft to do something that was socially responsible and good for that community. That didn't need a single senior manager to say it. That was just part of us doing day-to-day business. I hope it continues to be ingrained in our business for the next 100 years because it's what's made us pretty special. And I think it is ingrained in our business for that period of time.</p><p>So I'll pass it back to Fran, who will introduce the next speaker. Thank you, Fran.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Alan. I think you've given us a good sense of what's coming up for the rest of the day. Our next presenter is Andrew Parker. He's the group executive of government, industry, international and sustainability. He has extensive international public affairs experience, including with Emirates in Dubai prior to joining Qantas. He was a key architect of the Qantas-Emirates partnership, which those of you who've been following us for quite some time will know how transformational that was for this business. As Alan said, Andrew will focus on how the group is ensuring it maintains its social license to operate. Please come up, Andrew.</p><p>ANDREW PARKER, GROUP EXECUTIVE OF GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY &amp; INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Thanks, Fran. Thanks, Alan. Good morning. It's fair to say that large Australian businesses right now are under significant political and community scrutiny. And with this cynicism and sometimes negative sentiment comes risk, a risk of bad public policy, for example, or brand damage. So the concept of acting responsibly, a social license to operate has really been more important to large businesses and the Qantas Group. We are Australia's most iconic brand, and integral to almost all elements of our economy and the wider community. And as Alan said, to give you some comfort on why we are different to many large businesses in Australia and why you should have, as investors, confidence in our social license, Friday was a really important day. And with the arrival of QF 7879, direct nonstop from London, it was not only an aviation milestone, we thought it was symbolic of the deep and quite rare, bipartisan understanding of our business and the role we play in this country.</p><p>As Alan mentioned, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition both attended. And I just call out 2 themes that they spoke on: Scott Morrison said whenever there was an international or domestic emergency, support from Qantas was a phone call away. He could ring Alan and he could get the resources to extract Australians from Cairo, from Bali, wherever it might be. The leader of the opposition called out the unique social conscience of being a leader environmentally at Qantas. And I quote, \"The work that Qantas is doing on biofuels on having the world's first 0 waste flight and a commitment to 0 emissions by 2050 is showing Australia, that corporate Australia can provide leadership.\" We're not perfect, but we think this does demonstrate that social license, our social license is strongly and deeply embedded in the Australian national psyche and across the political spectrum.</p><p>So as Alan mentioned, there's a few elements of our social license we'd like to cover for you this morning. And they involve and impact all of our stakeholders, our investors, our employees, the community, governments, industry and wider community. And the issues, be they regional Australia investment, connectivity, tourism or climate change often intersect. In the last 2 months, we have now operated over 44 charter services for rural fire services in addition to regular flights and supplying seats at no cost to the community for those firefighters. And we've carried over 2,000 firefighters as part of this exercise. We implemented fare capping and fee waivers in all fire impacted areas. It's what the national carrier does.</p><p>And at the same time, the debate on climate change, on fires, on drought, on changing weather demonstrates how alive the Australian community is to our changing environment, and we believe the urgency and actions required to tackle these risks and our risks.</p><p>The Qantas Group takes the urgent challenge of dealing with climate change very seriously. And we have significant plans we'll touch on today to minimize both our emissions and broader environmental impact. And we believe this is at the core of our social license.</p><p>The Paris target of 2015 of limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees was an important start and step in tackling climate change. It was also instructive for our industry and the establishment of IATA, our global industry bodies, significant plans to cut emissions of which Qantas was a key driver. But the evidence is now emphatic, 2 degrees does not go far enough. We accept strongly that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees must be the new global focus. 1.5 degrees will mean global emissions must be net 0 by 2050, i.e., any CO2 admitted that year must be balanced out by CO2 absorbed in that same year.</p><p>Bolder ambition and more urgent action is necessary and at the heart of the Qantas response. As this chart shows, aviation in red is 2% of global emissions. But it is growing. And as other sectors decarbonize often with easier and more available transitions and technology, aviation risks a higher proportion of emissions and profile unless we respond more decisively. Qantas will be a key voice in our industry's response. And Australia is an island. We don't have a viable or timely alternative to travel between our cities or to other countries, nor do we currently have alternative fuels. And 85% of global emissions are for journeys over 1,500 kilometers. We don't accept Australians should not travel or the world visit our continent. We think we can find a balance between the need and the desire to travel, including growth and to do so on a truly sustainable basis.</p><p>As mentioned, Paris and our aviation agreement, CORSIA, were important beginnings and will achieve a material difference. CORSIA was the first and only global industry mechanism to reduce CO2 by sector. CORSIA will see international emissions capped at 2020 levels. Australia, as well as Qantas, took a leadership position through ICAO, the UN's peak governing body on aviation, and this year, we started monitoring and verifying our baseline emissions. Next year, we and 70 -- and airlines from over 70 countries, representing 85% of international emissions will begin offsetting any growth from international flights during the voluntary phase. And from 2027, all growth from international airline emissions will be offset or reduced through the use of sustainable aviation fuels when it becomes mandatory. But as ever, implementation is the hard part.</p><p>We believe, just as we have industry targets and agreements, we must work together as an industry to deliver. 2 years ago, Qantas helped to form airlines for Australia and New Zealand alongside Jetstar, Virgin, Tiger, Rex and Air New Zealand. And one of its key areas of focus, and more so in the coming years, will be on sustainable aviation fuel. Qantas is keen to take offtake agreements in California and from the U.K., where existing and emerging biofuel production facilities and supply is increasing. But we also want to see an industry developed here in Australia. And that will require collaboration across airlines, researchers, technology partners, fuel companies, investors, governments and airports.</p><p>And as Alan said, we believe we have a first-mover strategic advantage as we enter a more urgent and larger-scale response to climate change. We are not Johnny-come-lately to aviation sustainability. Fly Carbon Neutral, our passengers offsetting program, is now 13 years old and has been the largest program in the world. About 10% of our customers voluntary offset on qantas.com every day. Future Planet, our commercial venture in carbon offsetting, is entering its fifth year. Our newest customer, amongst 30 others, is Australia Post. We partner with the likes of Alliance Bernstein on developing ways for companies to offset emissions, of developing carbon-neutral products and services. And we have deep access, both locally and internationally, to carbon offsetting markets.</p><p>And beyond offsets, last year, we achieved a cut to our water use by 20% and our electricity use by 35%, ahead of our 2020 target. But this is the big news. The Qantas Group has now set the most ambitious carbon emission reduction targets of any airline globally. Announced 10 days ago, we've committed to have 0 net carbon emissions by 2050 and the capping of our net emissions at 2020 levels for all our group airlines. It will not be a linear journey, but we believe we need to meet 1.5 degrees via net 0 emissions by 2050. And we're beginning immediately, matching our customers dollar for dollar every time they offset. And we've announced $50 million to kickstart the local biofuel sector that we mentioned earlier. And it is paying dividends with the federal and state governments and fuel companies and airports seeking to work with us closely on aviation biofuels as a priority.</p><p>Like the many different flight paths you could fly from London to Sydney, there are varied options on how we get to these 2050 targets. First, we've factored in growth. This speaks to what Alan said on the potential of Asia and our own growth ambitions.</p><p>You may have seen that Sweden announced an actual limitation on flying for their citizens through its flight shaming campaign, and this is not just an ambition of that government. It's a stated policy to reduce the amount of flying of Swedes. It is not a vision we share. We think the Swedish government's policy to set targets to reduce the actual flying for their citizens is [myopic]. Concerns about emissions and climate change are real and serious, but we can't lose sight of the contribution that air travel makes to an open, liberal society and growing economies. As Alan famously says, you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Flight shaming and environmental taxes do little to support the industry's transition to a low-carbon future. The industry has already come a long way in reducing its footprint. But the solution from here isn't to fly less, but it is to make flying more sustainable. To achieve this goal, we need to substitute jet fuel with alternatives. Scale to sustainable aviation fuels is urgent but we think achievable. A cost differential of up to 10x compared to JET A-1 fuel is down to twice the cost now for biofuels, and with subsidies in California, it is getting closer to 1:1. We will invest in more large-scale, effective and certifiable carbon offsetting projects here and internationally. Emissions are a global problem. So we will have a portfolio of global projects.</p><p>And finally, technology. The London to Sydney flight that you've heard about last Friday and no doubt read about produced approximately half the emissions of the 1989 747-400 delivery flight from London to Sydney as well. Our delivery flight of the 789s and our ongoing use of 789s now embedded in our fleet are proving to be ultra-efficient. And Jetstar's 320 family of neos will also deliver significant fuel and emission reductions.</p><p>Aircraft manufacturers are designing and beginning to produce hybrid aircraft, a statement that would have seen almost bizarre 5 years ago. Small in size and orders for now, but this is a sign of confidence that there will be a step-change in technology from aircraft manufacturers sooner than we think using batteries, ultra-high bypass ratio turbo fan engines, hydrogen and fuel cells.</p><p>I won't take you through this box of data. But I do want to stress that it is an example of the transparency we know investors want in how we are tackling climate change.</p><p>In 2017, we began aligning our annual reporting to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We are 1 of only 6 airlines in the world to do so. And since then, we've been working to increase the depth of disclosures on climate risk. And this year, we completed the first phase of our climate scenario modeling.</p><p>We are also doing significant amounts of operational assessments as weather changes and impacts our on-time performance. Wind change, both speed and direction, is a clear example with more data, giving us more evidence to work with governments and airports and plan changes to our operations. We're also working with Airservices Australia to continue to improve how delays are handled and how operations can be optimized, reducing the need to circle airports, which is obviously highly inefficient.</p><p>And finally, on sustainability, our passengers and employees are passionate on waste. This little picture here, some of you may have seen before, but it is one of our most-ever liked that was posted on social media. It shows from our first 0 waste flight from Sydney to Adelaide what the normal waste produced from that flight produced and then what the 0 waste flight produced. The small bag looks like a bag of crisps on the left. And even that small bag, went on to be used as a fuel product in a cement kiln.</p><p>We've set the world's most ambitious waste targets of any airline. It is also one of Australia's most ambitious waste reduction programs announced to date. We are eradicating 100 million single-use plastic items by 2020 and a 75% reduction in landfill by 2021. In a couple of months, we would have already removed 16 million items from our operation.</p><p>So to conclude, today, we wanted to share with you our latest and just completed economic modeling on our wider economic contribution to Australia. And this tells the impact and scale of Qantas, of Jetstar, of Loyalty, of QantasLink and all our airlines and businesses to the Australian economy. In 2019, we contributed over $12 billion and 55,000 jobs to our economy or 0.7% of our nation's GDP. And when you consider the federal government's focus on small and medium businesses, we spent over $5 billion on suppliers this year in every state and territory, from small businesses that we've helped grow bigger like Cape Grim Beef in Northern Tasmania to indigenous suppliers like the Dubbo-based Dreamtime Tuka, who supply over 600,000 snacks onboard our aircraft.</p><p>And to shine a light on just one state, Queensland, we contribute over $2.6 billion and 10,000 jobs there every year. This month, Jetstar will launch the Gold Coast to Seoul as a new service. And next year, Qantas will begin launching 2 new direct services to the United States: Brisbane to San Francisco and Brisbane to Chicago. And Toowoomba is the home of our new Qantas Pilot Academy. And just 2 weeks ago, in response to calls from local exporters, we launched direct freighter services on Cairns-Hong Kong. This means far North Queensland businesses like MG Kailis, a tropical rock lobster farmer, now has same-day access to Greater China and North Asian markets.</p><p>And while those numbers are big and demonstrate the importance of our operations to Australia, we do face challenges, in part due to our iconic status. Regional Australia and regional airfares are a case in point. The high cost environment of regional Australia, a network ecosystem that needs to deliver both connectivity and sustainable profitability and a perception that regional airfares are more expensive than reality speak to this complexity.</p><p>2 to 3 years ago, as the mining sector and resources sector bounced back and the drought bit harder, we had to balance these sometimes competing and complex forces. Qantas is adaptable, and our social license to operate [weighting] is evidenced in the decision-making that followed because there were some pricing pain points, especially at peak periods in towns with large mining footprints. We were alive to the community and political sentiment and adjusted our model to ensure that communities, particularly those that were remote, had access to affordable last-minute fares.</p><p>In late 2017, we introduced a discounted fares program for residents that is now being used by over 25,000 passengers with discounts of up to 30%. It covers 16 towns and regional centers in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, where the challenges were the greatest. We also implemented fare caps of around $400 one way for residents in these towns to ensure the retail market was not crowded out by resource traffic or adversely impacted by higher last-minute airfares. And I think the success of the program is its accessibility, its transparency and that it provides measurable benefits for regional residents. And it's sustainable for our business.</p><p>And as the national carrier, when the drought set in, we felt we had a duty to help those communities who were doing it especially tough. That's why we took a leading role in Australia's drought relief effort, and it continues, partnering with Rural Aid and making our own $1 million contribution. And in July this year, with the support of our passengers and their amazing contributions and us matching those contributions, the total has now reached the $3 million goal.</p><p>These funds are being distributed to regions and to farmers around Australia. And we also recently launched the Qantas Regional Grants program, a $5 million effort to support [grassroots] causes. And they add to existing initiatives created to strengthen regional communities, driving local economic activity and stimulating tourism.</p><p>So thank you. I hope this has demonstrated the value and the importance we place on acting responsibly and our social license to operate. And no element of that is more important to us than climate change. Like we do for all risks, we have planned and are implementing a comprehensive approach to manage and to mitigate. Despite highly ambitious goals, and they are, we're optimistic. And we won't shrink from a leadership position on these issues even if that attracts some noise. It's what good businesses do and it's what -- what is expected of a great national carrier like Qantas. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Andrew. And I think I can say for all the employees here at Qantas, we're very proud of what we do. Our next presenter is Vanessa Hudson, our Group CFO. She's had a long career with Qantas, working in a number of commercial, customer and financial roles. As a chartered accountant and with her vast experience across the business, Vanessa brings a broad perspective to the role of CFO. Vanessa will discuss how we are applying the financial framework to deliver long-term shareholder value.</p><p>I'll now hand over to Vanessa.</p><p>VANESSA HUDSON, CFO, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Thanks, Fran. I forgot my water. Good morning, and welcome. And I need to get my technology right. You would all be familiar with our financial framework. This has been in place since 2015, and it has guided our capital allocation decisions as really, we have driven to support our drive in sustainable growth in earnings per share and also to achieve top quartile TSR performance.</p><p>But to give you a quick recap of the financial framework, it consists of 3 pillars. The first pillar is maintaining an optimal capital structure. And this is the net debt settings that enable us to minimize our cost of capital. The second pillar is achieving ROIC returns greater than our weighted average cost of capital. And if we are delivering returns greater than 10%, we are creating value. And we do believe that this is an appropriate benchmark moving forward given the long-term nature of our capital investments. And lastly, disciplined allocation of capital, essentially balancing the needs of reinvesting into our business and providing returns to shareholders.</p><p>And since 2015, we think that this financial framework has served us incredibly well. We have optimized our leverage, and we have reduced our net debt by up to $1 billion. We have invested over $7 billion in our business. That is in our customer experience, transformation, in our growing loyalty business and also and importantly, in our aircraft. We have delivered ROIC returns that are significantly higher than our cost of capital and returned over $4 billion of surplus to shareholders. We have more -- we have reduced or bought back 1/3 of our stock and more than doubled our earnings per share to $0.55 per share in FY '19. So it has served us incredibly well.</p><p>As a result, as Alan mentioned earlier, we have one of the strongest balance sheet positions in our history. With an investment-grade credit rating as well, we believe that this is a significant competitive advantage that is not matched by many of our competitors. And so moving forward, the one thing that we are going to be focused on is maintaining this balance sheet strength, maintaining this competitive advantage that it provides and that this will be a top priority for us as a leadership team.</p><p>Maintaining an optimal capital structure to minimize our cost of capital is the first pillar in our financial framework. Specifically, this is defined as the net debt range at 2 to 2.5x EBITDA where ROIC is at 10%. We typically target the bottom end of this range. And this, coupled with an investment-grade credit rating, has enabled us to build a leading debt maturity profile.</p><p>Our debt strength continues -- our debt structure continues to strengthen. Our sources of funds are diversifying. We have a broader mix of bank and nonbank lenders sourced both locally and also offshore. Our tenor is extending. We are now being able to place issuances in the market up to 12 years. We've also been able to smooth our maturity profile. We now have less in any 1 year, obligations less than $1 billion or 30% of our operating cash. And our cost of debt is continuing to reduce as we both optimize that debt structure but also our liquidity settings.</p><p>Our liquidity is also strong. We have no financial covenants. 51% of our aircraft are unencumbered. And these have a current market value of $4.5 billion. We have strong cash reserves and also undrawn line facilities up to $1 billion. So again, moving forward, our focus is going to be keeping this refinancing risk low whilst continuing to improve our cost of debt and also our tenor.</p><p>This slide summarizes our relative position to our airline peers. And the Qantas Group maintains an investment-grade credit rating, and we've maintained that since early 2017. But there are 2 points that I'd really like you to take from this slide. Firstly, that the Qantas Group is in a strong position relative to our airline peers. And this balance sheet strength provides us, as I said, with a really important competitive advantage. And it's that advantage, when relative to our competitors, that gives us the strength to withstand competitive action or be resilient to weather unexpected industry shocks.</p><p>And the second point to take from this slide is that our discipline in applying the financial framework ensures that we are continuously aligning our net debt with our earnings outlook. And as we target, as I said, net debt where ROIC is at 10%, and that our ROIC is actually substantially more than that, the group has significant headroom in our current investment-grade credit rating. So again, a significant competitive advantage and a key part of our balance sheet strength that we will place is an absolute priority to maintain.</p><p>Our quality of earnings and operating cash flows remain strong, and our outlook is for this to continue, if not improve. And you will hear during the day where we actually see earnings growth across the portfolio. And the group has unique competitive advantages. You heard Alan most recently speaking about that. But our leading dual-brand position in the domestic market underpins a significant part of our earnings base. In such -- with structurally advantaged market, plus also with an outlook where we're seeing more rational capacity action, we believe that this will continue to grow.</p><p>Our Loyalty business also now contributes a substantial part of our growth and also diversifying our earnings outcome. Loyalty now represents the second-largest contributing segment to our earnings performance. And 100% of that earnings comes from outside the group. So very reflective of how it is continuing to diversify our earnings stream. And structurally transformed Qantas International, earnings are becoming ever less volatile. Plus also, Jetstar International is continuing to grow our earnings from the price leisure segment outbound from Australia but also taking that Jetstar know-how into new markets in Asia. And Gareth will talk about that later on.</p><p>A common misconception, though, is that Qantas earnings are volatile and aligned very closely to the volatility of fuel price. Clearly, fuel does represent a substantial part of our cost of our business and that prices are volatile over the short term. But to counter this, we have a very disciplined approach to fuel hedging. We have a forward view on a 24-month rolling view of our hedging position, where we have a much larger and more substantial percentage hedged in the near term. This provides the group with greater confidence over our cash flows in the short term but also our operating cost.</p><p>But most importantly, the hedging program provides time. It provides time for the business to -- and the airlines to adjust through either driving transformation to reduce costs or to adjust network and capacity settings and also pricing so that we maintain our margin. And you can see here that the group has been able to do that over time in that our revenue per ASK versus our fuel per ASK has maintained a relative margin during that period. And the group has absorbed, during that period, $800 million in fuel. So it absolutely does demonstrate the ability of the group to mitigate the cost of fuel both in the short and the medium term.</p><p>Currency movements also do have an impact on the group. But unlike fuel, where all airlines incur the same fuel cost, currency does impact airlines differently. And the impact on the Qantas Group is a lot more than just the foreign currency and the effect of the foreign currency translated on our foreign costs and also revenue. You need to look a lot more deeper at what is actually driving the impact on the change of the currency, most particularly the relationship between the currency move and demand and the impact that that has on our competitors and our broader market.</p><p>So just to apply a scenario here and a lower dollar scenario, this would actually see Qantas' costs, our foreign currency costs converted into Australian dollars and revenue, they will increase. However, a lower Australian dollar typically represents a lower demand environment both here and also globally. And so, therefore, what you would expect in this situation is that international competitors would have a lower profitability in this market. That is because obviously, with a lower demand, there is less outbound demand for tourism. But also, those competitors, for the revenue that they generate in Australia when they convert it to their home currency, their yields will be lower.</p><p>So as a result, what you would expect is that international capacity would reduce. And in fact, this is the rational reaction that you would expect, and we have seen this. We have seen this in the international market in the recent periods. So this, in turn, would actually help Qantas lift our yields and therefore, offset any effect of a lower Australian dollar.</p><p>I think, though, what I wanted to leave with you today, though, is what matters most in any operating environment, in any foreign currency or Australian dollar scenario, that there are 3 things that we are always going to keep very much front of mind. The first thing is that we are going to maintain our focus on our balance sheet, and we are going to maintain our relative margin advantage to our competitors. Secondly, across the group, we are going to focus on maintaining network and capacity flexibility so that we can also adjust our settings to changes in demand created by currency movements. And finally, as I mentioned before, a drive to diversify our earnings is going to provide ongoing strength in all operating market environments going forward. So, therefore, and assuming that our markets are rational, we are really confident that the Qantas Group can operate effectively in all scenarios of a high or a low Australian dollar.</p><p>The third pillar of our financial framework is disciplined capital allocation. And central to this approach is maintaining balance sheet strength, optimizing our cost of capital and targeting the bottom end of our net debt range, always on a forward view of our earnings outlook. And you can see this slide presents what would be the cycle of decisions that we make around that, applying that financial framework.</p><p>So the first step, if we consider our net debt to be too high, we will prioritize the repayment of debt. And this is exactly what we did in 2015. As the next step, and again, based on the outlook of earnings, we will prioritize capital to both reinvestment in the business across aircraft, Loyalty, customer and also transformation. And this has been averaging in the past of $2 billion per annum. We will also prioritize our capital to returning a fully franked dividend to shareholders at the rate of $200 million a half. And then finally, if there is any remaining surplus, we will distribute that to shareholders in the most efficient way possible, or we will reinvest that into the business for growth and earnings growth in the future. This will then ensure that the balance sheet net debt returns to its optimal level, and this process will be a continuous one on a forward-looking basis, maximizing the economic outcomes for the group.</p><p>The breadth and flexibility of our fleet across the group is a key feature of our competitive advantage. And strategically, we think about this through 3 distinct frames. And they do drive our actions. The first frame is where there is a financial case, we will retire technology where it is no longer fit-for-purpose or that technology has faded. And this is the case with the 747. Tino will talk a little bit later around the 747 replacement with the 787 in more detail. But this step is a game-changer for our international network and performance. The 787 is more fuel-efficient. It has a lower running cost. But it has a range that has enabled us to unlock routes that wouldn't be possible with the 747 such as Perth-London.</p><p>The second frame relates to our core, our main fleet. And this is the right aircraft for the routes that they fly and for the customers that they serve. Just a few examples to call out here, the A380 is our core international long-haul vehicle with the right capacity, serving predominantly slot-constrained ports. We are investing in the A380. We are currently reconfiguring those aircraft. We are investing in its midlife check. So this aircraft will form a significant part of our international fleet for at least the next 10 years. The A330, the 737 and the A320 are the backbone of our domestic and short-haul Asia network for both Qantas and also for Jetstar. They are incredibly versatile aircraft, and they are high-performing aircraft. And we are also investing in those aircraft. Recently, we've completed on the A330 the investment in the business class lie-flat bed, but we have also -- are due to complete installation of Wi-Fi on our domestic 330s and also 737 aircraft. So these aircraft will continue to form a substantial part of our core fleet for many years to come.</p><p>The third frame that we think about is that we will adapt and adopt next-generation technology, where it provides the group with a sustainable competitive advantage or unique economic benefit. And Gareth will talk later about the example that we use here on the replacement of the A321ceo with the A321LR. And this is a very, very compelling business case. And I think that the A321, you only need to look at, again, the operating cost of that aircraft, the efficiency of that aircraft but again, the range that that aircraft enables for the Jetstar network to grow beyond what the capability of the A321ceo would enable.</p><p>So whilst the Qantas Domestic fleet continues to perform well, we will undertake a narrow-body competition next year. This will help us understand the emerging technology that are coming from new aircraft and fleet types but also will enable us to weigh up the best economics in the future for any replacement program. This is just a normal part of our fleet planning process. Our time frame will be long, and we will always be applying our financial framework to help us make those decisions along that journey.</p><p>A common misconception is that fleet age should be the point in which we make replacement decisions. Actually, this is just a very blunt instrumental measure to measure fleet health or the economic contribution of a fleet. It ignores the improvements that's coming with technology, and we are seeing that right now, extending the useful life of many of our fleet types. And our view is simply that replacing aircraft and the maintaining of fleet age is not an efficient use of capital. So, therefore, our approach going forward will be to continuously assess the value of replacement and maintenance and therefore, deploying capital in the most efficient and economic way across the group.</p><p>At current earnings, the financial framework has provided for an annual reinvestment of $2 billion per annum across our fleet, our customer, Loyalty and also transformation. This has been our baseline planning assumption, and it is the planning assumption for this financial year. And moving forward, we will maintain this discipline and continuously test reinvestment against our business needs, our financial framework and our earnings outlook.</p><p>The mix of capital within this envelope changes from year-to-year changes from a mix of transformation to customer loyalty. But it is fair to say that the substantial amount of capital allocated in this envelope will be to aircraft, either replacement, maintenance or refurbishment. And to ensure that we maintain maximum flexibility, our capital plan considers a 10-year high horizon but with much more certainty and commitments in the short term. And we think that that is actually a really important part of our business planning process but also building resilience in our business as it provides us with flexibility to respond if we need to, flexibility to respond if markets change or the ability to reprioritize capital if we actually see an opportunity that emerges.</p><p>And looking beyond our existing committed orders that you can see there and working within our planning framework, albeit that we will be constantly adjusting for inflation and also changes in currency, we could replace over a 4-year period, our narrow-body with 63 -- 63 narrow-bodies or 21 wide-bodies. And that would give us the capacity to replace our entire fleet over the next 20 to 25 years.</p><p>So as we roll forward, and as we firm up our near-term plans, as I said a moment ago, our approach is to be continuously assessing the value of maintenance and also versus replacement and constantly applying our financial framework and our forward view of earnings to make sure that we always have capital in balance with the framework.</p><p>The group is well placed to deal with an unexpected shock. When considering shocks that we faced in the past such as the GFC, we believe today, we are in a better position than we were when we went into the last GFC back in 2008. Particularly, our market fundamentals are significantly better than they were. We have a strong domestic position. Our dual brand is now more mature. And Jetstar is 2.5x the size it was back in 2008. We're also, as I said before, expecting the forward view, our capacity to be moderate. Back in 2008, we had just come off the back of 4 years of 10% capacity growth in the domestic market.</p><p>Our Loyalty business is more than double the size. And every year, it is diversifying our income. We have a stronger international position. Both Jetstar and Qantas International are benefiting from new technology. And also, we are seeing, as I said a moment ago, capacity in the international market continuing to moderate. Also, our constant efforts since 2014 to continuously transform our business and our cost base has put us in a situation where, versus our competitors, our margin advantage has improved versus where we were in 2008.</p><p>And also, our financial position is stronger. We have stronger cash flow. We have a stronger balance sheet with lower leverage and also lower refinancing risk. Our fleet is more simplified. And we have less forward commitments, which actually gives us greater flexibility to respond if we need to. So we don't wish for another GFC or we don't wish for an unexpected shock, but we are stronger and in a better position to face it, if one was to occur.</p><p>So the financial framework, it is proven. It has delivered value, and we intend moving forward to live by that. We will continue to target the right level of net debt to deliver the lowest cost of capital. We also will continue to target ROIC that is greater than our cost of capital and invest to create competitive advantage and also to create earnings growth in the future. And we will continue to exercise a discipline in capital allocation to maintain our current balance sheet strength.</p><p>So we do believe that we have the right settings, and we also do believe that we have the right strategy that you'll hear over the rest of today that will set the Qantas Group up to deliver ongoing value to you as investors but also more broadly across the Qantas Group ecosystem. So thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thank you, Vanessa. Our next presenter is Rob Marcolina. He'll update you on our transformation progress to date and the next wave of the group's transformation agenda. Rob's our Group Executive, Strategy, People &amp; Technology. He joined Qantas in 2012 after a career in strategic consulting with Bain &amp; Co. After Rob's presentation, we'll have our first Q&amp;A session. Rob, if you'd please come to the stage.</p><p>ROBERT MARCOLINA, GROUP EXECUTIVE OF STRATEGY, INNOVATION &amp; TECHNOLOGY, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Thanks, Fran, and good morning, everyone. Many of you are no doubt Qantas frequent flyers, and you would have seen changes in how we do business over the last couple of years. And we've looked really throughout the organization up and down for opportunities to improve our business, our cost position, our employee engagement and our customer experience, which is really your experience. And transformation has really been at the center of our strategy and helping us to deliver a sustainable level of financial returns.</p><p>So my objective today is do a couple of things. Firstly, is provide you with confidence that we've done what we said we would do back at Investor Day in FY '17 and that we have the right mindset and ideas and culture to continue to transform the organization. Well, our transformation has been a journey over the last 5 years.</p><p>The early period of FY '15 to '17 was characterized by large projects such as the 747 base closure and the contact center consolidation. And they're a long list of ideas. Many were complex and challenging. But we worked through them, and we exceeded our $2 billion target. And pleasingly, we did that with record customer NPS and record employee engagement.</p><p>In FY '18 and FY '19, as you can see, we had a mix of projects. There were some big projects such as the transfer of the hub from Dubai to Singapore and the introduction of the 789. But the average size of the projects actually reduced. And in FY '19, 70% of our initiatives were less than $1 million. And many of these, as you'll see today, were identified and delivered through the front line, which we believe really is a good indication of how embedded the transformation actually is.</p><p>For FY '20 and beyond, we're committed again to a minimum of $400 million per year in gross transformation benefits. The mix of cost and revenue-related initiatives will vary from year-to-year, depending on the market environment. And as was mentioned earlier by Alan, in FY '20, 70% of our initiatives for transformation benefits will come from cost-oriented initiatives.</p><p>Going forward, again, we talked about this earlier as well; we see technology as an important transformation lever. And today, as we go through the presentations, you'll see this consistent, whether we're talking about operations, our commercial operations or employee productivity, we think technology is just as relevant in all parts of our business.</p><p>Now many of you may -- this slide may look familiar to many of you, we actually presented this slide in FY '17. It was presented as a guide as to where we thought we would expect to drive transformation benefits and an estimate on how we thought the $400 million might be achieved. Now we've pushed hard on many of these initiatives and look to maximize the opportunity. And what you'll notice is that, on average, we've achieved a $450 million against the $400 million target. And many of those initiatives have been achieved over this time period with the help of our teams in the front line. And you'll also notice that the mix of benefits is roughly in line with our expectations.</p><p>Now there are a large number of examples at the bottom of the page, and I'm not going to go through those in detail today, but I do want to let you know that many of those will continue to be transformation drivers as we go forward over the next couple of years.</p><p>I wanted to share, getting to some detail, and share a couple of case examples that illustrate our transformation achievements. Engineering is one of the areas where we've made significant progress. And 2 good examples of that are with our base maintenance facility in Brisbane, where we do heavy or more complicated aircraft checks, and our supply chain, where we manage inventory across the group. And with regards to base maintenance. We thought we could do better, and our engineers thought we could do better. And by doing better, we can improve the competitiveness of the facility and put us in a better position to attract work from Jetstar and also from third parties.</p><p>We conducted a time and motion study and identified that only 33% of the engineer's time was being spent actually touching the aircraft. Now the rest of the time they're spending finding parts and tooling equipment. Now the quality of the work and the safety of the work were first class, and they continue to be so today, but we were just inefficient. We needed to get more aircraft touch time by our highly skilled engineers.</p><p>So the engineers took the initiative. They reengineered the process, and today, touch time has now increased. And as a result, our turn times have improved significantly. And productivity at this point is equivalent to those of industry norms. And so today, the facility is providing services to Qantas, Jetstar and third party. And going forward, we expect to do more with Jetstar and also with third parties. Both of these really highlight the importance of frontline ownership, which we know increases the sustainability and the stickiness of change.</p><p>The second example is the rollout of Wi-Fi. Now this has been a significant investment for Qantas to drive better customer experiences, but also to help our cost position and also our overall operations. Qantas in-flight Wi-Fi is a world-leading product. It's fast and free, hopefully, many of you have used it, delivering speeds consistent with those that you get on the ground. And customer satisfaction is quite high, over 40% of our customers are regularly using it and there's greater take-up on longer routes, such as from Sydney to Perth.</p><p>Wi-Fi also gives us an ability to help with disruption management to reduce stress for our customers while in flight. Now our embodiment is almost complete. The 737s we expect to be finished by the end of the calendar year, and the last remaining 330s at the beginning of next year as they go into their heavy maintenance checks. So currently, we have 80 aircraft flying around Australia connected to a high speed Wi-Fi.</p><p>Wi-Fi is also having a positive impact in our cockpit. Our pilots love it, getting access to additional information such as weather. And it's also helping us to reduce our communication costs, utilizing NBN satellites and ViaSat ground stations versus our legacy VHS radio communications. So we'll continue to look at Wi-Fi and what it can do for our business, both in terms of the customer experience, but also with our overall operations. We established some principles a number of years ago, and those are up on your screen now. And these have guided us well. We think they're just as relevant today and going forward as they have been over the last 5 years. And a couple I'd just like to emphasize.</p><p>Firstly, with regards to ownership. Transformation at this point is embedded in the business. It's business as usual, and it's ingrained in the operating rhythms of the company. Second, with regards to linkages. Our transformation planning is directly linked to our strategic objectives and ensuring that we achieve our short-term financial goals. And as we've mentioned before, we will adapt our transformation and the focus based on the external market conditions and again, FY '20, with a focus more on cost initiatives. And then finally, I wanted to focus on the last one, that being around our customers. We will continue to be mindful of our customer in all our transformation deliberations. We'll always consider the implications on our customer and ensuring that we, as much as possible, identify win-win opportunities, which are good for our people, good for our customers and good for Qantas.</p><p>As we look at our transformation going forward, we see 3 main themes that will drive opportunities. Firstly, on fleet and network, just really the lifeblood of an airline. The right aircraft on the right route, leveraging lower cost fleet technology such as we've mentioned already, the 789 or the neo, and deploying these assets where we have a strong competitive advantage. Second, in our ways of working. This is our secret sauce. It's not just what we're doing to transform, but it's how we're doing that, whether it's in our operations or in one of our new loyalty adjacent businesses. We're deploying agile and design thinking and other innovative methodologies, but we're thoughtful about which of these methodologies we deploy where recognizing that they need to drive incremental benefits. And then finally, on digitalization, we're already well down the path with this. We're driving results today, but we know that this will be an increasingly important area as we look forward. And the most important first step with regard to this is around data. It's ensuring that we have standards in place and that the data is clean, real-time and secure. And there are many case examples with this, whether we're talking about personalization, fuel efficiency, employee productivity, and you'll hear many of these case examples over the next couple of hours.</p><p>As you can see, it's quite a complicated slide, but it lays out a bit of detail with regards to our pipeline, and we believe we have a robust transformation pipeline over the next few years. Again, using the 3 themes from the previous page, we've laid out some of the specific initiatives. Many of these we have underway, some we have plans in place and some at this point are more work in progress. On fleet and network, we have some exciting fleet-related transformation coming up, as it's been mentioned, the retirement of the 747s and the introductions of the neo. And Andrew, Tino and Gareth will take you through those plans, and specifically, how they will unlock transformation benefits.</p><p>In our ways of working, this is all about behavior change. It's getting data and insights into the hands of our decision-makers and encouraging them to lean into those decisions armed with that information. For example, providing our pilots with data and insights around discretionary fuel use. Evolving our ways of working, we know, will drive transformation benefits.</p><p>And with regards to digitalization, as you can see, we've got 3 columns there around data enablement, automation and AI, and we believe it's a combination of these factors for specific initiatives that are going to drive benefits going forward. And this is going to be done across the operations. If you look through some of the examples there, there are specific ones around operations. There's also commercial examples and also employee productivity examples. And again, we think the benefits are going to come across the operational areas. And then I'm going to go through the next few slides, 3 examples. One is around frontline enablement, revenue management and biometrics, which we feel are important for our future.</p><p>As I illustrated with engineering, frontline enablement is key to driving transformation. And we have work underway in all parts of the group, across Qantas, across Jetstar, both above the wing in our terminal and below the wing alongside our aircraft. We understand the importance of on-time performance to meet our customers' expectations and to ensure the smooth running of our operations. Delays cost us money and put unwelcome stress on both our customers as well as on our people. We need to get real-time data into the hands of our front line. In the terminal and at the gate, we recognize that our customers are well informed by publicly available applications. We need our customer-facing staff to be better informed. We want them well prepared for conversations that they're going to have with our customers, particularly in times of disruption or when things change.</p><p>And for our below-the-wing staff, they have a major responsibility to get our aircraft away safely and on time, and they need the ground equipment available and ready to use, and technology can help. We're installing telemetry on 5,000 pieces of our ground equipment and arming our staff with handheld devices. We know that this will improve utilization as well as lower inventory levels.</p><p>With regards to revenue management. Revenue management is very complicated in airlines, how to set a price and then how to vary that by time of day, day of week and time to departure. Our revenue management journey over the last few years has driven significant incremental revenue. We've transformed our legacy systems, partnered with leading universities, adopted new technologies and put science into action. And we've used combinations of methods and tools to drive these revenue outcomes. Going forward, we'll continue to use innovation tools to help forecast network demand and optimize it against our inventory. This will include greater customer segmentation and continuous pricing, and this is in contrast to the advertised pricing categories that we're restricted to today.</p><p>We are building a dynamic pricing engine to generate and adjust prices in real-time. We'll also leverage our new distribution freedoms to get tailored offers directly to our customers, and Steph will go through in a lot more detail with regard to our distribution and personalization initiatives.</p><p>And then the final example I wanted to share with you was around biometrics. There's been a lot of energy around biometrics, not just within aviation, but in other industries. We want to be pioneers in biometrics to influence how it can help our business, how it can help our customers to provide a seamless, secure and personalized experience. We've done a number of trials over the last couple of years with regards to biometrics, and they've validated the opportunities. Customers find it faster and easier and, in fact, have been more eager to embrace the technology than we anticipated. But for biometrics to work and to deliver on the promise, it needs to be end-to-end. So if you think about checking in, dropping your bags, going through security, the lounge and then on to the aircraft, it needs to be end-to-end across that experience. Otherwise, we're just moving the bottleneck.</p><p>Now the senior management team recently visited Western Sydney Airport, and we talked about many things, including biometrics. They see biometrics as a key technology in the design of the airport to drive not only a better customer experience but also a lower cost position. And this is a wonderful opportunity for Qantas as well as for our customers. And we've signed an MOU to work collaboratively with them on these particular items. Western Sydney Airport will open in 2026 with 5 million passengers per year. It's a significant investment for Sydney and for Australia, and we're excited to work alongside them to deliver this. But we're also working with other airports, with Sydney airports, other airports around the world and around Australia, as well as the federal and state government because we want to ensure that collectively, we can actually realize the benefits of biometrics.</p><p>So today, you've seen a lot of ideas and a robust pipeline of transformation opportunities, and we're excited about the possibilities. But there are critical enablers that we need to make sure we have in place. And again, it all starts with the data, assuming -- ensuring that it's available real-time and it's secure. We need to get the data to the right people in the right places at the right time in order for us to make the right decisions. And in a world with so much data, there is the potential for misuse. And so we are committed to ensuring that we have robust protections in place. This is our DNA. This is what we do. So we're confident that we can use data in a safe and secure way.</p><p>So in summary, I wanted to leave you with these thoughts. First of all, that we have a proven track record of delivery, there again committed to a minimum of $400 million per year in gross transformation benefits. We'll continue to leverage the transformation principles that have been effective over the last 5 years. We know where we're going to drive transformation benefits. And in FY '20, about 70% of those benefits will come from cost-oriented initiatives. Thank you very much.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Rob. If Vanessa and Andrew could join you and take a seat over there. We'll kick off our first Q&amp;A session for the day. Alan will direct the questions. If you are in the room, please put your hand up. Our graduates will come with microphones. And please say your name and your organization. If you are on the webcast, you can type your question into the box on the right-hand side.</p><p>I'll hand over to Alan to direct the questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Thanks, Fran. And if we can, I mean there's plenty of chances in the next section to talk about the individual airlines and the individual performance of those and capacity outlook. So if we can on this one focus on the topics of transformation, the financial framework and the overall position of where the strategy is and our social license to operate. So any questions in the room? Yes, over there, gentleman.</p><p>JAKOB CAKARNIS, ASSOCIATE, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Jake Cakarnis from Citi. Just one for Vanessa. You spoke a lot about ROIC being greater than WACC there. Just wondering if you could give some examples of where the ROIC champions are for global airlines and what you see is the incremental ROIC from Qantas here, maybe not necessarily capping it at 10% per se.</p><p>VANESSA HUDSON: Well, I think what we've recently seen is the IAG Group, as Alan mentioned earlier, have been generating substantial returns, even though there's a difference in the calculation between their ROIC and how we would see it. But I think that it comes back to understanding the markets that you operate in and the competitive advantages that you can extract from that. So I think that there is a leader there, but also, I think that we will hear later on from Andrew and also from Olivia, just around the earnings outlook that we have as a group as well and believe that we can actually see our return on invested capital being able to increase in the future as well.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: And to be clear, Jake, I mean we're not saying that 10% is our target. We're saying it's the value creation level above which we know we create value. And I think what Vanessa was actually saying, which I think is important, there's a lot of people saying with debt coming down, maybe your cost of capital, your WACC is coming down and the thresholds for future businesses cases could be at lower levels. We're not going to approach it that way. As far as we're concerned, the capital for investment in fleet are 20-, 25-year decisions. So the hurdles that we're setting for ourselves are still our WACC above that 10%. And that is, we think, value creating.</p><p>You can see from the slide that Vanessa showed that we're way above those levels for the last few years with the targets that we presented, and you'll see from each of the individual businesses, we think we can even do better than that. The 18% margin for Qantas domestic, the 22% for Jetstar are maintaining both returns of above 10% for Qantas International and for over 15% for Jetstar. And the loyalty targets translate into a number way above that, and that's our target over the next 5 years.</p><p>Other questions? Yes, up here. I've got light shining in my face. So it's hard to make out -- I've not only got a bad voice, I have bad eyesight as well, so apologies.</p><p>PAUL BUTLER, DIRECTOR, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Paul Butler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Just wanted to ask just a bit further question on that. When you talk about the margin targets, so the 18% for Qantas domestic and 22% for Jetstar, should we think about those as being targets of what you see is sustainable and you're going to average that? Or are they margin targets at the top of the cycle?</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: So I might save that for the next set of presentations because Andrew is going to go in detail about the sustainable competitive advantage we believe we have in both the domestic businesses and why and what we believe that is going forward. So I'm going to steal his thunder if I do that now. So I think let's come back -- if you're okay, Paul, we'll come back to that in the next session.</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: Perhaps I can ask another one then. The $50 million that you're spending on biofuels, can you give us a bit more detail of how you -- what you're actually investing in and the timeline and when that will provide a benefit.</p><p>ANDREW PARKER: Yes, thank you. We -- there's a number of elements to it. As I mentioned, the critical thing is we've had a series of trials and some investments by airports. So for example, there is some ground infrastructure having been created at Brisbane Airport. But we feel that investment is going to take a lot of these trials we've done by this trial flights and trial usage and try to actually create a physical facility in Australia. It's a relatively small amount of money in the grand scheme of things. But as I mentioned in the remarks, it's trying to build a coalition who will come up with several hundred million dollars a year, we think necessary to really get some scale underway like we've seen in California and now in the United Kingdom and other parts in Europe.</p><p>So I would think of it like seed funding. It will be an investment in some technology. It will be investments in facilities, but it will be one element of what we hope will be multiple tiers of funding by both a private sector and federal and state governments in both physical assets and the production of supply within the next 5 to 10 years.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: And it's interesting, Paul, since we've made that announcement, Andrew has been inundated a bit by people from the banking sector, people from the private sector, private money, some people that are very passionate about this topic and from governments, both federal and state in Australia that see this as an opportunity for creating jobs. And there is an opportunity for creating a significant amount of jobs in each of the individual states and federally. So I think it's starting as a catalyst and seen as a catalyst. If we need to invest more to get there, we'll have a look at that. But absolutely, if we think there's a business case for it, we'll go after it, but we think this has had the desired impact already. We'll start the process of developing this native industry, which I think is going to be very important for Australia.</p><p>Next question. Peter? We've got 2 up here.</p><p>PETER HARBISON;CAPA-CENTRE FOR AVIATION;EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN: Peter Harbison from CAPA. Still, on the environment, a lot of interesting stuff going on there, obviously. You've got 2 fronts that you have to tackle that on. One is the popular one, and the one is the real one if I could call it that. The popular one is carbon, obviously. One of the nasty ones for aviation, particularly, is NOx, nitric oxide, and you didn't mention that, Andrew. What -- and aviation is a particularly bad emitter of that. What are you doing and what can be done about that?</p><p>ANDREW PARKER: Yes, I think it's -- you're right to raise it, and it is part of, I think, the overall focus of industry is the headline absolutely on CO2 emissions. We have a lot of discussions with manufacturers and propulsion engine manufacturers, principally because I think that's where we're going to see the change in terms of technology, and I think they are focused on it. We, though, do believe our greatest environmental impact is CO2. So that's where we're going to focus our efforts, but absolutely working very closely with the manufacturers and government. So our government, ICAO and others are putting a significant effort into not just carbon but NOx, as you mentioned. So I don't want to pass the buck to Boeing and Airbus. But I think they are the ones with the expertise in terms of how they're going to build engines of the future. They're going to help tackle that as well.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: And I think Peter, I mean Andrew mentioned, we're really focused on the technology here. When we started looking at hybrids or electrical aircraft, I mean, even a year ago or 2 years ago, we thought that there wasn't a chance that they could get there in our lifetimes. I mean that Statoil whose view is that to fly Melbourne and Sydney, the battery power was going to be 34x the weight of the fuel. But we're starting to see this technology rapidly stand with the common option, and our friends in Air New Zealand see a hybrid aircraft potentially solving a lot of these issues. As a potential for regional flying, which is a big part of where CO2 and O2 actually comes from. So I think the technology has to be our solution here because it's very hard to fix that in any another way, and that's why there's a lot of dialogue going with the manufacturers, a lot of airlines working together on it. And I hope this turns out to be something like safety, where it's actually seen as an industry issue. And like we invite other airlines here, and then actually since our announcement, Andrew has had contact from British Airways, from Air New Zealand that we're talking about this, trying to fix the issue together rather than -- as an industry issue rather than as a competitive factor issue within that industry.</p><p>Next question.</p><p>MATTHEW H. RYAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND RESEARCH ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Matt Ryan from UBS. I just had a question on CapEx and the $2 billion that you've sort of outlined. Just wanting to know what that sort of assumes for seats growth moving forward and also -- the seats growth. You're obviously taking some aircraft out of the fleet as you add new aircraft. So just curious on where the number of seats will end up across the...</p><p>VANESSA HUDSON: Seats growth, sorry, I...</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Hard to hear.</p><p>MATTHEW H. RYAN: And also, obviously, on utilization, that's been pushing up, where you see that moving going forward and where you see sort of best-in-class airlines on utilization?</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: So maybe a couple of things. Andrew is going to cover off utilization because I think you're absolutely right, the way you framed the question. There is a replacement. And we're seeing this replacement of the fleet that we have with the seats that we have. But there are opportunities with the newer aircraft. And with the way we're looking at the operation to improve utilization. And we don't think we're there yet. And some of the aircraft that we're planning to replace like the F100s, I mean, they've got still good, and John will be happy to talk about this in the next section. They've got -- we bought them at 20 years plus. We have them on very low utilization, a few hours a day because they fly in fly out. The replacement for them eventually is going to be an aircraft that has higher utilization, and it's going to give us more seats in the marketplace. So it's -- your framing is absolutely right. It is that combination that gets you a lot of growth. And can we, again, save that when we get to the individual sections on the airlines. And in some cases, I would say, we're not growing for the sake of growing. I mean the Perth-London, we actually did reduce capacity to London. And we were profitable for the first time in 10 years. And Tino will do that as a case study. And for us, it's about the premium capacity, the premium market and how you service that to where the profitability is going to come from. So we're not fixated on just seat growth. It's actually margin growth and profitable growth that's going to be key.</p><p>So we've got time for I think 2 more questions, maybe.</p><p>OWEN BIRRELL, METALS AND MINING COMPANY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Owen Birrell from Goldman Sachs. I've just got a couple of questions for Rob on the transformation side. Just looking at the splits for FY '19, I saw there was $35 million of misses, I guess, in group initiatives and from technology. Just wondering if that's opportunity that is now gone, or whether it's just deferred into this year.</p><p>And then looking forward, I think, traditionally, it's sort of been at, what, 2/3 cost, 1/3 revenue in terms of the outlook. Is that how we should consider that split over the next few years?</p><p>ROBERT MARCOLINA: Yes. Well, on your first question, you'll probably know from the definitions of the categories there, they're not clearly defined in terms of a messy arrangement, meaning that some of the initiatives you could put in either of the columns if you like. But specifically on your -- so we've -- in terms of categorization, we sort of put it in the main area that it was defined as but it's not a missed opportunity. I mean I'd say that group initiatives is something that we've been doing since FY '15. It's something we're always going to do, whether it's in engineering that I mentioned or warehousing, supply chain. So that's probably the area that we've made the most progress on, particularly the way that we work closely with between Qantas and Jetstar. So I wouldn't take it as a missed opportunity or a deferral. It's probably just an ongoing area. Many of the things that were in the bottom of that page, that I mentioned are things that we're going to continue to focus on. And then as to your second part of your question, I mean, as we mentioned in FY '20, we are going to be at least 70% cost, and it will just depend on the market. We're very focused on both costs and revenue, and Steph will go through some of the specific initiatives around revenue and personalization. But I think as we look at the market and the uncertainty in the market, we will be more focused on cost-based initiatives over the next couple of years.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: One last question. And we'd go up over there. It's Anthony.</p><p>ANTHONY MOULDER, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Anthony Moulder from Jefferies. Just following on, Rob, from...</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Are you sure, Anthony? It keeps on changing all the time.</p><p>ANTHONY MOULDER: Cheap. Cheap shot. I'll ask this question, not (inaudible)</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: I'm sorry I shouldn't...</p><p>ANTHONY MOULDER: Transformation, which I know a lot of, thank you, Alan, is -- I wondered how much of that is coming from CapEx. You're effectively using CapEx to replace OpEx.</p><p>ROBERT MARCOLINA: What we do -- I mean each of the transformation initiatives we do go through, we have quite strict guidelines in terms of understanding to what extent we can capitalize those particular things. But no, I mean the $400 million is all OpEx. I mean that's specifically focused on the P&amp;L. Some of those initiatives do have CapEx elements to that, but that is all focused on the P&amp;L. Okay.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Okay. Well, thanks very much, everybody. We're going to have a break now until quarter past 11 -- 20 past 11. So we'll have a tea break, and we'll come back for those on the webcast at 20 past 11. Thank you very much.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Okay, I think we've just about got everybody. Welcome back, everyone. I hope you enjoyed morning tea. There was lots of chatter out there, so lots of conversation.</p><p>The group's focus on sustainability is a key part of this event. And consistent with that approach, we are going to be giving you a (inaudible) cup at the end of the day. Someone's going to give me one to show you. And they'll be available to pick up in the foyer. So don't forget to pick one up before you go, if you have to leave after lunch today. There we go. There's one. It's got the 100-year logo, one that's probably a bit of a collector's item.</p><p>In our next session, we move on to a more detailed focus on the group's 6 pillars. The 3 presentations will be led by our airline CEOs before we open it up to Q&amp;A. Leading off is the CEO of Qantas Domestic, Andrew David. Andrew joined Qantas Group over 5 years ago after an extensive career in the aviation industry. As you know, our domestic dual-brand strategy is a major driver of the group's profitability. Andrew will walk you through how we are positioned to deliver even higher margins that we've established as a target for ourselves from the domestic market.</p><p>Please come up, Andrew.</p><p>ANDREW PAUL DAVID, CEO OF QANTAS DOMESTIC &amp; FREIGHT, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. An excellent question, Paul, earlier before morning tea. Because if I was in the audience, I would have exactly the same question as you posed of me if listening to this presentation. Because if I was in the audience, what I would want to know is your domestic business contributes significant profit to the overall group and does it get any better from here.</p><p>Well, Alan has already stolen my punch line because he's already told you, yes, it will. We are targeting 18% operating margin for Qantas and 22% operating margin for Jetstar over the next 5 years. My job over the next 25 minutes is to take you through how and why we are going to hit those targets. Let's start with the market, okay?</p><p>The Australian domestic market is a very resilient one over the long term. Yes, we are currently facing headwinds of the East Coast with the softness in the market, but we're also enjoying tailwinds from the West as we're seeing another resource boom. We've got 2 airline groups that have 98% of the capacity in this market. Both those airline groups have a full-service airline and a low-cost carrier. The customer is very, very well served in this market. There are 139 unique city pairs offered by that combination of the Virgin Group and the Qantas Group schedules. And in real terms, fares are 30% lower than they were in 2005. The chart on the right there on this graph shows the market discipline that has been in place over the last 5 years, where we have seen capacity supply aligned with demand. That is a good thing for consumers and a good thing for shareholders because it ensures that both airline groups will be profitable into the long term, not one.</p><p>Now you overlay on those market factors some of the infrastructure issues and constraints that we're seeing in the market. Alan spoke before about Brisbane-Sydney and Sydney-Melbourne being the second and 12th busiest routes in the world. We are seeing congestion in Sydney and Melbourne in the morning in peak and in the evening in Sydney as well.</p><p>And while Western Sydney Airport will provide some relief for Sydney, much the same way Narita has for Tokyo or Gatwick has for London, Kingsford Smith will remain as the preferred business airport for business travelers.</p><p>And then the other factor I'll just touch on there is that 44% of all domestic journeys flow through Sydney, and the Qantas Group has 50% of the slots at Sydney. So considering those market factors and the infrastructure factors on top as well, what's resulted is the profit that's in front of you in this chart. What you've seen is profit out of the domestic market rise year-on-year. And for the Qantas Group, it has been over $1 billion of profit from Qantas Domestic and Jetstar Domestic for the last 2 years.</p><p>Last year, we had almost 90% of the profit in this market, driven by a number of factors. Our focus on our customer, our network advantage, our capacity advantage, our share of the corporate market, which is at 80%, our growth in the SME market, which has grown 1 point a year in share and is now at 50%, and our focus on the low-fare leisure market where Jetstar has a significant advantage.</p><p>So where to from here. There's 4 main streams that I want to talk you through that will bring us back to those targets of 18% and 22% and why they are believable and achievable targets. Firstly, our network advantage. Second, our relentless focus on customer, the service and product we provide to our customers, our capacity discipline in the market and in the cost and revenue strategies that are inherent in both Jetstar's plan and Qantas' plan that will see us achieve those margins.</p><p>Our network. Between Jetstar and Qantas, we have 43% more seats than our competitor to capital markets. Qantas compared to Virgin has 39% more seats to business markets, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra. On peak hours, we have more frequency than our competitor. And on what we define as super peak, the 7:00 till 9:00 a.m. slots in Sydney, we have more seats than our competitor.</p><p>In the resource markets, Queensland and Western Australia, we have more seats. In fact, in Western Australia, intra WA, we have doubled the number of the seats into that market than our nearest competitor. You combine the power of the domestic network with the international network, and last year, 1.7 million Qantas International customers connected on to our domestic network. Jetstar's case, Jetstar had 2.7 million more seats in the market last year compared to Tiger. And combined between Jetstar and Qantas, we have more seats to all the major leisure destinations, both domestically and internationally out of Australia.</p><p>This is a real advantage, a significant strategic advantage for the group. And we take very, very good care of that advantage. Twice a year, our network teams come together and meet for a full day and plan the next season's flying. Once a month, Alan, Gareth, myself, Vanessa and Rob meet with the teams to review the capacity settings on an ongoing basis. The teams are in daily contact. We have refined this process, and it's very, very important because of that network advantage, we look at the demand levels. We look at what our competition is doing, and we adjust accordingly. That is why we believe our network advantage is such an essential core of the benefits that we have in this business and why you can start to believe we can get to those operating margins.</p><p>Now let's turn to our focus on customer. I've mentioned already from a Qantas perspective, our 80% share of the corporate market and our 50% share of the SME market. And because of our Qantas Business Rewards program that is growing 1% a year. And Olivia this afternoon in talking and addressing you on our loyalty proposition will talk in a little bit more detail about that program and the value that we've achieved out of that program.</p><p>Of course, we focused on our product and service, and it's been noted already this morning from both Alan and Rob, the investment that we've made in Wi-Fi, the ongoing investments that we make in our lounges and the ongoing investment we make in our service.</p><p>I do want to touch just briefly on on-time performance. While Qantas Group has beaten the Virgin Group 3 out of the 4 months of this financial year in on-time performance, the industry has seen a degradation in OTP year-on-year for the last 3 years, both in on-time performance and in increased cancellations. This has been caused by 2 factors: One, Andrew spoke to earlier this morning the impact of climate change. In the last 4 months, we have seen wind velocities at 34% average higher than the last 30 years, and it's prevailing Westerly rather than the South, South Westerly we've seen in the past. There's challenges in crosswind flying and means the movements are slowed down. You add to that the issues that we're facing in Sydney and Melbourne in peak hours, and that has led to degradation in on-time performance.</p><p>What we're doing is focus on how we can improve it. We are working with the federal government, the state government, CASA, air services, the airports and the other airlines to get improvement in that on-time performance and a reduction in cancellations, and we also have a series of internal initiatives underway. Those activities are now starting to pay dividends. We have seen an improvement in October, starting to trend back towards the levels that we were enjoying 3, 4 years ago, and that is an ongoing focus for us.</p><p>The value of our Qantas Frequent Flyer program, our loyalty program, with its 13 million members, the strength of our international business, its network and our partners, that Tino is going to talk to next, those things, together with our domestic home strength is what makes our customer proposition such a powerful one.</p><p>Now let me turn to Jetstar and the strength Jetstar has. I spoke before about its extensive network and the advantages we enjoy over our competitor. But there's a couple of other things I want to touch on with Jetstar. Jetstar was born in the area -- the era of the Internet. It didn't come encumbered with legacy agreements with travel agents and global distribution systems, and it is to leverage that power. Jetstar.com has now morphed into Manage My Booking. And as a result of doing that, focus on ancillary revenue means that for Jetstar's Domestic business, 17% of its revenue comes from ancillary revenue. And that is growing at 8% a year. It comes from things like baggage and bundles and many, many other examples, and I'll let Gareth, who is following Tino, to talk about in more detail aspects of that. Or alternatively, we can answer those questions when we come to the Q&amp;A session.</p><p>So it is the strength of the dual-brand offering we bring to the market that gives us this powerful customer proposition.</p><p>To capacity. There's something unique about what we've built here. Vanessa spoke before about having aircraft fit for purpose. What we've actually done is built businesses that are fit for purpose, starting with Jetstar. Jetstar's 320 family allows it to build a production driven schedule that gives the customer choice but increases utilization of aircraft. Pushing higher utilization drives down the unit cost. If we look at the trunk airline for Qantas, we managed the mainline trunk with 330s and 73s. And by combining both domestic and international network plans, we fly those 330s internationally and the 73s. For example, a 330 here can fly domestically and then leave Sydney overnight up to an Asian destination and back, ready to do more flying the next day in the domestic market. That means out of our 73s, we're getting close to 10 hours of utilization at peak times of the year and our 330s, 12 hours.</p><p>Now turning to the regional markets. They're served by 3 separate entities, Cobham fly our 71s. And Eastern and Sunstate fly our turbo prop aircraft. Typically, you're getting 6 to 8 hours out of those aircraft. But the 71s are a very, very flexible aircraft because we also use the 71s on thinner trunk routes. So when off-peak, where the demand is lower, you're better off putting a dual-class 110 seat aircraft into those markets. And the single class 125-seat 71s, we actually use in some of our resource fly.</p><p>And lastly, the resource markets themselves. Network aviation based in the West runs F100s, 17 of them, and now has 3 A320s that are retired out of the Jetstar fleet, soon to be 4, operating in the West. And the point that Vanessa was making before about aircraft and age is highlighted best in this example. We can operate older aircraft, low-capital aircraft because they're only flying 4 to 5 hours a day. And the whole purpose of network aviation is to operate efficiently in that market. Of course, the other benefit we get out of this mix of aircraft types is, as demand patterns and levels change, we can adjust our capacity accordingly. What's unique about this model is normally when you've got complexity of fleet, you have higher cost. By having businesses fit for purpose, we've managed the cost base and, at the same time, set ourselves up to maximize revenue opportunities.</p><p>So turning to the market itself and the management of capacity. We've spoken to our network advantage. We've spoken about the way we have the sophisticated approach to managing our capacity, and we now have new management in our competitor, who are saying they are very, very focused on the bottom line.</p><p>If you turn to the market, what we are clearly seeing, certainly in the East Coast of the domestic market is softness and that softness warrants capacity discipline. For the first half of this financial year, we expect both the Virgin Group and the Qantas Group to have flat capacity. Virgin Group have publicly stated for the second half, their capacity levels will be minus 2% year-on-year. Up until this weekend, we had seen them address 1 point and they were published at 2.9%. Over the weekend, they have made a number of changes and removed 2.3 points of capacity out of the market. With normal operational cancellation rates as your assumption, that gets you to minus 1% for the Virgin Group for second half.</p><p>For us, we are published at 1.8% today, excluding the resource markets, where we are seeing significant growth. Including resource markets, we are at 2.2%. What we will do is come back to the points I was making earlier, this disciplined approach that we have to capacity management. Alan, Gareth, Vanessa, Rob and I will meet with the teams this week, and we will consider the demand levels, our strategic positions, our peak, our super peak, the frequency and the seats we have in the markets, the competitor capacity that's in the market, we will give due consideration to all of those things and make adjustments accordingly. But it's done with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. And that is the power of the process that we have put in place and refined over many years that we have deep insights to demand, and we adjust accordingly, and we work as one team.</p><p>So what does this mean in terms of operating margins. Let me again start with Jetstar that has the highest operating margin on that chart. And what you need to consider when comparing Jetstar with everybody else. 30% of the Jetstar Flying, Tiger operates across 30% of that Jetstar network. Virgin operates across 70% of the Jetstar network. Virgin is as much a competitor for premier -- for the leisure market as Tiger is. And that's what's impressive in those operating margins because Jetstar enjoys double-digit margin advantage, not only over Tiger but also over Virgin. And Qantas has improved its rest premium by 2 points in the last 3 years and has reduced the cash gap between Qantas and Virgin through its business transformation program, and we believe that gap to be currently about 5%. That's what's led to the operating margin advantage and the absolute operating margins we've enjoyed to date.</p><p>Over the course of the next 3 slides, I'm going to explain to you how and why does it get better from here. Again, let's start with Jetstar. There's been much talk already about the power of what the NEOs are going to do for our business, and Gareth, again, will go into more detail on this after Tina has spoken. But look at the numbers, a 23% fuel saving per seat, 25% more seats, a 12% lower CASK. And the fourth point on there is very, very important, the utilization. So what the NEOs will allow Jetstar to do once we've built to scale, is operate out of East Coast cities up to a port like Bali overnight. The aircraft takes Jetstar customers up there that, in turn, releases 787 capacity to operate elsewhere in Jetstar's international network. It's back in the morning to operate the Jetstar Domestic rail. So we get significant upside in utilization, driving down unit costs, and the customer gets a better offering. The digitization of Jetstar's operation means moving to paperless engineering, predictive maintenance, automated load sheets.</p><p>The automation focus is on things like automation of refunds and price guarantees. And then if you turn to the other side of that slide, there's considerable customer benefits from the NEO, improved seats, large overhead bins, BYO devices for in-flight streaming.</p><p>I've already spoken to Jetstar's strength in ancillary revenue in the way it's used its distribution strengths to maximize its operating margins.</p><p>If we turn to Qantas cost focus that's up there, there's words on the page there about digital integration and asset utilization and fuel efficiency, but let me bring that to life with a few examples, and Rob has already touched on 1 or 2 of those. Our pilots enjoy an application called Flight Pulse. All of our pilots have an iPad. Now given this application, and what it allows them to do is compare their flying with their peers. It's back to Rob's point before about ownership. The only person who determines how much fuel we're going to put in an aircraft is the pilot in charge, and that will never change. But by having this app, what they can do is compare themselves with the other 2,300 pilots we have in the group. It allows them to look at the way they've done land -- takeoffs and approaches and landings. It allows them to compare themselves with their peers when it comes to single-engine taxi. It allows them to compare themselves with their peers on the use of discretionary fuel they load into the aircraft.</p><p>So we've given them the tools and they can learn and learn from their peers. Our engineers, all have iPads. It's called QE:Touch. It allows the line maintenance engineers, not the base ones that Rob was talking to, the line ones that are operating at gates overnight to check that aircraft are all good to go for the morning. They've got all the information they need on an iPad in hand. We've built an app so that when an aircraft is at a gate and it's using an auxiliary power unit, the power in the aircraft, for too long, the engineers are alerted. They go to the gate and they replace the auxiliary power unit with a ground power unit saving money. We have reserve levels for crew. And what we're doing is using all the rich data we have to analyze disrupts. And then from that information, be smarter at the way we plan those reserve crews instead of just having a flat level. We're trialing in Melbourne at the moment, trials to use digital data so that every turn that we do, we're analyzing where all of the equipment and people are and where we're behind on a particular turn, we can move our assets to speed that turn up. They're examples that are in place today.</p><p>So imagine what we can do over the next 5 years with all the data that we're going to harness and our people working with us owning the solutions.</p><p>On the revenue side for Qantas. I'm not going to steal Steph's, I'm just -- she's going to talk to you at length this afternoon about the opportunity in front of us, but we have done something quite unique. We now enjoy, as of August this year, the very freedoms that Jetstar has enjoyed from its inception. We have worked with the industry. We've worked with travel agents. We've worked with the global distribution systems, and we've changed our model and changed it radically. And as a result, we now have freedoms that we never had before. We have the freedom to make the right offer at the right price through the right channel, the right time to the right customer. And combined with our personalization AI-driven engine and our revenue management sophistication that Rob spoke to, we can move to dynamic pricing, and we are ahead of the industry in what we're doing. As I said, Steph will explain in more detail this afternoon.</p><p>So in summing up, if you think about what we've just talked to, our unique dual-brand network advantage. And I don't know of another airline group in the global aviation industry that manages dual-brand in the way Qantas does. Maintaining our customer focus, which has been key through our transformation. Even in the worst of times, Qantas never ever lost sight of its customer. I can tell you when we had those large losses and those large redundancies, and we were going through all of the programs that Rob outlined, we never stopped investing in service training. It's critical to our offering, not only in the domestic market but right across the entire group.</p><p>The rigorous and rational capacity management is the third thing that we're bringing to the table. And the fourth I've just spoken to, which is both the revenue and the cost initiatives inherent in the programs in both Qantas and Jetstar.</p><p>So breaking into a little bit of Australian vernacular, what's the pump test. Can you believe that this is actually achievable? Is it doable? Does it stack up, mate? All right. So just think about this. These are things you need to believe to be able to achieve 18% and 22%. You need to believe in the market going forward that capacity is aligned with demand, fuel and FX movements. And with a rational player now incentivized on bottom line profitability, I think that's believable. You've got to believe that excluding fuel, our CASK in Jetstar and Qantas will rise by about 1% per annum, reflective of higher depreciation because of new aircraft and new tech, the investment we're making in revenue-driven initiatives and an assumption that we are looking at a lower-growth environment. Those things we build into that assumption around 1% CASK increase. And then you're looking at a RASK growth of 2.5% per annum in line with average GDP growth.</p><p>What does that mean for the customer? For a Qantas customer, that means an average fare increase per annum of $5 to $6. And for a Jetstar customer, that means an average fare increase of less than $3.50, inclusive of that 17% of ancillary revenue, which is growing at 8% a year. That's what you need to believe.</p><p>Thank you for listening. I look forward to your questions after both Tino and Gareth have given their addresses. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Andrew. I thought you ran away with the clicker there for a moment. Very good. Our next presenter is Tino La Spina, the CEO of Qantas International. Tino, I'm sure, is very well-known to all of you, who's been at the Qantas Group for 13 years in a variety of roles, including our last Group CFO. He's appointed to the role of CEO of Qantas International on the 1st of October this year. Over the past few years, Qantas International has been transforming into a fit and profitable and competitive business. Our focus now is to build out from our strong home market in Australia to build a sustainable competitive advantage in the international market. Tino will unpack how we plan to do that. So please come to the stage, Tino.</p><p>TINO LA SPINA, CEO OF QANTAS INTERNATIONAL, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Thanks, Fran. And good morning, everyone. I was getting myself prepared for this and getting really focused. And then I hear Andrew David say, does it stack up, mate? Look, today, I wanted to take you through how we are building competitive advantage at Qantas International and how this sets us up to achieve a return on invested capital greater than our cost of capital.</p><p>In 2013, Qantas International was indeed in need of transformation. Since then, we've implemented revenue and cost initiatives in excess of $1 billion. The network has changed significantly as we leveraged our partnerships to play to our strengths. In 2013, Europe accounted for about 1/3 of the group's capacity. Today, it's at 8%. Asia accounted for 44%. Today, 55%, reflecting the fact that it's the fastest-growing aviation region in the world, with traffic growth over that period of about 45%. And in North America, we maintained our strength, where traffic has grown by 34%. Prior to 2030 -- 2013, we had no joint businesses. Today, we have Emirates, China Eastern and American Airlines. Aircraft utilization has increased by 17% over that period. And we expect that to improve even further as we retire the 747s.</p><p>In terms of product, in 2013, we had 4 different business class products across the 767, the 747, the A330 and the A380. By the end of next year, we'll have consistent lie-flat suites, with direct dial access in each of our A330s, 787s and A380s. It will be the best, most consistent product we've had in our history.</p><p>Since financial year '14, our profit improved by nearly $800 million. And we've been achieving ROIC greater than our cost of capital. In summary, today, we're a better airline for our customers, our people and for you, our shareholders, a solid foundation as we prepare to enter our next 100 years.</p><p>You've probably taken the key theme today is around -- is our focus on competitive advantage. And today, whilst we have more, I want to focus on 3 sources of competitive advantage. Firstly, our strength in the Australian market. Second, our partnerships and how we leverage them both to complement our network and monetize the distribution strength that we have in Australia. And last, how technology allows us to better compete by allowing us to create onshore hubs in Australia and to overflow our competitors' hubs. So let's explore each of these.</p><p>So our strength is derived by our home market strength. As Andrew showed us, we have the best domestic network. As Liv will show us, we have the best loyalty program. And combined, they give us the best distribution strength. Of the top 100 destinations ex Australia, we sell 88 of them. We operate as a group, including Jetstar, 31 of these in our own right. In terms of customer segments, we have 3 core customer segments, the same as we do for Domestic: The corporate, SME and leisure. As you know, we have 80% of the corporate market domestically, and 98% of corporates fly both domestically and internationally. And our corporate dealing model requires our corporates to attain share targets, both domestically and internationally, to attract discounts. 90% of our SMEs fly both domestically and internationally. In fact, combined, corporate and SMEs represent around 15% of our passengers, but nearly 1/3 of our revenue.</p><p>In terms of leisure, 71% of our tiered frequent flyers also both fly domestically and internationally. Whilst not as profitable as the corporate and SMEs, leisure travelers represent around 85% of our passengers and more than 2/3 of our revenue.</p><p>In summary, no other airline has the quality of premium customers that we have. And no other airline can offer a better, more comprehensive solution.</p><p>So where do our customer segments fly. This slide sets out to show us the commonality. If you see, Auckland is the #1 destination across all customer segments. Singapore is in the top 3 across all customer segments. In fact, 8 of the top 10 corporate destinations are in the top 10 for all segments. This is significant as it provides not only network synergy, but it also mitigates the impact of seasonality on our business.</p><p>So this matrix sets out the destinations in terms of the relevance to our customers or where most of them want to fly and our competitive advantage. It helps describe why we fly where we fly and where we leverage our partnerships. For example, if you look at the Tasman in the top left quadrant, many of our customers want to fly there, and we've got multiple frequencies there, but so too to our competitors. Whilst we're very competitive, we have a relatively lower competitive advantage. In contrast, look at Perth-London in the top right-hand quadrant. Again, important to our customers. But here, we significantly, we had a competitive advantage, where we are the only nonstop carrier between Perth and London. In the bottom left quadrant, we have Beijing. It's relevant to our corporate market but has high competitive intensity. Beijing has seen 20% capacity growth since we resumed flying. That's why we recently announced that we'd cease operating there and instead leveraged the China Eastern partnership. The partnerships also help us serve other parts of the network that don't have enough traffic to and from Australia to be able to justify us having a service there. And then in the bottom right quadrant, we've got services that we operate opportunistically. In other words, there's not enough traffic to operate year round. But we can operate to places like Sapporo and Vancouver during the ski season, destinations that are attractive to the Australian market.</p><p>Partnerships. They weren't only an important part of our transformation journey, but they're also an important part of our forward strategy. They provide 2 key advantages. Our partnerships supplement our network beyond our gateways. In fact, passengers that connect to and from our partners drive $2.5 billion of revenue to Qantas. I'll use the example of the Qantas Flight 36 going Melbourne to Singapore. Over financial year '19, we had 615 discrete origin destinations that operated on that -- that flew on that aircraft. Clearly, we can't fly to all of those places, but our partners can get those passengers onto our network. And our partnerships also allow us to monetize the distribution strength that we have in Australia.</p><p>In 2019, we sold $1.5 million of revenue on our partners, and all of that was profitable. In 2012, we operated to Frankfurt. We had a daily service, we needed 3 747s of capacity to flow to Frankfurt. And we lost more than $70 million. In financial year '19, we sold about $23 million in Frankfurt on Emirates, all of it profitable and no invested capital. So we've got 4 types of partnerships. Firstly, we leverage Jetstar network, both domestically and internationally. For example, providing connectivity to and from our Singapore hub. And Gareth is going to talk more about that in a minute.</p><p>We have our joint businesses with Emirates, China Eastern and American Airlines. We've got 30 codeshare partners. We've got 130 interline partners. And as a result, since 2013, our commissions -- our commission revenue has grown by over 500%. In fact, 40% of all of our customers connect either to or from a partner.</p><p>Turning to the 3 joint businesses. With Emirates, we're heading into our seventh year. We sell 50 destinations to Europe, Middle East and Africa, all profitable one-stop destinations. To give you a sense of scale, last year, we had 1.8 million passengers traveling across the partnership.</p><p>American Airlines. As you know, we recently received ATI approval from the antitrust immunity from the U.S. We have the best network and the best frequent flyer proposition for our more than 110 million combined frequent flyers. Combined with American Airlines, we operate 61 weekly services between Australia and New Zealand and North America. With AA's domestic network, we can offer 109 destinations in North America. And we're planning to grow that to 200. Now you should see AA's domestic network as a significant funnel, which drives passengers onto our combined services, and in allowing our revenue management capability, that Rob was speaking about earlier, to really come to the fore and cherry-pick the best revenue.</p><p>And the U.S. for us is a significant opportunity. You think about outbound U.S. travel, Australia accounts for less than 1%. Between us and American Airlines, we don't have to shift traffic away from other destinations much to have a significant impact.</p><p>And then there's China Eastern. The partnership entered its 5th year. It covers 25 destinations in China. It's the largest source of inbound traffic into Australia. And passenger volumes have more than doubled since we started the partnership.</p><p>So in summary, we've got 3 great partners that we didn't have in 2013 to 3 very important regions in the world.</p><p>See if this works. So in terms of our network, so much has changed since transformation. Europe is now profitable. Asia continues to grow. We maintained a leading position on North America. We have a strong Tasman network offering connectivity to and from New Zealand. And our partnerships complement our network. As a result of our partnerships, we have 18 additional destinations to New Zealand and the Pacific. We've got 144 additional destinations in the Americas. We've got 67 additional destinations in Asia and 62 additional destinations into the Middle East, Africa and Europe. So Qantas now code on 320 destinations plus more through oneworld, interline and Qantas Frequent Flyer, bringing the total to more than 1,300 destinations. In short, we have the most comprehensive network for the Australian market.</p><p>So I've spoken about our home market strength and the strength of our partnerships as competitive advantages. I now want to focus on technology and how it provides us the competitive advantage. Now we normally don't talk about new technology as competitive advantage, mainly because, well, frankly, all of our competitors can buy the same technology. But for us, it's different. You see, historically, long-haul aircraft or large gauge, which could be challenging in seasonal lows that have high trip costs in a challenged revenue environment. And they still needed to stop in the midpoint, if you wanted to get to London or beyond the West Coast of the U.S., and we were disadvantaged as an end-of-line carrier. Now today, we've got smaller gauge aircraft with attractive unit cost and a higher proportion of premium seats, which plays to our strength, and they allow us to either hub Australia in Australia or to overfly our competitors' hubs.</p><p>For the first time in our history, the 787 allows us to connect Australia with Europe. And in a minute, I'll talk a little more about Perth-London. In terms of the Americas, the 787 allows us to develop new routes beyond Los Angeles, such as Brisbane-Chicago, which we'll be launching next year and allows us to increase frequency on thinner routes, such as San Francisco and allows us to more profitably consolidate traffic on smaller gauge aircraft between cities like L.A. and New York. And then there's Project Sunrise, where we want to leverage even newer technology, go even further from the East Coast of Australia to London and New York nonstop. And importantly, this is nonreplicable by our competitors, but more on it shortly. In summary, we contend that new technology provides us with a unique competitive advantage.</p><p>So Perth-London is an example of what technology has enabled us to do. The U.K., for us, was challenged. There were -- there are 20 one-stop competitors between the U.K., Europe and Australia today, and only 1 European carrier flies through to Australia, which underscores the challenge for the underlying carriers. It was capital-intensive, and it was loss-making. The 787 allowed us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We focused on premium. It's got 30% premium cabin versus 23% on the A380. The smaller gauge aircraft means more resilience in seasonal lows. I mean, we rarely have a problem filling the premium classes, in fact, even in the A380s, but the 380s have 371 economy class seats down the back, whereas the 787 has 166 seats. In seasonal lows, it's a much more challenging proposition. As a result, the 787 has not only a lower unit cost but has a much higher unit revenue, which equals a significantly higher margin. The 787 also allows us for the first time in our history to be able to hub Australia in Australia. Andrew took us through the domestic network before. We have multiple frequencies to Perth today from Darwin, Cairns, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Auckland even, Adelaide through to Perth, able to consolidate the traffic into the one terminal and then on to London. And it is difficult to replicate. Hub carriers can't replicate it because they don't have the traffic rights to fly between Australia and the U.K. And end-of-line carriers, it's just not that interesting to them. They don't have the aircraft to be configured in a way that they can do the mission, number one. So even though competitors have the 787, their 787 can't do that mission. And because Australia or that sector length is such a small part of their network, and it would be difficult for them to build fleet scale, even if they did get the aircraft. And importantly, even when you hit Perth, they don't have the domestic network that we do. So the results for us have been clear. Average load factor 94%. Average load factor in the premium class, 99%. We've got the highest satisfaction of any routes in our network, and it's the longest sector, and that's in all cabins.</p><p>We get a 30% revenue premium from London traffic going direct to Perth versus the one-stop alternative going over Singapore. And importantly, today, all London flying is profitable for the first time in 10 years.</p><p>And now the final frontier. The success of Perth-London gives us the confidence to look at Project Sunrise, nonstop flying between the East Coast of Australia and London and New York using smaller gauge, ultra-long range flying, with a high premium mix and the flexibility to deploy the aircraft on other long haul routes. A competitive cost base with high unit revenue. And importantly, again, it's not replicable. Hub carriers don't have the traffic rights and fleet scale makes it unattractive to end-of-line carriers just as it does for Perth -- for Perth-London. And importantly, they don't have the IP that we've developed. The 2 new additions for us has meant that we've invested a lot of time and energy and thought and expertise into building that IP, the flights planning system that Rob spoke about earlier, our approach to fatigue risk management, our unique fuel policy.</p><p>So what are the next steps. The good news is both Boeing and Airbus have the product or the capability or the aircraft that can fulfill the mission. The business case is nearly there, but we've got a couple of gaps to fill. The manufacturers are sharpening their pencils, as we speak. And we are seeking an enterprise agreement with our pilots that does deliver productivity improvements, just as we did with the 787. The research flights we're conducting are providing valuable insights. But the message for you here today is we're only going to do Project Sunrise if the business case meets strict hurdles, and we hope to make a decision by the end of this year.</p><p>So we're focused on the 3 key advantages in terms of -- versus our competitors. And I've taken you through all of those, and that's why we think that the international business today is in good shape with strong foundations. But the next year is still a transition year. We have 10 of our 14 787s in our fleet today. We will receive the remaining 4 by the end of December next year. By the end of December next year, we will have retired the remaining 6 747s. By the end of next year, we will have finished the reconfiguration of our A380s, with all new J class seats. We will improve the premium density on that aircraft. We're adding 6 additional business class seats as part of that reconfiguration. We're adding 25 premium economy seats, and we're taking out 30 economy seats.</p><p>The American Airlines alliance will be a year on. We'll have grown our network into the U.S. from 109 destinations to more than 200. So we're confident that we're in a position to achieve return on invested capital greater than our cost of capital through the cycle, as we make the case to conquer the last frontier in Project Sunrise. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thank you, Tino. I think one of the things we can be sure of is having the next CFO as the CEO of Qantas International if the numbers don't stack up. But I think we'll be doing -- accounts don't stack up. Our next presenter is Gareth Evans, the CEO of Jetstar Group. Gareth will also be familiar to many of you. He's been with the Qantas Group for 20 years in a variety of roles, including Group CFO, CEO of Qantas International. He's appointed to the role of CEO of Jetstar Group about 2 years ago, and he will take you through how we are aligning both Qantas and Jetstar to benefit from the amazing growth that we see in the Asia Pacific region. He'll also do a bit of a deep dive into Jetstar Japan, which is a great growth opportunity for the group. Please come up, Gareth.</p><p>GARETH R. EVANS, CEO OF JETSTAR GROUP, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Good afternoon, everybody. So I'm on the shift just before lunch, so it's me that's standing between you and that. And more importantly, I see Neil here, it's me that's standing between you and listening to Neil Perry talk to you about lunch.</p><p>So what I am planning to do is take you on a trip through Asia for the next 20, 25 minutes or so. Sorry, somebody's Siri's -- phone has just gone off. So Alan said at the beginning that Asia is one of the -- the growth of Asia is one of the major global forces that is shaping the world. And clearly, we have a huge proportion of our network pointed to that diverse continent. As Tino said, 55% of Qantas International flying, over 80% of Jetstar International flying is pointed towards Asia. And I'm sure we're all in the room, well aware of the staggering growth statistics that come when you talk about Asia, but it is worthwhile just kind of refreshing our memory as we talk about this.</p><p>So Asia is expected to have a population of just under 5 billion people by 2030. That's 58% of the world's population. 19 of the 30 cities with greater than 10 million population are in Asia. And importantly, for travel, that key middle class group, households earning over USD 20,000 a year, is predicted to double in the years to 2030. And that's reflected on the growth of the Asian travel markets, on this slide, which really absolutely reflects the rise of Asia. Boeing estimates that the Asia Pacific region will have just under 40% of the world's airline fleet by the late 2030s.</p><p>In terms of inbound traffic and travel to and from Australia, there's some statistics on this chart. 65% to 70% of all traffic to and from Australia will be within the Asia Pacific region by financial year '27. 80% of that traffic will be leisure or VFR. And it will result in just staggering $173 billion total tourism spend versus $126 billion in FY '18. So the growth is enormous, and the statistics are enormous. The growth between now and FY '27 of inbound Asian traffic to Australia is forecast to be 8%, double that from inbound from the rest of the world or outbound from Australia.</p><p>So in terms of the competitive advantages that we are going to leverage and are leveraging, how we're going to compete in this hugely opportune -- huge opportunity and huge growth market. And unsurprisingly, they're very similar to the competitive advantages that have been talked about in the previous sessions. We're going to leverage our brand strength. We are going to fly where Australians want to fly. And that enables us to leverage those domestic markets, the trust that both the Qantas brand and the Jetstar brand have in the eyes of the Australian public. We will leverage our home market strength also into partnerships and codeshare deals to extend our network reach outbound, but also to achieve greater offshore distribution to participate profitably in those inbound markets.</p><p>Andrew also spoke about the sophistication of our dual-brand strategy. And we've been able to export that to markets where Jetstar branded airlines operate offshore: Japan, Singapore and Vietnam. Asia is also dynamic, and having dual brands with different fleets and operating models gives us the flexibility to respond to the changing market. And this will increasingly be the case when we get the ultra-flexible A321LRs and XLRs in the future and also increasingly from growth of aircraft like 787s in Qantas.</p><p>And finally, the strength that we have in the domestic market when we bring Asian tourists and visitors back to Australia means that we can participate profitably in those higher-yielding Asian inbound tourists.</p><p>So in terms of Asia, Asia is not one place. If you say it quickly, it sounds like one place, it isn't. It's a diverse continent from a cultural perspective and it's a diverse continent from an operating perspective from an airline point of view. And this chart here shows the varying inbound and outbound traffic flows, market percentages for various countries across Asia. And because of that diversity, we have to have different approaches.</p><p>On the left-hand side, you've got markets that have got high outbound credentials. And for these markets, with that strong outbound strength, we want to fly directly to them. You've got Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines there, ones where it's primarily dominated by Australians.</p><p>In the middle, you've got more balanced markets. Again, markets that you want to fly to directly, but ones that need more thought and have more strategic challenges. Markets like India, Japan and Singapore. And clearly, 2 of those markets are very, very strategic for us, and we have in place ostensibly a dual-brand operation, leveraging Qantas and a locally based Jetstar branded airline.</p><p>And on the right-hand side, you have markets where inbound dominates. We have to be even more careful because we have less competitive advantages in those markets, markets like China and Korea, and I'll talk about those a little more later on.</p><p>So here are the network maps across Asia of Qantas and Jetstar. And first and foremost, we fly where Australians want to go. We fly to 17 of the top outbound destinations with either the Qantas brand or the Jetstar brand or both of those brands. Tino has just explained how Qantas structures its routes around where Australia's corporates, frequent flyers and premium leisure passengers fly. The Jetstar International network is also very focused, but it has different criteria.</p><p>So firstly, there's those large outbound markets such as Bali and Phuket, where we leverage our strong domestic position for price-sensitive leisure flyers underpinned by being the lowest cost operator in the market. Bali is a great example of the dual-brand at work. With the rise of the number of 4, 5 and 6-Star resorts for premium travelers, Qantas has carved out a greater high-end customer segment and operates now directly and successfully to Bali. Meanwhile, leisure travelers are looking for good value and simply can't get enough of the flights that Jetstar operates to Bali. And with new A321LRs on the way with their smaller capacity and longer range, Jetstar can look at flying to Bali from Australian cities we don't already serve on routes, for example, like Avalon to Bali.</p><p>Now turning to Singapore. So Singapore has always had a key role in the Qantas International network. And in 2007, it also became host of the first offshore Jetstar branded airline. Now Jetstar Asia, which is currently operating with a fleet of 18 aircraft, has grown to be the second largest low fares operator in Singapore behind the Singapore Airlines owned operator, Scoot. And it absolutely is a fantastic airline. It actually leads the Qantas Group in operational reliability, on-time performance, customer service satisfaction and employee engagement. Now the profitability of this airline has been challenged in recent years, partly because of fuel and foreign exchange, but also because of the introduction of high airport taxes and charges, things like the Changi Airport Development Levy as Singapore and Changi look to grow and develop an enormous airline to be a hub for the next 50 years. And so we're working very hard on improving the financial performance of that airline. But it's not just the stand-alone financial performance of Jetstar Asia that is important to the group because, with the rehubbing of Qantas International into Singapore, we are undertaking and operating a dual-brand strategy within that market. So Jetstar Asia is now providing significantly increased levels of connectivity to Qantas International. And we are deliberately adjusting and altering the timing of services to tighten and improve those connections. Connecting passengers on Jetstar Asia have increased by 80% in FY '19, 72% of that with Qantas and a further 35% increase is expected in FY '20, growing Jetstar Asia's revenue contribution to the group network offering.</p><p>We also use Jetstar Asia as a testbed for some of the innovation that the group will bring out across both brands. For example, at the moment, it's the trial location for new bag tagging technology and new full body security scanners with Changi Airport.</p><p>Also interestingly, Jetstar Asia, it's not just as an airline for Singapore, but is an airline for Southeast Asia as a whole. So 36% of sales on Jetstar Asia come from Singapore point of sale, but 14% come from Australia, 9% from Indonesia, 8% from China, 6% from Japan and the other 27% spread right around Southeast Asia. While we're in this part of Asia, I can't not mention India. So India, what appears to be and is another significant growth market, is in fact the fastest-growing inbound market to Australia with 18% growth, but it is coming off a very low base. And moreover, its geographical fragmentation means that market, the traffic from individual cities, including the large ones, is low in volume. So right now, India is best served by hubs. Around 90% of traffic from India travels via the hub of Singapore. And unfortunately, right now, there is no more bilateral capacity available for Jetstar Asia to operate from Singapore to India, restricting the group's access to that market. But in the medium to long term, as passenger numbers and yields rise, there's absolutely potential to use Australian-based aircraft to fly to key Indian cities via Singapore, leveraging Australian fifth freedom rights. And in the longer term, as yields and passenger numbers grow even further, there's absolutely potential for the group to operate direct services from the East Coast of Australia to cities such as Mumbai and, potentially, Delhi and Bangalore.</p><p>Moving to China.</p><p>China was on the right-hand side of the graph that I showed earlier. It is the largest source of inbound passengers to Australia, overtaking New Zealand about 18 months ago. However, inbound Australian market is dominated by Chinese airlines. And we, as a group, have few competitive advantages to profitably serve the Chinese market. We have low brand recognition, we have low distribution strength, Jetstar is not the lowest cost airline on the route. And regional governments in China are subsidizing those Chinese airlines unsustainably in the long term. There is a significant amount of losses being experienced by airlines operating this route. And the key to our strategy is only operating where we can make for profitable and a profitable return.</p><p>So we have made a strong performance of our route to Shanghai, because there is a high proportion of high-value Australian business travelers on that route, and we can leverage those using the competitive advantages that I've talked about, but other flying direct into China is hampered by the disadvantages that we have in this market.</p><p>So we have looked to leverage partners. We've got a joint business with China Eastern, which leverages the strong Australian outbound demand, but we also have codeshares with China Southern and with Cathay Pacific. Moreover, the codeshares with these 2 out of the 3 Mainland Chinese carriers operate between them over 3/4 of the capacity to Australia. And the group is well-positioned to pick up domestic connections, which it will seek to do as yields in the market rise. We also have niche access to freight capacity and freight bilaterals enabling us to operate freighters on a triangle from Australia to China across to the U.S. and back to Australia.</p><p>The Jetstar-branded airlines in Singapore and Vietnam do operate charters and regular passenger charter flights into China as well, opportunistically taking advantage of market opportunities when they arise. And Jetstar in Australia has now twice operated our RPT charters to Wuhan and to Zhengzhou, which are good money when the opportunity is there, but the charterers tend to move quickly from market to market and from operator to operator, and you simply cannot plan and invest capital for the long-term in opportunities like that.</p><p>Moving on to Vietnam, Vietnam is a market with substantial growth but there are very challenging market dynamics. On paper, Vietnam has the hallmarks of a great place to be running an airline. Its GDP per capita is 17% growth. Inbound tourism grew by more than 15% last year and in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, they have the sixth largest city pier in the world. But it is highly competitive. There are 3 new local airlines applying for AOCs: Vietjet is looking to double its fleet; Bamboo plans to triple its fleet by 2021, and AirAsia has entered the market a couple of times and we will imagine will do so again.</p><p>Our direct services using the Jetstar brand from Sydney and Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh are performing strongly, but domestically, Vietnam is an incredibly competitive market. There's 35% capacity growth going on in that domestic market currently. And whilst there is still some yield growth which is amazing and shows how much traffic growth there is in that market, it does remain challenging. Our joint venture with Vietnam Airlines has underpinned Jetstar Pacific's success and operations domestically, and whilst Jetstar Pacific did turn a profit in FY '18, it is important we continue to focus on finding efficiencies in our ways of working to compete effectively and efficiently in this crowded marketplace.</p><p>I'll now turn to Japan. So over the past 70 years, the group has worked hard to establish and defend a multifaceted position in the Japanese market. And as I said at the outset, in our Asian strategy, it is the plan to play to our competitive advantages, and this is best exemplified in Japan across both Australia to Japan, Japan to Asia and our Japanese domestic operations.</p><p>Japan has overtaken China in terms of inbound tourism growth. At the same time, Japan is the #1 market in North Asia for Australians, and as a group, we have the #1 position. With such, such strong bidirectional flows, the group is very well-positioned to grow and is now operating more than 40 frequencies a week. 75% of the seats on the market between Australia and Japan are operated by the Qantas Group and we use dual-brands to unlock opportunities at both ends. Most recently, as Tino mentioned with the introduction of the seasonal Sydney (inaudible), the closest airport to the Sapporo ski fields. In the near term, we will grow Haneda using Qantas and increase our low-cost market penetration with Jetstar as X Boeing 787s are redeployed when the A321s enter the Jetstar fleet. Looking further out, the potential to serve Japan with A321 XLRs from FY '25 could mean new point-to-point narrow-body markets, such as (inaudible).</p><p>Domestically, Japan is the world's fifth largest aviation market. It's stable, it's profitable and it has incredible potential for growth. Only -- currently only 1 in 10 seats are low-cost. A market such as Japan should support 20% to 30% of seats being sold to price-sensitive leisure travelers. So we think that this low-cost segment has room to double or even triple in size. Jetstar Japan, our joint venture with JAL, is the largest domestic low-cost carrier and is the clear #1 at Narita. Since its launch in 2012, more than 30 million customers are flying with Jetstar Japan to 20 destinations, 16 domestically and 4 internationally.</p><p>Now it takes a long time to establish an airline in Japan, given it's a highly regulated market where growth is controlled. And so we've managed to grow this airline now to 25 aircraft, and it is very, very well-established in the market. It's a market that's difficult to penetrate, and we have done it. And in fact, that regulation and that slowness is actually now a protection for us in the future because any new entrant to the market is going to have to wade through that in order to get to the position that we have got to. We're the biggest. There is Peach in the market as well, which is ANA's joint venture. That is of a still slightly smaller size than us domestically, but really now, the market structure protects those 2 airlines and gives us a real opportunity to take advantage of the significant growth going forward.</p><p>We've got 25 aircraft today. This airline can easily grow bigger than Jetstar domestically in Australia. The brand is also well-established. It's #63 most recognized brand in Japan out of all brands. It's more recognized than Tiffany, it's more recognized than YouTube, it's only just behind ANA and JAL as in recognition and no other low-cost carrier is in the top 100 brands. We have 4 years of profitability behind us, a ROIC of 10%, we are the most profitable low-cost carrier in the market. And now we can self-fund growth from 25 soon to be 28 aircraft with the arrival of the first A321s, to 35 aircraft by FY '23 and then beyond. This is quite an achievement for an Australian-based Asian airline.</p><p>And there is more growth potential beyond the borders of Japan. So flights into Japan have grown 27% CAGR since FY '12, and the vast majority of this is leisure. Infrastructure has struggled to keep pace, unlocking returns for early movers.</p><p>In total, Jetstar-branded airlines have the largest market share from a low-cost perspective to Japan, with not only the flights from Jetstar Japan but from Jetstar Asia and from Jetstar Australia into the market. With the arrival of the A321s, it opens up new destinations as well. Taken together, 1/3 of the world's population is within range of an A321 LR from Narita. And whilst we're not going to fly to it all, what we will do is continue the proven and profitable strategy of seeking competitive advantage where brand distribution and low-cost economics overlap.</p><p>And what about other markets? Well, there's Korea. Again, at the right-hand end of that graph, but a huge opportunity. Koreans have the highest propensity to travel of any nation in the world. I thought it was Australians, and we're the top 2, but Koreans outrank us. And Korea has the same sort of criteria, the same personality as a market as Japan did a number of years ago. It has significant low-cost penetration, but there are no low-cost carriers on the route between Australia and Korea, and so we're going to launch a direct service, 3 per week, Incheon-Gold Coast starting on the 8th of December, partnered with Jeju Airlines. Jeju are the biggest and most well recognized airline in Korea, and we need a partner in that market to help us with distribution and brand recognition. This is an exciting new route for the Qantas Group, adding a new destination and a new country to the group map. The Korean end of the bilateral is full, and we will be the only low-cost carrier on this underserved market. So we are very, very optimistic about how this market will perform.</p><p>It's been a great example of governments and airports working together with the group to get this underway. And we look forward to more partnerships to build and grow new markets between Australia and Asia.</p><p>So just finally, turning to the A321, which will help unlock these markets and this growth from a Jetstar perspective. And Andrew has talked about this, Vanessa has talked about this, and I just want to touch on exactly why this is important for Jetstar. We talked about the economics. They are super-efficient aircraft. But the range of these planes unlock something special for Jetstar. Currently, our high-density A320s do not have the range for our biggest international market, which is East Coast Australia to Bali. This will change in July 2020 with the arrival of the A321LRs, they will have 232 seats and will unlock substantially lower trip costs and allow us to serve Bali overnight direct from Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. And the business case is a fantastic one. So for 4 A321LRs, we can release 3 787s currently flying on Bali and then redeploy them elsewhere within the Jetstar International network to Asia. This is a fantastic business case as it takes a lower value asset of 321 and releases a higher value asset. And these planes will primarily be flying domestically but then have the flexibility to fly internationally making sure that we hold our position on Bali. And then as we redeploy the 787s, potentially grow capacity to Bali, grow capacity to Japan, grow capacity to Korea and elsewhere across the continent. This is a truly phenomenal aircraft for us with great economics and huge strategic value will really unlock the next round of growth for Jetstar International. We're looking at 9% growth per annum across the years from 2020 to 2022.</p><p>So Asia is the place to be when it comes to capitalizing on aviation growth. And to maximize the opportunity the region brings, the Qantas Group has a clear and proven strategy. Asia can be challenging, but we're going to come -- play to our competitive advantages. We're going to continue to fly where Australians want to go, we're going to leverage our partnerships to build our reach, we're going to apply a dual-brand strategy that has been so successful in Australia to other markets. And we're going to maximize the domestic opportunities from inbound traffic. The arrival of the 321s mid-next year brings even greater flexibility for us and efficiencies to our operations and we very much look forward to them arriving in our fleet.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Gareth. If you take a seat, and I'll ask Andrew, Tino and Vanessa to join you on stage. We'll now open the Q&amp;A session. If Alan would like to come up and direct.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Thanks, Fran. Okay, do we want to go in the room. We're also, for people on the webcast, we're also allowing people to ask questions as well. But we'll start in the room. Yes. Anthony? Have you changed jobs yet?</p><p>ANTHONY MOULDER: Any -- you're better than that, Alan.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Sorry, I did apologize earlier.</p><p>ANTHONY MOULDER: We'll get back to that. A question for International, Project Sunrise, can you detail us what needs to change, how the business case is stacking up with the aircraft and the pilots? And whether or not Air New Zealand's flight from Auckland to New York changes the hurdle.</p><p>TINO LA SPINA: So the business goes, as I said before, Anthony, the -- we've got the Airbus A350 ULR, and we've got the 777X. Both products can do the mission. The economics and what we've been asking from the manufacturer, we're in through a best and final offer phase, we've asked them to go back and relook at that to sharpen their pencils because there still was a gap there. So we are eagerly awaiting to see what we get back from that. And that's not just around price as well. That covers things like guarantees the what-ifs, because this aircraft is going to be in the fleet for the next 20 years and we want to cover off eventualities because if you were going to buy the aircraft for these ultra-long range-flying, you certainly wouldn't choose that aircraft as well. So we're making sure that it's future proofed. In terms of the pilots, we are seeking productivity improvements from the pilots. And we think it's achievable. I think the -- in terms of the community of employees that have the most to gain from growth, it is the pilots, right. So the growth in the international business does bring promotion opportunities for our existing contingent. And our promotion is really the biggest pay rise they'll get in their career as well. And so -- but when you think about the mission that we're looking at even the current enterprise bargaining agreement doesn't contemplate doing missions beyond 20 hours. And a Sydney to London will breach that in terms of GD hours. So we need a new agreement anyway to cover what that flying will look like. So that's got to be done. We're also looking at fatigue risk management system in place because that will determine how many crew and what mix of crew you need on the aircraft. And that's part of the work that we've been doing on the research flight is to get stats on that. But that's only one small part. We've been doing research on some of the flights that we've got already between Perth and London. So the hurdle rate is clear. We still seek to achieve our cost of capital, more than our cost of capital on any investment. Nothing's changed. The financial framework that Vanessa spoke about and that discipline, nothing there has changed, and nor does Air New Zealand service change anything for us as well. I mean, they're going to be a competitor for us. But they won't be able to fly, they're not going to be flying between Australia and New York nonstop. This is a niche market for us, right?</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: I will say, I mean, there's a couple of things. The interest that we're getting from people as a consequence of doing these, the flights were done for technical reasons to understand the fatigue risk management and to understand the impact on people, but the media attention that they generate is quite massive. And I think everybody is talking about it. And the general consensus we're getting is that there is huge demand for this. And I think the premium that we've been looking at, the 30% that Tino talked about from the Perth to London that we're getting today, that's the type of premium we're expecting from the Sydney-Melbourne Services. It could be bigger than that, but we're going to be conservative on the revenue projections coming from this. And I think the other thing is the counterfactual if you don't do it. And I would rather -- I was looking at New Zealand within that context because if I were Air New Zealand, given the range they have from Auckland into the U.S., which is an important market for us, I'd [do] more of the [New Yorks] over time. And our competitive challenges is to counteract that, and flying direct into these markets from Sydney and Melbourne is the way to do that. So I think that that improves the business case if anything for us to do over the long term of today. And I think that's the way we're looking at it.</p><p>Is it Jake again?</p><p>JAKOB CAKARNIS: Guys just building out on the assumptions that are going into Sunrise, I know it's still early days. You said 30% revenue premium. Can you give us an indication of what the initial fleet size will look like, what you're expecting for loads and how that might compare to Perth-London, say, at the moment? And then any other indications that's going into the investment case?</p><p>TINO LA SPINA: I'm going to be a bit vague on this one, Jake. So we haven't actually talked about how many aircraft we're going to be ordering. Suffice to say, we're not only going to be using it for London and New York, and we are looking for both Melbourne and Sydney. But we are looking at cities like Sydney and Melbourne to Chicago directly as well because even the 787 can't do it from Sydney. It can do it from Brisbane. So we do have some assumptions in the business case. Obviously, we're pretty clear on what we will be asking for. And the other thing that I could probably give a bit of color on is just the configuration of the aircraft, whilst not going into the actual sequence, but we are looking at having 4 class configuration. And making it such that it's appropriate for ultra-long-range flying. So you should read into that. We've got zones in there for people to be able to get up, to be able to stretch, and there's a lot of thought that's been going on into the science of fatigue as well. And the impact of long-haul flying on the body. So we are very conscious, very conscious of that. In terms of yield premiums, we gave that -- just to give you a sense, was that 30% because even that surprised us just how much people value the direct flying. Now we've -- we're not going to go into the assumptions across each of the networks and what we've got in there for yield premium. Having said that, we are expecting to get a yield premium nonstop over a 1 stop definitely.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: And the way we're looking at the capital on it is that we would gain the capital. You have to have a minimum size fleet that we're working through to make sure that the economics work. But it's certainly the opportunity is quite significant in terms of the range of routes that we have from Australia. But you wouldn't be ordering all of those aircraft simultaneously. You've gated and proved that you can make a work and then continue to increase the order over time. So we're going to be obviously very cautious on it. The same way we set up Jetstar. We set up Jetstar with a minimum number of aircraft. And then over time, it knocked around the ballpark. We added more. And Jetstar now has...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: 132.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: 132 aircraft that was nowhere near the amount of aircraft we had when we thought that business venture was going to start.</p><p>Okay. Other questions? Yes.</p><p>PAUL BUTLER: It's Paul Butler again. You've told us some pretty interesting things about how you make capacity allocation decisions and so forth. I just wonder if you can talk about where you see that you are in the journey in terms of increasing efficiency of capacity allocation, like how much of an improvement have you made over the last 3 or 4 years, how much further is there yet to go in further upside there.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Good question, Paul. I'll have Andrew here for you.</p><p>ANDREW PAUL DAVID: Paul. Look, it has been an ongoing journey. And what underpins it is the culture in the group, the fact that we're all accountable for our respective business areas, but it is always the group first. And that has been the core fundamental change. And then you bring the teams together, you do deep analysis of the customer segments. Qantas is focused on the premium end. Jetstar is all about the price-driven end. You understand the markets, you understand the demand levels. And with all the flexibility that I took you through, you then apply that. It's an ongoing process. I don't think the journey ever ends. It's like it is with safety for us. As Alan talked about earlier, it's about staying power, it's about staying on your game, and it's looking for constant refinements. But we do all kinds of things. We -- sometimes, we challenge the Jetstar team to say, okay, you manage the Qantas network and Qantas will do the opposite. We bring the teams together deliberately so that they think group first and then they refine those 2 networks. I think there's more opportunity. But we have come an awful long way in the last 4, 5 years.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Great. Other question here? Over here. Yes.</p><p>OWEN BIRRELL: Owen Birrell from Goldman Sachs again. Just a question on Project Sunrise EBA agreements. We understand that you're trying to tie the Project Sunrise EBA to other EBAs within the group. I'm just wondering why. And can't Project Sunrise stand on a separate EBA parts?</p><p>TINO LA SPINA: I might carry that one. I'm not sure what you mean by tying it to other EBAs in the group. So to actually fly the Project Sunrise, we need changes to the existing EBA. It's an enterprise agreement that pilots sign up to. So we needed changes to it because we don't have duty hours, or there's no contemplation of having duty hours greater than 20 hours. So it needs to go in there. So the question is, what is it going now? You can start as it's a new fleet type. Let's put it in on A380s in terms of conditions. You could start as, let's deal with it as we did with the 787 and bring it in on that level. But it's not contemplated at the moment. And there are different scales. So what we are seeking to do is bring it in on a reasonable scale. And then even look at things like how do we get efficiency like multi-variant flying into the organization, which would be another transformation initiative. Today, because of the [tyranny of distance] and just the way duty times work, we don't get anywhere near the 1,000 duty time limitation that pilots can do in Australia. We don't get anywhere near but imagine if you had an aircraft, it was an A350 that a pilot could move from an A350 to an A330, or they could move from a 777 to a 787. That capability exists. We just need to enhance some of our training to get ready for that. And so you need an enterprise agreement that even allows for that. We call that multi-variant flying, which improves productivity. That's not in the agreement today because it can't be done today. So we need to negotiate those things in. It's just productivity improvements. In no way are we asking any of our -- any of our pilots to take a pay cut. We're not doing that. All right? So we're saying, yes, you might have to be more productive to get the same pay, we've got that, and we're not going to apologize for that. We've been doing that for the last -- since we started transformation. But that's what we're looking at.</p><p>OWEN BIRRELL: For (inaudible), I ask -- I mean, if you're asking pilots to become more productive for the same pay, where is the incentive for them to agree to that?</p><p>TINO LA SPINA: That's easy. So these are growth aircraft, right? So if we get growth aircraft, that means that we need more pilots to fly. More pilots to fly means we get more, let's call them from, the street, which create a ripple effect through the organization as you start to promote pilots. A promotion for a pilot is the biggest payrolls they are going to get in their career. Right now, up until we've gotten the 787, you've had people stagnating as first and second officers because they haven't been able to move on. Because the captains aren't retiring, the captains aren't going anywhere. So their career stagnate. It's only through growth that you unlock new growth opportunities, promotion opportunities for our people.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: But I think maybe, Andrew, you talked about the 787s, so what's that generated in terms of recruitment and pilot promotions because I think those were great starts.</p><p>ANDREW PAUL DAVID: Yes. So pre -- the deal with pilots and the bringing in of the 78s, we would typically train 200 pilots a year. Retirements at the likes of that, which generate the [200 million]. Over the course of the last 2 years with the 78s coming in, we've trained 500 pilots a year because we bought pilots in, and they've moved both rank and type. And that's what Tino's referring to. When they move rank and type, they get a promotion and they get a pay increase. So they've seen movement. If you go back pre the 78s, all the growth had happened in Jetstar. So the exciting thing as a Qantas pilot is you are seeing opportunity, you are seeing growth. As we move into the discussions that we're having now around Sunrise, of course, there's natural tension. The pilots don't want us to say we've got to do a deal to bring the aircraft in, they would just like to see the aircraft come in. But we've got to be competitive. We have to be competitive in an international market, where fuel is the same for everybody. The deals that we do with Airbus or Boeing can be replicated. So you've got to focus on the things that you can control and labor is one of them, and the pilots represent 20% of the labor cost. So it is the right discussion to have. And we just have to work through this, and we have to focus on -- it's the age old question in any negotiation, what's in it for me? And we've been very clear what's in it for a pilot.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Can I say one last comment on this, and then we're going to have to move on to lunch because it looks like everybody is starving in here. The business case. The business case for Sunrise, to be absolutely very clear on it, there's a lot of capital that would potentially be needed for Sunrise. We have been very disciplined in the capital allocation of this group over the last decade. That's going to continue. And if we think the business case is not going to get there -- and for it to get there, everything has to work on this. We have to get a premium from our customers, which we'll get more and more comfortable with. We have to get in the position where the manufacturers contribute their contribution, we have to get the regulator on site, and we have to get the pilots on site. And if one of those factors don't click in, we won't do it. I have no problem and the management team here has no problem in saying we gave it a good try, but it didn't work. And the capital that we don't spend on this, we've got other growth opportunities that we could spend on. You're going to hear from Olivia, you're going to hear from Steph, and you're going to see the huge growth on the loyalty side and the huge potential that we have there. You saw from Tino the benefits we getting in partnerships. If we can't -- we can't make this business case working or sales will fly and direct, we'll leverage the Emirates partnership and the American Airlines partnership. And in some ways, it's lower capital. But if this does work and we can get everybody to fall together on it, are we going to go for it? Absolutely. Because when we've made the big bets on [Loyalty], when we've made the big bets on Jetstar, they paid massive dividends for our shareholders, and they've transformed this group into having sustainable competitive advantage that is unique. And I have no doubt that if we can make Sunrise work, it'll be in the same category, but we will be hardnosed about it.</p><p>I think we might then go over to talking about lunch. Can I, can I get -- maybe I'll let introduce -- can I introduce Neil Perry. Everybody knows Neil. Neil has made a huge transformation to the Qantas product now over 20 years...</p><p>NEIL PERRY;CHEF: 22.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: 22 years. And I think we've got reputation there with having the best in-flight (inaudible) airplane in the world. That's also now been extended in the last few years to what we've done on the ground. And Neil has been an amazing transformation and ambassador for Qantas. He's also really focused those, and Andrew talked about this earlier on actually buying Australian projects. We're now up to, was it about $5 billion worth of Australian projects? Some amazing projects, and he's given a lot of small companies their break internationally. That have done exceptionally well because of his passion for that project and how it can be served in Qantas and getting that window on the world.</p><p>So over to Neil to talk a little bit about what he's done and what you're going to eat for lunch.</p><p>NEIL PERRY;CHEF: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, guys. I'm sorry to be between you and a bowl of noodles. But the last 12 months, building on the last 22 years, has been incredible. And you'll taste some of the fruits of that labor at lunch. We've opened the Spice bar down in Melbourne, Business Class lounge, which has been really fantastic and had another great piece of our lounge puzzle, which is, I think, the best in the world. We're just about to open Singapore, Alan and I are doing that next week. As a matter of fact, it looks like a beautiful big dining room that I'd actually love to own, I saw photos of it yesterday and it's really quite extraordinary. So all the wonderful signature dishes with a lot of local flavor. So skate wing with sambal burnt butter is bringing up there, laksa went off the charts last night, at one of the soft openings, which is fantastic. And I think one of the really exciting things that we've been working on because of Sunrise, has really been working with CPC. And mainly food as an important part of jet lag and what we do on long-haul travel as everything else that happens within the aircraft. And I think we've changed a lot about the way that we focus and look. We're looking towards healthier options. We're looking towards options that bring on tryptophan and melatonin and serotonin, you want the good dreams. And I won't bore you with all the detail of that, but we've designed meals around it, and it looks like it's been really working from all the feedback that we've got, firstly, on the London-Perth and Perth-London flight. And now from the couple of trials that we've seen, people are really super positive about the food program. And that sense and feeling of getting people into the time zone from the moment they enter the aircraft to landing. And we're having great -- I saw the photos. Alan and the team springing off the flight from London and off the flights from New York. Everyone was full of energy, which is great. So it's fantastic that food can play a part in that. That is really exciting but it doesn't just stop at Sunrise, it goes across the entire fleet in time. We're working towards making sure that we're in the 21st century, we're developing food that people are going to need and want for long-haul travel. And we're making sure that along the way, we're talking about hydration and rehydration and some of the things that you'll taste today with Kombucha and the Spice Lemonade that we're doing with ginger and kaffir lime, which is really exciting, and the teas and all the things that you've seen in lag. We're really rolling it out through the aircraft and people are responding to it really, really well. So we know that Qantas people really -- well, frequent flyers really value our food and wine and our service package that we put together, as well as all the amazing things.</p><p>But just on a personal note before I let you go and taste some noodles and some beautiful short ribs that are braised and served with pickles and the fantastic new dessert that we've just launched -- I'm feeling really hungry. I've been vegetarian for 10 days, I'm about (inaudible) somebody. And the desserts are going to be really delicious, which is beautiful coconut mango sorbet with caramel made from palm sugar, which is, again, been a massive hit with our soft openings.</p><p>But I'd just like to say is that amazing -- I'm very much a frequent flyer. I travel a lot. I travel a lot obviously on Qantas. I love the airline itself. But personally, I'm a bit of an environmentalist, and I'm also a bit of a humanist. So I really love the fact that Qantas like my business, to not only look at profit but looks at the really important side, which is community. And the fact that I work with an airline that -- Alan's come out and talked about sustainability and where it needs to get to and is becoming a world leader, and we need voices in Australia like that in business. Because it doesn't look like government is going to help us out on that one. So we're going to have to do the heavy lifting. Obviously, incredible with all the work that was done on marriage equality and human rights. And I think super important that I -- something that I love a lot is our indigenous engagement, reconciliation is super important to us as Australians, 65,000 years of amazing culture in this country. And for me, nothing represents that like Qantas. So I couldn't be prouder. And I'm pretty sure that most shareholders and most people who invest in companies that share -- hold shares in Qantas really want to know for the future that they're involved with a company that not only delivers from the bottom line but also delivers from the heart as well.</p><p>So thank you. Enjoy lunch, and have a great day.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks. Thanks, Neil. And now I'm holding you up.</p><p>So just a couple of quick things before I let you go downstairs. Lunch will be served outside in our garden, but you can also flow into the street. We've got a lot of showcases there to show you, some of the great work that the teams around the Qantas Group are working on at the moment.</p><p>And if you collect one of these tags from the Qantas Future Planet team, write your name on the back, we will plant it, and it will grow a tree. Also, the Qantas Centenary Shop is open downstairs. A lot of our staff have been shopping there, and it's a good opportunity if any of you are keen on picking up some of the centenary product that's available there. Food will be served throughout the lunch break. We have an hour and 15 minutes. I'll ask that you're back here at 2:15. Our graduates will help rouse everybody up. And if all that makes you thirsty, we also have a hydration station out there where you can sample some of the drinks that we have, both on the ground, in our lounges and in the air.</p><p>So once again, follow the crowd downstairs to the street and be back here at 2:15.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Okay, we'll just cut off the Bee Gees there.</p><p>Okay. Well, welcome back for our third and final session of the day. I hope you enjoyed your lunch and had an opportunity to explore the showcases, I had a cuddle with (inaudible) and a bit of a photo. It was a good opportunity.</p><p>It takes a huge effort from a lot of people to put an event of this scale on and I'd like to say a big thanks to all the people involved. Most of them are back at their workplace today keeping Qantas running. There's the creative team, the events team, our strategy team, members of all of the GMC teams and of course, my team. So thank you to everyone.</p><p>For this session, we'll hear from Olivia and Rob. We'll return to stage, and Alan will wrap up for us. But first, Steph will explain how our customer strategy provides the business with sustainable competitive advantage, including explaining our focus on personalization, distribution and revenue management, as Alan said earlier today.</p><p>Steph was appointed to the role of Group Chief Customer Officer in August. She has had a 15-year career at Qantas across the airlines and loyalty businesses in a range of roles. Please come up, Steph.</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY, CHIEF CUSTOMER OFFICER, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Hi, everyone. Welcome back from lunch, we hope you enjoyed it. To the person who just wished me luck with the graveyard shift, I intend to make this not the graveyard shift for you all.</p><p>I'm going to talk you through Qantas Group's customer strategy, in particular, I'm going to talk to a couple of the global sources that have been mentioned throughout today, particularly rapid digitalization and the rise of big data but also our shift in customer preferences. And hopefully, the objective after this session is that you see that both Qantas, Jetstar and Qantas Loyalty have really clear strategies across customer, brand, data and digital that enable us to be the first choice for our customers.</p><p>So the strength of our brands across the Qantas Group, as a couple of people have already said today, really is a true competitive advantage for the group. And it's really at the heart of our customer strategy. The brands have truly never been in better shape. We are really clear, as the airline CEO spoke to this morning, on the role and purpose of each brand and the customer segments that each brand serves.</p><p>When we talk about brand, it's really critical to remember that brand is a combination of what you say and what you do. It's a lot more than just marketing and PR. And for our customers, the what you do side of the brand is critically important. Important from a social license perspective, that Andrew Parker spoke to this morning, but also incredibly important from a consistent delivery of customer experience. This is important for our current frequent flyers, but also for the next generation of frequent flyers.</p><p>The voice of the customer sits at the heart of our strategy, we are definitely in a customer era and in the midst of a digital revolution. Consumer expectations, choice and empowerment are unlike anything the world has ever seen. It's never been more important that we are listening to our customers closely, whether it's through top-down market research or bottom-up feedback we get directly. We are really working hard to have a very integrated view of our customer across the brands. This needs to be very horizontal across the group because we know our customers traverse the different Qantas brands. To that -- that customers will find it easier to give us feedback and that we will close the loop on their issues as soon as we can. We're leveraging new technology that puts customer insights into the hands of our people in real-time.</p><p>The brand has never been in a stronger position across all of our key customer and brand metrics. When you look at Qantas' NPS versus our domestic competitor, you consistently see a 10 to 15-point NPS lead. We see that NPS lead strengthened more when we invest in our experience, including the 787, the Perth-London route, as Tino mentioned this morning, and our Wi-Fi-enabled aircraft that consistently get a stronger NPS than our other aircraft. We are also seeing really positive signs already from our reconfigured A380 aircraft. With 2 more to come add on to the line shortly. Jetstar also performs really well, being the most preferred low-cost carrier in Australia and record NPS results in Australia and also in Asia.</p><p>Qantas remains the most trusted brand in Australia. And we are very focused on retaining that position. We don't take it lightly. We see a step change in the trust for Qantas versus other brands, including other full service airlines. We've maintained strength across all the key drivers of trust, including acting ethically, quality leadership and taking a stand on key social issues. The centenary year gives us an incredible platform to further enhance our brand connection with all our stakeholders, building brand equity for the future. We're very passionate that we've maintained a really consistent approach to our marketing of our brands, with our customers across the years. Many businesses, many marketers fall into the trap of constantly reinventing their brand and we know the risk in doing this, and we've avoided it. We showcase our people and we showcase real customers in an authentic way. Next year's momentous occasion gives us many opportunities for brand activations throughout the year, and we're really excited about that. But in the meantime, we just thought we'd share with you some work that showcases one of our current people, our beautiful pilot, Alana.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY: Just to touch on the way we are focused on our customer feedback, including customer complaints. We think we're well on the way to really establishing a leading culture around complaints, and we've established group advocacy forums across the business. As I said, it's really important to have a horizontal view of the customer as they traverse across the Qantas Group. And we feed all of our inputs on our customers into that group to really analyze what are the issues and emerging themes for our customers and how do we create real change. That includes looking at the journeys of our most vulnerable customers and making sure that we're delivering to their needs. Quarterly management committee and also board reporting has been established.</p><p>We've actually been looking to grow out number of customer complaints as we make sure all the feedback from all the channels is actually fed into the system, so that includes feedback we get through our frontline teams directly but also feedback we get online through social media, through our voice of the customer programs. And all of that feedback we're inputting into new customer management tools that enables us to acknowledge and solve issues, but also add it to the knowledge and history of our customers that we can use to create better customer experiences. We've also launched a number of chatbots on our qantas.com and jetstar.com pages, also helping to solve customer queries with a success rate between 75% and 80%, which we think is best practice.</p><p>So in the last little while, I just spoke to you about the voice of the customer program and also brand, which really lies at the heart of the customer strategy, illustrated in this diagram. If you look at the outer circles, we know that having excellent product service and digital experiences this is really critical for our ongoing customer experience leadership and maintaining our NPS and margin advantages. But we believe the new frontiers of competitive advantage required strengths are: a, very hard to replicate; b, very hard to disintermediate; and c, very hard to make us commoditized, lies in the inner circle of our priority customer pillars. The way we demonstrate we know our customers, the way we care for customers in their experience, particularly when things don't go to plan and how we value our customers, in particular, through our loyalty programs.</p><p>These focus areas are actually shared across the Qantas Group. They're relevant and a focus for Qantas and Jetstar, and we'll spend most time today talking about these priority areas. I'm going to focus on know me and care for me, as Olivia will also talk to the value me pillar when we talk about the great things we're doing in Qantas Frequent Flyer. So just to look at -- to start with product and service.</p><p>So we continue to focus on -- in custom products and services across the end-to-end experience, where we know it matters to customers and drives the yield and margin advantage for the business. This includes investing in our lounges, as Neil mentioned before, we've reopened all of our Melbourne lounges with considerable improvements. I'm happy to report that the Singapore First Lounge opened last night. And we had 200 people through it last night, and we had a lot of local dishes, but I'm happy to report the salt and pepper squid was the most-served dish in the Singapore lounge last night. So that increase in Singapore is exciting because it increases capacity across both lounges by 60%. So hopefully, next time you're traveling through Singapore, you get to experience the new lounge.</p><p>We've also got some upgrades planned locally in Australia, including Sydney, Hobart and Alice Springs. And obviously, in the air, we are focused on constantly creating world-class in-flight experiences, including our product, service and the way we use technology. And we know where we invest in this, we see customer satisfaction uplift, as I said, on the 787, Wi-Fi and our reconfigured A380.</p><p>Project Sunrise will enable us to consider a further step change for what the customers experience on long-haul flying. And the research flights over the last couple of weeks have given us incredible inputs also from a customer perspective and how to handle that flight length. And probably most importantly, and Andrew David mentioned it before, we've continued to invest in our front-line service training, making sure probably our most valuable asset, our people, is continually invested in and kept up to speed on how we service our customers.</p><p>Turning to the strength of our digital channels. It's very key to our success, and it's very foundational. And when you think about the high market distribution strength and competitive advantage that Tino, Andrew and Gareth spoke to you this morning, the distribution channels are key. Qantas.com, jetstar.com and the apps are really critical group assets from a sales and servicing perspective with many benefits arrived when our customers book with us directly. Both Qantas and Jetstar are seeing really strong year-on-year growth across our key digital metrics. We've got growth in traffic, growth in users. And with both of those, you see a growth in revenue, both flight and ancillary as well as channel share shift. Personalization, which I will talk to shortly, has been a key contributor of that growth across both airlines.</p><p>We have to continue to evolve and improve our digital experiences in the same way that digital native businesses that our customers interact with do. And many of our customers who are increasingly digital native expect. Qantas was recently rated the most digitally ready airline globally in a Frost &amp; Sullivan Research report based on the strength of our digital channels but also our proactive approaches to the distribution and personalization landscape.</p><p>Jetstar have had a drive direct program since 2017 designed to turn around what was the trend of online travel agent, or OTA, growth outpacing the growth of jetstar.com. The program has been successful, and we've seen Australian direct booking passenger share increase by 3% since we started and the Japan market by 4%. This has been achieved through a variety of actions, including focusing on that direct channel where the yield is higher, also drive direct marketing campaigns, exclusive pricing on the channel and up-weighted search activity.</p><p>We hope you've all downloaded the Qantas and Jetstar app. I'm coming around later to check you've all got it on your home screen and that you're using them regularly. You can see -- can you -- you will continue to see us invest in both of those apps being, we really want it to be a mobile wallet in your pocket. I'm pleased to report last week, Qantas apps scored 4.9 in Apple Score, which is the best score we've ever had.</p><p>Just to turn to Jetstar's ancillary revenue growth. Andrew David touched on this morning, and it's really been a significant driver of growth for the group over the past years. We've deliberately invested in it and continue to improve the customer experience. 73% of bookings with Jetstar add an ancillary product. It's a huge tagging rate. And Jetstar sells on average of 1.4 ancillary products per customer at an average of $35 per customer. Jetstar's approach to ancillary revenue really is leading and there's lots of learnings that we shared across the group from an ancillary revenue perspective.</p><p>Now to turn to the new frontiers of competitive advantage and starting with know me. So personalization, revenue management and distribution, our 3 core areas of focus under the know me pillar. We've spoken to many of you about these before individually, and we've made a lot of progress, which we'll share today. And they're all investments we're making individually, but the power and the secret sauce really comes from the ways of working and the way that these initiatives connect in with each other.</p><p>So let's start with a video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY: So we're already seeing some fantastic results against these programs even though it's early days. Our personalization journey, we think, is world-leading not just from an aviation perspective. Last year, we tested with a small group of our members, but this year we've scaled personalization across the airline and loyalty in terms of the assets that we've built and also the ways of working. It's a really highly coordinated customer-led approach. And we're seeing success. Customers are more engaged with how we're interacting with them. In the first quarter of this financial year, the personalization doubled its performance business target, which we measure in terms of incremental revenue versus a rotating control group. It proves I think, for us, that personalization is also a tool to be used in all market conditions. One of the great wins of personalization that won't be evident to our customers is how much quicker we can be as a business. So we're getting off of that a lot faster with over 80% efficiency versus the previous ways of working. And the added strengths to our own channels means we're actually spending considerably less on marketing and traditional channels. Personalization is a great example of artificial intelligence and machine learning automating tasks in a positive way. Many of the tasks of our marketing and analytics teams have been automated, but they were value -- not value-added tasks, meaning they can now focus on constant optimization and performance manage of the system to deliver business results.</p><p>Strategically, personalization is also really important because it sets up a foundation for future growth. We now have a system that can wear and prioritize growth in our loyalty businesses, growth in routes, growth in ancillary products and deliver the increased breadth of offerings based on where we think the customers will value them the most.</p><p>From a distribution perspective, as Andrew mentioned this morning, we launched our Qantas distribution channel in August, so it's very recent. But we've already got over 90% of our Qantas revenue signed up to the Qantas distribution channel, including most of our key partners, including Flight Center Amex, Helloworld, CTM, CWT, Webjet, Expedia and many more. The distribution ecosystem disruption is perhaps the biggest change in the airline commercial landscape of our era. Those of you that were at the IAG Investor Day would have heard them talk about it, and we commend their leadership on the issue as well because it really is an industry issue. The key issue with distribution was the old GDS agreements didn't give us any freedom to differentiate the inventory or the price we place in channels. And we were distributing by our old technology, which gave us a very limited opportunity to innovate and create new content. In many ways, what we've done for Qantas replicates the freedoms that Jetstar were afforded from the start.</p><p>We launched our own channel, and we took the whole industry with us on this journey. And as a result, we had very high uptake for our agents, so 98% of point-of-sale Australia agents are onboard with the Qantas channel. And 2 months post launch, we are seeing many positive results already. We have the content freedoms and ability to innovate at a more rapid rate. We have content control, which is great for us as a business, but also great for our customers because the conditions we've put in the Qantas channel means that we get better control of that content.</p><p>To give you an example of Skyscanner. Skyscanner, as many of you would have known or used, are global online matter. And one of their key business models, they get OTAs to bid on fares, and they'll choose the lowest fare from the OTA, they'll add a Skyscanner margin into it, and that will go at the top of the metasearch. It's been a really successful business models for them. It's a bit like the Amazon model in retail. Skyscanner came to us a couple of weeks ago to say it wasn't working in Australia because our OTA partners were afraid to breach the Qantas channel terms and conditions. This is great for us, but also great for our customers because it means the fare they're paying is value for money and there aren't added margins put on those fares.</p><p>Distribution gives us a seat at the table with all the new digital players, including Facebook and Google and others. It enables us to protect our digital channels, which I spoke to before, which have really an important strength and also protect our loyalty program, both key to our high market strength. And as the video said, it really is the integration, we think, of personalization, distribution and our ability to dynamically price that will give us unmatchable customer competitive advantage moving forward.</p><p>To touch on caring for our customers, particularly when things don't go to plan. We know that rapid digitalization and the proliferation of mobile devices means that we can care for our customers in different ways including when things don't go to plan. Both Qantas and Jetstar are really focused on prioritizing efforts around disruption management and proactive and personalized recoveries for every customer.</p><p>We know that the way we act and the way we operate in disruption is a moment of truth in our customer relationship. We are investing to be faster in the way we recover, and we've delivered some tangible outcomes already.</p><p>Just recently, we launched a technology advancement in our operations center. That means it's now possible to rebook an A380 in minutes, what took hours not long ago.</p><p>The change to the distribution landscape is also critical for disruption management because we're now capturing more customers' contact details, which means we can manage customers proactively, regardless of where they've made their booking, be it direct or indirect. We know that customers want to self-serve in a disruption in their channel of choice. And we're making sure that we're empowering them to do so, either online, via messaging, Facebook, SMS, in-app or chatting with our virtual assistants, Jess on Jetstar.com and Matilda on qantas.com.</p><p>We will continue to guide our customers through the digitalization of the experience. It's really important that we're giving customers education on how we're doing it and not just doing it. Also freeing our people to focus on excellent service by empowering them with information, as Rob spoke to this morning, and automating non-value-added tasks.</p><p>To summarize, brand and the voice of the customer are really at the heart of the customer strategy. We'll keep investing in digital data and technology to unlock excellent customer experience for our customer. Customer experience to have customer, commercial and operational benefits.</p><p>We think our 3 focus pillars are absolutely right and will continue to be our focus areas. We've really successfully mobilized around in this year that more investment is to come. And we know that the integration between these 3 pillars will be our secret sauce moving forward.</p><p>As we reflect on what and who we are as we enter our centenary year, both Qantas and Jetstar have very clear customer strategies, and we think the future for the Qantas customer is bright. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Steph. Our next speaker is Olivia Wirth, our CEO of Qantas Loyalty. She joined the group in 2009 and has held several positions, including the role of group Chief Customer Officer. Olivia also has over 20 years' experience in corporate affairs and marketing.</p><p>Qantas Loyalty, as you all would know, has evolved from a highly successful frequent flyer business into a sophisticated consumer loyalty ecosystem. It provides a stable, diversified and growing earnings base for the business. And I'm sure you've heard us all say a very significant benefit to the balance sheet.</p><p>Olivia will take you through the road map of how we are going to achieve the growth objective of $500 million to $600 million EBIT by the end of financial year '22. I'll hand over to Olivia.</p><p>OLIVIA WIRTH, CEO OF QANTAS LOYALTY, QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED: Thank you, Fran, and hi, everyone. Thanks for sticking it out. I was thinking before, maybe we should have had bribery by points or something. Something to keep you here, but we thank you for coming back after lunch.</p><p>So look, over the past 3 decades it's well-known that Qantas Loyalty has grown into a significant member program and also a revenue-generating business. And what we want to do this afternoon is share with you our plans for growth. But before we get into that detail, we're going to watch a short film, which really explains the evolution of this business into Australia's #1 loyalty program.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>OLIVIA WIRTH: So it's pretty clear that Qantas Loyalty has an important role within the Qantas Group, delivering value through customer engagement and retention and providing stable and diversified earnings. Our ambition, which I think is very well known, is to achieve $500 million to $600 million EBIT by FY '22. We're planning to deliver this within a rapidly changing industry landscape of shifting member expectations and behaviors, fast-evolving competitors and increasing external pressures. We can do this because our business is unique. We have market-leading assets and capabilities and provide a significant competitive advantage. And importantly, as Steph outlined before, we have one of the most trusted brands in Australia. We're underpinned by a culture of innovation that influence the products that we promote and the partnerships that we make. Importantly, we have built a rich infrastructure of data sources and advanced analytics tools that allow us to understand our members better, and this ultimately means we're just -- we have more productive interactions with them.</p><p>But at the very center of all of this is the simple fact that people want QantasPoints. We know people choose product X over product Y because it has points attached to it, and that has enabled us to establish a top tier coalition of some of the biggest brands in the country. So all of this combined, all of these qualities make us very appealing to customers, business and investors.</p><p>That ecosystem, a word that's often thrown around and it's become a bit of a buzzword, but for Qantas Loyalty, it's a very real concept, and it's absolutely integral to our strategy. Our ecosystem has been purpose-built and carefully cultivated. Every part or every cog in the wheel that you see represented here benefits from and drive benefits to the other cogs. That creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem that promotes engagement and advocacy with our customers. And it's fair to say, we have evolved from very humble beginnings of rewarding travelers for flying somewhere. QantasPoints shape the decisions that consumers make. And we keep making it easier for them to earn them as part of their everyday life. Our partners also understand the true pulling power of the QantasPoints and the halo effect of the brand association with Qantas. They also know that we're equipped with the assets and intel that help them get closer to their customers. And it's these same assets and intel that have allowed us to identify high-growth sectors to extend our brand into.</p><p>Let's take a -- take an example of Qantas Wine in a case study on how this ecosystem works. Let's say a member joins the program, let's call her Fran, and she becomes aware of Qantas Wine. She's already purchasing throughout the ecosystem. She's received one of those many e-mails that I'm sure you all received in the room from Qantas Frequent Flyer (inaudible) he's getting very excited about purchasing wine. And after that one purchase of wine, Fran becomes more aware and more open to other purchases, whether that be retail purchases through Qantas shopping or whether it be travel -- Qantas travel money for an upcoming holiday.</p><p>But this ecosystem also works in reverse. Qantas Wine, actually, has a unique entry point, where a wine lover, let's call him Tino, may be attracted into our carefully curated selection and then decides to join the Qantas Frequent Flyer program as a result of that one interaction. Tino is going to be far more likely to look at the rest of the Qantas Loyalty ecosystem. And more importantly, is going to consider flying Qantas above our airline competitors. It's a Tino. It's not necessarily [this Tino].</p><p>So if you look at all of these cogs, all of these entry points and opportunities for cross-promotion, you can really begin to understand the power of this connected and growing ecosystem. Growth engines, stable contributor, diversity of earnings, Qantas Loyalty has been reported as many things over the last few years, but there's a common thread, and it's always growth, but more importantly, sustainable growth. A strategy we've worked hard to implement through expanding our portfolio of new businesses, which you can see here below, while never taking our eye off the core partnership business. This has been our membership base well to close to 13 million members and allowed us to deliver on our ambitious financial targets.</p><p>2 years ago, in this very room, this business put out a very bold growth target, the target to grow earnings to between $500 million to $600 million by FY '22. Ambitious? Sure. A lot of hard work to get there? Definitely. Achievable? Absolutely. And that's what I want to focus on for the rest of today's presentation, how to get there.</p><p>First off, for Loyalty, the North Star has always been and always will be our members, and that forms the first pillar of our strategy. So when we look ahead for FY '22, we're continually looking at new ways to increase levels of engagement, remove the customer pain points and deliver on the core promise of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program, which is the dream trip.</p><p>Secondly, we're all about defending and growing the core of our business, our partnerships with financial services, with retailers, grocery chains in just about all of Australia. And we're not -- we're doing that by not just sitting still. We are evolving our partnership models. We're building even closer ties with our core partners to generate new revenue streams. If you look at the recent Home Loan campaign with ANZ and the recently relaunched partnership with Woolworths, the 2 examples of that new approach to partnerships.</p><p>The third pillar of our strategy is developing new loyalty businesses, including direct-to-consumer businesses. The businesses launched over the last 8 years, like health insurance and Qantas Money are rapidly achieving scale. They're diversifying the group's non-cyclical earnings, and importantly, they're also finding new ways to engage our members, and there's more to come.</p><p>So let's get into a bit of detail on how these 3 pillars and how they're going to help achieve our targets. Let me use an analogy. If you think about Qantas Loyalty as a business as a flywheel, and then at the center of that flywheel would be the Frequent Flyer program. And at the very heart, the very center of the Frequent Flyer program, are our members. And what we want to do is to get that very heart of the flywheel spinning as quickly as possible to drive member engagement with the program. Because when we do that, we know that every partner in every business that we add will maximize its potential. Put simply, when we invest in our members, we also invest in our ability to grow as a business. So how do we do that? Firstly, engagement, obviously, that's critical. We're continuing to grow the breadth and depth of our offering just to create more and more links between us and our customers. Secondly, through awards, as Steph mentioned, a critical component of our overall customer strategy. We are looking at ways for our 13 million membership base, not as one homogenous group. The way we look at our membership base is really through distinct cohorts of customers. They've got all very different needs, different aspirations from this program. So we're tailoring our rewards and recognition to the drivers of these different groups. We're creating emotional connections, which are both powerful and also have longevity.</p><p>Value is also critical. If our program is not worth the time and effort, people won't come back. If it's not aspirational, people won't change their behavior. And that's why our program CVP is really anchored on what matters most to our members, and that's about taking the dream trip on their points. And then there's experience. And Steph also talked on this briefly before. How our members interact with us through digital channels, our products and those partners, and importantly when they fly with Qantas. We've massively upped our investment in creating a more personalized, hassle-free experience for our members, and there's obviously more to come on that.</p><p>Back in June, we announced a major overhaul of the Qantas Frequent Flyer program. And we know that the people are very passionate about the program. But even we were surprised by how much attention a simple media alert received when we said we'll be announcing some changes to the program the very next day. Alan was stopped in the street at the coffee shop at its hair addresses, asking him what is happening to the program, what is planned. And based on the feedback and the response so far, it's fair to say, it's been positive.</p><p>We have invested $25 million into the program, and it is already delivering. You can see by the results here, 20% increase in members booking classic rewards seats. The 28% increase in international premium cabin redemptions. This is the most sought-after reward by our members, and I'm sure many of you in the room, it's both international premium cabin redemptions.</p><p>Importantly, almost 300,000 classic rewards seats have also been booked by members who have not booked a flight redemption in the previous 18 months, who have not booked one before. This last piece of data is really compelling. Why? Because it's getting the latent members to reengage. And the #1 driver of re-engagement is (inaudible), which is why alongside adding more than 1 million seats on Qantas and our partners. We cut the cash costs associated with flight redemptions.</p><p>Another major development for our members is the introduction of the point swap, and this will be released early next year. And this is essentially providing an entirely new set of rewards and exclusive offers for a growing number of members who are earning points in the ground. You would have seen in the film that over 70% of our members, actually, 70% of our points earned on the ground. This is appealing to this particular cohort of members. One of the key emerging trends in our consumer ecosystems is the rise of subscription models. I'm sure many of you in the room have multiple subscriptions. You know what I'm talking about.</p><p>And the Points Club with the Points Club, we're stuffed a first for any airline multi program, where members can enter an elite program of additional benefits and recognition through their annual points earned. Importantly, though, these investments don't just underpin the growth of the loyalty business. The more engaged and active our members are, the more the group benefits through a higher share of wallet and repeat business when it comes to flying.</p><p>The second pillar of the loyalty strategy is expanding our partnerships or the coalition, as we call it. From the big 4 Australian banks to everyday spend partners like Woolworths and BP right through to the hundreds of retail partners and our SME Rewards program. This really is the core of our business. It represents the majority of current and future earnings. And with the road map that we have in place, we're forecasting average annual forecast growth of 5% to FY '22 from this core business.</p><p>Let's start with financial services. Our AFS portfolio, as you would be well aware, has faced different headwinds over the years. An interchange and other regulatory changes through the times of lower consumer confidence impacting spending. But through those periods, we've increased market share. We've doubled down on investment with our key partners, and we've diversified our brand product offering to include mortgages and superannuation in addition to the well-known and unrivaled co-brand credit card portfolio.</p><p>That credit card portfolio continues to grow. We've got more than 50 QantasPoints earning credit cards, 50 points per earning credit cards, issued by more than 20 financial institutions in market. That results in 35% of all credit card spend in Australia taking place on a co-branded credit card.</p><p>The other important element of our coalition is comprised of major every day earned partners and more than 500 partners pretty much covering every spend category you can think of. With BP, which we recently announced as a new partner, which will join the program early next year, we are demonstrating the growth and evolution of our approach to such partnerships. Having an entry point with BP, allowed us to include an exclusive fuel card for our Qantas Business Reward members. That's our loyalty program for (inaudible). So again, you can see the network effect of each of these partners, which ripples right through our Qantas Loyalty program.</p><p>And with Woolworths, we recently announced a refresh of the partnership after being in business with Woolworths for 10 years. And this hasn't just been about improving the earn rate for our members; it's about a vastly improved customer experience with one-click join, and it's about the capacity to convert points automatically instead of quarterly. So with Uber, DJS, TerryWhite, Kogan, to name a few. Our coalition is recording more than 25,000 points earning transactions taking place every single day. Every single day. And every earn or retail portfolio is also forecast to see points issuance, which is the driver of billings to increase by 30% this financial year. So we believe that this is a true step-change in the frequency of interactions with our members and gives us real confidence in our road map ahead for our retail partnerships.</p><p>Just briefly on QBR, Andrew mentioned as did Tino mention the importance of the SME sector for the airline businesses. Our QBR program was launched in 2014, and we've seen significant growth in this part of the business with 270,000 SME members joining since that launch period. And that member growth and expansion of QBR has seen a coalition of businesses associated grow to 60. And the revenue growth from these partners has grown by more than 80% last financial year. So the growth is significant.</p><p>And critically, for the group, QBR businesses contributed more than $1 billion to airline revenue annually with the reward and recognition of the loyalty program, attracting these new customers and generating strong uplift for repeat business.</p><p>Now we've spoken about the power of the ecosystem from a customer and from a Qantas Loyalty perspective. We want to look at it through breaking through a different lens. And this is how do we drive the financials for our partners and in turn, our business. So the formula is pretty simple. Members are participating more, spending more, engaging with more products and partners. And in many cases, using a co-brand or Qantas credit card to pay. So this means the initial partner, let's say, TerryWhite Chemmart earns more. And the reason why they earn more is if a member engages across multiple categories. So they might take out Qantas Travel insurance and book a holiday through Qantas Hotels, they did a weekly shop at Woolies. When this occurs, this multiplier effect comes into play. And the reason being is that each partner in the ecosystem earns more is that when members are earning across multiple categories their QantasPoints are top of mind. Their Qantas points are top of mind. And therefore, it's more likely to influence their behavior. Also, when engaging in multiple partners, the member could be saving for a more aspirational reward. And what we know from this is that it means that it's more attractive for them to continue to be seeking out this important QantasPoints earning opportunity.</p><p>The final pillar of our strategy is about new business creating -- creation, including our direct-to-consumer businesses. This portfolio has continued to grow. And in line with our 5-year plan is generating significant earnings. And in a minute, we'll do a bit of a double-click on our insurance business and the approach that we take to building out that particular sector. The logic behind setting up these businesses is pretty simple. But it's very difficult to replicate. So every time we think about starting a new business, we always start with the customer. What are the pain points? Where are the unmet needs in this particular market and how can the combination of the Qantas brand with the QantasPoints solve this unmet need? We then consider the industry really carefully. Is this a place where Qantas has a right to play? Is it where our assets and our capabilities provide an advantage? And importantly, we assess it if it's a right fit for the Qantas brand. We'll always protect the Qantas brand so we take a considerable amount of time assessing if this is the right thing from a brand perspective. And then we'll engage in deep human set of discovery process that's supported by our strength in data and analytics.</p><p>And what comes out of this process is typically several strong ideas. And even then, we only pursue the ones that we think have longevity that will always reinforce the core coalition and provide meaningful earnings contribution within the medium term. So it's a very, very high bar. So based on this, you might think it's a miracle we've even entered to 4 verticals, but we have become fairly good at this process, and I can tell you there's plenty more to come.</p><p>Let's take a quick look at Qantas Hotels as an example. This started off as a fairly standard mass-market hotel booking engine back in 2013. But this business has now expanded to include more than 330,000 available properties, end-to-end packaging, leveraging distressed inventory from Jetstar and soon to come Qantas, events and experiences that you can purchase from around Australia and around the world, a partnership with Airbnb and an exciting new pipeline of partnerships that will help sustain growth rates that are already double-industry average for online travel agents. So with insurance, hotels, Qantas Money and Wine, we're seeing strong growth, and we are forecasting a more than doubling in earnings contribution for these direct-to-consumer businesses between 15% to 20% of EBIT by FY '22.</p><p>Briefly on insurance. For Qantas Insurance obviously started with travel. That makes sense. But for loyalty, we launched our first -- our digital-first customer-centric health insurance product in 2016. And since then, it's been one of the fastest-growing health insurance products in the Australian market. It holds the #2 in health for net growth and is now sitting at around $165 million in terms of annual premiums. Our wellness app. I'm hoping many of you have downloaded that, Steph, can you check on that when you're doing the check of the phones, the wellness app, which rewards our customers for walking, sleeping well, eating well, all those things that we know are good for us, has seen more than 600,000 downloads and has significant engagement from our members. And we've taken the same thinking, refined our experience with health and then applied it to other products, including life and car, which we announced a few weeks ago and shortly home insurance.</p><p>Our large member base, our channels, our loyalty offering, the deep data insights and advanced analytics capability allow us really to effectively communicate to our members. And it creates really compelling offers that we know that they will love.</p><p>The digital assets and sale assets that we have, and we've built and refined over time through the multiple business launches have become very sophisticated in terms of the member engagement. Specifically, the assets that we think provide us a sustainable advantage, QantasPoints, member base, data and insights, marketing channels and digital capability and importantly, brand. Importantly, brand. These assets combined, lead to lower acquisition costs, higher attention of customers and an ability to attract valuable customers.</p><p>So in wrapping up. We believe we have the track record and momentum to achieve our FY '22 goals. We have the experience to challenge the traditional notions of an airline loyalty program. We have the vision to reimagine the future of customer loyalty as an ecosystem. We think we're equipped to explore new businesses that leverage our existing IP. We're investing in the skills and technology to help increasing member engagement. And importantly, we do have the momentum in earnings and customer metrics to back our ambitions with the strong performance we saw with double-digit growth in the second half of FY '19, continuing into the first half of FY '20. So that's how we'll achieve our goal, and we believe it's not easy to replicate.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Liv. You've heard a lot today about sustainable competitive advantage. And as Alan started off the day, our people and culture are a very big part of that. I'd like to welcome back to the stage Rob Marcolina, to outline our people strategy that underpins our broader business strategy. Rob, please come to the stage.</p><p>ROBERT MARCOLINA: Thanks, Fran, and good afternoon, everyone, and you have heard a lot today. Just sitting there listening to it. You've heard a lot about our achievements over the last couple of years and excitingly about our initiatives going forward, whether they be across Qantas or Jetstar, international or domestic or what we just heard in Loyalty. And all of the plans that you've heard today are very dependent on us delivering for our customer. And as Steph mentioned just a little while ago, this means also that our people really are the linchpin of delivering for our customers.</p><p>And so our people really work out in the field. They're out and day to day and in the frontline, they're engaging with our customers on a regular basis, and they're energized and excited to drive these strategies forward. And our people really at their best are unstoppable and represent a strong competitive advantage for Qantas. And we're committed to providing the right tools, technologies and capabilities as well as the culture for our people to flourish.</p><p>Now you've seen the global forces a few times today. And as Alan and Andrew have previously discussed, the global forces really provide context for shaping and evolving our strategy, and they're just as relevant for people and culture. The longer-term trends are obvious and the implications on our people strategy are just as obvious. And I'd like to highlight a few.</p><p>With regards to the first one, in the rise of Asia, as you've heard from Tino and Gareth, Asia is a big part of our network today, and we expect a big part of our growth story going forward. We need to ensure that we have more Asian language speaking crew and fully understand how to best serve our various Asian customers.</p><p>On big data, the rise of big data provides a significant amount of information, and we need to make sure that we have the capabilities to drive value from all this data and information. Now getting these capabilities is challenging, and we know we're in a war for talent. And it's not just with the big tech companies, but it's with any company. In today's market, everyone is looking for employees with digital capabilities.</p><p>And on preferences, our employees are consumers of other products and services. They use Facebook, they use banking apps and they use Uber. Their interactions as consumers really drive their expectations as employees, and they want Qantas to interact with them in similar ways.</p><p>And then on climate change. And as you heard from Andrew this morning, aviation and its impact on the environment are becoming more top of mind. And our employees know this. They hear it from their family and friends, and they want us to be leaders in this space, whether that's through carbon offsets or the development of biofuels. And as you've heard also today, we're taking action, and this is an important part of our employee value proposition. We believe strongly in the importance of diversity and that an inclusive culture contributes to our success. Now as an airline group, we fly to over -- we fly 55 million passengers per year within Australia and over 23 other countries, and we need our workforce to reflect this diversity. As you can see, we have a multigenerational workforce from baby boomers to Gen Z and with an increasing number of millennials in our workforce.</p><p>We employ people across a diverse range of roles from baggage handlers to data scientists, with education levels from high school to multiple PhDs. We speak over 30 languages on board our aircraft. After English, the most popular being Japanese. Also Mandarin, Cantonese, French and Spanish, making up the top 5 languages spoken on board by our crew. We also have an increasing number of women in our senior management and an increasing number of women in our technical areas, pilots, engineers and in technology. And in fact, 7% of our pilots today are female, and this may seem low to you, and it is, and we know we need to get better. But this is, in fact, double the percentage in the United States and in the United Kingdom. And encouragingly, 13% of our pilots in Qantas Link are female.</p><p>So at Qantas, we pride ourselves on attracting great people. We are an employer of choice. In 2019, we received the #1 employer award from a number of organizations. So I'd like to play you a video now to introduce you to some of our team.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>ROBERT MARCOLINA: Well, as you heard in those stories, our employee value proposition is very strong. Our appeal is emotional, the romance of our history, the iconic nature of our brand, the purpose-driven principles for which we stand and advocate for and the allure of the aviation industry, but it's also experiential, the relentless focus on customer service. The willingness to push the boundaries with innovation and the inclusive and diverse workplace. But we also get the basics right. Offering competitive salaries and benefits. And these benefits are highly valued and frequently used, predominantly through our core product, that being flying. How people get access to staff travel and discounted airfares. This is a real differentiator in working at Qantas. But we know that we offer a compelling value proposition.</p><p>Now while the value proposition gets people to Qantas, we also know that our culture is why people stay at Qantas. It drives our sustainable competitive advantage. And there are a number of inputs that contribute to that culture, and I'd like to highlight a few.</p><p>Firstly, on behaviors. We've linked our behaviors to our purpose. And as Alan talked about earlier with regards to purpose, we take the spirit of Australia further. We've taken a step back and assessed behaviors to make sure that we are promoting behaviors that best embody the spirit of Australia and taking it further. And we believe these key behaviors include being resilient and taking responsibility as well as acting with respect. We want our people to display these behaviors at all times with our customers, but also with our people.</p><p>Investing in our people. We do this in many ways, through training, promotion and career development. And as we've mentioned a few times today with regards to training, in 2020, we will continue to train our frontline leaders, 12,000 going through customer service training and 5,000 going through leadership skill training.</p><p>And with regards to career development, we support lateral moves and internal promotions. We actively move people around the organization. This provides different experiences to them, but also provides optionality for future promotions. For example, over the last 5 years, all appointments to the senior management team have been internal such as Steph Tully, who was recently promoted to our Chief Customer Officer; and Vanessa Hudson, who was recently promoted as our first female group CFO.</p><p>Community spirit is also an important part of our culture. As we said, we are the spirit of Australia. Our people are engaged in the community, whether that be through UNICEF with Qantas or StarKids with Jetstar or many other organizations around Australia and overseas.</p><p>We're proud of the culture that we've created at Qantas, and we'll continue to celebrate, to protect and also to enhance it.</p><p>As Steph mentioned earlier, we excel at understanding and improving our customers' end-to-end experience. Our customer strategy has been built on a deep understanding of this, and we've used the same approach with regards to our employees. We've taken a design-thinking approach using data and ethnographic research to map out our employee experience. Understanding the moments that matter to our employees just as we do with our customers. In this case, from onboarding to succession or exit.</p><p>We've built a people analytic capability, gathering insights and data about our employees' experience. We've opened more communication channels, including pulse surveys, to talk with our people more directly and more frequently to share our strategies and plans for the future. And again, as I said before, this is not a new process. This is something that mirrors quite closely the customer NPS process that many of you probably participate in. And as with our customers, this process enables us to be better informed to ensure that we're making better decisions with regards to our people.</p><p>Now we recognize that our industry is not standing still, that the global forces are impacting our people as well. And there are 2 key employee growth areas that I wanted to highlight: pilots and digital workers. With regards to pilots with a significant demand projected over the next 20 years, particularly coming from Asia, and digital workers with the explosion of data and information.</p><p>On pilot specifically, we've recognized the demand, and we're taking action. We need pilots. And as we've referenced before, we had over 300 join the organization last year and know that the demand will continue. But we understand the attractiveness of the Qantas brand to prospective pilots. And we don't want to drain the general aviation pool in Australia. So we're looking to self source. And again, as we've referenced a few times today, we've launched a pilot Academy in Towoomba. And we're also looking to open another one in Mackay. Both will help us to cater for Qantas' own growth but will also represent an opportunity for Qantas to provide Qantas trained pilots to Asia to help meet that demand. And we expect that there'll be a strong pull for our Academy graduates.</p><p>And then on digital workers, this is not a new area of growth. We've been competing to these type of employees for a number of years. But again, steering it into the pipeline and everything from what you've seen today, we know that demand will increase. And the demand is across the group. It's not just in loyalty or qantas.com or jetstar.com, but it's in our operations group and also in our people analytics. And we've established a capability chapter across the group, coordinating similar needs in different areas of the group. We're going to market as a group. We're leveraging our scale and business diversity to attract top talent and offering a tailored value proposition.</p><p>But we also know that recruiting is not enough. There are not enough graduates coming out of universities. And we also need to be looking internally. So we've begun to look at reskilling, looking at how we redeploy current employees who have an interest in these particular areas. And we're working with our tech partners, and they're helping us to upskill our organization. We are preparing our organization with the skills required so that we can take advantage of growth opportunities going forward.</p><p>So in summary, as we enter our centenary year, we must embrace the rapid changes occurring in our industry and nearby. Our people initiatives are designed so that our workforce can support our strategies so that we can drive better business and employee outcomes. We'll continue to evolve our people and culture strategy to ensure that our workers are more capable, efficient and flexible as we look forward. Our people are an important source of competitive advantage. They embody the spirit of Australia, and we're committed to ensuring that we continue to do that. Thank you.</p><p>FRANCES VAN REYK: Thanks, Rob. If I can get Olivia, Steph and Vanessa to join you. We're going to open up to our final Q&amp;A. Alan, if you'd like to direct the questions? Alan will wrap up after the Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Thanks, Fran. Jake, go for it. Over there. Put your hand up again Jake. I think, so we can see you.</p><p>JAKOB CAKARNIS: Jake Cakarnis from Citi. This is one for Rob and Steph. Just give us an indication about the potential cost savings and revenue upside from the changes in the distribution model. And maybe start by giving us an overview of what the JDS fees were and then a breakdown potentially into what the costs and revenue benefits look like from the shift to Qantas Direct.</p><p>ROBERT MARCOLINA: Steph, do you want to do that one?</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY: Yes. I'll do that one. So we won't be giving away what our GDS fees work because it's commercially confidential. But there's a number of value pool drivers around the distribution strategy. And primarily for us, the freedom that we get to distribute our inventory and price in different channels, the way we choose is the primary upside. So we think the customer stickiness and the revenue outside of that is the primary driver of the distribution strategy.</p><p>The ability to control our content in the way that if you think about it from a retail example, the way that Apple control how they're priced, the way that we as the manufacturer of airline experiences can now control how we're priced, obviously leads to some revenue upside there.</p><p>You've got consequential potential cost saving pools both through the way we negotiate our agreements with travel agents and GDS, but also the way that we can control that content, meaning that some of the things that went on in the past like cross-border selling, et cetera, means that we can pay less cost of sale because we've got more control of that inventory. So there's cost and revenue drivers associated with the distribution strategy, but more important, it's a very strategic play around customer relationship.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Yes. It's -- there is some very good saves and examples of where the wonderful bookings that we now can control and identify where people using a different cost of sales and commission levels overseas compared to here to actually fill the system. And we're now being able to stop that and police it because it wasn't appropriate that was happening. And that's the immediate savings we're seeing. But the business case on this was predominantly on revenue. Because we're comprised now, I think Andrew used to say, we have 26 booking classes from A to Z. And now we have potentially millions of different pricing points that you can actually put out to individuals out there, which gives you a lot more power on the revenue management, which is why the whole business case was to find out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: And I think the other thing as well, that Steph mentioned before, just to conclude and recap, it's the value that comes from the personalization, investment, distribution and also revenue management and actually being able to combine value-based offers, so they're not just based on a flight, but also can combine value from the Loyalty business in terms of offers of points or status or other products that we have in the ecosystem. So in terms of that multiplier effect that Olivia was talking about, that is actually really the big prize that we're aiming for in the horizon is bringing all of those together simultaneously in a much more easy way to distribute.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Other questions? Yes, (inaudible)</p><p>NIRAJ-SAMIP SHAH, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Niraj Shah from Morgan Stanley. Just a question on Loyalty. Earlier today, we talked about global best practice or champions in terms of carrier returns or potentially load factors. Who or what do you look at for the Loyalty business in terms of what you can or should be doing medium or longer term?</p><p>OLIVIA WIRTH: So we wouldn't just be looking at airline programs. We would be looking across the board around other customer retention and customer loyalty programs. So we think about it quite broadly. We are quite advanced compared to other airlines in terms of the breadth, as you well know, given your report that you've written. The Qantas Loyalty business is more probably more advanced than many of our other airline competitors, both in Australia and overseas. So we also look to other, I guess, other customer loyalty programs as ways for us to continue to stretch our thinking and investments in the future. So it's not just straight down the airline vertical.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Other questions? Yes, Paul. Up here of the phone Paul here. He's coming up behind you. It's actually very bright.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just another question for you, Olivia. I think the RBA data on credit cards suggests something like a 10% decline in active accounts over the last 18 months. And I think that's sort of accelerated in the last couple of months. How much of the revenue in Loyalty comes from credit cards? And is that decline of concern?</p><p>OLIVIA WIRTH: It's a good question. It's obviously something that we looked at, and we keep a close eye on. We have done so for many years, given the broad portfolio in financial services. We don't go into specifics around these -- I guess, the value creation that we have in our credit cards business is obviously important for us. But there's a number of things you need to consider, we're not seeing the same decline in our portfolio, and we're not seeing the same decline. And what we do know is that the customers and members that we have on co-branded credit cards are both on our own cards and also those that are co-branded cards are actually high-value customers, and we're not seeing that same level of deterioration that you've just mentioned. And what we also do see is that we've seen -- we have not seen a significant buck in the trends there at all. Obviously, what we are looking -- we're bucking the trend there, and we've done that through the cycle. We've done that over the last couple of years. So we're not concerned by the level of deterioration that you've talked about there. However, what we're also seeing and -- what we've talked about, there is obviously, how do we diversify beyond credit cards as well. Obviously, mortgages and super are the first 2 with more to come in that space.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: And I think, what levers say from the lockdown is all the other forms of payments that are out there and whether we can have a proposition with Loyalty as well. So I mean, the opportunities for us are immense in this space. And the model that you went through earlier about how we judge, which ones we get into is really key because we could do a hell of a lot in a lot of different areas simulates.</p><p>OLIVIA WIRTH: Yes. And I think you can see the example of mortgages. That's sort of the first time we've really gone above the line with ANZ on a significant mortgages proposition. You might be aware of the ANZ CEO gave some details around that at their financial results. And that showed that they've been at 30% increase in terms of the mortgages they've seen in a certain period of time, which is directly related to the marketing campaign and partnership with Qantas Frequent Flyer. So we do know that there is application of our points beyond the credit card. We know there's value in it.</p><p>And to then to Alan's point, that gives us confidence that there's a whole range of other payment opportunities out there for us to work in partnership with our banking partners on.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Great. Other questions? Up here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Back to Steph. There's been a bit of controversy around -- with Qantas Direct about excluding certain intermediaries from particular fair offerings, both from a legal point of view and from a public point of view, generally -- retailers generally. Do you see that issue going away in due course? Or is it going to be something you're going to have to face up, too.</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY: Can you repeat the first part of the question? It was hard to hear.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Some intermediaries precluding them from the Qantas distribution channel.</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY: Yes. I mean, we are not close to anyone joining the Qantas distribution channel. So it's a channel that we created deliberately to invite everyone in, whether some parties choose not to join. We're not actually seeing it. We've got 98% of Australia and 75% of the rest of the world signed up to it, GDS to advance their technology, which they're all appreciating as well. So I'm not sure if this.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: So Jetstar has and some of the OTAs because they were -- we're making sure that our distribution is clear that going through jetstar.com as an example, is still the lowest cost way of doing it. And if these OTAs want to charge a booking fee on top of that, that's up to them, but it needs to be clear and transparent to the customers. And we have been hard-nosed about that, and we will continue to be hard-nosed about it because I think that's just fair to the customers that they're aware of that. And there's no -- there's no other processes going on behind, and maybe it's relating to that. But I haven't heard anybody say they were unhappy with the Qantas distribution channel.</p><p>STEPHANIE TULLY: No, we've got positive feedback. I think it's early days, and it's partly a journey for the whole industry. So we're still waiting for the GDS to advance their technology as well. But the next year is going to be a good year. I think you'll get more and more of that experience technically through GDS and through non-GDS the customer and the agent that still has the choice.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: Great. Other questions? We exhausted everybody, have we?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: They look exhausted.</p><p>ALAN JOSEPH JOYCE: They look exhausted. It looks like, and I think I might then do a wrap up. Can I thank everybody for the presentation?</p><p>So I'll keep this brief. I think it's fair to say that when you look at what you saw today, it's very clear that we are an organization that have been operating for 99 years. We're a business that has a very clear purpose. We do take the spirit of Australia further. We believe that that served us well for that period of time. And we are very focused on making sure we deliver for all of our stakeholders.</p><p>And Andrew Parker went through in great detail what we're doing for the community. What is that -- what we're doing on the environment, what we're doing for regional communities, what we're doing for Australians in need. We think it's really key to our continuous prosperity that we have a focus on our social license to operate. And being part of that community, have been involved in that community is really a core part of what's made us successful for 99 years.</p><p>What you have also seen, I think, from Steph, Olivia, in particular, is our focus on the customer and how we believe what we've been doing with the customer gives us competitive strength. We have a very clear focus on caring for the customer, rewarding and the customer and knowing the customer. And I think each parts of what they're doing in their individual businesses goes across the entire group and delivers a sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>Steph took you through what we're doing in distribution, the Qantas channel, what we're doing in personalization and what's we're doing in revenue management. That's only starting to kick in. I think it is substantial competitive advantage here in this market and has huge upside to it. We also then had each of the businesses talking about their sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>Andrew David talked about the domestic market in terms of our market strength, our dual-brand strategy, our network size and the benefits that that are giving us. We are seeing that the market structure playing out to the benefit of Qantas, 98% by 2 airline groups, of Qantas' strength in those other areas, giving us over 80% of the profit builds.</p><p>We have given a target over the next 5 years as a consequence of that. If you go back a few years, people were thinking that the domestic market would never get back to $1 billion profit. Domestic market did. Our next target was that we would get Qantas to $1 billion profit. We did. Our next target now is that we get to margins of 18% for Qantas domestic and 22% for Jetstar domestic. They are achievable around the rest of the world, and given the structure in this market and our competitive advantages, we think we should be able to do that.</p><p>Tino gave a very clear path through for improvement in Qantas International. He showed that aircraft technology is changing that business. There's huge upside to the 787s replacing the 74s. That is a transition year next year in order to do that. But the benefits that we're now seeing from our partnerships worldwide with the 3 joint ventures, in particular, with the joint venture with American Airlines, again, having big upside that isn't in our numbers today gives us confidence that the international business will return its cost to capital of over 10% through the cycle and positions us well if we can make the business case work to actually launch Project Sunrise.</p><p>The performance of Perth-London has given us that competitive advantage that we think it's hard for other people to replicate. And if we can get the business case across the line, Project Sunrise, in my mind, is like the big bets we've made in the past. It's like Emirates, it's like Jetstar and it's like the work that we've done on Loyalty.</p><p>And we saw from Gareth this huge opportunity we have with the Asia Pacific region. The opportunity that we have with growth for markets that are going to be phenomenal over the next few years, but that we are going to be very disciplined on the markets that work for us. I think also a sleeper in the group is what's happening in Japan. And Gareth showed the opportunity there. We think it could be bigger than Jetstar Australia. It could be as profitable as Jetstar Australia. It's a slower pace and that happened here because of the way the market works, but the opportunity in Japan is amazing.</p><p>And you probably saw our secret weapon, Jetta, downstairs. I hope everybody didn't have a cuddle because that's inappropriate to do in the office space. What Jetta -- Jetta is a symbol of the brand and simple of how much it's penetrated in Japan. And finally, I think you saw that 2 years ago, we gave a target for loyalty. We said that we would get to $500 million to $600 million by 2022. And I think Liv has shown that we're on track to achieve that and has given us confidence to reconfirm that today. And that is why we've also given the targets in the other businesses. The 15% return on invested capital for Jetstar, the 10% for international, the 18% margin for Qantas domestic, the 22% margin for Jetstar. Now if all of them come together, we will be delivering for the shareholders because that means significant upside and shareholder returns on top of the $4 billion that we've returned to shareholders over the last 5 years on top of what we've seen in terms of the investment we've made in aircraft and customer. It continues to allow us to do that. And it is a virtuous circle. I believe, fundamentally, that you get the community right, you get the customer right and you get the employee engagement right, you can deliver for shareholders and continue to deliver. I think that's what Qantas has showed in the last 5 years. And hopefully, this plan and this strategy will say, for the next 5 years, we can even exceed that.</p><p>So can I wrap up by saying a few things? First of all, can I thank Fran and the team. There's a huge amount of work, as she said, that has gone into this. The team have been working very late nights on weekends. Can I thank everybody that presented and their teams behind it? You probably noticed the reference between how the teams work together. The one thing I think I'm most proud about is how well the team works together. And there is general support, and there's general interaction. And we know that the group can only be successful if all of these businesses if all of these segments if all of these different functions work together to achieve it. And typically, what you're seeing here is how we work on a day-to-day basis, which I think is a great credit for the senior management team.</p><p>I can wrap up by saying, I haven't got the ability to bribe with points here because we don't do that. But what we do have is a bar downstairs. Fran has said he's going to put her credit cards -- her credit cards on the table. Yes, to get points. So if anybody wants to join us for a drink. And I'm going to wrap up with one last video. And this is a video that talks about the century that we've just gone through on Qantas. How we're proud of that history, how we're proud of where we've come from and how this positions us well for the future. Thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Relatedly, H.E highlighted the initiatives that have been undertaken by both government and QCB to promote a solid and diversified economy as part of Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030).</p><p> The presentation featured Fintech as one of the major key challenges facing banks at present, driven by changes on both demand and supply sides. In this context, H.E remarked that QCB is providing the enabling regulatory framework. As part of this, it is proposed to introduce Fintech strategy, accompanied with strong risk culture and other related controls.</p><p>A lot of large Big-Tech players are entering the payments and financial services market, due to healthy margins, putting pressure on business models of banks.

Contextually, support is needed from other stakeholders such as supervisory and regulatory entities and educational institutions in order for banks to win the battle.</p><p>In conclusion, H.E stated that in this dynamic environment, if banks can provide competitive services, gain customer loyalty, attract talent and safeguard security, they will have an advantage over digital-only financial services providers.

It's an age of anger as trust in governments and major institutions is broken, because of the failure to protect people and share prosperity,\" said Sharan Burrow, general secretary, International Trade Union Confederation, arguing for the motion that big tech cannot be trusted to self-regulate.<br/>\"The impact of big tech companies is not helping because they're subverting privacy, competition, and indeed democracies as they're becoming global monopolies. And who has the right to monopolise power? We've never accepted it from governments; traditionally we've never accepted it from corporations.\"<br/>Lisa Witter, co-founder and executive chairperson, Apolitical, told the debate: \"Big tech is calling for this regulation \u2013 CEOs are asking for help,\" referencing tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Microsoft president Brad Smith, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, who last week said there was \"no question\" that AI needs regulation.<br/>However, Rebecca Masisak, chief executive officer, TechSoup, argued against the motion, saying that self-regulation requires a multi-disciplined stakeholder approach. \"Can we trust governments? Governments have agendas, too,\" she claimed. \"At times, they're really not keeping in mind what's best for citizens. And governments are not global, whereas the problems are.<br/>\"We can trust big tech to self-regulate with a model that engages a diverse set of global stakeholders, businesses, governments, and academia, and also big tech employees and grassroots civil society. The several million employees in big tech across 50 countries have the potential to meaningfully influence big tech to self-regulate.\"<br/>Malcolm Frank, president, Digital Business, Cognizant, suggested that big tech companies are already, to an extent, regulated by the public. \"Switching costs are unbelievably low for this industry,\" he told the debate. \"You don't like Google Maps?

However, the lack of regulations has led the industry to become less known for its remarkable innovations.\"<br/>The main theme of the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 50th Annual Meeting is, 'Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World'. However, a key element of the forum is the Fourth Industrial Revolution, opening up discussions on technology and trade governance. <br/>International speakers from a variety of industries will bring their perspectives and experiences to the debate, with three participants arguing for and three against the motion in front of a live audience and jury. The Oxford-style debate will also see jury members add their comments, critique arguments, and pose additional challenges to the debaters.<br/>Debaters include Sharan Burrow, general secretary, International Trade Union Confederation; Tristan Harris, executive director, Centre for Humane Technology; Lisa Witter, co-founder and executive chairperson, Apolitical; Andrew McAfee, co-director and co-founder, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy; Rebecca Masisak, chief executive officer, TechSoup; and Malcolm Frank, president, Digital Business, Cognizant.<br/>The judges are Dr Barraj; Helen E Clark; former Prime Minister of New Zealand and Shamina Singh, president, MasterCard Centre for Inclusive Growth &amp; Executive Vice President, Sustainability, MasterCard.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/6/157955781067.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/6/157955781067.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-165054756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1G-TB71-F11P-X2SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Barraj, Outreach Program Specialist at QatarDebate.<br/>'You only need to look at what Google is undertaking on an AI level, and what is being delivered across healthcare and life sciences, to witness the impact of technology on humanity. However, the lack of regulations has led the industry to become less known for its remarkable innovations.'<br/>Dr. Barraj believes that although tech companies do self-regulate, two chief concerns are yet to be resolved. 'The first is data leakage, which has seen millions of people exposed, and the second is how big tech firms are collecting, misusing, and perhaps selling data to third parties,' he said. 'This is a pressing issue, and it will remain one until a solution is found.'<br/>The main theme of the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 50th Annual Meeting is, Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World. However, a key element of the forum is the Fourth Industrial Revolution, opening up discussions on technology and trade governance.<br/>International speakers from a variety of industries will bring their perspectives and experiences to the debate, with three participants arguing for and three against the motion in front of a live audience and jury. The Oxford-style debate will also see jury members add their comments, critique arguments, and pose additional challenges to the debaters.<br/>Debaters include Sharan Burrow, General Secretary, International Trade Union Confederation; Tristan Harris, Executive Director, Center for Humane Technology; Lisa Witter, Co-Founder and Executive Chairperson, Apolitical; Andrew McAfee, Co-Director and Co-Founder, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy; Rebecca Masisak, Chief Executive Officer, TechSoup; and Malcolm Frank, President, Digital Business, Cognizant.<br/>The judges are Dr. Barraj; Helen E. Clark; former Prime Minister of New Zealand (1999-2008); and Shamina Singh, President, MasterCard Center for Inclusive Growth &amp; Executive Vice President, Sustainability, MasterCard.<br/>Speaking about the significance of the event at the WEF and the importance of fostering a culture of debate in today's world, Abdulrahman I. Al-Subaie, Head of Outreach Program, QD, said: 'Today, more than ever, we recognize that the life skills debating instills in its practitioners are the very same qualities that are needed for building a peaceful and prosperous society.<br/>'This idea is guided by an enduring belief that by raising the quality of discourse and exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of respect and sincerity, humanity is best equipped to prevail over the monumental challenges facing all of us.'<br/>The WEF will be held from January 21-24, bringing together more than 3,000 participants from around the world, including global leaders, industry experts, and business professionals.<br/>'The World Economic Forum is a platform where global challenges are addressed,' said Dr Barraj. 'It is a comprehensive event, attempting to improve the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas.'<br/>The debate takes place on Wednesday, January 22, and will be available to watch on the QatarDebate and NYTLive YouTube channels.<br/><br/>MENAFN2001202000702288ID1099575891</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MENENG-1099575891</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MENENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1C-SMB1-JCNX-340V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300954</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MENA English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38985\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On the Sidelines of the event Dr. R. Seetharaman CEO of Doha Bank said, The discussions at this event may cover inclusive growth, gender equality &amp; sustainable development to be focused at this event amidst global slowdown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to IMF head, Kristalina Georgieva, The world economy is experiencing a synchronized slowdown and in some of the largest emerging market economies, such as India and Brazil, the slowdown is even more pronounced this year. There is a serious risk that services and consumption could soon be affected as global trade growth has come to a near standstill. On the economic side discussions on economic policy in turbulent times, global trade and development and the current situation of global value chains (GVCs).</p><p>Escalating trade tensions are taking a toll on the global economy and have spread into sensitive areas like technology and currencies. Many central banks have appropriately lowered interest rates, but there are limits with this strategy. No-one can doubt that we are once more living through a period of turmoil. But there has been no comparable questioning of the basic ideas determining economic policy. The failure to re-examine those ideas risks another financial crisis. Global value chains powered an economic revolution over the past three decades: growth accelerated, incomes rose, and poverty rates plunged. Almost 50% of global trade involves GVCs, but rising trade tensions and uncertainties over market access threaten their future. On Sustainable development, concerns continue to mount over the impact of climate change and central banks are taking action in a range of areas within their mandates. Discussions are going to happen as to how Central Banks can support fight against climate change. In relation to Sustainable development goals, discussions will evolve on how to get the goals to reality by 2030 and whether the needed financing is in place. It is also expected to cover catalyzing environmental, Social and Governance investment. The world is suffering a historic loss of biodiversity, threatening natures ability to supply nutritious food, clean air and water, sustain livelihoods, regulate climate and to act as a buffer against extreme weather. Discussions are expected to happen on how to plan to shape the new global biodiversity framework.</p><p>The role of Gender equality has drawn attention in recent years. There is a going to discussion on Women, Work, and Leadership with IMF head, Kristalina Georgieva. It will focus on the macro-criticality of gender equality, including the need to increase the presence of women at the highest levels of decision-making, and how to address barriers to womens career growth, such as unpaid work and how it influences womens decisions to enter the labor market. Discussions are also going to be held on Unleashing the Potential of Women Entrepreneurs through Finance and Markets and Promoting Womens Financial Inclusion through capacity development.</p><p>On Technology discussions are the role of fintech in inclusive growth of economies. Fintech innovators are transforming financial services around the world. While the world has made progress toward universal inclusion, 3 billion people are still left out or are poorly served by the formal system. Fintech promises to play a central role in addressing this gap. Technology enables innovators and incumbent financial service providers to expand access to services, while improving quality. Rich data offers new ways of evaluating loan eligibility or estimating risk. Advances in technology and connectivity are spurring a new wave of business models. Big Tech are entering Fintech. They bring technology, deep pockets, massive networks, mountains of data, and great user experiences. The opportunities and the risks that are emerging as the financial sector is reshaped, and how regulatory strategies can be adopted to foster sound, inclusive financial innovation and expand the reach of financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUCLID-157354633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUCLID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9J-N721-F11P-X0N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343637</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TendersInfo - Euclid Infotech Pvt.

Even so, according to industry insiders the Qatari banking sector is in good shape and confidence has been fully restored following the early days of the economic blockade in June 2017, when a rapid outflow of non-resident deposits rattled the sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Qatari banking sector remains sound. Local market liquidity has definitely improved, and the cost of funding is coming down compared with the beginning of the blockade,\" says Dr R Seetharaman, CEO of Doha Bank, one of Qatar's largest lenders. \"The sector's risk profile is improving, but it still isn't strong compared with the profile we had before June 2017, when the blockade started,\" he adds. \"The loan-to-deposit ratio has been really under pressure, at 125% to 130%. Now it's back on track: the loan-todeposit ratio in March was 114%, and deposit growth was 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019.\"</p><p>A RISE IN RATINGS In October 2018 Moody's changed its outlook for Qatar's banking system from 'negative' to 'stable', reflecting the resilience of the country's economy and banking system to the ongoing regional dispute, the ratings agency said.</p><p>\"The Qatari economy has rebalanced as supply chain disruptions recovered rapidly following the blockade from other Gulf states and Egypt,\" Nitish Bhojnagarwala, vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody's, said at the time. \"Likewise, the banking system rebalanced its funding profile with the reduced liquidity from Gulf Co-operation Council sources offset by inflows from government and related entities,\" he added. Moody's found that public sector inflows had effectively stabilised domestic liquidity, reducing Qatari banks' reliance on market funding and offsetting funding pressures linked to the ongoing geopolitical tension. Meanwhile, the agency predicted that loan performances would remain broadly stable, with the economic slowdown in recent years, coupled with challenges in the construction and contracting sectors, resulting in only modest pressure on their performance. System-wide problem loans were expected to increase from 2% in 2018 to about 2.2% to 2.5% of gross loans by 2019.</p><p>At the same time, the ratings agency predicted average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.8% between 2018 and 2022, up from 1.6% in 2017.</p><p>RETURNING CONFIDENCE The 2017 blockade by four of its neighbours led to a rapid outflow of external financing for Qatari banks, mostly in the form of nonresident deposits and inter-bank placements. According to S&amp;P Global Ratings, outflows of non-resident funding had reached roughly $22bn (equivalent to 13% of Qatar's GDP) by year-end 2017, \"about three-quarters of which was related to the boycotting countries repatriating deposits they had in Qatar.\"</p><p>However, those deposits were quickly replaced by liquidity injected by the Qatar Central Bank and entities such as Qatar Investment Authority, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, to the tune of about $40bn, which helped to mitigate any damage. Non-resident deposits have gradually recovered to pre-boycott levels, according to S&amp;P, \"demonstrating investor confidence in the financial sector\". Non-resident deposits increased 23.3% year on year in December 2018.</p><p>There are currently 18 banks operating in Qatar, serving a population of roughly 2.6 million. Total banking sector assets grew by 4.1% year on year in March, the latest figures available, according to Qatar National Bank (QNB), with bank deposit growth and credit growth both at 3.1%.</p><p>\"Despite the economic blockade, deposit and loan growth remained strong,\" says a spokesperson for QNB, the country's largest lender. \"The banking system remains well capitalised with banks' capital adequacy ratio above 16%, well above Basel III guidelines. Asset quality also remains high with non-performing loans [NPLs] steady at 1.7%. Profitability remains solid with returns on equity close to 14%,\" he adds.</p><p>QNB saw net profits of QR13.8bn ($3.8bn) in 2018, up 5% year on year, with total assets up 6% to QR862bn. Customer deposits also increased by 5%, while the bank's cost-to-income ratio dropped from 29.1% to 25.8%, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 99.3% as of December 31, 2018. The 2018 results were considered among the best in the bank's 55-year history. NPLs came in at 1.9%.</p><p>RAISING FUNDS One clear sign of the overall confidence in the Qatari banking sector, and the economy as a whole, has been the ease at which Qatar and Qatari banks have been able to raise external funds. According to a report by Oxford Business Group, Qatar's banks issued a combined $7.4bn-worth of foreign currency-denominated bonds in the first half of 2018 alone.</p><p>\"In 2018, Qatar returned to 'business as usual' on its transformation journey towards a sustainable, knowledge-based economy, and Qatari banks have found little difficulty raising funds in 2019 from the international investment community,\" says Joseph Abraham, group CEO of Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ), the country's third largest lender by assets. CBQ, which is in the third year of a five-year strategic restructuring aimed at cleaning its loan book and improving operational effectiveness, saw net profits of QR1.7bn in 2018, up 175.5% year on year. The bank also reduced its cost-to-income ratio from 37.5% to 33.4%, closer to the Qatari average.</p><p>In addition to the banks, the country appears to have had little difficulty raising funds. In March 2019, Qatar sold $12bn in bonds, attracting demand of about $50bn.</p><p>This followed a similar sized issuance in April 2018, which was also heavy oversubscribed.</p><p>This demand emphasises the \"strong investor appetite for Qatar's long-term debts,\" says Bassel Gamal, group CEO of Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), the country's largest Islamic bank. He adds that QIB issued its own $750m five-year sukuk in March 2019, which was 4.1 times oversubscribed. Almost half of the sukuk (46%) was sold to Asian investors, with 23% going to Middle Eastern investors and 21% to Europeans.</p><p>A LITTLE LOCAL TENSION The geopolitical standoff between the countries has filtered down to the banking sector. In March, Qatar said it would no longer allow First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), the largest bank in the UAE, to provide financial services to new customers in Doha. This followed accusations of currency manipulation against the bank.</p><p>Qatar has accused its neighbours of attempting to devalue its currency, securities and derivatives markets, and in 2018 asked US regulators to investigate the US subsidiary of FAB as part of its concerns. In April, Qatar filed lawsuits in London and New York against FAB, as well as Saudi Arabia's Samba Bank and Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland, alleging financial market manipulation aimed at undermining its currency and bonds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qatari banks have been reducing their exposure to the UAE, primarily though asset swaps with UAE-based banks. \"We have reduced our exposure,\" says Doha Bank's Mr Seetharaman. \"From about QR6bn, we have brought it down to QR2.2bn on the UAE side. We are de-risking the bank and concentrating more on Qatar and the local economy,\" he adds, though the bank plans to maintain a scaled-back UAE presence in case the geopolitical situation improves.</p><p>Doha Bank saw net profits fall by more than 25% in 2018, to QR830m, after the bank took significant loan loss provision. The bank's net operating income stood at QR2.6bn, with total assets of QR96.1bn.</p><p>Meanwhile, CBQ has been trying to sell its 40% stake in UAE-based United Arab Bank, but so far no deal has been announced.</p><p>M&amp;A MOVEMENT With a relatively small domestic market, mergers within the Qatari banking sector have long been discussed. In late 2018, Barwa Bank and the International Bank of Qatar (IBQ) reached a final merger agreement, with the official completion of the merger taking place in April. The new sharia-compliant bank, which will have total assets of QR80bn, is to be renamed Lusail Bank.</p><p>\"We are proud to be part of the first bank merger in Qatar. It is no small feat to have brought together two of Qatar's ambitious financial institutions under one consolidated entity,\" Omar Bouhadiba, managing director of IBQ, said at the time, adding that both parties are confident the combined entity will play an integral role in reshaping the domestic industry.</p><p>Further mergers and acquisitions could also take place in the medium term. \"Qatar has 18 banks regulated by the Qatar Central Bank all competing for business in a relatively small domestic market,\" says CBQ's Mr Abraham. \"With margins under pressure, conditions are favourable for further consolidation, but we expect the proposed merger between IBQ and Barwa to play out first before we see any further movement in local banking M&amp;A activity,\" he adds, saying that a merger involving CBQ is not part of the bank's current plans.</p><p>Qatari banks are also continuing to grow their foreign operations. In 2016, CBQ completed its takeover of Turkish lender Alternatifbank, the same year that QNB completed its takeover of Turkey's Finansbank. Other banks have also been expanding abroad.</p><p>\"International operations are increasingly important as QNB continues to diversify its portfolio to balance risk and ensure future revenue opportunities within its core markets and beyond to south-east Asia,\" says the QNB spokesperson, with the bank now present in more than 31 countries across Asia, Africa and Europe.</p><p>ISLAMIC FINANCE HOPES According to Qatar Central Bank, Islamic banking assets accounted for 24.7% of total banking sector assets as of March 2019, marking a steady increase from 20.9% in December 2010. The total assets of Qatar's four Islamic banks rose by 1.77% in the first nine months of 2018, while assets grew 3.81%. Over the past five years the growth of Islamic banking sector assets outpaced those of the conventional banking sector, with a compound annual growth rate of 13%, compared with 11% for the conventional banks. \"The Islamic banking sector of Qatar has recorded many significant achievements over the past few years as it has continued to strengthen its capabilities in becoming mainstream by having the products and services, as well as the capacity, to structure and finance major projects in Qatar,\" says QIB's Mr Gamal. QIB posted a net profit of QR2.75bn in 2018, up 14.5% on 2017 figures, with total assets up 2% to QR153.2bn.</p><p>Qatar is targeting a greater involvement in the $2000bn global Islamic finance market, and in 2018 launched the world's largest single-country Islamic exchange-traded fund, with initial assets of $120m. \"Our vision is to cover the entire globe's Islamic financial transactions between three financial centres: Qatar, Turkey and Malaysia,\" says Sheikha Alanoud Bint Hamad Al-Thani, managing director of business development at Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), a business and financial centre located in Doha. In that equation, Qatar would serve the greater Middle East region.</p><p>Qatar also announced earlier in 2019 the establishment of Energy Bank, a sharia-complaint financial institution that, according to those involved, is set to become the largest Islamic energy-focused bank in the world. Based in the QFC, the investment bank, which is expected to be operational in late 2019, will focus on oil and gas, petrochemicals and renewable energy projects both domestically and globally, with a targeted capital of $10bn.</p><p>FOLLOWING FINTECH As well as strengthening its position in global Islamic finance, Qatar is eyeing a leading role in the Middle East when it comes to the growth of fintech. Under Qatar's current strategic plan for the financial sector, running from 2017 to 2022, fintech has been recognised as key area for achieving long-term development goals for the financial sector.</p><p>In October, the central bank governor, Abdulla Bin Saoud Al-Thani, announced the upcoming launch of a banking service platform to support and promote fintech. Meanwhile, in April 2018 Qatar Fintech Hub signed a memorandum of understanding with Lithuania's Fintech Hub to contribute to the development of the fintech industry.</p><p>\"With recent initiatives by the government, fintech is gaining momentum. The infrastructure, competencies and government support will facilitate fostering fintech culture in Qatar over the next [two years],\" says Mr Seetharaman.</p><p>Banks are also aware of their need to adapt to this new landscape. \"The rapid pace of innovation and digital transformation is increasing pressure on the banking sector as new non-bank incumbents, such as big tech companies, fintech and digital platform companies are increasing competition and eroding margins,\" says the QNB spokesperson. Qatar's banking sector continues to grow, as well as look to the future, even while the uncertainty of the continuing blockade remains.</p><p>The IslamIc bankIng secTor of QaTar has conTInued To sTrengThen ITs capabIlITIes by havIng The producTs and servIces as well as The capacITy To sTrucTure and fInance major projecTs Bassel Gamal</p><p>local markeT lIQuIdITy has defInITely Improved, and The cosT of fundIng Is comIng down compared wITh The begInnIng of The blockade R Seetharaman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Major player: QIB posted net profit of QR2.75bn in 2018, up 14.5% on 2017</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-149831345</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W82-7R51-JCBW-N2D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2212\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001POX</classCode><className>MOODY'S CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC7323 CREDIT REPORTING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>MCO (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Mergers &amp;

Facebook, for example, has announced the launch of their own cryptocurrency, Libra[1], and an accompanying crypto wallet, called Calibra. Mastercard also appears poised[2] to enter the crypto markets on its own mission. There is also the messaging app giant Kakao, which has similarly announced[3] it is to enter the wallet game. </p><p>While institutional support is needed for global mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, their participation does not equal universal success, according to Daniel Popa, CEO of Anchor. Large companies do not necessarily have the current infrastructure, nor the history of dealing with the ever evolving nature of crypto security. What they do have is customer loyalty, and brand recognition, which could expedite the crypto revolution more quickly. Digital Journal spoke with Daniel Popa[4], CEO of Anchor[5] to understand more about the future evolution of cryptocurrencies.  Digital Journal: How are crypto wallets evolving? Daniel Popa: What we have been seeing over the last two years in the evolution of crypto wallets is their diversification for activities beyond allowing access to cryptocurrencies. Private keys are being used to perform various blockchain transactions such as selling stocks, tracking supply chain assets, and executing smart contracts for a variety of purposes.  A crypto wallet is a type of software which maintains the private keys that are used to verify and digitally sign for different crypto and blockchain transactions. Another avenue that crypto wallets are evolving into is something we are calling 'smart wallets'. This is in essence a merging of the traditional hot and cold wallet, as it is a physical device that would act in the same manner as Apple pay does. The smart wallet would take the appearance of a traditional credit card, but would have a screen, house all of your various credit and bank cards, loyalty cards, and cryptocurrency private keys.  DJ: What are differences between hot and cold storage? Popa: Hot storage are the most ubiquitous form of crypto wallets available to the public today. They are the digital, invisible wallets that exist as desktop apps, mobile apps, or on websites you can log in to. Hot storage can be accessed anywhere in the world that there is an internet connection. Cold storage for crypto wallets are the physical manifestation on a device which holds private keys. They are physical, USB-like devices which maintain the private keys offline, and have to be plugged into a network in order to function.  DJ: Why has Facebook launched its own cryptocurrency? Popa:There is actually a lot of discussion about whether we should even be considering Facebook's new cryptocurrency, the Libra, a cryptocurrency at all. According to Facebook, Libra will operate on a 'permissioned' blockchain, unlike the dominant cryptocurrencies that the industry has grown on. Compared to bitcoin and ethereum, which operate on a peer-to-peer basis, Libra will validate its transactions through the Libra Association, which is made up of corporations with their own self interest to monetize the process. This is hardly the path of the most popular cryptocurrencies, which are initially mined and then traded across crypto exchanges.  We believe - as well as many in the crypto community - that Facebook has launched its own cryptocurrency because it sees the business potential for creating its own stablecoin to use across its many platforms - existing and planned. From their perspective, they are offering a solution to the problems associated with remittances in a globalized economy, and in their own words 'offering to be the currency of choice for the 1.7 billion unbanked globally.' While these intentions are well meaning, it appears to be an avenue for further centralization of data, and therefore power and control.  DJ: What will be the technical and functional differences between Calibra and other crypto wallets? Popa: Calibra will function on a 'permissioned' blockchain, meaning that a cohort of companies will regulate and maintain transactions on the blockchain. This is hardly the stuff of publicly visible, permissionless blockchains that have come to define the sector.  DJ: What will be the impact of Facebook's entrance on crypto financial markets? Popa:Facebook has already caused quite a stir, and they haven't even commercially released the Libra or Calibra yet. The U.S. Congress has already thrown up a series of roadblocks for them, even going so far as requesting that they hold off on the launch, as they are worried about the potential negative effects (and uncontrollable effects) it could have on the US Dollar. On the other side of the equation, Facebook's entrance into crypto is a validation of the underlying blockchain technology, and its near ascendance to mainstream popularity. It is in this sense having an enormous impact on the reputation of crypto financial markets, and solidifying the legitimacy of crypto as a reputable corner of the global financial system.  DJ: What impact with Kakao's entry have? Any existing social media companies and internet companies that enter the crypto markets will have an effect on the adoption of blockchain and crypto technologies, full stop. However, some will have a larger impact than others. Kakao is a popular app, but mainly in South Korea, as it hovers around 49 million monthly active users. Compare this to Facebook's 500 million monthly active users globally. South Korea already has a high penetration of crypto users, so it remains to be seen how much this will move the needle in terms of having an effect on crypto globally. DJ: What is the current state of the crypto regulatory proposals in the U.S. and globally? Popa:The current state of crypto is in flux globally, and rather chaotically. In the US, crypto regulation is at a standstill after the announcement of Libra by Facebook. Regulators are concerned about privacy rights, destabilization of USD, and the potential for money laundering for terrorism and drug cartels. Currently, US agencies classify crypto different across agencies, which can lead to a patchwork of regulations: IRS views it as property, Commodities Future Trading Commission views them as commodities, and SEC views them as securities.  However, countries like New Zealand and the U.K. are tepidly advancing the regulatory apparatus around crypto. New Zealand recently ruled that receiving income in bitcoin is legal and therefore taxable. The U.K. hasn't outright banned it, nor has it produced any crypto specific legislation like Malta or Bermuda, mostly because they do not deem it a threat to the British Pound or the stability of the U.K. economy.

About 460,000 H-1B visa workers are employed in the United States, predominantly in high-tech sectors like information technology and software development, with up to 85,000 new visas awarded by a random lottery each year. But the program has long been criticized as a way for U.S. companies to pass over skilled American workers and instead hire foreign workers at far lower salary rates than their American counterparts. As well, the program has increasingly been captured by companies[1] that use the program to offshore American jobs. </p><p>Meanwhile, these foreign workers are tethered to their employers, making them vulnerable to exploitation[2]. For years, members of Congress have tried to address rampant abuses in the system only to run into resistance from powerful companies in the tech industry that have embedded the program in their business model. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump pointed to the H-1B system as an instance of how Washington puts politics before the needs of Americans and pledged to reform U.S. visa programs as part of his America First platform. But if he wants to achieve real reform[3], instead of using it as yet another opportunity to villainize immigrants[4], Trump will have to navigate a tricky political landscape\u2014something that thus far has completely outstripped his capabilities. I spoke with Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, about the problems with the H-1B program and what to make of Trump's new executive order. What follows is an edited and condensed version of our conversation. Justin Miller: What was the original intent of the H-1B visa program?  Daniel Costa: It's basically a temporary worker program to bring people from abroad to work in what's called a specialty occupation\u2014all that means is somebody is coming in to work in a job that requires the education that you at least get with a bachelor's degree. It's for educated guest workers, basically. When companies who use the program talk about it, they always say it's for when they can't find a U.S. worker\u2014when there's a labor shortage\u2014and that the workers who are coming in are the best and the brightest. People sometimes say that the intent of the program is for that, but the rules were never written that way, so it's hard for me to say what the intent really was. But people think of it in that way, in part, because there's been a good PR job from the tech industry and because people don't understand the program very well. What are the driving factors that you would say have compromised the H-1B program?  The low wages are the main problem, since you can pay an H-1B worker so much less than a comparable U.S. worker, that gives huge incentive to employers who can cut costs. And the companies that have taken advantage of that the most are actually the IT outsourcing companies. Say you're Bank of America and you want 30 staffers to do your back office IT; you can just call one of these outsourcing companies and say I need this many people for this kind of project. Those kinds of companies make up the biggest employers that get the most H-1Bs\u2014in any given year these outsourcing companies get between one-third to one-half of all those visas. The micro-data that we've seen through FOIA requests show that they're paying on the lowest range of wages, especially compared to other companies that don't have that business model. And these outsourcing companies are the ones that have been involved in all the big scandals where U.S. workers have been forced to train their own replacements, and the H-1B worker takes over a job of an American worker who was earning $100,000 and the H-1B worker is earning around $50,000. So how do these big tech companies like Google and Facebook utilize the program?  They're not perfect either. While some of the main, most egregious scandals have been with the outsourcing companies, everybody--including Apple, Microsoft, Google\u2014is using the program to pay low wages. These companies, even though they're paying slightly higher wages than the outsourcing companies and are applying for more green cards to keep their workers in the U.S. permanently, are still taking advantage of the program by paying low wages. If you look at the wage of a software developer in Silicon Valley, the going rate is around $150,000 a year, but you can pay the level-one wage to someone you bring in on a H-1B and it's about $40,000 less than the local average wage. You multiply the $40,000 by six years (which is the length of the visa), and times that by the number of H-1B workers you have, that's a lot of money. Trump declared last week, when introducing his executive order, that the program 'should include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers.' In terms of the actual executive order that he issued, what does it do in practice?  Well it does nothing in practice as of now, and has no teeth to it. It only had two bullet points about immigration. One was directing federal agencies to look into fraud and abuse in the immigration system generally. The other was about H-1B and specifically referencing the program's lottery\u2014every year, there's more petitions for H-1B workers than there are slots for workers, and so because it's not clear in the law that you can prioritize one application or another, the government has always allocated them by a random lottery. The bullet point is basically saying, if you read between the lines, 'We shouldn't be doing this in a random way; we should be doing it in a way that prioritizes the highest-paid, highest-skilled workers.' It doesn't propose how it's going to do that, but it's a signal that they're looking into a regulation that would prioritize the visas in some way rather than doing it randomly. What would an ideal regulation do to address the current problems with the H-1B system?  On the lottery specifically, they would just create a prioritization scheme that would then allocate the petitions that have a level four [the highest of the prevailing wage levels] to go first, then the level three, and then the level two, and so on. Or they could set it up in some other way, like the bipartisan Durbin-Grassley bill[5], which has a prioritization scheme that's not just wages; it also prioritizes STEM degrees from U.S universities [along with several other factors]. What are the big unanswered questions for you regarding how the Trump administration intends to move forward on this?  The biggest unanswered question to me is what they're going to do with the Labor Department. The proposed budget cut of 21 percent for the next fiscal year is across the Labor Department. You could propose the best regulation in the world to protect migrant and American workers, but if you've got nobody at the Labor Department to enforce it and investigate abuses, it's going to be totally pointless. What are the pitfalls of substantial and impactful H-1B reform?  The biggest obstacle to reform is really the division on this. There's [Utah Senator Orrin] Hatch's I-Squared Act[6] [which seeks to expand the program without reform], which has had people like [Democratic Senators] Amy Klobuchar and Chris Coons, and [Republican Senator] Marco Rubio on it, so there's a bipartisan coalition on that side. And there's a bipartisan coalition on the Durbin-Grassley side, which would reform the system by cutting out the two lowest wage levels, and require that you first recruit U.S. workers. Jeff Sessions, Bernie Sanders, and Sherrod Brown have also signed on to the bill in the past. So you've got the far right and far left together on that; then there are the left and right centrists on the Hatch bill. So what ends up happening is you really need legislative reform, but it's also quite possible that those two sides are going to cancel each other out and nothing will get done. It's also possible that the Trump administration, if they end up doing a new prioritization scheme with other regulations enforcement and while cracking on abusive employers, that might put some pressure on employers to negotiate around some of the Durbin-Grassley type reforms. But it's anybody's guess as to what happens\u2014it's just too hard to tell. What's the topline takeaway for you on Trump's purported interest in reform?  I'm skeptical. If you look at the specific, narrow language that they're hinting at by itself, it looks like a promising development. When you consider it in the whole context of the criminalization of immigrants generally and the scapegoating and everything else the Trump administration has done, as well as the proposed budget cuts, it's really hard to believe that the administration is going to move forward with this in a way that actually protects migrant and U.S. workers and helps raise their wages.

The Baltimore resident is the founder of the Future Today Institute (FTI). As a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, Webb developed and teaches the Master of Business Administration course on strategic foresight and futures forecasting. An accomplished author, Webb has published multiple books on technology, including \u201cData, A Love Story: How I Cracked The Online Dating Code To Meet My Match\u201d and \u201cThe Signals are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream. \u201d A few days after moderating a panel for the HBO futuristic show \u201cWestworld\u201d at Comic Con International in San Diego, Webb answered our technology questions. </p><p>The Daily Record (TDR): In March, FTI released its 12th annual Tech Trends Report and found 315 advancements in emerging technologies. What are a couple that will definitely be impacting the mainstream soon? Amy Webb (AW): Over the next few decades, talking will replace typing for everyday tasks. Our mobile phones will recede to the background. Rather than having just one device that is our primary interface, we will instead have many devices that interconnect, and we will communicate with them by talking, loudly and in undetectable whispers. Home automation will lead to a prolific use of automated machines and equipment where we live. That could be horrible: It could lead to a digital dependency in which we are unable to make even the most basic decisions on our own. On the other hand, it could lead to robust, affordable diagnostic testing at home, which would mean better preventative care and healthier communities. TDR: What were the key findings in this year\u2019s report? * AW: This year we had several key findings. One persistent theme in this year\u2019s report is surveillance. Whether it\u2019s how hard we press on our mobile phone screens, our faces as we cross an intersection, our genetic matches with distant relatives, our conversations in the kitchen or even the associations we keep, we are now being continually monitored. Just by virtue of being alive in 2019, you are generating data  both intentionally and unwittingly  that is be mined, refined, productized and monetized. We will start to see the emergence of \u201cPersonal Data Records,\u201d or PDRs. This is a single unifying ledger that includes all of the data we create as a result of our digital usage (think internet and mobile phones), but it will also include other sources of information: our school and work histories (diplomas, previous and current employers); our legal records (marriages, divorces, arrests); our financial records (home mortgages, credit scores, loans, taxes); travel (countries visited, visas); dating history (online apps); health (electronic health records, genetic screening results, exercise habits); and shopping history (online retailers, in-store coupon use). Your PDR will be heritable  a comprehensive record passed down to and used by your children. Ideally, you will be the owner of your PDR, it will be fully interoperable between systems, and big tech companies would simply act as custodians. We are at the beginning of our transition from email and social media logins and passwords to PDRs. We're also focusing on China: Through its various state initiatives, China is building infrastructure and next-generation internet networks across Southeast Asia and Latin America. No other country\u2019s government is racing towards the future with as much force and velocity as China. This means big shifts in the balance of geopolitical power in the years ahead. Lawmakers around the world are not prepared to deal with new challenges that arise from emerging science and technology. In 2019, we are sure to see proposals for new regulatory frameworks. However these new rules, regulations and policies won't be modeled to understand their broader, next-order implications. TDR: This year\u2019s report was your largest ever. Why was it bigger than previous years? AW: It had to do with several inflection points, an infusion of capital in key areas of R&amp;D and commercial breakthroughs that happened in 2018. Technology begets new technology. TDR: What is your definition of a futurist? AW: The birth of modern strategic foresight can be traced back to the early 1900s. Futurists use data to identify weak signals and trends, calculate the trajectory and velocity of change, and to build models that describe plausible outcomes. We don't make predictions, we make connections. I advise Fortune 500 companies, the federal government and the military, using strategic foresight tools and the methodology I developed to confront deep uncertainty about the future. TDR: Your book \u201cThe Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity\u201d came out in March. What inspired you to write it? AW: Artificial intelligence is the next era of computing, and because it intersects with so many other facets of everyday life it became a focus of our research about a decade ago. During the normal course of building models and scenarios, I found that I kept coming back to the same few companies over and over. That got me wondering: what happens to society when we transfer power to a system built by a small group of people that is designed to make decisions for everyone? The answer isn\u2019t as simple as it may seem, because we now rely on these companies  and they are entrenched into our economies and systems of governing. When it comes to AI, there\u2019s a lot of misplaced optimism and fear  and too little concrete planning for our farther futures. I wrote \u201cThe Big Nine\u201d to both educate and inspire. Meaningful collaboration between the big tech giants, prioritizing interoperability and transparency, and courageous leadership in the wake of market demands is what will save us from serious threats on AI\u2019s horizon. TDR: What do you hope people take away from the book? AW: The book is meant to jolt readers into action. We need to start making smarter decisions on AI in the present. * One of Webb\u2019s answers previously appeared on Medium.com as a part of a column she wrote for the publication in March.</p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2019 BridgeTower Media.

Williams worked as a technology and business strategist at Google for 10 years and recently received his Ph.D. from the University of Oxford. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Daily Princetonian : Many of us have long suspected that Twitter and Instagram have taken a toll on our functional attentional capacities, but you argue that our devices have taken more than that. You argue that digital technology not only undermines our abilities to do what we want, but also to be who we want to be and to engage in reflection and reasoning to define our values. This has serious implications for our political lives. What worries you the most?</p><p>James Williams : What worries me the most is that we don't yet have the prerequisites in place for the right kind of conversation, and my worry is that the situation might devolve under our feet faster than we can describe the problem. So that's one thing I was trying to do with the book is figure out how to put a bound on the problem, because it's described in very disparate ways in societal discourse, from the problems of big tech to social media to distractions. What I was trying to do is just figure out the essential elements and how can we move forward with a shared language for this. I don't claim to have figured that out, but hopefully the book is a step in the right direction.</p><p>DP: Let's talk solutions. You argue that policymakers, among others, can catalyze corrective action. What are some examples of good and bad digital technology policy?</p><p>JW: One example of where regulation can enhance people's freedom by regulating technology is in the area of net neutrality, where an internet-service provider shouldn't be able to partner with a content provider to create fast lanes and slow lanes. That's an example in which regulation can play a great role. In the [United States], some of that has been undone. Hopefully it will be redone before too long.</p><p>Where you see negative types of regulation is where the problem is insufficiently defined or where solutions are hastily undertaken. In the [European Union], there's a law that requires website owners to obtain consent from each user whose browsing behavior they wish to measure with tracking \"cookies.\" That's a good idea in principle, but what it means in practice is that every user has to click a button, creating 15 more decisions you have to make each day as a user. There's a cognitive load cost that isn't really taken into account. Furthermore, the consent-gathering exercise becomes an exercise in persuasion. Sites will make a dialogue box look like a pop-up ad or use the advertising methods to optimize for whichever type of consent dialogue results in the most consent, so it's just manufactured consent.</p><p>DP: I wonder how employers and employees should understand your book. Some demands on our attention come from around-the-clock work emails. Do emails constitute a similar threat to our attentional freedom, and if so, whose job is it to limit those effects?</p><p>JW: The sheer quantity of information that's out there and the fact that it's available 24/7 means that we need to figure out where those boundaries are drawn. In France, they passed a law limiting the hours in which employers can require workers to respond to emails. There's also a question of organizational culture. The question of responsibility will vary from situation to situation. It's partly a technical and partly a cultural issue, because it's not only email but things like Slack and other kinds of workplace software.</p><p>Email is not a platform like Facebook or Twitter. It's a protocol, which means there is a decision to distribute it. It's good in a way, because there may be a case to be made for responding to email, for doctors, for example. So it will depend.</p><p>DP: Have you received any feedback from your former colleagues in the Silicon Valley?</p><p>JW: I keep in touch with my friends and colleagues in the industry a lot. The reaction has been uniformly positive. One thing they've expressed that they appreciate about the book is how there's criticism but not a kind of moralized blame, like you see in media coverage, and the \"fight the monster\" mentality you see in news articles because it get clicks and sells ads. They appreciate the nuance and that the book recognizes the systemic issues and does not blame individuals. It's a solution-oriented book.</p><p>One of my aims was to make it be tech criticism in the sense of literary or art criticism. If someone is doing literary or art criticism, you wouldn't think they don't like literature or art. They want to tease out the nuances and fundamentally make it better, so that was my aim and I've been heartened that that's been the response from people I know in the industry.</p><p>DP: How have your views changed since you wrote the book?</p><p>JW: There are certainly ways my view has evolved since I wrote the book two years ago, in the same way the tech landscape and the societal response to it has evolved. When I wrote the book, these questions of tech and persuasion weren't really part of the day-to-day consciousness of people. They certainly are now, in part because of the various political earthquakes in the past two years, but also because people are thinking more seriously and more critically about the role in these technologies in their lives.</p><p>There are so many levels to the problem and so many levels to the solution. But there are a lot more people thinking about it today than there were a few years ago.</p><p>DP: Out of personal curiosity, what do you do to limit screen time and cognitive load?</p><p>JW: Part of the reason I started looking at this stuff is that I felt it in my own life. There are ways to rearrange technologies in our own lives, but [at] the end of the day it's a systemic problem. There are minor, simple things I do, but I don't consider myself an exemplar. I think people should do what works for them. I'm reluctant to be too prescriptive in this regard.</p><p>DP: Anything else you'd like to add?</p><p>JW: One important thing is to protect and value these enclaves where there's resistance against this competition for our attention. Two of the institutions I'm most concerned about are journalism and academia.</p><p>Journalism seems to me to have already capitulated to the Twitter style of thought and communication, and I think academia is getting there pretty quickly. The more we can see these institutions as essential for democracy and ensure that there are countervailing dynamics against the comp for attention as the core goal - that's an essential thing for us to be doing more now.</p><p>DP: Can you say more about the \"Twitter style?\"</p><p>JW: Twitter is the newswire now. Journalists say they are on Twitter all day every day; it's where breaking news happens. I see people in academia that are becoming more like Twitter: angstier, less nuanced, and prone to use outrage in a way they weren't before. It's something I feel and see. I think this is becoming the main cognitive style in our culture, as epitomized by Trump's success and presidency. It's the infrastructure of journalism now.</p><p>I asked one of my friends who's a journalist what he thought journalistic courage looks like today. He said it is writing a piece that won't go viral, won't get clicks, but that you think is really important. I thought it was a telling answer.</p><p>DP: In academia, too?</p><p>JW: Academia is one of the best examples of a self-contained metric economy. The metrics of success have to do with citations, which are academic retweets. There was an article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" saying that we will soon see a number of viral articles being formalized as inputs in tenure decisions. Practically speaking, we're probably already there. Academia has always been this enclave where depth of thought is unconstrained by immediate workplace demands. The more it adopts this style of the attention economy and social media, we stand to lose something that is precious.</p><p>Suggested Articles</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4238305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-SS31-JBSN-32RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1397\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Princetonian: Princeton University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As an early adopter of Twitter, for example, I embraced its efficiency to communicate a message, unfiltered, to a broad audience. Technology giants such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, have reengineered the economic, social and cultural landscape by transforming, innovating and disrupting the way things are done. Driving along what once was dubbed the information superhighway, entrepreneurs accelerated ideas, products and services across various platforms, reaching deeply into the personal lives of everyday Americans. </p><p>Left largely untethered by government regulation, the pioneering men and women of the digital frontier face serious questions about their approach to privacy. Facebookis caught in the cross-hairs of the unfolding investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. Recent revelations have exposed a potentially significant breach of privacy and misuse of data for 50 million account holders. But Facebookcertainly isn't the only company that harvests large amounts of data from its users. Google, Twitter and others also collect information, often to sell it to advertisers. Greater transparency can help consumers better understand how their personal information is being collected, used and protected. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have scheduled an April 10 hearing to examine the future of data privacy in the social media industry and discuss a better path forward. I've invited the chief executives from Facebook, Googleand Twitter to participate and answer directly to the American people. The tech industry has an obligation to respond to widespread and growing concerns that data was misused or mishandled. That way, we will be able to identify what needs to be done to strengthen standards to protect privacy and restore the public trust.</p><p> Q: What's at stake?</p><p> A: As a matter of public policy, personal data involves legal questions about who should be able to control information about an individual. From an economic standpoint, the technology sector drives prosperity from Wall Street to Main Street. Big Tech wields growing influence in the global economy. Investors, workers and pensioners are stakeholders. On the other side of the road, we have hundreds of millions of consumers who have every right to be concerned about the business practices that impact their personal information. In addition to congressional inquiries, a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys general is seeking answers. What's more, the Federal Trade Commission is looking into Facebook's policies and practices. If the tech giants allowed, facilitated and profited from the harvesting of personal data at the expense of consumer privacy, we need a conversation to educate and empower consumers, improve rules of the road and step up enforcement. Consumers have a right to fundamental privacy protection. I'm working to get the facts out on the table so we can make informed decisions. Throughout my years of legislative and oversight work, I've always applied the Hippocratic Oath to policymaking: First, do no harm. Whenever an individual downloads an app, uses a search engine, shares content with followers, clicks news articles, shops, or answers online surveys, the user is creating a digital footprint, unique to that individual. That trove of information should not be Silicon Valley's treasure to exploit for profit, especially without providing transparency about practices and policies. Consumers ought to have clear information, not reams of gobbledygook, about policies and practices affecting the flow of their personal data. Navigating the digital age raises complex policy issues and society will benefit from public debate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-e148f3927f1fac999cd97a6909630a846d5fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BCF1D66FF5D NWBKIA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S11-N8F1-JBCN-4275-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Boone News Republican, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a Boone News Republican<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And, in a world plagued by unrest and rising political tensions, the benefits of debating \u2013 which include developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills \u2013 are becoming an increasingly important factor in building progressive societies.</p><p><br/>QatarDebate is working to take the art of debate to the world. From organising the first European Arabic Debating Championship in Vienna, Austria, and establishing the inaugural US Universities Arabic Debating Championship at Harvard University, to sponsoring a debate on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Qatar Foundation (QF) member is providing the necessary building blocks to help shape globally responsible citizens.<br/>The event in Davos last week was held in collaboration with The New York Times, and saw six speakers discuss the motion \"Big tech cannot be trusted to self-regulate\". At the end of the discussion, audience members voted on the arguments, with the overwhelming majority believing that corporations cannot be trusted to regulate themselves.<br/>Helen E Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, who attended the debate as a judge, spoke about the relevance of the topic, saying: \"I think it's been an incredibly important debate, because online platforms have an incredible control over our life. I am really impressed that Qatar Foundation has supported this debate in the interests of us hearing what all the arguments are, and I personally got some new insights into how to tackle the issue.\" <br/>Dr Mahmoud Y Barraj, Outreach Program Specialist at QatarDebate and a jury member, highlighted how QatarDebate aims to bring key issues to the forefront of the nation and find solutions to global problems through the power of debate. \"The motions are chosen by an internal committee whereby in most cases the RFR technique is applied: Recency, Frequency, and Relevancy,\" he explains. <br/>Recency refers to how much time has lapsed since the topic began being discussed, while frequency looks at how often the topic has surfaced on different platforms, whether there is a sense of urgency to it, and how many people are talking about it. Finally, relevancy refers to how pertinent it is to our present and future.<br/>\"The motions are also treated in horizontal and vertical conducts,\" said Dr Barraj. \"Horizontal refers to different topics \u2013 for example, economic, social or political \u2013 while vertical means the level of fluency, such as whether the motion is for professionals, university students or schoolchildren.\"<br/>Abdulrahman I al Subaie, head of Outreach Programme, QatarDebate, said, \"This year's event at Davos was a landmark event. The World Economic Forum is committed to improving the state of the world, and not only was it the 50th Annual Meeting, but the subject matter itself \u2013 big tech and regulations \u2013 is extremely topical at the moment, and showcases the type of issues QatarDebate aims to address. <br/>\"Indeed, what QatarDebate and Qatar Foundation did at Davos complements what we do locally in Qatar and internationally, so, in reality, one of the things that excited us most about the event is that it truly represented what we are hoping to do in 2020 and beyond.\" <br/>Dedicated to spreading the art of debate, QatarDebate is currently in Kuala Lumpur organising the Asian Arabic Debating Championship, where \u2013 over the course of five days \u2013 around 30 university teams from across Asia will compete for the prestigious title.From Harvard to Davos, Qatar Foundation member QatarDebate champions the power of dialogue and reasoned argument</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/61/158033531690.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/61/158033531690.jpeg</url></p><p>QF promotes art of debating across the world<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QATART-165840453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QATART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3D-HXS1-JDJN-64RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357157</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Qatar Tribune.

That would make it the last U.S. technology firm to get a large antitrust penalty from Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</p><p>Vestager is due to step down later this year after punishing Google with more than $9 billion in fines and ordering Apple to pay more than 14 billion euros in back taxes. She warned in May she was 'definitely not done yet' with big tech as she weighs potential new probes into Amazon.com Inc., Google and Apple.</p><p>The EU's current Qualcomm investigation targets 3G chips for internet mobile dongles sold between 2009 and 2011. Regulators allege these were sold below cost in order to push Icera, now owned by Nvidia Corp., out of the market. The EU took the unusual move of sending an extra antitrust complaint to Qualcomm last year to bolster its arguments of a 'price-cost' test it used to show far below cost the prices were.</p><p>Qualcomm and the European Commission declined to comment on the fine. The timing of the penalty could slip beyond the EU's August summer break, one of the people said.</p><p>Last year Qualcomm was handed the EU's fifth-largest antitrust penalty over payments to Apple that the EU said were an illegal ploy to ensure only its chips were used in iPhones and iPads. Qualcomm is challenging the fine at the EU courts.</p><p>Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, is unique among semiconductor makers in that it gets most of its profit from licensing patents. Makers of handsets pay the company royalties, whether or not they use its chips. That lucrative profit pool has come under attack as governments around the world scrutinized Qualcomm's business practices.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

The ruling, made by US District Judge Lucy Koh, would require Qualcomm to make significant changes to its chip business. Antitrust pressure on the tech industry has risen in recent months as the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission reached an agreement over jurisdiction. </p><p>Watch Qualcomm trade live.[2]Qualcomm's push to delay a landmark antitrust ruling has been opposed by LG Electronics and the Federal Trade Commission, sending shares sliding by 1.84% early Wednesday. Qualcomm requested that a ruling made on May 21, which would make it license its patents to rival chipmakers rather than phone manufacturers, by US District Judge Lucy Koh be delayed while it files for an appeal. Qualcomm's agreement with LG expires on June 30. LG Electronics opposed the request, saying it may allow Qualcomm to pressure it into another unfair deal. The Federal Trade Commission also came out against a delay, arguing it was in the public interest to uphold the decision as an appeal could last years. Qualcomm said that in order to comply with Koh's decision the company would have to make changes that might be irreversible if an appeal is successful. Tuesday evening's decision comes as the federal government has begun to divy up other major tech companies for antitrust oversight. In early June, The Washington Post[3] reported that Amazon will fall under the FTC's jurisdiction, while the Department of Justice will have oversight of Google. During a speech in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Tuesday,[4] Makan Delrahim, a top DOJ official, said the department has the means to enforce current antitrust laws on companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. \"We already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies,\" Delrahim said[5]. \"US antitrust law is flexible enough to be applied to markets old and new.\" Qualcomm is up 26.63% this year. <url

$130 bn Broadcom bid for big tech tie-up</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:dateline><location>Washington, Nov 13</location> 2017</nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Qualcomm on Monday rejected a $130 billion bid from fellow computer chip maker Broadcom, setting the stage for a potentially bitter fight for control of a key player in the world of mobile technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposal \"significantly undervalues Qualcomm relative to the company's leadership position in mobile technology and our future growth prospects,\" Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm's executive chairman, said in a statement following last week's offer which would be the largest ever in the technology sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore-based Broadcom made the offer to consolidate two major players in the booming sector fueled by growth in smartphones and other connected devices.</p><p>Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm's chief executive, said in the statement the California company remains confident about its future on its own.</p><p>\"No company is better positioned in mobile, IoT (internet of things), automotive, edge computing and networking within the semiconductor industry,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are confident in our ability to create significant additional value for our stockholders as we continue our growth in these attractive segments and lead the transition to 5G,\" he said, referring to the fifth generation wireless networks in the works.</p><p>Broadcom responded to the announcement by saying it \"remains fully committed\" to the planned tie-up.</p><p>- 'Engage cooperatively' -</p><p>Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the deal would create \"a strong, global company with an impressive portfolio of industry-leading technologies and products.\"</p><p>Tan noted that \"we have received positive feedback from key customers about this combination\" and added that \"we continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders.\"</p><p>While Tan did not specifically address whether Broadcom would make a hostile bid, he said, \"It remains our strong preference to engage cooperatively with Qualcomm's board of directors and management team.\"</p><p>Broadcom could sweeten its bid in an effort to win over management or launch a hostile takeover effort to persuade shareholders to sell or install new board or management members.</p><p>Michael Walkley, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, said he believes the Broadcom bid and Qualcomm rejection both suggest the US firm is undervalued.</p><p>\"We do believe the combination of the two companies could generate strong synergies, creating a dominant wireless business and overall powerful global semiconductor leader,\" Walkley said in a research note.</p><p>\"Therefore, we believe Broadcom is likely to increase its bid.\"</p><p>Any merger deal would need to pass muster with Qualcomm shareholders and could face regulatory scrutiny in the United States and other markets.</p><p>Qualcomm has been facing a series of antitrust investigations around the world linked to its dominance in the smartphone chip segment and is in litigation with Apple in a dispute over patents and royalties.</p><p>Broadcom's proposal followed Tan's visit to the White House this month, where he met President Donald Trump and announced plans to move the tech company back to the United States from Singapore.</p><p>It comes as Qualcomm seeks a $47 billion acquisition of Dutch rival NXP, a deal that is the subject of a European Union anti-trust probe.</p><p>A merger with Broadcom would create a behemoth with about $51 billion in revenues, including those from NXP.</p><p>Broadcom, meanwhile, is seeking to buy US rival Brocade Communications in a deal being reviewed by Washington. </p><p>Broadcom and Qualcomm are both major makers of semiconductors used in the latest tech gadgetry.</p><p>The US firm is the leader in processors for smartphones and is expanding into new sectors, while Broadcom makes an array of chips for wireless communications, set-top boxes and electronic displays.</p><p>bur-rl/it</p><p>BROADCOM</p><p>QUALCOMM</p><p>NXP SEMICONDUCTORS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

As Amazon s share price soared to its all-time high ahead of its second-quarter results, its founder and chief executive   who owns 17 per cent of the company   saw his personal wealth overtake that of Microsoft s (MSFT) top dog Bill Gates. But by the time Mr Bezos had finished informing shareholders of another period of investment, which he thinks will slow profit growth, the share price of the e-commerce-cum-tech giant had fallen back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon wasn t the only US juggernaut to suffer a share price fall in the wake of second-quarter results. Google s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) reported its worst year-on-year profit fall since the financial crisis, after it was hit by a  2.42bn fine from the European Commission last month.</p><p>In contrast, Facebook (FB) is flying. Concerns that advertising income might be hampered by competition from fellow social networker Snap (SNAP) were quashed, after the group reported a 47 per cent year-on-year increase in advertising revenue. Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX)is hauling in customers. The demand for original content, entire box sets and Adam Sandler films sent membership numbers further past the 100m mark during the period. Although a period of Amazon-esque investment constrained profit growth, investors didn t seem too bothered and the shares rose 8 per cent on the day of the results.</p><p>A 50:50 split in the share price fortunes of the FANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflixand Google) following second-quarter results isn t bad considering their stretched valuations. The US giants have been expensive for a while, recently pulling the value of the S&amp;P 500 technology index through its dot.com bubble highs. According to data from Yale University s Robert Shiller, the index is trading on a cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) of 30   the highest it has been since 2001.</p><p>These kind of statistics are making analysts jittery, but today s tech behemoths are very different beasts from those companies that went pop at the turn of the millennium. Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are more quality than growth stocks, rated positively on measures such as free-cash-flow margin and return on equity. Netflixscores well on these metrics, too, although with its robust sales expansion, quants at Societe Generale Cross Asset Research still consider it primarily to be a growth stock.</p><p>Last year's rotation into value investing has reversed and, while expensive, the tendency of the big tech companies to combine quality with growth characteristics could underpin high valuations a while longer. As the SG team highlight, growth stocks often do well in late-cycle economic regimes. In their research, quality growth stocks   such as the FANGs   with above average long-term earnings and sales growth, are attractively defensive.</p><p>That s not to say these companies are without fault   there are many challenges that may yet be the undoing of their lofty valuations.</p><p>Microsoft is also having to invest more in its tech development and it was the group s cloud computing division that propped up recent half-year numbers. At Apple (AAPL) it is becoming harder to get customers excited about the latest version of the iPhone. Business in China is still struggling and group operating margins fell to 24 per cent during the three months to June, its lowest in eight years. That said, acceleration in the app and cloud computing business ensured another period of revenue and profit growth.</p><p>Google has already faced the wrath of one regulator due to the dominance of its search engine, and both its Android mobile brand and advertising platform are also undergoing further European competition investigations. In the US, News Corp and other newspaper owners are lobbying the government for regulatory change in the advertising market and   judging by his tweets on the subject   President Donald Trump is listening.</p><p>Facebook, like Google, has benefited from demand for digital advertising, but management has warned for some time that its rate of growth would slow as it closes in on the peak number of advertisements it could show in its main app s news feed. And then there is the heady spending at Amazon and Netflix, which may yet spook cost-conscious investors. Both sites boast enormous customer numbers but they remain two of the least profitable companies in the big US tech sector.</p><p>Despite the challenges and huge expectations, none of the US tech giants has disappointed this second quarter results season. With their market leading positions   described by some as global dominance   and the growth rates of a start-up, these companies deserve their lofty valuations and we see no reason for investors to jump ship.</p><p>Buy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P68-F4Y1-DYX2-S02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><issn>0261-3115</issn><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 3, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

He'll be followed by Laurie MacCarthy, our new EVP Worldwide Field Operations, newly promoted, I should say, not new to the company. He's going to talk about the scalable sales model. She'll be followed by myself who will talk about our scalable business model. And then Sumedh's going to come up and moderate a customer panel who will talk about security in the age of the digital transformation.</p><p>So just a reminder, if people could have their cell phones off, and we'll do Q&amp;A at the very end. And welcome, Sumedh. Thank you.</p><p>With that, I would love to turn it over to Philippe.</p><p>PHILIPPE F. COURTOT, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, QUALYS, INC.: Okay. Here we are. So thank you very much for coming. And in fact, the -- on the panel after that will be also for you the opportunity to really ask questions to the panelists so you could get the direct feedback. And for those who are attending -- did I lose now -- or did you just reduce the volume, okay? So for those who are attending the conference, also, this is the opportunity for you to directly speak with customers and get their feedback. I mean as you probably -- as you all know, we're a pretty transparent company. And I think that's, we believe, the way it should be.</p><p>So with that, if somebody gives me a clicker, here it is. So I'm going to start to give you the presentation that I gave this morning. I'm going to make it a little bit shorter. And I don't know why this thing is not bigger here. Okay, very good. Thank you. And are we in the -- we're now in projection mode. Here we are, perfectly.</p><p>So we had this morning, Dick Clarke, which gave us very interesting -- how many of you could attend Dick Clarke -- okay, about half of the audience. So it was interesting because as you all know, Dick Clarke was essentially the first cybersecurity czar. And what he did was to really highlight the sinister side of the Internet fundamentally, where Internet, as you know, went through that first period of everything was fantastic and happy, like hippy, and we could communicate freely across the world. And then, of course, things started to change, obviously. And that's what he alerted that there's really bad actors and nation states bad actors as well.</p><p>And so [he rolled a book] and recently addressing how sophisticated everything is coming. And there's absolutely necessity that we all have now today that security of that new environment, which you could call the cloud of the Internet, whatever you want to call it, is becoming front and center. And it affects almost everybody.</p><p>And so -- and then he presented a kind of positive view of, at the end, thinking that today with all the new technology that bad guys are, of course, using that this is also the opportunity for us to essentially rethink security in many ways and essentially start to -- and this is more what I've always believed that we could now -- we're in a position of now building security into the new fabric, and that's a very major change.</p><p>And so with that, if I go back to 2012, this is something that I've already said -- and boy, you've got that lights that come right in your eyes. So anyway, so I'm going to try to move away from it, but I don't want to be behind the podium. Anyway, and then this is not turning to the right direction. We'll dance around. So fundamentally, I gave that speech in 2012, which I have to say was not really that well received. And because I was essentially saying that trying to continue securing the current networking environment that we had was essentially becoming almost very difficult, if not impossible. And of course, at the time, there is a lot of resistance from the security and the IT people to the cloud. And that's what it was, not very well received.</p><p>So the point I was making then as well was if you look back at the evolution of computing, essentially, mainframe computing came, as we very well know, from the vacuum tubes to the day when finally IBM gave up in a way and invested $1 billion in Linux so they could essentially encapsulate their old mainframe world and then emerge as a middleware and a service company.</p><p>And then during that time, because of the technology of semiconductors has improved, now you have the minicomputer era, which came in. And then the client server came in. And major change in the way computing was delivered, and we'll discuss about that later. And now today, we're absolutely in -- now we can say today that the cloud is taking over. There's absolutely no question about that.</p><p>So if we again look back about cloud computing, we know today that we're just at the beginning of even more changes. 5G is coming. And what about quantum computing? What about the ability to have genetic storage and so forth? And when is that going to come? And there's many other things that we have not even thinking of. The acceleration, if you go back to the industrial revolution, this new technology wave like the electricity -- I don't know why -- why are we picking in and out of the -- my mic is moving. Okay. So when we were essentially at the beginning of the industrial revolution, you have the steam engine, the electricity, a lot of things converging, which has actually significantly enhanced and changed the human condition.</p><p>Now today, we're on the verge of a significant, thanks to the Internet, which is becoming absolutely -- connecting billions of people who now have the ability to change information, to learn, to improve the human conditions. And that's where we see all this acceleration of technologies in so many different ways. So we are just at that beginning, really. And now the Internet is really taking over, or if you prefer, cloud computing.</p><p>So it brings a lot of changes with it, obviously. And of course, those who adapt to the change and adjust and/or drive the change are going to need to thrive. Conversely, those who don't are left behind. And that's -- these are the law of evolution. Nobody can change that.</p><p>So if I go back to the computing. When you look at the mainframe, the mainframe were distributing the computing power to the large companies who could afford it. And there were big data centers protected by walls which are very difficult to enter. The communication to the outside world was pretty simple, private phone lines with [adapter]. And who was securing that? The IBMs of this world, this control data. And so that's why it was a relatively easy environment. That's what they were doing. The minicomputer, which was similar, was the same.</p><p>Now when client server came in, this is where everything changed. So the client server now is distributing the computing, so the minicomputer to the labs and to the departments. So this was the era of the DEC, the Primes and the (inaudible), which, by the way, disappeared pretty quickly because they could not, and we'll talk about that later, adjust essentially to the new client server world.</p><p>So now certainly, that coming power was delivered to all the people in the enterprise. And nobody paid much attention to security because you were inside of the walls of the enterprise. And also, it was a little bit more complex because you didn't have any more one vendor. You had the people manufacturing the servers, the operating systems, the database, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>And what was that architecture? The architecture was actually servers, the LAN, and of course, the PC. And so securing all that was an afterthought. No need to do that. And absolutely, of course, through the floppy disk, which I'm sure some of you may remember, not all of you. Suddenly, viruses came in, and that became essentially the first, oh, what about security? How could we do that? And this is where McAfee started and other companies.</p><p>And then the need to communicate more and more became very important. And then suddenly, you had to open up the walls of that house that we had. And that was the era of the firewall and on and on.</p><p>And then the more we were opening up -- the more doors and windows we were opening, and the bad guys, of course, took advantage of all of that and especially that now that you are connected on the Internet, you are not disconnected anymore. So now you could -- you're not into this air gap networks anymore, so they could use the Internet to go back into your homes.</p><p>And then we saw absolutely that era where more -- because security has so many different facets, then we had to bolt security on and on and on, and that's why I made in 2012 that comments that guys, we cannot continue bolting our security and through all of these things. So today, we have to adopt cloud-based architecture even for security because you have to secure that world.</p><p>And what is, again, the component of the cloud? It's not some magical computing power some place in the heavens. It's essentially massive data centers with infinite computing power, infinite storage capabilities which are all now much easier to patch, by the way, much easier to secure. And of course, the access can be better controlled.</p><p>And then you have the Internet as the means of communication. And the Internet needs to be secure. And today, we're not yet at the level where we should be. And I essentially applaud the efforts of Google, which started first by essentially saying, guys, we need to have a set of communication and make it ubiquitous everywhere and have succeeded in doing that. I created the Trustworthy Internet Movement to try to really push that. But of course, Qualys was too small and it was not really our place.</p><p>But now today, Google has embarked into a new initiative, which some people start to criticize, of course. We absolutely applaud that because they say, guys, we need to change the Internet protocols, which were never designed for security. How could we today spoof website? How could we spoof e-mails? And what about the security of DNS and on and on? And that, I believe, is the work to be done. And I absolutely encourage them to really move full speed ahead behind Google. That's the domain of the Facebook, the Google, the Amazon, the Microsoft, the Azure because they are leveraging that Internet. So at the end of the day, it's in their own interest to make sure that the Internet itself becomes significantly more secure.</p><p>And then on the other hand, what do you have, is now a significant different type of tablets, of phones, of devices that connects and, of course, which need to be secure with multiple actors as well again. So now there's still that same problem that you have multiple actors, which will have to work together to try to put all these pieces together from a security standpoint so we can finally build the security in.</p><p>Now what happened, of course, with client servers -- I discussed the complexity of security became absolutely crazy. And when you look today at that and you know all of that, then the amount of security compliance companies out there, it absolutely doesn't make any sense anymore.</p><p>And on the top of that, we still are being breached big time. Why? Because these different security solutions, they don't work well -- they don't work together. They were never designed to work together. And so -- but you need to have the information that each of them have. So how do you do that today?</p><p>Okay. So you put a SIM, another solution on the top of that. And you try to make all that information coming into that SIM. But that SIM doesn't know how to correlate that information. Because how do you know that the information which has popped up from that way, that device and another information popped up on that same device by another application is essentially the same device? You don't even know. So that's why the SIMs have not only significant cost that they add because of all that complexity of taking the data, manipulating the data, et cetera, the number of false positive or false alerts, if you prefer, is absolutely significant. And the problem when you have false alerts is that you cannot automate. Because if suddenly, you're not going to eliminate something which is false, what are you going to do?</p><p>And so this is why today, we need to totally rethink security. And that's where the digital transformation is coming in and the usage of this cloud-based technology. So fundamentally, the world is changing, and it's changing finally very fast.</p><p>I thought it would have happened 10 years ago. And -- but now I can tell you, it's happening now. So -- which, of course, is very good for Qualys because we have been cloud-based since 1999 and leveraging first the nascent technology, which was the Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, which is not really that great, but that was the beginning. And then suddenly, today, there's a plethora of new technology, Kafka, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, which are all coming, by the way, from the cloud vendors themselves -- from the private cloud vendors, which needed to develop this technology for themselves so they could scale. And what they did very shortly is to put that in open source because they realize that they could not develop all of these technologies themselves. So in fact, they were sharing between themselves this technology via the open source, which they greatly simplified because the early days of the open source movement, which I'm bold enough to have been part of it, where the (inaudible), where you have these kind of purest people where everything had to be pure and so forth for the great of human kind and so forth, so they were so complicated to put your hands on that open source. But now today, they simplified all of that to the point that we, Qualys, have benefited significantly from that.</p><p>If you listen to the presentation of Sumedh, after that, you will see we're using today about 140 open source engine where absolutely we're indexing 3 trillion data points on our ElasticSearch clusters and on and on. And without this technology, we could not essentially have built the platform today that we have built. And we have been working on that since quite a long time.</p><p>So the digital transformation now affects everything or the cloud, if you prefer, cloud transformation. And essentially, I'm going to discuss about it affects the market itself as you -- as we'll see. It affects, of course, the current security vendors. And it affects also the security professional and the company. And the key is, how could we fundamentally take advantage of all of that and embrace this new solution because those who will embrace them are going to be the one that succeeds.</p><p>So with that, today -- that I mentioned that in one of our earnings calls that we see another thing is today, clearly, the market used to be the enterprise market, the consumer with the antivirus. Today, we see 4 different markets shaping up. One is a market of the large enterprises, which, of course, has a huge channel today to retool everything, fundamentally. So they could accelerate, if you prefer, their business, their flexibility. We see today what the banks are doing. Now today, they are -- the silos are crumbling, as I can give you many examples of that. You see today that if you go in India and you want to create a bank account, you just pick up your phone and you just authenticate yourself via the Indian government ID system, and then you take a selfie and then you create the phone -- your bank account. That simple. All of that because of the underlying -- the infrastructure, which is behind, which allows to do that automatically and, of course, via the Internet or via 5G or whatever.</p><p>So today, the challenge of these companies today, all of them, the large ones, they have to do that themselves. Because you cannot go to another outsourcer and say, \"Okay, do everything for me.\" Their business is so core, so they have the knowledge of their business. So they need to decide what am I going to retool myself, what I'm going to put into the cloud, into these private clouds and have then rebuild, if you prefer, their underlining computing infrastructure.</p><p>So of course, from a security standpoint, it means, okay, I cannot continue with that plethora of operations, 9 agent on average on my endpoints doesn't make any sense. So consolidating the stack is really the new game.</p><p>And then from there, okay, now I need to retool. And now, of course, is that new era. Now we see DevOps rising in these companies and which are the ones retooling almost everything.</p><p>And of course, security has to be built in because, today, if you want to respond in real time, as you must do, you need to be really capable of also having good data; and second, being able to really respond as solidly and as automatically as you could. And so that's totally a new game.</p><p>And then there is the cloud security vendor themselves, which today are building security into their platform. And we're very, very proud of having worked with Microsoft, and there's a presentation this afternoon of Microsoft about building security into Azure. So we made an announcement about a couple of weeks ago, I don't know -- about a few days ago or 2 weeks ago that now our cloud agents are built into Azure.</p><p>So now security in this new environment has totally changed. You go to the Azure Security Center, you click on the link. And automatically, you have the view of all your resources on Azure, thanks to the Qualys agent, which is embedded there. You click on the second link, and you essentially now have the security and compliance posture of all of those assets. And you click on the third link, which has nothing to do with Qualys this time, which is the ability to remediate what is called your playbook. And then you have your playbook and then you push on the button and you remediate. So security in that new -- in this new cloud environment has become a click, click, click, nothing to install, nothing to update. The only thing you do is that you bring your policy.</p><p>And the agreement we made with Microsoft is that Microsoft is offering that for free to the customers. And of course, behind that, there's a significant opportunity because there's so much more solutions that Qualys can bring to the table, some that Microsoft probably at some point in time will also bundle and some others.</p><p>So the world has now changed. So these vendors, of course, they have to make the decision versus -- build versus buy. So -- and they will build some things. Today, you go to Amazon, and they have built their firewalls, essentially. And the world is also changing. We're moving into now you have serviceless environment. The technology is changing so fast, it's absolutely incredible.</p><p>And then all of these other companies on the planet, which don't have the resources of the big guy, they still have to do their digital transformation. They don't have the technical people, and I think they're going to be relying on the new generation of MSSPs as security is concerned or MSPs. And again, these are people which are going to embrace this cloud technology and preferably not building that themselves. So they already look at companies like Qualys and say, by the way, can you give me all of that and then use these platforms to essentially now use that instead of them building it like they've been currently doing, now suddenly bringing their expertise and the human added value to essentially help those other companies.</p><p>And finally, there's a totally emerging market. And if you were there this morning, you will have seen on Sumedh's presentation that we're moving as well into this OT and IoT world, of course, because of the architecture that we have.</p><p>And that's a totally different market again. You have to secure all these devices. And then again, you have to build security in. There's no way you can bring your box on these devices. And you need to have the automation. So when you look at this architecture, the example that I give to almost everybody now is the home, today, the way we secure our homes while exactly leveraging these cloud technologies. We put sensors in our home everywhere to detect not only just the break-ins but also to detect -- to look at the temperature, change the temperature, if this is what we want to do totally remotely across the Internet. We can always see if somebody knocks on our door from our phone and then we can open the door or close the door. All of that is absolutely automated essentially.</p><p>And then you still have the problem that I alluded earlier of these false alerts. The last thing you want to do is to have false alert because if there's an incident, if there's a fire or there's a burglar, automatically, this incident result system, which are in the cloud some place that alert the cops and the fire marshal. So you don't want to have false alerts.</p><p>And you have the thing, which has been solved today, which is a very good example of our newest instrument, talking about our new, next-generation of SIM as we call it that we're building. The goal of what we are doing today is not only having scale, so we can really manage millions and if not billions of devices, hundreds of millions of devices, but also being capable of responding as much or rapidly as possible. That response is very key.</p><p>So today, if you leave your dog in your homes, then the dog is going to move, it's going to bark, et cetera, an intruder alert, so suddenly, you will have the cops rushing in, which obviously is not very good. So what do they do today? And this is existing because they have cameras. And of course, they can hear and analyze the voice as well. So they will analyze if it's the voice of your dog and they will analyze if you take the fingerprint of your dog and then they eliminate the false alerts. So you can now leave your dog, which has another advantage in terms of security because if somebody wants to come into your house, they're going to bark, which is another level of security that you have built in by leaving your dog, if you prefer.</p><p>So the world is changing big time, as you can see. And the other message I would like to leave you with. Today, a lot of that security has been built around the fact that the network has been increasing and increasing and becoming almost like a cancer growing. And there, of course, you have now to put more firewalls and more of these and more of that. And that was because this Internet technology were not mature enough. But today, they are there. Yes, as I mentioned earlier, we are using 140 open source engines today back end. And of course, without that, it will have taken significantly longer. So there's been a lag for this technology to come and mature, but they're all there.</p><p>So what we're going to see, and I can see it already happening, the network is shrinking to be replaced by the Internet, which, by the way, doesn't cost you a penny, essentially, very little. So that is another major change. So what it does, if you're now a vendor not only you are faced with the problem of rearchitecting and move like the minicomputers, they could not really re-architect the solution. I remember Ken Olsen, and I think you remember as well that it was attached to his minicomputers, and that client server was (inaudible) for life was not good enough. The reality, they could not rearchitect, was far too complicated. And so that's the challenge #1.</p><p>Challenge #2 is the distribution channel challenge. The channel of IBM were not the channel of DEC. The channel of DEC were not the channels of Novell. The channels of Novell were not the channels of Microsoft, et cetera. Why? Because suddenly, that computing power, the cost is going down. So you're not selling multimillion-dollar solution with a lot of professional services. You end up buying -- selling something, which is a much lower value and much less services. So the channels that are dying are the first one who takes it on the chin and have to adapt. And the cloud brings absolutely a disruption, which is absolutely phenomenal. Because the channel is the distribution -- the cloud, sorry, is the distribution channel. You don't need -- these are managed with sales guys and these technical people, et cetera, to bring this solution to your customers. And that's what we have done today by launching our free Global IT Asset Inventory, which is absolutely, from a technical standpoint, something absolutely incredible what we have done, where we can automatically help companies of any size, very small or very large, to create their own Global IT Asset Inventory across on-premise, endpoint, cloud, containers, web applications, et cetera. The complete view, totally automated view. Totally free of charge.</p><p>Why can we do that? Because try -- just try and I don't know if Sumedh will have the presentation. Do you have that presentation of how we enable our Global IT Asset Inventory or not? Anyway, this -- he gave the presentation this morning, which is totally straightforward. It's very easy to do. And why? It's because, again, we're using this cloud technology. And the cloud is the distribution channel, major change.</p><p>And then on the top of that, to make our life even more complex, the buyer is changing. The buyer is not anymore the CIO, is not anymore even the CISO. Its becoming DevOps. And these are engineers. And that's a totally different game changer. Again, these engineers are the one driving the digital transformation of their enterprise. They are the new buyers. And these guys are engineers. And so if you have something for them, say, \"Okay, show me your code.\" Okay. If they like it and say, \"Okay, great. By the way, don't tell me, give me the code. I'm big enough. I'm going to evaluate it. So please leave me alone.\"</p><p>Second, if they call you back because if they don't like it, they don't even call you back. They call you back and say, \"Oh, I like your code, but I would like you to do this and this. Can you do that?\" Okay. If you said, yes, they come, they discuss. And then they will call you back and say, \"Now, I'm very much interested in the road map.\" But by the way, it's not the road map of the vendor anymore. It's their road map. So they are the ones driving the show. And that's something that Qualys understood that very early on. And everything we've been doing have been always driven by customers. They are more intelligent than we are. And that's another very big change in that industry. It's not any more the [people] of computing or security bringing their knowledge to the masses. I mean the masses, they know better. And these DevOps people, of course, they are engineers at heart.</p><p>And as you very well know, now they are faced with another bigger challenge as well, which is the business model change. Why does the Wall Street now want to see companies having a subscription-based model? It's because that's what the customers want. They are part of the shelf wear. That 4 years, 6 years down the road, they are going to rip off everything, put the new software and, of course, a lot of shelf wear. So we have entered into essentially a consumption-based model, which is the way the customers want to essentially procure technology. So that's for them.</p><p>So of course, what about the security professionals in that industry? So we have to adapt, not only the vendors, but also all the security professionals. And so that adaptation, in fact, requires that we don't think anymore in terms of silos, where you've got the security people doing this, the IT people doing that, the compliance people. It has to be a team now, and it's almost a cultural revolution in the company that needs to take place. And we see that already happening. We see that today, and I will give you one example in a minute, whereby it's a mindset change. Companies have to adopt the notion of that -- of security has to be built in, fundamentally, that this is a Board-level issue. We have to secure the data of our customers. We have to secure their privacy. We have to do all these things; if not, we're not going to be in business for very long. And we need to use all this new technology to become more agile and have better connections with our customers.</p><p>So today, it's a teamwork effort. And as I mentioned earlier, security now is at the Board level, front and center. Why? Because of 2 things. One is GDPR, all this regulation, which are now coming at you big time. And the second one is all data breaches. The last thing you want to do is to have these massive data breaches and then the lawyers coming at you and the regulators coming at you. That's [why it is not] possible.</p><p>So this is where we are today. And I will give you one example, which I can share with you because, Societe Generale, which is a Qualys customers, and I would tell you the story behind it, I think it's important, just published on LinkedIn a fantastic video. Well, the notion of let's all work together to essentially secure the data of our customers, make all that experience better. And you see this entire group of Societe Generale, the silos are breaking and now they are working together. And they created a little video on LinkedIn, and I put some of the pictures here. I cannot show you the video because it's all in French, so sorry for that. But I will tell you the story of Societe Generale, and you can see the way it [finished] the future is you, you, the customer. That's fundamentally -- they are totally customer-centric now. It's not anymore I'm the bank, I'm going to give you the loans, et cetera. No. That's why I gave you that example in India where the banks are -- absolutely, everything becomes digitalized.</p><p>Now in 2016, something happened, and it's GDPR. The regulators in Europe find that absolutely -- that to absolutely put their foot down, and they created GDPR, which if you cannot prove to the regulator, as most of you know now, that you have done everything you could do and you should do to secure both the privacy and the security of the data of your customers, you could be fined up to 4% of your global worldwide revenues. Needless to say, that went up to the Board pretty quickly.</p><p>So we received a phone call from Societe Generale, I received a phone call in 2016. And they told me, we like you to come and to visit us and please with your Chief Security Architect.</p><p>Then at the time, they didn't want to tell us why because they say it's confidential what we are going to discuss. Now today, it's totally public, so I can say it. And so Sumedh and I, we went to France, to Paris and we met with the top management of Societe Generale. And they explained to us, look, thank you very much for coming because we have now -- the reason why I wanted the Chief -- your Chief Architect coming is because we have now the team today, which is doing the digital transformation of our enterprise, which is ready to meet with you because we like to make sure that what we are doing into rebuilding our system or rearchitecting our system fits what you guys are also doing. So we can work together and learn together. And that's why it's very important.</p><p>So then I ask them a very simple question to the top management of Societe Generale, I said, \"What is driving you of doing that? And why is that confidential at this time?\" They said, \"Look, because we have decided essentially, and this is why it's confidential, to accelerate our digital transformation by 3 years.\" And so what was the impetus for that? And they say, \"It's GDPR. Because today, how are we going to prove to the regulator is not by putting, investing more in the current infrastructure that we're going to be able to do that. So it's much wiser to spend the money in trying to accelerate our digital transformation, so we could build security. And that's why we asked you to come.\" And then I remember vividly, I was with Sumedh to -- when we went downstairs in the basement, as I used to say, in fact, it was in the basement. These engineers, oh, my God, they were speaking the same language, Kubernetes, et cetera. At the time, I was not understanding half of that. And Sumedh, discussing with these guys that they were using the same tools, they have the same ideas and it was a little bit different. And that's where the DevOps people. And that's fundamentally a big change, which is happening today. And I can give you more examples of that. We see that happening today in our large customers as well. And of course, everybody now is moving into that.</p><p>So with that in mind, I'm really happy we have announced something which some, by the way, have asked us to do that many years ago, and there's a gentleman in the room here, which told us, \"Why are you not bundling some of these solutions. You have so many solutions today.\" The reason why we didn't do that is because, at the time, because we're working at creating a one single application, which we call today Vulnerability Management, detection and response, which is essentially what that application does is essentially bringing altogether the visibility through our Global IT Assets Inventory; the detection -- the real -- the creation of asset group almost automatically; and then from there, detection in real-time of the vulnerabilities; then we have come up with a new prioritization engine, which Sumedh will talk about, which allows us to prioritize the vulnerabilities with really great precision, which is very important.</p><p>And then from there also, doing the response, which is, in that case, the patch management and then closing the loop. So that's created, of course -- that was a lot of engineering work to put all these pieces together. And until we had the entire solution, I didn't want to do this kind of what I call this fake bundling that you do for marketing reasons. We wanted to really bring a solution that, first of all, our customers could adopt immediately because it's the same solution. And then also, we changed essentially the pricing to make it much easier for our customers to procure and going into an asset-based pricing, as we call it.</p><p>And I've been fortunate enough in my life to essentially bring companies to what I call ubiquity. And I know what ubiquity is all about. If you -- to reach ubiquity, you need to have 3 things that needs to come at the same time. So you have to have the patience to do that, which, as you know, sometimes, this is what Wall Street necessarily has, which is, one, the need must be there. If you don't -- and that's what I did in mammography. So when the need is there, you need to have now the technology to answer that need. But that technology needs to be extremely well packaged. So it could be diffused externally -- distributed extremely easily. And that requires a lot of work. And the packaging is also on pricing. It's also the way you present all of that.</p><p>And then the third thing you need to do, which is what we are now embarking into is if it's not good enough to be good, you need to tell. So if you have waited when all these 3 things can be aligned, then you can simply pick up significant market share, change an industry also at a minimum cost because, of course, you have done all the investment before and the cost of creating awareness is significantly much less than the cost of building these solutions and packaging all of that. So this is essentially where we are today.</p><p>And of course, because we have such a big, big position in vulnerability management, we're essentially creating a new category and elevating the bar significantly for the few competitors that we've got left.</p><p>So as always, I want to really remind us and our customers that everything we've done since the very beginning was driven by our customers. And absolutely without them -- so another one, we invent technology in a vacuum. We really are very close with a lot of customers. I remember vividly, Apple Computer, which was our first large customer for the Internet-facing devices; then Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, a French company, the first one to help us deploy these scanner appliances and then we had many others. And then we have -- DuPont was our first large deployment, and then followed by Daimler. And then we had Amazon helped us scale the agent at a huge volume. And now today, we have Microsoft with whom we have really worked to build security in.</p><p>So we really value our customers. And at the end of the day today, I said to our customers, now this is the time to go and reach the need that your companies have, really be the advocate of deploying the global IT Asset Inventory because this is the cornerstone of any good security. And now you start to have the Qualys platform, and there's more to come with the SIM that we are doing, et cetera, et cetera. But the key today is get the control, have the visibility across your total network. So this is another game changer.</p><p>So with that, I thank you very much. I think now today, Sumedh is going to show you that what I'm saying is just not marketing talk. It's absolute reality. So thank you very much.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR, PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, QUALYS, INC.: Can you guys hear me? Okay. All right. Good. So how many of you were able to see the demo earlier? Okay. Good. So most of you did. So I'm going to do the similar talk that I did this morning, was essentially to set the stage for what Philippe mentioned earlier,is -- if this works. All right. There you go. Is at the end of the day, we talk a lot about visibility and all of these things. But at the end of the day, pretty much what anybody in cybersecurity curious about is how quickly can they respond. And there's a lot of different what we call as time to respond. And there's a lot of different ways that people try to measure their security scores and all of that. But ultimately, how quickly can you respond to every single attack that can potentially happen or any single vulnerability that can pop up is really what defines how successful your security program is. And with digital transformation, that is accelerating today, as you saw from the response from all of the customers that were out there. A significant number of them feel that this is not just something that is somebody doing on the side. It's really accelerating in their organization. And that's a lot of new processes, new buyer, as Philippe mentioned, coming up, new technologies being added into the platform and really giving that opportunity to look at that hybrid infrastructure. Because at the end of the day not everybody -- or nobody essentially can completely move into a single environment right now because you're still going to have cloud and some containers. And then there's still going to be endpoints and things like that. And with that environment becoming so hybrid, when you talk about time to remediation, there are so many different vectors that the customers need to look into to be able to make better decisions on how quickly can they respond, whether it's to a new vulnerability outbreak, whether it's to a malware outbreak or whatever it is. So the security challenges that they face today is that increasing surface area. So being able to look at their devops guys going into many different clouds. And earlier, we used to hear that people would say, oh, I don't know, somebody went and they did something in AWS. And then now they complain that there's another team that didn't like that team. And then they went and did something in Azure as well. And so now the problem is getting more complicated for them because it's not only one cloud. Now you have multiple cloud. And some people are doing it as a strategy. Others are doing that -- we saw Salesforce recently talking about Azure and Google and that multi-cloud strategy, which, of course, means that there's a very different surface area, which is really, the visibility for them to be able to know what they have in that environment is becoming challenging.</p><p>Like how do you -- when there are teams that are going out and creating entire applications and using their credit card to get AWS and run that entire application without ever even coming to you, how would you even have the visibility as a security person, which really goes into what Philippe was talking about is the buyer is changing. It's not necessarily just the security people who are looking at security tools. For the same reason, the developers and the DevOps people are also looking at the security tools, and they are becoming the buyer of these tools as well because they are essentially bypassing for quite a bit the security guys that traditionally have been looking at things mostly after the fact.</p><p>So the silos, they continue to exist in many organizations, though we do see a lot of the cutting-edge organizations coming to us are -- how their DevOps team are the ones who are leading. We had a customer who had their agents -- Qualys agents for vulnerability management, and they called and said, \"Look, we're going through an entire digital transformation. We're using your agents in the cloud. We just want to enable file integrity monitoring and policy compliance and indication of compromise and just do all of that with one agent and then be able to get that visibility and just build that into our DevOps process.\" And they came to us directly from a different channel, bypassing the traditional security team that was only focused on the vulnerability management solution to be able to provide those reports for patching. So that people, process, tool, silos that I talked about today, they really kind of do exist, and that's causing a lot of the ability for them not to have their visibility.</p><p>So in an ideal situation, the best way to be able to reduce that -- the time to remediation is really about having a real-time context, collecting a lot of data, having good, strong analytics and then having the real-time response capabilities and being able to orchestrate all of that with -- in different situations across different data points, across different infrastructure.</p><p>So a lot of organizations today, they are -- they have a lot of siloed solutions, and a lot of security solutions today talk about orchestration in their own area or they talk about orchestration or they talk about the cyber scores or whatever it is. But it's only focused on one aspect, and that really is not helpful for the customers. Because if you just say, okay, just my score based on vulnerability or just my score based on vulnerability or just my score based on malware or just my score based on something else, that's not giving the customers a real feel of what is on their environment and then being able to take the appropriate action. So as I mentioned earlier, today, home security solutions, Philippe talked about that as well are following this model, collecting a lot of data from different sensors, bringing that into their subscription-based services, which is exactly the model that Qualys really has, is being able to collect the data from multiple different sensors, a solid back-end subscription base that provides them that visibility and better ability to correlate between different data points to make a much better decision with an automated ability. That's really -- that's the key is that every customer, they just want to have the best time that they can remediate in. And it's not about how big your team is, how much money you spend, how many tools you have. That's one of the reasons that Philippe mentioned the average tenure of the CISO these days is like 1.5 years or something like that because just coming in and trying to buy tools and showing that that's their empire is not really working if they are not really involved in truly bringing down their time from a response perspective.</p><p>So point solutions today, even the best of the new solutions, so to say, which are focused on container and Lambda and cloud and all of that are really not working well together because they, again, end up being point solutions. So customers are still not able to make a firm decision on saying, can I make a response action here because they still need to go and verify another tool because that tool is seeing something different. And then, again, the cost for them for cybersecurity is increasing quite a bit because the more agents that you have to put, the more consoles that you have to manage, the more things you have to deploy, even if the solutions are more cloud-based solutions, you still have multiple cloud consoles then that you have to log into and manage the security around that. So the integrations that we have been traditionally looked at, they give only specific context, which is not really broader context, so you may be able to triage a little bit better if you get some asset contacts with ServiceNow or something like that. But that doesn't necessarily give you the overall picture of what is going on with that asset. And that just ends up with too many point-to-point solutions that don't bring the full context of that device, everything that's on it, what's going on, who is it talking to, what kind of processes are running on that.</p><p>So that has given, of course, the rise to the SIM, which has been traditionally an IT tool for collecting logs and correlating that to being able to do certain security capabilities, which, of course, is looked at the central place. So instead of doing this point-to-point solutions. You look at the SIM as a way to collect data. And most of it is log data, which is after the fact, time series data and not so much being able to do this real-time, what's going on, what's my vulnerability posture, what kind of activity did I see or I'm actively seeing. Like most of the SIM, for example, won't be able to tell you what active connection does a device have right now because they're only looking at logs that have come in over a few hours ago and correlating that kind of an information.</p><p>So you have the SIM now. It's a little bit better than what it was before, but it's still a bunch of point solutions. Then they have acquired other companies for UEBA, for ML capabilities. So there is a better -- slightly better detection capability, but it is still not something that people have a lot of confidence in, which is why then you have to look at how well can you do a response if you don't have confidence in the detection. And because of that, people are looking at the SOAR solution, which is, I don't necessarily have confidence in the detection, so I need an analyst to go and look at these other consoles to collect more data so that I can maybe make a better decision. And then the SOAR solutions, which is another app they tend to, again, integrate with all other apps, and then they tend to try to automate to a certain extent what the analyst will do manually and just kind of try to reduce that manual effort that has been put in there. And that's one of the reasons why most of these SOAR solutions sort of got absorbed into the SIM vendors because the SIM vendors today cannot do anything if you don't have data coming into them. And if you don't really have a good ability to actually create some sort of an action, so you see some of the SIM solutions, you see Palo Alto also buying a company around SOAR because that ability to orchestrate is very important because that's the only way you can respond fast.</p><p>So at Qualys, we have been focused. We have those 19-plus solutions that we've talked about for a while that we have been building. And a lot of that has been the groundwork, building the framework, a lot of data collection, ability to bring a lot of information to give the context that is required to make better decisions, what an atypical analyst will look at to make that decision. And so the platform has been evolving significantly to unite the ability to have IT, security, compliance teams come together on a single platform. And of course, the growth that we are seeing with customers adopting 4 or more, 5 or more solution really reflects that. Message is resonating quite well. And customers are going and saying, I just want to consolidate these vendors and I want to consolidate the stack and I want to just have one agent. I don't want to have 10 agents doing all kinds of different stuff and more and more as we continue. That has helped us get a good foothold in organizations with those agents. And you've heard about the number of agents that we have out there. So that's kind of what the focus has been so far.</p><p>One of the big things that we've talked about with our own teams and with the teams that are out there is the best way to reduce your TTR or the best TTR you can have is 0, right, which is prevention. Being able to be in that DevOps cycle upfront, which container -- security and cloud vendors and container vendors are really pioneering that is if you can eliminate a lot of the issues upfront, then you have a lot less to deal with later. And so security vendors that can really have a platform that is sort of cloud-based, that can fit into that DevOp CI/CD pipeline is something that -- that's something that the customers really prefer because they can go in, they don't have to install anything. They can just plug in an API, get what they need and move on.</p><p>And with that, as you will see in the session later today, Microsoft has done a really fantastic job, and they really felt like they needed to offer the basic vulnerability management capability or detection capability as part of a built-in service. And of course, Qualys being the best branded solution out there, they partner with us so that customer who is bringing their infrastructure does not have to go through the effort of trying to get another security solution deployed and configured and being able to pull the reports and orchestrate that with something else. It's all built in, directly goes into Azure Security Center. And a lot of that is coming from exactly the same desire and the same direction that we are taking, which is about building the security and collecting the data in one place and being able to take a much better response.</p><p>So what we have focused on, as you saw in the demos, across the board, whether it's vulnerability assessment, configuration assessment, container security, cloud security, we are ensuring that, that platform is widely enabled for DevOps and really fits into the DevOps life cycle, which is important because, as we talked earlier, there's a good number of organizations where at least part of the security, tooling and procurement is going -- is being done by the DevOps team. So the more the platform is enabled for DevOps and that is being used in the DevOps life cycle, that really ensures that we have a good partnership with both sides of the organization, whether it's on the DevOps side or whether it's on the security side of that.</p><p>From a next-generation perspective, as I mentioned, we have done a lot of work so far around being able to build those views, collect that data. And what we have been really focusing on is in 2020 now is the ability for us to -- I'm not sure whether it's like that, but it's supposed to be response, is the ability for Qualys to use all the different sensors that we have created, whether it's SaaS, whether it's cloud sensor, whether it's container or whatever it is and being able to take response actions as well. Because if you want to reduce the time it takes to respond to something, being able to respond is very important. So no matter what vendors will come and say, we have this amazing thing that we are going to give you this risk score and good luck. That doesn't necessarily help the customer because now they have a bunch of data that they cannot really do anything out of the box. They have to then again go to a SIM, which then has to go SOAR, which then has to go to another solution for being able to take a response. So building that response capability in the sensors that are already deployed by the customer and then adding that security analytics and orchestration with all that huge amount of data that we're already collecting is something that we have -- are going to focus on and we already are focusing on for 2020 to be able to then provide customers a solid platform that helps them right from the DevOps side of the house, getting into the run time and the production environments and then being able to tie all of that together.</p><p>The response capabilities are going to be very interesting. As I mentioned, this is not a response of like, okay, we can invoke a patch management, API on an existing patch management solution on the box. This is across the board, covering servers; endpoints; handheld, mobile devices; network-connected devices with a NAC; web applications with web application firewall; cloud configuration; remediation; being able to fix your cloud configuration, S3 buckets, all of that automatically; containers as well, being able to take action on containers. All of that -- being able to have those responses on those sensors is super critical for us and the customers to be able to then see something. And the demo that I showed earlier, when they are using the free Global IT Asset Inventory, if they see a bunch of software or they see something that they don't want to see, they can really quickly take response right there from the console. They don't have to say, okay, I'm using Qualys for asset inventory, but then I have to go to some other tool, plug that information in, and then I can go and -- I'll have to take a response action from there. So the more we enable that, from a response perspective, the wider the capability from a response. Because a lot of time, the response that customers have to take is not just about one thing. It's not about just \"I want to patch.\" They also need to maybe quarantine the machine. Maybe they need to block some ports, maybe they need to uninstall some software or shut down some service or they need to disassociate an IAM role in their cloud environment to be able to take remediation actions.</p><p>So when you take that response capability, marry it with the security analytics capability, where, of course, Qualys is already built in because of the 19 apps, we are collecting so many different data points already. Shown in that other slide is multiple petabytes of information that we are already collecting, some plug-and-play with some other vendors that -- things that we don't do today. And then really leveraging that cloud-based capability to be able to do analytics and be able to identify the known threats and, in the future, also the unknown threats so that we can help customers more and more make better decisions on how quickly they can respond. And the key thing that ties all of this together is the SOAR capability, which is a security orchestration capability, which we are also bringing, again, where just Qualys is built in because the sensors are already there. They know how to deploy a bunch of other tools to try to take some remediation actions. So with those flexible playbooks, which will allow customers to take pretty complex remediation actions as well, will then really have those customers leveraging and a lot more bought into the Qualys ecosystem in general because now they are not just looking at this as a solution that's going to give them some visibility and then they have to go some other places to try to get the analytics and the action taken as well.</p><p>So that's the platform that we have been building and working on building and a few of these things that are already in motion and other things that are currently being worked on, but that's kind of the goal for us in 2020 to be able to provide the capabilities around threat hunting, analytics, correlation, UEBA, et cetera.</p><p>So that's the goal for us is to really make Qualys that platform -- single platform for detection and response and have the orchestration also built in, while we also plug in with some of the other vendors where we don't actually provide some services and capability. And the first thing that we released in that is the MDR capability, which is the cycle of vulnerability management, which includes, first, you have to detect the asset, then detect the vulnerability, then prioritize the threat, then go to response, has been a siloed set of organizational departments as well as tools. And so where asset management is a real challenge, CMDB, some people may use ServiceNow for the CMDB, but they don't have really good tools for discovery. Maybe they use some -- a few other tools for discovery, but then the vulnerability management tools are different, then they may be using Kenna or somebody for prioritization. But then they have to take all the data out from Qualys or Tenable or whoever, and then put it into a third-party solution. Then that solution, after doing certain prioritization, does give you a report and a score and doesn't really do much or has to be integrated with another set of solutions to be able to take some response action. So if you want to not trigger passive deployment job based on the remediation or based on the prioritization, that's again a whole different solution that has to be purchased and deployed.</p><p>So what we are now doing is really bringing all of that together in simplified workflows, new prioritization engine, combining our threat intelligence from our team. We have built machine learning capabilities to be able to look at historic trends on vulnerabilities to have another vector for customers to prioritize their vulnerabilities.</p><p>Accurately pinpoint the patches also, so it's not just good enough to say this is a high vulnerability with a high score. What exact patch do I need on that exact machine to patch it is also super critical because that's, again, what is going to reduce the time to respond. Because otherwise, if they have to go to some other system to try to figure that out, that's really going to take a lot of effort. And so that machine learning capability that we have been -- that we've built recently is just another vector that goes in there. And unlike some of the other vendors who are trying to make that as like the be-all, end-all of everything that you'll ever need to do, it is not really the be-all, end all. It's just another trend or another factor that goes into prioritization of those vulnerabilities.</p><p>And then the key after that, of course, is how do you create an immediate workflow for them to be able to patch and get those things fixed. So it's not about the badges of how low your score is. It's about how quickly can you actually reduce that score. And that's what this new capability of putting those solutions together with this additional context and additional reporting and workflows is going to bring to our customers. And so that really makes that as the fastest platform -- single platform to be able to go from discovering new assets to being able to detect vulnerabilities, prioritize the critical ones and patch them in the entire industry. That's what I believe.</p><p>So being able to provide that is what we got really good feedback from our customers because this is all the pain point they are really going through right now. So as we continue to build the architecture, more sensors, more data collection, now the ability to go back to those sensors, asking them to take action. Platform has been growing quite a bit. We have expanded into Canada with an additional platform, so we can have more customers in the local geographic regions, more private platforms. That's that 19 petabyte of data. So when people say, when is Qualys going to build a data lake, that's already something that we have built to an extent, and we continue to add additional capabilities around our ability to ingest large amounts of data, process it in different ways, store it in different databases. So we can leverage it based on the use case as well.</p><p>And then these are the numbers from -- that I already talked about earlier. From an expansion perspective, we gave a demo earlier about our new capabilities that we are adding early next year around ICS and OT environments, being able to provide Qualys passive scanning and scanning capabilities into the SCADA environment, so which will allow us again to be able to address another segment of our customers' needs, which is around being able to look into these large number of OT devices. There's a lot of customers that have big, huge manufacturing floors and locations that have a large amount of devices that are connected to the network. And this will help us -- help the customers really do a better job at understanding what they have.</p><p>And then the acquisition or the integration of Adya, which we acquired last year is almost complete now, so we will have a beta going out pretty soon, which will allow the customers to go all the way from that robot that they have in their environment in some floor, all the way to their entire cloud-based software or SaaS-based software that they're using in terms of being able to configure -- being able to know that the configurations are correct, the security is correct. So that SaaS security compliance will also be going out early next year as a beta.</p><p>And then as the platform builds and we are adding more and more capability, I already demoed a large amount of these today, being able to do not just throwing a report on the customers, but being able to do the detection and the response with the orchestration across multiple infrastructure segments is what really sets us apart from most other solutions that are very, very focused only on certain segments of the infrastructure that the customer has.</p><p>And the demo, you guys already saw, so I'm not going to go through the demo. But -- so that's it. Thank you very much. And any -- are we doing questions now or -- at the end, okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. We have a short break. So why don't we start again at 1:40?</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We'll talk about our scalable sales model.</p><p>LAURIE MACCARTHY, FORMER EVP OF WORLDWIDE FIELD OPERATIONS, QUALYS, INC.: All right. Hi, everybody. Laurie MacCarthy. I'm going to talk to you guys about the scalable sales model that we've created here at Qualys. I'm a really great person to talk to you about this. I've been working within it for 8 years. So let's get going.</p><p>What I'm going to talk to you guys about is what makes it unique, how we enable this model to be successful within our business and how we're going to use this to grow in 2020.</p><p>So what makes our model scalable? What we do is we hire a sales team and very technical account managers. All of our account managers are able to speak to all the intricacies of our platform and our service. We hire 2 flavors of account managers. We have our presales technical account managers, and those are our hunters, very technical folks that are able to also go out and attain new business for our company. We've had a lot of success hiring in the consulting area from integration partners. That's where we get a lot of our presales technical account managers.</p><p>Our post-sales technical account managers are our farmers. They help us to maintain and grow our existing clients, very technical and able to really get in and understand the strategy within each of our clients. We have hired many of those from existing clients. I, myself, am a great example of that. Eight years ago, I was running the vulnerability program for what is now CVS Health, and here I am 8 years later.</p><p>Both our post-sales and our presales technical account managers work with our direct sales and our indirect sales. So they're part of -- both are part of our hybrid model. So they work directly with our clients, and they also work directly hand-in-hand with our partners, the MSSPs that we work with, integration partners, et cetera.</p><p>So why does that make this model unique? Why does that make this model successful for us? By having very technical account management instead of just a traditional sales model, our TAMs are able to go into our accounts and do what we really need to do to be successful with our clients, which is listen. We go in and we listen to our clients. We understand their challenges, and then we take our solutions, and we match them with our clients' challenges to help them solve the problems that they have in their organizations and be successful in having a wonderful foundation in security and compliance for their group, for their organizations.</p><p>One of the things that we did this past year is we added an additional role under the post-sales side of the house, which is our major accounts solution architect. So the MASAs are expertly skilled post-sales technical account managers. They are targeted to work with just our biggest and most complicated clients. They have a higher level of understanding and strategy around how our services fit within the complex organizations of some of our bigger clients.</p><p>Our clients have changed, just like our platform has changed. We have a more mature offering. We have more things to offer. Our clients are using more of that. They're maturing, so we really had to up our game with that. And that's been very successful this past year in improving our bigger relationships.</p><p>Now, of course, I'm sure you're wondering. You've got this team of technical account managers. You have this plethora of services solutions, applications within your platform that you need to make sure that they can support. How do you do that? So what we have is a team of subject matter experts. They roll up under the field, and they are specialists in each of our applications solutions. And they help to make sure that our TAMs are well educated on everything we need to be able to understand, to have our clients use our services most effectively. They also help to educate our partners, the MSSPs we work with, et cetera, so that we are having a good service delivery in both our direct and indirect sales. And they act as a liaise too between our technical account managers and our product management team and our clients and our product management team.</p><p>All right. So we talked a bit about people. That's a bulk of our model. But let's talk about the platform itself. The Qualys platform, in and of itself, is its own distribution model. We are one of the only solutions that offers freemium services at the scale that we do. Philippe had mentioned it before. We're very much a try-and-buy model. With our freemium services, our clients and prospects are allowed to go in and try everything that we have to offer. And then that can translate into a buy.</p><p>Up here, I have some numbers. This is some of the new numbers around our recent free Global Asset Inventory, which is being very successful. We had about 5,500 people sign up. Out of that, we've got almost 1,000 translated into active users. And that's almost 17% growth, which is pretty excellent for very little overhead on our part. So that has been a really great way for us to distribute our model across the MASAs.</p><p>And then, of course, within our clients as well, once you are in with Qualys and you have a subscription with us, it is very, very easy to try any of our services because of our really great and scalable model, where all services are on a single platform and available to you very easily.</p><p>So I want to talk a little bit about our 2020 revenue drivers. You guys have already heard from Philippe and then in-depth from Sumedh about our VMDR. This is going to be very game changing. Being out in the field, talking to our clients on a regular basis, we've heard the call for an end-to-end solution and a simple way to procure that. So that's what we're delivering. We're the only solution, the only one in the competition out there that can truly go out, find your assets, organize them, evaluate them, then prioritize them and remediate them. So no one else can offer that, makes for a very compelling story for us, and we're very excited about it.</p><p>And then on top of that, let's make it even better. We're going to offer it at a single asset price and simplify the whole process. And I think a lot of our clients are going to be really happy with that. We're really excited to offer it. So this, in combination with our continued efforts and success with our freemium services, will really lend to help make us very successful going into 2020.</p><p>And that's all I got, and that's it. Okay. And now our CFO, Melissa, is going to come up and talk about our scalable business model.</p><p>MELISSA B. FISHER, FORMER CFO &amp; PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER, QUALYS, INC.: Thank you, Laurie. As she mentioned, I'm going to talk about how the cloud platform drives our scalable business model.</p><p>We have demonstrated strong growth as the compound annual growth rate of our revenues has been in the high teens, while our EBITDA and free cash flow have grown significantly at a significantly faster pace. This highlights the profit leverage we have inherent in our highly scalable operational model.</p><p>Our revenues have grown organically at an 18% CAGR over the last 4 years, driven by continued growth in core solutions like Vulnerability Management, Policy Compliance and Web Application Scanning as well as contributions from newer products like Cloud Agent and Threat Protection.</p><p>Everything we do today is centered around the cloud platform, from our product and operations strategy to our sales delivery. With the expansion of our product portfolio to 19 applications and our expansion of coverage across cloud, on-prem, endpoints, mobile, OT and IoT environments, we have multiple levers of revenue growth, with new customer prospects, existing customers, channels and verticals like the Fed market.</p><p>Our growth has been driven both by the addition of new customers to our platform as well as expansion of purchases from existing customers. On an LTM basis, approximately 2/3 of our bookings growth has come from new customers, and we continue to expand our wallet share with our existing customers as well with a dollar net expansion rate with our enterprise customer base of 108%.</p><p>Our expanding product suite has been a key driver of our highly profitable revenue growth. As you can see, our revenues have grown faster than our customer base. The additional cost of selling additional solutions is very little. And all of these solutions are built into our organic platform, which also serves as a distribution channel.</p><p>The power of our upsell model is exemplified by the increased multiproduct adoption we have seen with our enterprise customers who have purchased 2, 3, 4 and 5 or more solutions, which is a testament to the success of our land-and-expand strategy. 46% of our enterprise customers have 3 or more solutions, double the amount 3 years ago. 26% of our enterprise customers have 4 or more solutions, more than 4x the amount 3 years ago. 13% of our enterprise customers have 5 or more solutions, more than 6x the amount 3 years ago.</p><p>The increase in multiproduct adoption has been bolstered by the strong growth in paid Cloud Agent subscriptions. Cloud Agent is only used today in 22% of our customers, so there's still significant room to grow. Even within those customers, we still see significant opportunity because it's still very early in terms of deployment on the endpoints.</p><p>Multiproduct adoption positively impacts our retention rate as well. Our enterprise customers with 2 solutions have a gross dollar retention rate of 94%. The multiproduct adoption increases stickiness as enterprise customers with 4 solutions have a best-in-class retention rate of 99%. And it drives higher ARPU as well. Enterprise customers with 3 or more solutions spend 4x that of a 1-product customer. And enterprise customers with 4 or more solutions spend 5x that of a 1-product customer.</p><p>As a result, we have seen continued growth in the number of customers who spend over $500,000 in revenues with us, a 38% CAGR over the last 3 years, with a higher CAGR of 46% in the average revenues. This has contributed to our industry-leading margins, and we reached 40% in 2018. We also benefited from significant efficiencies in sales and marketing, operations and R&amp;D as well, which I will detail more in the coming slides. These strong margins have led to strong free cash flow growth with free cash flow margins at 45% for the year-to-date period.</p><p>As Laurie mentioned, you heard about the drivers of our scalable sales model, including the platform as a distribution channel, which enables customers and prospects to try and buy, as well as our technical account sales force, who can quickly ramp up on new solutions. This has led to strong sales and marketing productivity, which is approximately 70% higher than our peers, which you see exemplified by our top-tier LTV-to-CAC ratio.</p><p>Despite nearly doubling our cloud applications over the last few years, we've maintained a relatively low cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue. This is due to our extremely efficient architecture. Because all of our cloud apps are built into one platform, we don't need a large operations and support staff to make enhancements. Unlike other companies that have been built through acquisitions or have hybrid architectures, we don't have multiple architectures to maintain. And we leverage open-source technologies and invest in making them scalable. We also benefit from having a large base of talent in India, which I'll talk more about shortly.</p><p>Our R&amp;D efficiency at 17% of revenues is slightly below the peer median of 18% despite us having 19 products versus a peer median of 6. One factor is that we use one code base for all customer segments, from SMB all the way up to enterprise. We have reusable modules, which make it very easy for us to add new products, and they're all built into our one cloud platform.</p><p>Another lever of our profitability is our large pool of top talent in India. We continue to grow our base of talent in Pune, and today, approximately 77% of our R&amp;D is located there. We're successful in doing this because unlike other companies which go to India for back office, we use it for front office. And as a result, we have very low turnover there. As you can see, our Pune operation gives us significant cost leverage. If all of our R&amp;D in this period was in the U.S., our margins would be 20 percentage points lower.</p><p>So when you put it all together, you see how our platform model provides us with significant operating leverage, even as we've delivered 3x more products than our peers. These results and industry-leading margins enable us to continue to grow our foundation of recurring revenues and maintain strong profitability, highlighted by our superior performance on the Rule of 40.</p><p>So with that, I would like to turn it over to Sumedh, who will introduce our customer panel.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: All right. Thank you, Melissa. So we're doing a different format this time and happy to have some of industry-leading folks out here, and I would like to welcome them to join me. So we have Wendy Pfeiffer, CIO of Nutanix. We have Chad. Sorry, Chad, your last name is hard to say. But he's Executive Director of Cyber Exposure Management at Comcast. Senthil Selvaraj, SVP of Independent Technology Risk at PNC Bank; Thomas Graham, CISO of CynergisTek; and Hemanta Swain, VP and Chief Security Officer at TiVo.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible) on the panel.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: They're not on this panel. Sorry, the paper had...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Oh, yes, yes.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: They're on the other panel.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This is the next panel for the...</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: You gave the different paper, so...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Very good.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: So thank you very much for joining and sitting through the morning presentation. So I wanted to start -- kick off by -- is there something -- is this my...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Testing, testing.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: So maybe a quick minute to introduce yourself, and then we can get started. So Wendy, we can start with you.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: I'm Wendy Pfeiffer. I am Nutanix's CIO and also sit on the Board at Qualys.</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: Thanks. I get both mics. Hi, I'm Chad Schieken. So I'm an Executive Director at Comcast. And my role is to help the organization really focus on protecting our customers' privacy through strong cybersecurity and vulnerability management from -- everything from assessments to scanning to audit findings, all those things sort of funnel into the program that I look after at this point in time.</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: Thank you. I'm Sen. I'm with PNC. So I'm a Risk Officer supporting the CIO groups, including the CTO, CISO and all the other CIOs. This is in line with the 3 lines of different approach that banking adopts. So I was pulled from the first line, from technology groups, into the risk group to challenge and advise the CIOs from an independent perspective.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Okay. Thank you very much. And I think we can -- we had a lot of conversations this morning around digital transformation. And I think I would like to kick off the conversation right there. I think this is something that we are all seeing throughout our organizations. And all of you come from very different areas within security and information technology within the organizations. I'm very curious to hear, Senthil, we can start from you, in terms of how are you seeing digital transformation change security in your organization.</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: That's to me, right? Yes, thanks, Sumedh. I think digital transformation applies to every company and every individual out there right now. And banking is no exception.</p><p>I wanted to give you one data point, which I saw from American Bankers Association, one of the premier ABA, it's called ABA, the banking entity that released statistics that says, if you go look at data survey, I think, actually, they did a survey of most of the U.S. customers, all the millennials and all the age groups. They found out how do you primarily use your banking today. And obviously, needless to say, only 17% used banking center, going into the bank branches as we used to do before. 35% says online; 36%, mobile. Obviously, the millennials have picked up, and this number is significantly up from the previous year, which was like 30% or something. But now the number of total U.S. customers doing online -- primarily online and mobile banking is almost 70%, 72%, which is quite a big number.</p><p>I think that tells, clearly, the need and the awareness and what banks should be doing about. And PNC is the sixth largest bank in the U.S. with $400 billion in assets, obviously, way below the top 4, BoA, where I worked for 15 years prior to joining PNC, JPM, Wells and Citi. So the big banks are able to upgrade their infrastructure, which brings up the question of securing your data, assets and everything to compete very intensely with all the large tech companies. So I think that's where our digital transformation is going right now.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Chad?</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: Big topic. So first, let me say that speaking from my own experience as an industry professional, not so much speaking as a spokesperson for Comcast, what I've observed, both working in my current role as well as prior, is that digital transformation has -- creates an opportunity for -- we, as security professionals, to take a massive leap forward along with the business, right?</p><p>One of the things that we typically see with any type of digital transformation journey is this move to the DevOps and what I'll just refer to as modern software development practices, whether that's agile or Scrum or strict DevOps or maybe what I'd call sloppy DevOps, where you have like an SRE involved, and there's different ways to kind of get there. But what we see consistently, and I think Sumedh mentioned this earlier in terms of your own experience at Qualys, is that you see this dramatic reduction in the security risks at any given organization as the things you can tangibly measure when you're using these practices because what was hard, which is updating and patching and changing systems, just became easy, right?</p><p>So I think there's this great opportunity. And as security professionals, one of the things that we're doing that I see in my current role is we talk about shifting left so much that my desk no longer has my chair at the center of desk. I have moved my chair over to the left, right, because we are physically shifting left, right?</p><p>And I hear from folks that I work with, both in leadership as well as throughout the organization, about building security in as opposed to bolting it on. And it's not easy, right? We all have legacy technologies. We all have things we've deployed for years and years and years. And just because you changed to maybe a better Scrum doesn't change that code base. So there is a lot of work to do, but the opportunity is there to really make a difference.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Okay. So Wendy, you have a pretty unique view here from both the IT side and the security side. So I'm curious as you -- I'm sure you see the push and pull from both sides. So curious with the digital transformation that you are witnessing at your organization. How do you look at how that thing is going?</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: So at the heart of this is application and data mobility. There are a number of studies out. The latest Enterprise Cloud Index note that, gosh, well over 90% of all enterprise IT departments are trying to operate in a hybrid cloud mode, running single applications and single data sets across multiple cloud formats. And in order to do that, we need specialized visibility and specialized controls. And what's more, now we're seeing the pendulum swing. So, let's call it, 7 years ago, we saw many applications moving to public cloud. The latest surveys show that 73% of the respondents were actually moving 5 or more applications back from public cloud to private cloud and/or to on-premise. And the driver for that was data security, was cybersecurity.</p><p>And so what we're seeing is that the -- in my world, the cybersecurity models, the tools, the applications are not keeping pace with this operating model of hybrid cloud. And so we're having to do these specialized point tools, these individual components rather than using that same hybrid model across the modes, across the clouds. Ultimately, vendors have to keep up because everything is changing. Like we were talking about earlier today, the consumption models have already changed. The operating models have already changed. So in my organization, about 40% of all of the work that we do is completed autonomously now. And behind that is data, of course, but that's autonomously across all the modes, and that's autonomously across multiple clouds. That's the model of today and the future.</p><p>The real digital transformation is being enacted, I think, by our employees. 70% of our employees, by the year 2026, will be millennials or Gen Z. And they didn't grow up with client server computing. They grew up with mobile devices. And those mobile devices allow that platform-like mixed mode of consumption with shared secured data, application, mobility, et cetera, sort of invisible to those employees. If in IT our role is to help our employees to be more productive and then to enable our companies to do -- to run, then that digital transformation is driven by the mode in which those employees work and consume data and so on. And we must keep pace. If we don't and when we don't, then they'll use consumer versions of the apps that we're trying to secure, et cetera. And so we're right in this messy middle. And in the midst of that messy middle, we need modes of cybersecurity consumption that match our application consumption. We need those to be on par with each other.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: And yes, you make a very good point about (inaudible) which matches with the point you made about it's not just about where we are now, but we are moving into a new generation of folks who don't even know client server or mainframe, and they've grown up in this sort of a digital economy and a digital way of life. And so everything we do and look forward has to be in that direction.</p><p>And so I would like to ask a follow-up question to you too because you mentioned about that digital transformation is something that you are pushing forward in the bank. I'm curious, how are you looking at it from a security perspective, right, or within the organization? Is that being looked at, \"Oh my god, this is like crazy\"? Is it, \"Hey, here's a good opportunity\"? And is that making a positive impact today?</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: Yes, that's a very good question. And if you look at the Internet banking space, as of, I think, last month, the count -- if you look at the count of number of banks in the U.S., we have about 5,300 banks. Obviously, that's a significantly large number. We wouldn't think that there are so many number of banks.</p><p>But the top 10 banks, top 20, the top 50, I mean banks with $250 billion and more assets, want to be in the game because we do not want to give all of our core services, the core competency platforms to fintechs that are coming up and also to the big tech companies that are making inroads. In fact, Wendy, to your point, my son -- I mean if you look at our kids, I mean they never grew up with anything that is less than a smartphone, right? So I think they're in a generation where they're used to the smart TVs and the Netflixes and all that.</p><p>I think from that perspective, banks need to adapt, but there is one problem, which I would throw it as a challenge, not just from a PNC perspective but, I think, overall from a banking perspective. Banking has fueled the last 4 industrial revolutions, right, from electricity to automobile to the computing, now cloud. So we have the legacy application, if you can call it as the baggage, right? So we have mainframes and things of that nature.</p><p>So I think the challenge for banks is not only to move fast to compete with the growing trend and needs of today's world but also how you can successfully transition from your mainframe legacy applications or at least integrate, so it will power your online and mobile application, which is what consumers expect. I think we have to balance that aspect with security. That's why banks, in general, have taken a cautious approach. I mean you mentioned how the trend is for companies to pull back some of their applications from cloud and go on-prem, right? But banks did not even go that far.</p><p>So we just finished our consolidation of multiple 2030 legacy data centers into nice, cool, greenfield data centers. So mostly, you can call it as cloud plus. We are heavily regulated. So we do have foundational cloud controls, the encryption key management and all those things. So we are not that much into the cloud now. Obviously, SaaS, we cannot ignore. I mean with the Workdays and Salesforce, no company is immune to those things. But I think from that perspective, banks are taking a balanced approach. So that's how we are able to manage the security aspects, by entering into the much-needed things without completely changing your DNA.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Right. And to that point, whether cloud or not cloud, the transformation is still happening with containerization, and that's sort of undeniable at this point. Whether it's on-prem solution or whether it's in the cloud, that containerization approach for everything is something that we see quite a bit. And so, Chad, I wanted to ask you a question around that. With the developers, the DevOps people who are pushing forward and containerization and all of that, how are you seeing the role of security can change in the organization, if at all?</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: Yes. Thanks, Sumedh. That's a really interesting question. How is the role of security changing it? I feel like we're moving from guards, right, stationed around your facility to coaches and trainers. Because what we're seeing with the DevOps revolution or the adoption of modern software development practices is that the person implementing and managing and even, in some cases, monitoring the security of their systems is the individual developer, right? They're the army of one, if you will, right? So now our job is to sort of lead and inspire them, right? They need to want to do this. And what I find personally is when I sit down with any developers in our organization, we review a security issue, and we talk about what's going on. The questions they ask aren't \"Why do we have to fix this?\" or \"Why is this important?\" Right? The question they ask is, well, what's the risk, so I can make sure that what we fix actually fixes the problem, right? And they ask questions like, \"Tell me who should I be worried about, might want to exploit this particular vulnerability?\" Right? They're not coming to us with these like basic objections. I don't personally experience that. And that's been a repeated pattern for me now in the industry. What I'm seeing is that the developers have taken ownership, right? And that's -- at the end of the day, that's as far left as where we're really going to get it. So that's been -- that's been my own personal experience. And in order to get there, right, you've got to take an approach that is something that developers are willing to consume, right?</p><p>One of the things we did recently with some of your products, actually, was the patch data about, okay, it's this particular patch for that particular problem. And we build an internal API that they could query to get to that data, and that was really useful for our developer community. Yes, we put out an MVP. We got some feedback. Developers wanted it all, of course, to be sliced and diced differently. So we went back to the drawing board in the slicing and the dicing. But the fundamental idea, that we met them where they are, we feel like we probably gained a year over the alternative approach of like communications campaign and e-mails and trying to have meetings and getting people to sort of like indoctrinate into a culture versus just showing up in the mode in which they already communicate and do things. And it's really starting to pay dividends.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Yes, that's actually my own experience, when the DevOps guys went ahead and started pushing code to production, then they didn't have the security team to blame for the issues that were coming up. So now they are at the table and working to figure out so that they don't -- if they want the ability to push that code without going through the old process, then they need to be partnering with security. And I think that's really the important message here is that what it used to be where they throw out their code and then it was security's problem to secure it even though the bugs were created by them, the new world is that they are at the table and they are actually working together.</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: Yes, and it changes the skill set that you need on your security team, right? Gone are the days where some of -- from my own perspective, from my team, I need, I would say 80% of my team, to have moderate programming skills, right? The ability to take a script, it does something and change it to do -- maybe does 3 things, add a fourth thing, change the third thing, they need to be able to do those things. If they can't, what I find is they can't communicate well with the developers, they can't be specific on the risks, and it's a real impediment. So even though we've got everyone on my team as a developer, we have a real need for that team. And we need the risk managers and more traditional security folks as well, but it's definitely changed the profile of the people that we look for.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Thank you for that. So I think related -- that's into the conversation that, Wendy, the question for you is with the developers now coming to the table with security, that kind of changes when you're looking at the budget and who's asking for money, and is it the security team coming? Is it the developers that are coming? Is it a combination of that? Or they're looking at more open source technology? So I'd be curious to see if you -- what kind of shift you have seen in the last few years and who's coming and asking for money.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: I run a really tight ship.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: I'm sure.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: So first of all, today, I work for a core operating system company where about 2/3 of the company are software developers. And we develop for special versions of operating systems for U.S. government, et cetera. So there's maybe 3 different areas. One is operational security, one is product security and one is compliance.</p><p>The shift that I am seeing is that in the past, compliance drove the funding decisions. Let's start with something like Sarbanes-Oxley. Until recently, that was driving funding. And so I could always find some reason to invest a little bit more related to citing some compliance challenge. So the problem with that is that the CFO's willingness to continue to support that is mitigated by sort of how much cybersecurity insurance we can get.</p><p>Today, we're looking at something different. We're looking at -- because of this digital transformation, I hate that term, but because of this digital transformation, we now have technology -- scalable technology that's enabling mobility at the core of our business model. And in that sense, when we talk about funding operational security, we're talking about funding product architecture. We're talking about funding business architecture, business agility. So the conversation -- in fact, I use very few technical terms. Now I'm talking about scalability, flexibility, geographic reach, resilience, terms that are much more core to the business model. And in that sense, our funding is driven by those business architecture decisions, and it's very, very different model.</p><p>So we were looking at some of the statistics earlier in the sessions, maybe spending companies that spend 10% on cybersecurity are doing really well. I'd venture to say we are spending a significant portion of our business enablement budget on resilient and scalable architecture, business architecture, which is fueled by this digital capability that we have. So it's almost difficult to parse those things out individually, but it's a lot more than 10%.</p><p>And the discussions are interesting, too, right? We're having Board-level discussions that are all about business model that result in funding cyber programs, but we may never even use the word cyber. We're using words around capability and so on. That's really exciting for me. I -- not that I'm capable as a CIO of using fear tactics. And every time I listen to Richard Clarke, my heart sort of stops a little bit, but at the same time, instead of fear tactics, enablement tactics, right? Capability tactics. What could we do if we had a model that worked this way in these modes in these geographies, et cetera? So for me, this is a super exciting time.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: And that really fits well what Philippe talked about earlier is it's about the architecture. So a lot of the focus is going into what is the architecture of where we're going rather than these individual solutions and do this and then I'm going to get this quid pro quo right away.</p><p>And I think, if I may ask you a question around that, Senthil, is how are you seeing this kind of balance with the traditional security solutions that we've used in the past or the organization they have used in the past with this pull -- or push towards moving to a newer architecture?</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: Yes. So that's a really interesting question. In fact, I wanted to pick up on one thing that Wendy mentioned on the Sarbarnes-Oxley plans and all those. I think there are certain things that we have to spend the money on, and we don't look at it as the percentage of revenues and things like that. So that includes the GDPR and the California CCPA and all those regulations. Whereas I think cyber and this digital transformation has given a new insight in that all the banks benchmark the percentage of revenue we spend for cyber insurance and things of that nature.</p><p>I think from that perspective, traditionally, we have just taken care of the application security and things like that, but now I think it's far more. One, we benchmark. We say that, hey, this is how Bank of America spends, JPM spends, and this is how much we should increase our spend, and we set a threshold there. And then how do we allocate within? I think that takes into consideration all the things that you talked about in your presentations, the siloed approach. It's not just one thing alone. Previously, it used to be, hey, while we are in the evolution, maybe 10 years back, it used to be just maybe a couple of solutions to go check your endpoints and invest in firewalls and things of that nature, but I think now it's more than that. I think you need to be training the employees to get better at phishing, things like the third-party independent pen testing that we need to do. So I think with the -- now there are multiple areas where cyber needs to focus on from an investment standpoint. So I think, yes, that's where banks are at too right now.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Anything you guys like to add to that? Chad?</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: So help me focus a little. What aspect would you...</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: So I mean, I think one of the things that I'm curious about is, right, when -- with the push that you say security is more now towards being -- working with -- consulting them, showing them what's the right direction, how does that bear with the traditional security tools that have been used in the organization, which have been enterprise solutions?</p><p>And if I can add a little bit to that is also the role of the same solution. Because an organization like you and pretty much everybody, despite having all of this always seem to be writing something in security, somebody is always scripting something and somebody is always creating their own data lake for security. And I'm really curious to hear here that push, despite all that, why is that needed?</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: Yes. I think my experience has been Comcast is an interesting business. We're quite large in terms of the number of IPs, the number of customers, and with that comes a lot of responsibility. And many technologies are built and designed not necessarily with an organization like ours needs in mind. So we are having to grow things around tools that are out there. The best tools we work with are the ones that make that easy. They give us an API, right? They -- it's easy to upgrade and those types of things. And what we're seeing is the advantages that we get really come from our ability to find a best-in-class thing and then deploy it for the thing it was designed to be deployed, right? And what we find is that there's products and -- that might have 47, 50 different features and functions, right? For us, it's really about identifying the very specific use cases that we're going to be leveraging and then making sure that they're going to work and scale the way we need them to. When we stay inside that comfort zone, things work really well. When we start to do testing and things are outside of that comfort zone, in those test scenarios, we find sometimes things won't always work exactly as expected. So for us, it's that constant vigilance of remembering sort of like the unique circumstances we're in and then trying to map things to that.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: Okay. Thank you. So I think we're coming up on our time?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. This has been incredibly powerful. I know a lot of our audience like have some questions for you guys. So why don't we start with Q&amp;A for the panel and then we can always do Q&amp;A for management after.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: They did have another mic.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: I think there's a question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just a question. We talked about this a lot earlier about the number of vendors -- cyber security vendors, and you were talking about Richard Clarke, whatever. Can you just give us an idea of how many vendors -- cybersecurity vendors you have in each of your environments? It might not be something that you even know, but -- and then what's your plan over the next 2 to 5 years to consolidate vendors? And how does Qualys fit into that plan? That would be really helpful.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: Operationally, I have about 60 vendors for my ops. I also work for an operating system company where -- and vendors certify to our OS. So I've got hundreds and hundreds that are running as well for certification purposes. I do not expect to dramatically consolidate, but I do expect to only use a handful of tools over the next 3 to 5 years for my core operations, ultimately, because everything we're doing is moving to autonomous mode and training the machine is best with focus. And so focus really helps us to get to autonomous operations, which then helps us to get to very fast response, and that's the goal for all of us operationally.</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: So unfortunately, I can't answer your question because I personally just don't know the number of tools. I can tell you that, thematically, we're going through a process to really focus on not just deploying tools, but measuring the effectiveness of those tools. And then I can tell you specific to Qualys, that's been a major area of partnership with us and Apollo's team throughout the past, I don't know, 6 months or so to really make sure that we're getting the leverage and effectiveness.</p><p>And my own personal experience in our environment has been, time and time again, when questions come up, like, \"Oh, is that really a false positive?\" Or, \"Did you really scan that correctly?\" Or, \"Hey, someone accuses a scanner of knocking something over, creating a disruption,\" literally, I want to -- I don't want to quite say 100% of the time because maybe I'm forgetting something, but I cannot recall a single instance where we've gone back to Qualys and said, \"Hey, you just did something in our environment that didn't work or you offered us a particular piece of value that we didn't get.\"</p><p>So I can tell you that these things have fared well for the tools that I'm personally managing. And across the organization, there's definitely this idea that if we're using anything that's not adding as much value as others that maybe we need to invest more in the things that are working and maybe just invest less on things that aren't. That measurement will be ongoing.</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: Yes. My answer to one of your questions is similar to what he mentioned, which is I do not know how many vendors we have. But obviously, the big banks have hundreds of vendors. But one thing I'll tell you, this is a public information. I mean, our regulators, especially the OCC, when they announce -- when they come up with a quarterly guidance for U.S. -- the consumers as well as banks, they rate vendor management as 1 of the top 3 risks. So cyber, vendor, operational risks are always in the top.</p><p>So vendor management risk is not vendor's risk. It's our risk. The way vendors can do anything, but I think ultimately, the onus is on the banks. I think from that perspective, we have a very good third-party vendor management program, which comes up with the first onetime assessment of inherent risk and everything, so that's how we evaluate various vendors. And we do have a lot of vendors that support in this space, from a DLP perspective, from CASB. I mean, obviously, with the growth of cloud, there are various products. But one thing I would tell you within the limits of what our ethics committee has provided me is Qualys has been our customer for quite some time for the last several years, even before we started this digital transformation and data center consolidation, all these programs. So yes, definitely, I think I would mention that one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Great. Any other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: We were constantly struck by how few subscriptions some companies use relative to the Qualys platform. The description he offered up this morning clearly shows an enormous amount of value that can be had, a lot of automation, a lot of orchestration, yet we don't see that reflected in 50% of customers buying 7, 8, 10, 12 subscriptions. So my question to you is, where are you guys in that? Are you using the full platform? Are you using 2, 3 subscriptions? And when you see what he offered this morning, do you see, \"Hey, this is something that I could really extend big time into my organization.\" How impressed are you with what they're showing here in terms of delivering the automation and orchestration and solving the problem of false positives and the like?</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: I can give a very general observation and then, Wendy, you can pick it up. I think one of the things that got my attention from Philippe's presentation this morning was how the paradigm shift has taken place across the 4 channels, mainframe to minicomputers to client server technology and cloud. I think the one notable thing there was it used to be contained to a handful of few companies and then -- I mean, to a whole bunch of companies and employees, but now with cloud, everyone is in it. Like, any company can come up with a bunch of nerdy technology guys partner with Stanford or something like that and then start a company. So I think from that perspective, it's very difficult. I mean, whatever Qualys has done in terms of number of products is impressive, but it's very difficult from a corporate standpoint where you can say, \"Hey, there's an opportunity for us to consolidate,\" because I think there are varying needs and that's how our vendor base and the needs are spread out.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: So I'm excited about Qualys' new play. It matches the consumption model that I'm trying to drive. The potential challenge with any model like that is that all the components may not be best-in-class, especially when you're talking about acquisitive platforms like a Salesforce, for example, where the components are not best-in-class. In this case, the development of those components was in-house and was specific to an overall road map. So that is interesting to me.</p><p>I can tell you that it matches a consumption model that we're -- that we want to have in IT, but financial cycles really are a factor in terms of how quickly we can change models and modes. Typically, as a CIO, in general terms, I'm not speaking about my current job particularly, but in general terms, we have financial targets that we meet around CapEx and OpEx consumption. And so if I'm going to change up a model of consumption, kind of writ large across a category of spending, then I do that gradually because the financial model (inaudible) so that's a challenge, right? And so I think what I look at when I'm changing from CapEx consumption to OpEx consumption, I'm looking at a -- I'm looking at maybe a 2- to 3-year pivot, right, a 2- to 3-year gradual move. That's actually okay. That matches this sort of model that Qualys is offering. So it's one of the things at Nutanix as well, we are moving to a subscription sales model, and we're seeing that same cycle. Our customers need that 18 to 36 months to pivot their consumption models and to plan that financially. However, it's a very attractive model once we make that pivot.</p><p>The last piece is that the laws have just recently changed as well. So we used to -- if we signed up for a SaaS-type deal, right, we would look at that on a month-to-month basis. Now we have to look at the total potential price of that contract. And so that's adding another layer of complexity in terms of how quickly we -- taking care for GAAP and all those other things kind of pivot our models.</p><p>Ultimately, if I'm going to displace multiple vendors today with a single platform but the consumption model will ultimately be the same, then I'm going to do that over, let's call it, 18 to 36 months. But I'm going to actively go there if I have best-in-class point solutions and it reduces my complexity because complexity is still the enemy of security and scaling and all those things.</p><p>PHILIPPE F. COURTOT: So I would like to a second. Let say that what's interesting that we might be (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Have you turned on, Philippe?</p><p>PHILIPPE F. COURTOT: Okay. Yes. I don't know. Okay. So thank you very much.</p><p>So what is very unique with the Qualys model, especially because of security, this is a security component. The challenge -- the reason why security has been best-of-breed is because the solution that eliminates false positive and false negative rises naturally to the top. And that's how we became the best warranty management solution because we are aware of the solution, which by far, has a less false positive and false negative. And we measure that even to the point that we are better than Six Sigma, which means for 1 million scans that we do, we have less than 3.2 errors.</p><p>Now what is interesting with our platform approach and that cloud approach and that's -- I learned that many, many years ago is that the solution that we build on the top of our platform become naturally and very effectively best-of-breed. Why? Because we can correlate information that this other application cannot do. As a result of that, we can eliminate much better and much faster the false positive and false negative. So all the solutions that we are building on our platform are almost build to be best-of-breed, and that's very unique. Again, it's an architectural component.</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: It's interesting. I'm going to respond -- I heard 2 parts to your question. The first part, you mentioned one aspect, false positives. And the question was also, what's the reaction to some of the announcements today.</p><p>So around false positives, I would say false positives are not a problem. And anyone that says they are, at least with this particular technology, isn't looking at the data. Because the data is clear. Like, nothing's perfect, right? So like I just went through our false positives that we saw in the past, I don't know, 2 or 3 weeks, and we have an environment that is truly at scale, right? I don't know if we're the largest customer. I doubt we are the largest, but we're certainly up there. And I think we had like 4 or 5 false positive requests, very, very few. And what -- and so even if someone -- so even if I had more, right, the thing you do in response to a false positive is, usually, 88% of the time, based on the Qualys knowledge base, you go -- you try to patch it. Well, the patches all look for the software and the version. So if you try to apply a patch that didn't need to be applied, it would just stop. And so I don't need to do this. So no matter how you slice the false positives problem, that's a bit of a trap. It's almost like an ad hominem attack against the program to say, \"Oh, you give me a false positive, so I'm not going to play in your sandbox.\" So I'm at the Qualys conference. I'm going to stand on that soapbox, right? This is my one opportunity to do it.</p><p>The -- what I will say is around the product announcements, what I saw was things that I consider really forward-looking. So I was actually telling Sumedh just a few minutes ago, I had a colleague approach me, looking for better prioritization of the results that we're giving them. And we have an internal project going where we're trying to find a different way to weight the vulnerabilities that we have using things like maybe there -- whether there's an exploit that it just exists, whether it is how mature is the exploit, right? And all these other factors as well as far as the CVSS score and the prevalence of this, and we're experimenting with this model to see can we find something, right, that would allow us to focus on the few things that are going to really have a significant impact on our risk. And then when we're done with those things, reassess either new things came in at that same risk level and we iterate at that high-risk level, maybe we don't get out of there, or maybe we solve the high-risk problems and now we have the time and resources to go after the lower risk, right?</p><p>So we've been experimenting with that and running some tests. And I wouldn't have had to do that work if Sumedh had to be able to push that out last year, right? So my reaction is very positive. I'm happy to innovate. We have a very innovative culture. We love to tinker and experiment. We try to do that. We never do that at the expense of the customer, but we try to do that in a way that allows our people to fully use all their different skills because we have such a talented team. At the same time, every time we build something and a vendor comes along with a solution that already -- that solves the same problem, I can now take those resources and apply them to something else, right? And I'd rather write checks to solve certain problems than put my people's time on it. So prioritization is a great example of something that the industry needs for a variety of reasons.</p><p>And the VMDR platform is very interesting to me. There's different environments where I can see that being incredibly applicable. My own use cases, as they typically do, don't encompass all of the needs that, that particular solution provides for, meaning it's not the same teams that find the problems and fix them, right? We -- most of our technology is tied up in what we -- the products and services we offer our customers, not sort of like the IT back office. So the teams that provide those products and services are the same teams that fix those problems in this DevOps model, right? So for us, it may not be as applicable, but that doesn't mean I don't see sort of the value. And Sumedh knows, if I had a different view, I'd be sharing that one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Do you use the Cloud Agent? And if not, why?</p><p>And then the second question would be, are you more likely to buy more Qualys products if you do use the Cloud Agent?</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: Okay. So we are beginning to take a more agent-based approach in our organization. We've traditionally had an architecture that was based on network scanning. That architecture served us very well for a long time and will continue to. We are finding that there are specific use cases for the Cloud Agent that are really compelling.</p><p>So for instance, inside a CICD pipeline in a lower environment, it becomes very easy to get a sort of federated product and service team to accept putting yet another agent, right, from their perspective into their -- onto their devices. So we've seen that, that approach has been really useful for us, given that we have a model where -- and so my leadership says this very eloquently. They hire really smart people and they give them problems to solve. They don't tell those people how to solve those problems. So when we deploy security controls and solutions, we do that in a way that allows for different teams to find the right fit for their particular fleet of servers. So I could have one team with a fleet of 30,000 or 40,000 servers and I can have another team with a fleet of 10,000 servers and 3 other teams with multiple tens of thousands in their fleets, and they're each going to be given various methods with which to sort of secure their environment and support around that. So for us, it's not a situation where we have this heterogeneous environment. We can just say, \"All right, push this out to everywhere, right?\" It's just not the way we work.</p><p>So we find that the Cloud Agent is a useful tool in the tool chest and we find that it can be really high-impact integrating into a CICD pipeline because every piece of software that you put onto any other system is a source of potential operational error and a source of security risk. So of course, we're going to want to keep that as small as possible. If we're able to effectively test on our lower environments and use modern development practices to push out to production exactly what we had just tested, that means that maybe we don't need all those agents in the production environment for, in this particular use case, detecting vulnerabilities. It's different for other pieces of like detection in terms of like malicious behavior or something, but for vulnerabilities, we find we can take a really efficient and targeted approach.</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: I think from our perspective, as I mentioned earlier, banking, taking a cautious approach, we are not that deep into the cloud right now. We have a lot of, I mean, variety of applications within our consolidated private cloud, if you will, or data centers. And we do use various products. I'm not exactly sure how -- which product we use for Cloud Agents and things like that, but we have the CASB solutions, the DLP and all that, mostly to secure our perimeter from externally facing applications and detecting their vulnerabilities, prioritizing and then letting us know so we can give that as a high priority. And we do measure that using a Board-level metric. So from that perspective, we have strong controls around whatever we have as an exposed surface, but not truly fully into the cloud. So I think probably that's future iterations. And when banks evolve a little bit more into the cloud and maybe explore infrastructure as a service, platform as a service products, we may try a little bit more, but I think most of our applications are secured within our private cloud area right now.</p><p>SUMEDH S. THAKAR: There's another question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have a quick one. So it seems like -- just wondering if you guys already have an existing vendor that's in play right now? And it seems like -- how are you guys thinking about adopting the vendor SIM solution just like Qualys announced today into your existing SIM operation?</p><p>And then lastly, just a quick initial reaction on the pricing model that was announced this morning.</p><p>CHAD SCHIEKEN: So I personally couldn't comment probably on the details of our SIM, what vendor we're using and that sort of thing. And I think the SIM is not a product that I personally run in my function, so I can't speak to the suitability or not. It's just not (inaudible) responsibility (inaudible).</p><p>As far as the pricing model, if I understood it, it's more bundled, right? Well, that was exactly what I asked for, right? The reality is that there's tools and capabilities in the platform. And given our environment where I might have different needs for different segments of the environment, it's really useful to have a partner that can say, \"Okay. You can use the PDI module over here. You can use this other module over there.\" And what that does is that eliminates the need for me to go out to the market and look at other solutions, and it kind of does keep me a little bit in this walled garden, which I'll happily stay in as long as I continue to get the value that I'm getting.</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: I run Splunk. They're also a technology partner of Nutanix, so they run certified on our operating system. I am always looking for alternatives that have favorable pricing models and especially favorable scaling models. And so I did hear about pricing. I like the sound of that. Scaling, I want to see how the model plays out, but I'm interested.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Even if it's more expensive?</p><p>WENDY M. PFEIFFER: Well, I'm a pretty good negotiator. So it's maybe not as expensive as for others.</p><p>SENTHIL SELVARAJ: No. My response is similar to what Chad provided. So I cannot divulge on the nature of work that different vendors do for us, but we do have a variety of vendors and we do have our own end-to-end program from a SIM perspective and all that. But I think the demo that was presented this morning was very interesting in that it hit the nail on its head with the siloed nature of the process, plan, tools and everything and there is urgent need to integrate all these things. So I think there's a lot of value. It doesn't matter whether the companies go for their own end-to-end process and solution or they're up another vendor product. But I think that's the need of the hour right now.</p><p>PHILIPPE F. COURTOT: Okay. What I would like to say is that we have at 3 p.m., there is a presentation from Microsoft, which is speaking about building security into Azure. So if some of you would like to go, I mean, 3:00. It's not -- for those who want to continue the question, you can stay until midnight. So that's no problem. So -- so it's really okay. So okay. Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Philippe, would you like to say any closing remarks?</p><p>PHILIPPE F.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc.</p><p>GOOGL[4], Amazon.com Inc. AMZN[5] and FacebookFB[6].Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day[7]:Shares of Qualys, Inc. have been on a roller coaster ride over the last 12 months, including a big one-day drop Monday. Despite the recent turbulence, the cloud-based IT security and compliance solutions firm's stock is up big over the last several years and Qualys looks poised to grow both its top and bottom lines going forward.Overview Qualys' pitch to potential customers is simple. The firm boasts that it offers 'a single cloud platform for IT, security and compliance across' all of a company's 'global IT assets.' The firm's cloud-based platform and its integrated cloud apps provide business critical security intelligence continuously, which allows Qualys' clients the chance to automate 'auditing, compliance and protection for IT systems and web applications on premises, on endpoints and elastic clouds.'The Foster City, California-based company was one of the first security firms to operate a Software-as-a-Service model. This has become widely popular across the tech industry today, from Salesforce to more consumer-facing companies like Netflix and Uber. Qualys has strategic partnerships with some well-known consulting giants and managed service providers like Accenture and IBM and currently has over 12,200 customers around the world.Cybersecurity concerns are set to expand as the world becomes ever-more digitized and connected. In fact, roughly $600 billion, or nearly 1% of global GDP, is expected to be lost to cybercrime every year, based on a 2018 study by The Center for Strategic and International Studies and global computer security firm McAfee.Qualys is coming off top and bottom line beats in Q1 fiscal 2019. And as we mentioned at the top, shares of QLYS have outperformed over the last serval years. Qualys is up 154% in the last three years and 93% over the past 24 months, which blows away the Security Market's 31% average climb and the S...00's 12% jump.Outlook ...rnings TrendsLooking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company's second-quarter revenue to pop roughly 15.2% from the prior-year quarter to reach $78.5 million. This would mark a slight slowdown from Q1's 16% top-line expansion. With that said, the company's full-year fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to jump 15.4% to hit $321.9 million. Peeking further ahead, Qualys is expected to see its full-year 2020 revenue surge 16% above our current-year estimate, in a sign of solid and stable sales growth.At the bottom end of the income statement, the security provider is expected to see its adjusted second-quarter earnings soar 20.5% from the year-ago period to touch $0.47 per share. Last quarter, QLYS crushed our earnings estimate by 16.7% to post adjusted earnings of $0.49, which marked a 36% climb. Meanwhile, the company's adjusted full-year EPS figure is projected to pop 10.3%. Plus, Qualys' 2020 earnings are projected to come in 14.6% higher than our current-year estimate.Qualys has topped our quarterly earnings estimate for several years now. This includes a 21.1% average beat over the trailing four periods. Investors will also notice that Qualys' earnings estimate revision picture has trended heavily upward recently, especially for fiscal 2019 and 2020. The firm's positive earnings estimate revision activity has helped lift its overall consensus estimates for both the current and following fiscal year, which means at least some analysts are more optimistic about Qualys' earnings growth.Bear of the Day[8]:Nordstrom, Inc. stock has tumbled 30% in 2019. This stands in stark contrast to the S...00's roughly 10% comeback, but is part of an increasingly worrisome trend among department store chains that struggle for relevance in the quickly changing retail landscape.Overview ...cent PerformanceNordstrom, Macy's, Kohl's, JC Penney and other more traditional department store-style retailers have found it harder to adapt to the e-commerce and delivery age. JWN and others have revamped their businesses to accommodate shoppers that have come to expect quick delivery and smooth, easy to use e-commerce platforms in the Amazon age.Wall Street and investors have, however, noticed that companies like Nike and Ralph Lauren have focused on direct-to-consumer expansion and big-box retailers such as Target have successfully attracted shoppers who might have been Nordstrom and Macy's customers in years gone by. Nordstrom has purchased Stitch Fix competitor Trunk Club and member-only shopping website HauteLook and focused on its off-priced Nordstrom Rack stores in order to better compete.Nordstrom's first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue slipped 3.3% from the prior-year quarter and missed our Zacks Consensus Estimate. More specifically, the top line was hurt by the company's loyalty program, digital marketing, and merchandise, which led to downturns across JWN's full-price and off-price businesses. Worse yet, the firm's adjusted Q1 earnings plummeted roughly 55% to fall well short of estimates.Shares of JWN have fallen roughly 14% since the company reported its Q1 2019 financial results on May 21. This recent downturn has pushed Nordstrom stock down 31% this year. Investors will notice that the company's recent performance is part of a much larger five-year downturn.Outlook ...rnings TrendsManagement lowered JWN's guidance for fiscal 2019 following Nordstrom's brutal Q1 showing. Looking ahead, the company's current-quarter revenue is projected to dip 3% to $3.94 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nordstrom's full-year revenue is expected to sink 1.75% to $15.58 billion. Peeking further down the road, the company's 2020 revenue is projected to jump 1.3% above our fiscal 2019 estimate. But this would still see revenue come in below 2018's total.At the bottom end of the income statement, the firm's adjusted Q2 2019 earnings are projected to fall nearly 16% to touch $0.80 per share. On top of that, the company's current full-year EPS figure is expected to slip 5.6%. Plus, Nordstrom has experienced a ton of downward earnings estimate revisions recently, especially for fiscal 2019 and 2020.Additional content:Google, Amazon ...cebook Fall as Antitrust Allegations Revisit Silicon ValleyAlphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. stocks opened Monday down big, with Amazon down 3% and Google down over 6%. Both companies are facing speculation of an antitrust investigation. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly going after Google, while the Federal Trade Commission is trying to tackle Amazon and Facebook. Amazon closed the day down around 5% while Alphabet closed around -6.5%.Meanwhile, Facebook is just now nearing the end of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and will be paying $3-5 billion for its privacy violations based on reports. Facebook opened Monday down 3% amid the concerns around other tech giants and closed the day down around 7% as the FTC will reportedly be including Facebook in their antitrust investigation.DOJ InvestigationAlphabet's subsidiary Google is under pressure as the DOJ looks to open an investigation into \"Google's business practices related to its search and other businesses,\" as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. With Alphabet being the tech power that it is, it's hard to know exactly what the DOJ is set to look into.Many of the worries seem to be focused on Google's collection of search data and control of the digital advertising market. Google's search engine currently claims about 75% of the worldwide search engine market share for desktops and that number is even higher for mobile and tablet devices. Google also made up 38% of the digital advertising market in 2018, 17% more than its closest competitor, Facebook.Google has faced many investigations in the past, paying out billions to the European Commission over the past few years. The FTC has also previously investigated Google, which ended with Google agreeing to pay a $22.5 million fine after denying any guilt.FTC InvestigationThe Federal Trade Commission has started the first steps of an investigation into Amazon. There is no clear sign of what the FTC will be specifically looking into, but Amazon's control in the online retail sector has always been an area of concern for politicians. This, coupled with its growing influence in multiple markets, make it a prime target.Amazon is also currently under investigation by the European Union who believe Amazon may be stifling competition due to its size. As seen with the previous Google investigation, the European Union is not afraid to fine these big tech companies in the name of consumer protection. The EU also tends to be significantly stricter than the US when it comes to regulation of these large companies.Facebook was added to the investigation after initial reports were focused on just Amazon and Google. The investigation into Facebook will focus on whether or not it stifles competition and has acted in an unlawful and monopolistic nature. This comes on the back of an FTC investigation regarding privacy issues and Facebook's user data collection.Public PressureThese investigations come after the companies and tech giants as a whole have come under bipartisan pressure from government officials. President Trump, backed by other Republicans, has accused Google of having biased search results and has had something of a personal feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.Meanwhile, Democrats have concentrated on whether or not these tech-giants cut off competition. Antitrust regulation has become a main focus of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign and her thoughts have been echoed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sen. Bernie Sanders. With this much support behind the investigations, it could prove troublesome for the companies.This investigation is just in the very early days and although the government pressure is large, all these companies have large legal teams and resources at their disposal so it is nothing to be overly worried about at the moment, but should be watched as it continues to progress.Will you retire a millionaire?One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire.

De la provocation en pleine Silicon Valley. La candidate d\u00e9mocrate Elizabeth Warren, \u00e0 l'origine de cet affichage, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la guerre \u00e0 Google, Amazon, Facebook et Apple, ou Big Tech, comme on les surnomme, l'\u00e9quivalent de nos Gafam. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Aujourd'hui, les g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique ont trop de pouvoir sur notre \u00e9conomie, notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et notre d\u00e9mocratie \",</emphasis>affirme la s\u00e9natrice du Massachusetts. Elle appelle \u00e0 leur scission et s'est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 refuser les contributions financi\u00e8res de leurs dirigeants. Evidemment, \u00e7a lui a attir\u00e9 quelques inimiti\u00e9s. Warren est une menace <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" existentielle \"</emphasis>, a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s Mark Zuckerberg, le patron de Facebook. Il a promis <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de \" monter au cr\u00e9neau \" </emphasis>et de <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" lutter \"</emphasis>contre son programme de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement. Sans attendre, Facebook a subrepticement escamot\u00e9 quelques publici t\u00e9s anti-Gafam de la candidate sur son site. Avant de les r\u00e9tablir, devant le toll\u00e9 suscit\u00e9.  Quel revirement ! Amazon et Cie \u00e9taient jusque-l\u00e0 vant\u00e9s comme des mod\u00e8les de progr\u00e8s qui oeuvraient pour le bien de l'humanit\u00e9. Mais l'industrie du num\u00e9rique n'est plus en odeur de saintet\u00e9. On lui reproche de manipuler les \u00e9lections, de propager des bobards, de maltraiter ses employ\u00e9s, de gruger le fisc, d'\u00eatre le Big Brother du XXIe si\u00e8cle... Seuls 50 % des Am\u00e9ricains consid\u00e8rent que ces groupes ont un impact positif sur le pays, contre 71 % il y a quatre ans, d'apr\u00e8s le Pew Research Center.  50 %  des Am\u00e9ricains estiment que les Big Tech ont un impact positif sur leur pays, contre 71 %il y a quatre ans, selon le Pew Research Center.  Jeu de massacre. Une fois n'est pas coutume, la droite et la gauche sont unies dans leurs critiques. Les r\u00e9publicains, Donald Trump en t\u00eate, accusent les sites de censurer les voix conservatrices. Les d\u00e9mocrates, eux, d\u00e9noncent l'exploitation des donn\u00e9es personnelles et la d\u00e9sinformation qui, estiment-ils, ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9faite de Hillary Clinton en 2016. Leur fureur est mont\u00e9e d'un cran lorsque Facebook a refus\u00e9, au nom de la sacro-sainte libert\u00e9 d'expression, de censurer une pub totalement mensong\u00e8re contre le candidat Joe Biden concoct\u00e9e par l'\u00e9quipe de Trump. Elizabeth Warren s'est amus\u00e9e \u00e0 lancer \u00e0 son tour un spot annon\u00e7ant - faussement - que Mark Zuckerberg soutenait la r\u00e9\u00e9lection de Donald Trump. Facebook l'a diffus\u00e9 !  Signe du d\u00e9samour croissant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Big Tech, l'audition fascinante du m\u00eame Zuckerberg \u00e0 la Chambre des repr\u00e9sentants le mois dernier. Pour l'occasion, il avait troqu\u00e9 son sempiternel tee-shirt pour un costume-cravate et s'est point\u00e9 avec une armada de lobbyistes et de conseillers en communication. Ce qui n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 le jeu de massacre. Pendant six heures, les \u00e9lus l'ont bombard\u00e9 de questions souvent hostiles sur son projet de cryptomonnaie, la protection des donn\u00e9es et le degr\u00e9 d'infox qu'il tol\u00e9rait. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Pourrais-je, par exemple, diffuser des pubs sur Facebook contre des r\u00e9publicains disant qu'ils ont vot\u00e9 en faveur du Green New Deal [son projet de lutte contre le r\u00e9chauffement climatique] ? \"</emphasis>a demand\u00e9 la d\u00e9mocrate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Je ne sais pas la r\u00e9ponse de t\u00eate \",</emphasis>a r\u00e9pondu le patron de Facebook avant de l\u00e2cher : <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Je pense que oui, probablement. \" \" Le manque total de v\u00e9rification des pubs politiques est-il, \u00e0 votre avis, un probl\u00e8me potentiel ? \"</emphasis>a poursuivi la jeune femme. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Je pense qu'il n'est pas bien de mentir et de placer des pubs mensong\u00e8res,</emphasis>a-t-il r\u00e9torqu\u00e9, visiblement mal \u00e0 l'aise. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dans une d\u00e9mocratie, je crois que les gens devraient \u00eatre capables de voir par eux-m\u00eames ce que disent les hommes politiques et juger de leur caract\u00e8re. \" </emphasis>Jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, les autorit\u00e9s de r\u00e9glementation am\u00e9ricaines avaient fait preuve de beaucoup d'indulgence \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Gafam. Mais, \u00e0 mesure qu'ils s'emparent de pans entiers de l'\u00e9conomie, les plaintes se multiplient. Amazon, qui contr\u00f4le 50 % du commerce sur Internet, est accus\u00e9 de privil\u00e9gier les produits de sa marque sur sa plateforme au d\u00e9triment de ceux vendus par des tiers. Google, responsable de 92 % des recherches en ligne, favoriserait, lui aussi, ses services et abuserait, avec Facebook, de sa position dominante sur le march\u00e9 publicitaire. Quant \u00e0 Apple, on lui reproche de faire la pluie et le beau temps sur la s\u00e9lection des applications de sa boutique. Bien s\u00fbr, les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s rejettent ces accusations. Leurs services offrent de nombreux avantages aux utilisateurs et sont loin d'\u00eatre monopolistiques. La preuve ? Par exemple, Amazon n'occupe qu'une faible portion du secteur de la distribution.  5  milliards de dollarsC'est l'amende que la Federal Trade Commission a approuv\u00e9 en juillet. En septembre, c'est Google qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 170 millionsde dollars d'amende pour avoir recueilli, via YouTube, des informations priv\u00e9es sur des enfants destin\u00e9es \u00e0 les cibler avec des publicit\u00e9s.  Plaintes. Le 9 septembre, un groupe de procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux s'est donc retrouv\u00e9 devant la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e0 Washington. Un cadre th\u00e9\u00e2tral pour une d\u00e9claration fracassante. Les procureurs de cinquante Etats ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'ouvrir une enqu\u00eate sur Google. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Il y a des indices montrant, selon nous, que ses pratiques commerciales ont pu r\u00e9duire le choix du consommateur, \u00e9touffer l'innovation, violer la confidentialit\u00e9 \",</emphasis>a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Ken Paxton, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Texas. Ils ont \u00e9galement Facebook dans le collimateur. Et ils ne sont pas les seuls. Ces derniers mois, le minist\u00e8re de la Justice, la Federal Trade Commission (FTC, l'\u00e9quivalent de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r\u00e9pression des fraudes) et la Chambre des repr\u00e9sentants ont lanc\u00e9 une avalanche d'enqu\u00eates contre les Big Tech pour d\u00e9terminer s'il fallait restreindre leur influence et moderniser les lois antimonopole \u00e9crites \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des arri\u00e8re-arri\u00e8re-grands-parents de Zuckerberg.  Vont-elles aboutir ? Sur quoi ? Il est trop t\u00f4t pour le dire. Les Etats-Unis n'ont pas une Margrethe Vestager, la commissaire europ\u00e9enne \u00e0 la Concurrence. La FTC et le minist\u00e8re de la Justice sont \u00e0 couteaux tir\u00e9s, le Congr\u00e8s est paralys\u00e9 par les divisions. Une chose est s\u00fbre : on s'achemine vers des batailles juridiques \u00e9piques, longues et co\u00fbteuses. L'un des obstacles majeurs auxquels se heurtent les r\u00e9gulateurs, c'est l'ombre de Robert Bork. Ce juge conservateur, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 2012, a \u00e9crit en 1978 \" Le paradoxe de l'antitrust \", dans lequel il reproche \u00e0 la justice d'avoir fait preuve d'un interventionnisme excessif dans la lutte contre les monopoles, ce qui a nui \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie. Les juges, \u00e9crit ce chantre du laisser-faire, devraient se poser une seule question quand ils examinent un dossier antitrust : le consommateur est-il l\u00e9s\u00e9, en clair, son porte-monnaie souffre-t-il d'une hausse des prix ?  Cette interpr\u00e9tation tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite de la loi, devenue la doctrine des tribunaux, a limit\u00e9 le nombre de proc\u00e8s (entre 1970 et 1999, il y en avait en moyenne 15 par an, mais ce chiffre est tomb\u00e9 \u00e0 trois entre 2000 et 2014 et a favoris\u00e9 d'\u00e9normes fusions). La philosophie de Bork a notamment prot\u00e9g\u00e9 les Big Tech. Il est en effet difficile de prouver que le client est l\u00e9s\u00e9 lorsque Google et Facebook offrent des services gratuits et Amazon des produits bon march\u00e9. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Le seul fait qu'une entreprise grandit et innove plus que ses rivales ne conduit pas \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle a viol\u00e9 les lois antimonopole \",</emphasis>analyse Mark McCareins, professeur \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Northwestern.  Lobbying. Une conception anachronique \u00e0 l'\u00e8re d'Internet, r\u00e9torquent les critiques. Qui viennent de coins improbables. En juin, lors de la remise des dipl\u00f4mes \u00e0 l'ultralib\u00e9rale universit\u00e9 de Chicago, le professeur Luigi Zingales a exhort\u00e9 les \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 s'attaquer aux g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique comme les colons s'\u00e9taient battus contre la Compagnie britannique des Indes orientales lors de la Tea Party \u00e0 Boston. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Nos lois antitrust ne peuvent rien faire contre ce type de monopoles. Le monde a chang\u00e9 et in\u00e9vitablement la position de l'Ecole de Chicago doit changer aussi \",</emphasis>a-t-il d\u00e9clar\u00e9. R\u00e9cemment, le magazine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The American Conservative,</emphasis>avec des accents quasi marxistes, a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 Bork et sa <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" r\u00e9volution qui a sacrifi\u00e9 le petit producteur sur l'autel de l'efficacit\u00e9 et des produits bas de gamme \".</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Le mod\u00e8le europ\u00e9en montre que les tribunaux doivent adopter une perspective plus large sur ce qui constitue un comportement pernicieux pour le consommateur \", </emphasis>observe William Kovacic, un ancien pr\u00e9sident de la FTC.  Plus facile \u00e0 dire qu'\u00e0 faire. Outre l'hostilit\u00e9 des juges, les r\u00e9gulateurs sont confront\u00e9s \u00e0 de formidables adversaires. Ces cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les Gafam ont d\u00e9bours\u00e9 des sommes record en lobbying - plus de 55 millions de dollars en 2018. Cette ann\u00e9e, Amazon et Facebook arrivent en t\u00eate des entreprises am\u00e9ricaines qui ont d\u00e9pens\u00e9 le plus pour la d\u00e9fense de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, selon le Center for Responsive Politics. Elles arrosent les hommes politiques, financent les think tanks, organisent des conf\u00e9rences et font tout pour museler leurs critiques. Google aurait ainsi eu la peau d'un chercheur du New America : dans un article, il s'\u00e9tait f\u00e9licit\u00e9 des sanctions financi\u00e8res impos\u00e9es au groupe par les Europ\u00e9ens.  En d\u00e9cembre 2018, le PDG de Google, Sundar Pichai, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner au Congr\u00e8s sur ses pratiques lors d'une audition houleuse. Puis, dans la soir\u00e9e, il s'est rendu \u00e0 une grande r\u00e9ception de No\u00ebl organis\u00e9e par Google dans un restaurant du Wharf, un quartier branch\u00e9 de Washington. Il y avait l\u00e0 des centaines de membres de l'administration et tout le gotha politique, dont Darrell Issa, un parlementaire r\u00e9publicain qui, quelques heures plus t\u00f4t, l'avait questionn\u00e9 lors de l'audition.  63 %  des Am\u00e9ricains qui se d\u00e9clarent d\u00e9mocrates et 60 %de ceux qui se d\u00e9clarent r\u00e9publicains approuvent un peu ou fortement le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement des Big Tech par l'annulation de r\u00e9centes fusions, telle l'acquisition d'Instagram par Facebook, selon un sondage YouGov/Data For Progress de septembre 2019.  D\u00e9mant\u00e8lement. Amazon a choisi, lui, d'installer son second si\u00e8ge \u00e0 deux pas du Capitole. Jeff Bezos, son patron, a rachet\u00e9 le <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post</emphasis>, s'est offert une demeure \u00e0 23 millions de dollars voisine de celle des Obama et a embauch\u00e9 une centaine de lobbyistes, parmi lesquels un ancien responsable de la FTC, trois ex-\u00e9lus au Congr\u00e8s et un bailleur de fonds de Donald Trump. Mark Zuckerberg, lui, invite r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des conservateurs influents \u00e0 des d\u00eeners chez lui, dans ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Californie. Sans oublier l'Association Internet, l'organisation corporative qui a d\u00e9cern\u00e9 cette ann\u00e9e son prix de la libert\u00e9 sur Internet \u00e0... Ivanka Trump, la fille du pr\u00e9sident.  William Kovacic reste confiant. Le climat politique a chang\u00e9 et il voit se profiler dans les douze prochains mois plusieurs proc\u00e8s. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Les procureurs des Etats et des agences de r\u00e9glementation se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 agir avec ces enqu\u00eates et ne peuvent plus reculer. \" </emphasis>Reste \u00e0 savoir quelles solutions seront pr\u00e9conis\u00e9es. Les amendes ne sont pas efficaces, l'Europe l'a bien montr\u00e9. C'est pour cela qu'Elizabeth Warren appelle au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement. Amazon pourrait c\u00e9der sa cha\u00eene de supermarch\u00e9s Whole Foods ; Facebook, WhatsApp et Instagram ; Google, YouTube ; Apple sa boutique d'applis... Dans l'Histoire, les tentatives de scission sont pourtant rares et n'ont pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 couronn\u00e9es de succ\u00e8s. Le premier grand exemple, c'est la Standard Oil en 1911. L'entreprise de John Rockefeller avait, par toutes sortes de magouilles, r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9liminer ses rivaux et \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler 90 % du raffinage. On l'a oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 se scinder en 34 entit\u00e9s. En 1982, AT-T, qui d\u00e9tenait un monopole sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, a \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9 \u00e0 son tour en 7 groupes. Cette d\u00e9cision au terme de huit ans de proc\u00e9dure a donn\u00e9 un coup de fouet \u00e0 la concurrence et \u00e0 l'apparition, et a permis l'\u00e9mergence, disent certains, de la t\u00e9l\u00e9phonie mobile.  Les trois plus grandes firmes vis\u00e9es par la loi antitrustScission. La Silicon Valley s'int\u00e9resse plut\u00f4t au cas Microsoft. En 1998, le minist\u00e8re de la Justice et une vingtaine d'Etats intentent une action contre le num\u00e9ro un mondial du logiciel, accus\u00e9 de favoriser son navigateur, Internet Explorer, aux d\u00e9pens de celui de Netscape. Condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre coup\u00e9 en deux, Microsoft fait appel et \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la scission. Il devra toutefois se soumettre \u00e0 des restrictions, qui, de l'avis de nombreux experts, ont favoris\u00e9 l'\u00e9mergence des Gafam. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Il est fort douteux que Google soit devenu dominant dans un monde o\u00f9 Microsoft pouvait dicter le type de moteur de recherche utilis\u00e9 dans chaque ordinateur de la plan\u00e8te \",</emphasis>estime Tim Wu, auteur de \" La mal\u00e9diction de la grande taille \".  A d\u00e9faut de d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement, les pouvoirs publics vont probablement contr\u00f4ler de plus pr\u00e8s les fusions et les rachats. Facebook a effectu\u00e9 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" 67 acquisitions sans opposition, Amazon 91 et Google 214 \",</emphasis>a calcul\u00e9 Tim Wu. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" Il est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e9galement de mettre en place des r\u00e8gles et des lois sp\u00e9cifiques pour promouvoir la concurrence, car les lois antimonopole ne sont pas suffisantes \",</emphasis>ajoute Charlotte Slaiman, du groupe Public Knowledge. Parmi les mesures envisag\u00e9es, une nouvelle entit\u00e9 de r\u00e9glementation num\u00e9rique, l'interdiction \u00e0 une plateforme de vendre des produits sous sa marque, l'obligation pour les Big Tech de rendre leurs services interop\u00e9rables, en clair qu'il soit possible d'acc\u00e9der aux photos de ses copains sur Instagram sans quitter Snapchat.  En 1890, le s\u00e9nateur Sherman, auteur de la premi\u00e8re loi antitrust, d\u00e9clarait au Congr\u00e8s : les monopoles sont <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\" incompatibles avec notre forme de gouvernement. Si nous ne supportons pas un roi comme puissance politique, nous ne devrions pas supporter de voir un roi r\u00e9gner sur la production, les transports et le commerce. \"</emphasis>L'Am\u00e9rique n'a pas de roi mais elle a les Gafam </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LPOINT-2464361132338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LPOINT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH2-79N1-JCMD-P50V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266080</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Point Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Point</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19709\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>14 Novembre 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

(Halifax International Security Forum) On Nov. 18, Jonathan Tepperman, Foreign Policy's editor in chief, interviewed Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet (Google's parent company), at the Halifax International Security Forum. Video of the full interview is embedded below. </p><p>The following excerpt of the conversation has been edited for grammar and length. Jonathan Tepperman: British Prime Minister Theresa May recently lashed out at tech companies like Google, claiming that you weren't doing enough to counter violent extremism online. Just this week, the New York Times reported that YouTube, which Google owns, is finally taking down videos featuring Anwar al-Awlaki, the famous, now-deceased ISIS recruiter. What took you so long? And what are Google and Alphabet's other divisions doing to fight extremism and fake news? Eric Schmidt: All democratic countries are facing these challenges together, and the tech industry is also facing these challenges together. We are aware of them, we understand them, and we're working on them. With regard to YouTube, there have been cases where people have uploaded things that violate our terms of service or things that have been used incorrectly. We have very, very detailed terms of service, and after enough people mention [a problematic post], we typically look at it and decide. In this case, I think it was fairly clear. Perhaps it was overdue. Ten years ago, I thought that everyone would be able to deal with the internet because we all knew the internet was full of falsehoods as well as truths. Crazy people, crazy ideas, and so forth. But the new data show that [bad] actors that are trying to either spread misinformation or worse have figured out how to use that information for their own good, whether it's by amplifying a message or repeating something 100 times so people actually believe it even though it's obviously false. My own view is that these patterns can be detected, and they can be taken down or deprioritized. One of the problems in the industry is that we came from a naive position that these actors would not be so active. But now, faced with the data and what we've seen from Russia in 2016 and with other actors around the world, we have to act. [embedded content] JT: Say a little bit more about how companies like yours help fight fake news and violent extremism \u2014 and what you can do that governments can't. ES: Well, the first thing is that Alphabet created a company called Jigsaw, whose primary purpose is to analyze and pursue these issues. And the first project that Jigsaw did was to study violent extremism and the use or misuse of information. We also have internal groups that watch for this kind of amplification and manipulation of information and then try to deal with it. The most important thing that we can do is make sure that as the other side gets more automated, we also are more automated. Much of what Russia did [during the election] was largely manual. [But] you can imagine that the next round will be much more automated. JT: How do you think about the fact that you're inevitably becoming more aggressive in determining what people can and can't see? ES: We started with the American view that, in a crowded network, bad speech will be replaced by good speech. But that may no longer be true in certain situations, especially when you have a well-funded opponent who's trying to actively spread information. What everybody's grappling with is, where is the line? Everyone has an opinion. Nations have relatively broad definitions of where the line is, and [if you cross them], you're then subject to sanction, regulation, courts, and so forth. For example, the European Court of Justice has passed a rule that, under certain situations, when we're asked, we're required to take down personal information about people who are not public figures and not materially relevant to the conversation. But [the court] didn't define those two terms. If you're going to regulate that particular thing, you better be prepared to define it or figure out who's going to make that decision. We've found ourselves having to make that decision. I think we've done a really good job at it. But you could imagine an educated critic disagreeing. JT: You made headlines about two weeks ago by suggesting that the U.S. risks losing the race for artificial intelligence to China. What is the state of the competition today, and why is China such a threat? ES: The rise of China will be the big news for the rest of our lives. And I mean that in an economic, cultural, structural sense. China's artificial intelligence machine-learning policy, which I've actually read, says that they're behind us right now, but by 2020, they'll be caught up; by 2025, they'll be ahead of all of us; and by 2030, they will dominate. These are their words. There is no equivalent document that I can find in the United States, which invented most of this (along with Canada). And remember the Chinese have enormous resources in terms of smart people, educated technical folks, and a will to implement this. JT: But we have all those things, too. ES: They have more. They appear to have five times more [people] by math, and I'm very impressed by the quality of their work. JT: Is part of the equation that you didn't mention the role that the government plays there versus the role the government does or doesn't play here? ES: The Chinese model is very much government-driven, central planning-driven. There's lots of money and investment. They also don't have the kinds of privacy and data restriction rules that you would expect in a democracy. On the other hand, in our system, you have a thousand flowers running around, you have all sorts of new innovation from different things, you have a pro-immigration policy with respect to technical people (recently under threat). You have lots of reasons to think the United States, Canada, the Western world, can respond well. JT: You are a strong proponent of the value of AI. Others are less sanguine. We all know the risks that AI poses to jobs. But tell us how AI is going to transform international security. Do we all need to fear the coming of the killer robots? ES: Well, I think we've all seen those movies, and it's important to remind people that those are movies. Let's talk a little bit about where we are. Right now, the technology of artificial intelligence and machine learning is largely focused on very powerful pattern matching. The impact that it's going to have on society is probably first and most importantly in health care. Think about what doctors do. A lot of doctors are using intuition and their eyes. Literally examining what they see, reasoning, looking at patterns, and so forth. Those abilities that humans have are very well augmented. This is a case of doctor-plus. Not doctor-minus \u2014 doctor-plus. For the next five years, that's going be the big narrative. The other big narrative is the ability to use large data sets of information to find hidden cues of one kind or another, as well as finding patterns. Computers are very, very good at looking at very deep patterns that humans don't see. I'll give you an example. When you ask people what they'd like a robot to do, the thing that they'd like more than anything else is [for it to] clean up the dishes in the kitchen. That is literally the No. 1 request. That turns out to be an extraordinarily difficult problem \u2014 and why? Well, think about what it requires. You have to walk into the situation. You have to access where things are. You have to identify everything. You have to remember where it goes. You have to move in an appropriate way. And you have to do all this in real time. So it's much more likely that computers will be understood as savants, helping humans see deeper, plan deeper. My hope is that in 10-15 years you'll have physicists who will ask the computer a question, a deep physics question, and while they're sleeping, the computer will do an analysis of all of the papers, read them all, and come up with some other scenarios for this physicist to start to think about. JT: I still want to hear about the killer robots that you guys are working on. ES: In fact, we have a policy against building killer robots, so we're clear. JT: Tell us a bit more about how you see AI starting to affect major security issues in the not-too-distant future. ES: There's a movie where there's a drone swarm that's autonomously directed, gets released, and overwhelms the opponent. Now, what's the technology behind that? Well, today in universities in the United States, we already have autonomous drone swarms that we can demonstrate. You throw them all up, and they self-configure and figure out where they're going using principles derived from the animal world. You can imagine the implications there. My observation about the military is that it spends most of its time watching things. Well, humans get really bored watching the same thing, especially if it doesn't change. Computers don't. So a simple example of how this can be used is to improve the ability to detect changes. JT: Over the years, Google has taken on an increasing number of jobs traditionally done by governments. One recent example is Project Loon, under which Google's X deployed a number of high-tech balloons to Puerto Rico in order to supply internet connections that the federal government and the Puerto Rico government haven't been able to restore. As Google takes on more of these quasi-governmental functions, how should its relationship with government change? And how will Google balance its obligations to the public versus its obligations to its shareholders? ES: We celebrate that we're run under a set of principles. We stipulated this right from the beginning of going public, and we feel very strongly about it. Something like the Loon initiative has nothing to do with revenue. It has everything to do with making the world a better place. In Puerto Rico, for example, the government and telecom companies welcomed us. As long as we're on that side of these issues, we're going be just fine. JT: But what can the public do to ensure that Google does stay on the right side of these issues? ES: Well, you have a Congress, a president, laws, regulations, and so forth. We operate under the laws of every country we operate in, and we operate in pretty much every country. JT: What is the big tech-related security issue that none of us are thinking about right now and that we need to start thinking about? ES: One is the development of quantum computing and how that changes everything. Another is the rise of autonomy and its implications. Another is the fact that, from a military perspective, we're getting to a point where there's no place to hide assets. But the biggest problem is the fact that there's a generation of young people, a new set of brains and talent, that democracies need to get in their organizations at the national level, at the military level, at the NGO level, at the think tank level. The talent is there, but I have a feeling that they're not coming to you. Figure out a way to make your situations, which have very interesting problems, attractive, and you'll be in a much stronger position. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FOPO1330891511274072851251764500241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOPO-133089</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R0Y-46N1-JCMN-Y3GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1914\"/><timeReceived>2:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Foreign Policy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 21, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So, out of the blue and because of the coronavirus pandemic, several Chileans had to test for the first time the experience of telework (also called remote work or home office), a modality that in the US and Europe has years of use, but that in Chile is still found in diapers.</p><p><br/>But there is interest in this modality. According to Google Trends, a tool that reflects the degree of google searches, Chilean users began to become aware of the new situation just this weekend, being the Metropolitan, Valparaiso, Magellan, O'Higgins and Maule regions who searched the related terms the most. The most recurrent queries in this case have to do with their implementation, the bill, and \"slack\", one of the most used tools in the business environment.<br/>The same points to a 2018 study in which from 33 countries, Chile was the second in which people expected to do their work from home, with 74% of preferences.<br/>Another scenario is mobile applications. Both Apple and Android iOS downloads include apps related to communication, meetings, and collaborative work, with platforms such as Zoom Cloud Meetings, Microsoft Teams, and Google's Meet hangouts as most required by Users.<br/>In the face of the expansion of the virus, this mode of work became the most effective measure to protect the health of workers, although those who want to implement it are still on time.<br/>Telework to the Chilean<br/>\"Telework is work,\" says Cristian Salazar, PhD in Information and Knowledge Society and academic at the Universidad Austral de Chile.<br/>For the expert, \"access to work is democratized, implies a cultural change in the employment relationship and how it is exercised. The low spread of these experiences in Chile has generated a number of myths, such as foreseing workers' rights, which involves working less, and that worker productivity will fall if they do not have direct supervision.\"<br/>\"It is not a profession, but a way of developing a task and requires a cultural reorganization for its efficient application. Culturally it has been difficult to change the ingrained concept of work, which is associated with a displacement action. Today we are facing a paradigm shift from 'going to work' vs 'doing it' anytime, anywhere,\" he adds.<br/>\"Therefore, both in schools and higher education centers we must educate the new generations that thanks to new technologies you can work from your own home ending the traditional concept: to work you need to be physically in the Company. Both teleworkers and organizations must be convinced that a teleworker can be so or more efficient and productive working at home,\" he says.<br/>Legal obstacles<br/>In this regard, Salazar comments that \"one of the major obstacles that companies have reported is that in the current legal order there are no provisions governing the telework contract in a special way. In 2017 thanks to the Labor Reform, Art.22 was modified excluded from the limitation of working hours who work without direct supervision, being able to provide their services in their own home, outside the place or site of operation of the company, using computer or telecommunications means. So too, with this Reformation, those companies thathave a trade union membership equal to or greater than 30% of all their workers, their trade unions may agree with the employer on special working conditions, among which it may be telework.\"<br/>Government to urgently provide telework project and SME grants are studied<br/>\"The non-existence of a law - as other Latin American countries do - that provides a regulatory framework that regulates the aspects of the contract of employment, rights, obligations and guarantees for both workers and organizations that adopt this modality, creates a fear in legally adopting the modality,\" he says.<br/>Pros and cons<br/>For the expert of the Universidad Austral, given the geographical characteristics of Chile, telework could help decongest big cities and allow people to work in the place of their choice to live and start a family: \"Working there, live here and spend here,\" he says.<br/>\"Telework would decentralize large cities, and regions would stop losing talents that migrate to large cities where there are more job and development opportunities.\"<br/>\"Chile is a highly seismic country and having telework plans can ensure the economic sustainability of families and the operational continuity of companies that pay tax to the economy and society. Cultural change can transform us into a country that takes over new technologies by improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. Boosting telework will create new sources of jobs and new services that support the lives of teleworkers,\" he says.<br/>Transition<br/>According to Randstad Chile, following the announcement of the first case of coronavirus in the country, only 22% of companies adopted health safety policies against COVID-19, the most widely used being the dissemination of information on symptoms and good practices, followed by the execution of healthcare protocols, and restriction of business travel. Remote work was in the last places, being in fact one of the most effective solutions; around the world, ways are being sought to implement them quickly and strategically, with a particular focus on companies that are not prepared.<br/>Ricardo Quezada Botto, Commercial Manager of Unnio Seguros Generales, notes that \"thinking about the benefit of all, the first thing that happens in these cases is for companies to activate their contingency plans associated with disease threats or pandemic, focused on prevent contagion, support those who become infected and ensure continuity of business. The safest way to do this is through technology, using customer self-attention channels and working remotely in the face of the high risk of contagion.\"<br/>Like any new process, this involves different challenges or insecurities in the face of transition. \"The key is for the company to prepare technologically so that each of its employees is able to deliver the same value proposition to customers without affecting quality. A key is to transition slowly, testing through a schedule of days when you work from outside the office,\" he says.<br/>Quezada ensures that when the work support becomes the technology, it should be prepared in terms of security, considering that those working remotely will be using home internet connections, who are more vulnerable to attacks Cyber. In Unnio they claim to use Cyberboxx, a technology platform that is used in these cases to monitor and respond to any cyberattack.<br/>Generational Gap\"This way of working is opposed to a workforce in the country accustomed to office hours. A study by Adecco revealed that only 28% of workers had facilities to work from home, while 72% said they did not have this benefit during the days of greatest conflict associated with the country's social awakening,\" says Mario Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, CEO of Zenta Group.\"Chile, the fifth country with the most hours of work and lower productivity according to the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures, has very low labour flexibility. The concept of home office appears only in a few companies, although the path goes there: in most cases, you only need a computer, a good internet connection and a cell phone to get the job done.\"According to Guillermo Beuchat, founding partner of Transforme, there are also generational factors for this adoption. \"The concerns of each generation are diverse. they live in the same business context, sharing responsibilities and tasks, but moved by different motivations, desires and attitudes to work and life challenges.\"\"Baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, and who account for just over 25% of the workforce, show high levels of dedication and loyalty to the company, but they are uncomfortable with technology, and contradict 'the system'. For its part, Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980 who add up to 35% of the workforce, have good skills for teamwork, focus on developing their expertise, always prioritizing family-work balance, and show openness to adopt Technologies. The so-called Millennials, born between the 80s and 2000s, have given much to talk about. This group is characterized as one detached to the norms and highly nonconformist, but with strong digital skills and autonomy that make them desirable in companies. Finally, Generation Z, born after 2000, has a much more optimistic attitude and are engaged in collective action. Their multitasking capabilities and quasi-technology addiction contribute a lot to the business context, but require other generations to give them proper supervision and guidance at work. These last two generations already account for 41% of the workforce.\"Tips<br/>But telework isn't just about taking the computer and working from home. Claudio Torres, Regional Manager of D-Link, states that \"the adoption of remote work requires companies to consider basic technical aspects, such as the quality of internet connection that employees have in their homes\".<br/>\"It is important for organizations to accept that it cannot be done from home the same thing that is done in the office. There will be tasks that can be removed and others that will have to be redefined or adjusted according to the new conditions,\" he explains.<br/>When working from home, the main recommendation is to enable a space dedicated to this activity, similar to what is advised in the case of students, in order to limit distractions. The D-Link expert also highlights the relevance of stable and quality Wi-Fi connectivity.<br/>\"It is relevant to understand that in our homes the connection is shared, this means that normal data traffic will be affected by simultaneous use among household members. For example, work-related video conferencing can be impacted by the use of streaming platforms, or by students' virtual classes,\"Torres explains.<br/>Finally, the expert warns about the importance of maintaining digital security standards in employees' homes. \"Businesses should understand that it is not only enough for workers to have a laptop that they can bring to their homes, they must also ensure that people have the tools to establish secure connections to the resources of the company,\" he says.<br/>In this sense, from ESET Latin America, a cybersecurity company, they share recommendations so that the organization can stay productive and safe at the same time. \"It is important to note that companies and organizations must also prepare themselves and their employees to face the risks associated with cybersecurity with remote work,\" says Camilo Gutierrez, Head of the Research Laboratory of ESET Latin America.<br/>- Physical security of the company's devices: As long as the employees do not take into account the security measures, they will be exposing the company's devices to an increased risk. Devices must be protected against loss and theft.<br/>- Home technology environment: Ideally audit the vulnerabilities of the home environment before connecting the work devices, this is an excellent time to take steps to secure them with strong passwords and updating both the firmware like the software to the latest versions available.<br/>- Access to the company's network and systems: Both cloud-based email and internal information, workers need access to the organization's network, but with all available security measures.<br/>- Collaborative tools and authorization processes: Use collaborative tools to protect against unauthorized instructions or transactions. Cybercriminals are likely to take the opportunity to launch email attacks through a fake message, listed as urgent, requesting immediate transfer of funds, without the ability to validate the request in person.<br/>- Training: There are numerous scams circulating that use the topic about COVID-19 in different ways. Computer security awareness training is often an annual requirement in offices, and it would be prudent to review to help prevent human error that cybercriminals seek.<br/>- Crisis support and management: In the rush to provide remote access, not sacrifice cybersecurity or the ability to manage systems and devices.<br/>Contingency plan<br/>What are big tech companies doing to adapt to telecom/or<br/>Ana Karina Ulloa, People Director of Movistar Chile, mentions that her company has more than two years of experience in the progressive adoption of remote work. \"In 2019, 60% of employees adopted this modality, while today more than 80% of our employees work from home at least one day a week,\" he says.<br/>\"In the face of the current situation by Covid-19, we wanted to take an additional step in this new way of working, putting the health and integrity of our employees first. Progressively, we started our action plan, prioritizing risk groups (people over 60 years of age, pregnant, chronic or immunocompromised), who were the first to start remote work in this context. Subsequently, from Monday, many parents joined the care of their children - whose classes have been suspended - favoring not only theprotect their health, but also parental co-responsibility and work and personal reconciliation.\"<br/>\"As of Tuesday, we have privileged the remote work for all our employees, whose functions allow it, favoring the social isolation recommended by the health authorities, thus taking all the care and precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus,\" he adds, ensuring that in relation to the tools, they use Office 365, Teams and Workplace.<br/>Something similar happens in Samsung Chile, from where they claim that one of their own tools, Knox Mobile, is very useful with companies and workers in mind. The system separates the work and personal areas of the user into the same mobile device, with the aim of accessing the corporate network from outside their office, but keeping all sensitive information safe.<br/>According to the company, it is basically the same security principle that applies on all Samsung smartphones, but carried to the corporate level. For example, today a Galaxy S20 or any device on the same line is already protected with Knox, meaning that it already has a mobile security platform at the processor and software level. However, with Knox Mobile for Business, companies can install and manage all Android corporate devices to their system at once, defining different criteria for access to information for each geolocation-based contributor, type of information and role.<br/>\"Although the company uses this service permanently for those who need it, in the current context it is being used more due to work flexibility policies for health prevention. In addition to implementing all possible preventive measures in their offices, high-risk groups (people over 60 years of age, with chronic diseases, pregnant women) and people living with this group, mothers or parents with children in suspended classes, among others, they can access to work remotely thanks to a VPN connection and Knox Mobile,\" says Bernardita Orellana, Communications Manager of Samsung Electronics Chile.<br/>From Claro Chile they say that all the necessary technical measures are being taken to keep the network services operational and that users can remain connected at all times. Alfonso Emperanza, director of Claro, explained that from Thursday they will only open some branches to respond to the most urgent needs of customers. \"Shift systems will be applied to reduce the number of executives and telework has been encouraged for a significant percentage of the company. Only those who are key to maintaining the connectivity of millions of Chileans will work in person. These measures aim to prevent and protect employees and their families, in order to help prevent the spread of the pandemic,\" he says.<br/>Ariela Mendel, Marketing Manager of ASUS Chile, says that since this Tuesday all workers are at home 100% remotely, and even the company prepared before installing compatible systems for this purpose. \"To continue working remotely, it is essential to make the most of the tools provided by the technology. In this way, we help to avoid possible contagion, taking care of our health and that of those around us,\" he says.<br/>\"In these circumstances of isolation, communication with other co-workers and meetings with clients are still very necessary. To hold meetings remotely, there are several tools that facilitate contact such as Skype, Hangouts, Zoom Meeting and MicrosoftTeams. Applications like MyAsus also boost performance and allow you to connect your computer with other electronic devices like your mobile phone, so you can control them without having them in front of you,\" he says.<br/>From Google in terms of its collaborative tools G Suite, which allows you to develop the work thanks to products such as Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Classroom, Hangouts Meets, Hangouts Chat and G Suite for Education, in addition to implementing free access to Hangouts Meet's advanced video conferencing capabilities for all G Suite and G Suite for Education customers worldwide through July 1, 2020. Resources are also being added to support increased demand for live public streaming on YouTube, and reveal that they have seen greater interest in affected regions as people seek to virtually connect with their communities when they are not you can do it in person.<br/>\"As COVID-19 evolves in Latin America, seeking caution and in order to prioritize health and safety, we are offering our employees in the region the option to work from home,\" says Alejandra Bonati, Communications Manager Google Chile.<br/>Online meeting apps<br/>One of the most commonly used apps these days is Microsoft Teams, center for teamwork at Microsoft 365 where teams can chat, meet, make calls, and collaborate in a safe place. According to the company, since the end of January there has been a 500 percent increase in its use, as well as a 200% increase in the use of the platform from mobile devices. It will be free during the COVID-19 outbreak.<br/>How is it used?<br/>Individuals: Anyone can register for the freemium version of Teams from this link, or if they have a work or school email account, they can register from this link.<br/>If you work in the education industry and want teachers, students, and administrators ready to use Teams, use Office 365 A1, a free version of Office 365 available to all schools. They can register from this link.<br/>Webex: A solution that provides a set of software and video tools that deliver a secure, reliable, and on-demand collaboration experience on the web.

Multiple data privacy and election-related scandals at various tech companies and a new political strategy of being tough on \u201cBig Tech\u201d have led to the phenomenon known as \u201ctechlash.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, in 2018, the Financial Times used that term to summarize \u201cthe year in a word.\u201d And the hits just keep on coming: in 2019 and this year, we\u2019ve continued to see even more calls to regulate technology and tech companies \u2014 with antitrust suits, congressional hearings and bad bills galore.</p><p> But as the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic sinks in, that desperately needs to change.</p><p> One of the major tools keeping us afloat right now is, of course, technology. Not every job can be performed remotely, and many brave people are going to work every day to keep the economy and the country from collapsing. However, a significant number of businesses, and even entire industries, have been able to move online. Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and other helpful remote tools have made this transition possible, though, admittedly, it hasn\u2019t always been smooth.</p><p> Remote work isn\u2019t the only area of our lives being sustained by technology during this period. Many churches are hosting their services online, and most schools and universities have switched to online classes for the rest of March \u2014 some even until the end of the semester. Political nominees are holding virtual town halls. Even AA meetings and therapy sessions are going digital.</p><p> It should bring us hope to see how society is adapting in all these spheres, desperate to persevere in the face of great odds. Tech, too, is being utilized for philanthropic purposes. Groups on social media platforms are forming to provide help to those in need and coordinate volunteer efforts.</p><p> As Fred Rogers said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Technology has made it much easier to connect those helpers now.</p><p> Tech companies have also stepped up to the plate to try to help mitigate the crisis and its impact on the economy.</p><p> First and foremost, social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) as well as hardware and software providers (like Microsoft and Apple) are actively combating misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p> For instance, Google removed thousands of videos that spread false reports about the coronavirus, and Apple\u2019s App Store team issued new guidance for health apps developers. Facebook has also been aggressively removing false content and promoting official, trustworthy accounts. Many of the big and small companies are also working around the clock and adding critical updates to their interfaces in coordination with health authorities.</p><p> Furthermore,\u201cBig Tech,\u201d hated as it is, has been busy creating and protecting jobs amid the crisis, since the economy is relying much more heavily on e-commerce.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is hiring 100,000 more people and raising employees\u2019 pay, and Microsoft is continuing to pay its hourly workers (like shuttle drivers, cafeteria staff) their regular pay \u2014 even though there has been a reduced need for their services as many employees begin working from home.</p><p> Gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft have followed suit, offering two-week compensation to their drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with COVID-19. And Facebook announced a $100 million program that will give cash grants and ad credit to small businesses impacted by coronavirus. E-commerce powerhouses like Ebay, and again, Amazon, prohibited price gouging when some tried to use their platforms to sell necessities like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and toilet paper for outrageous prices.</p><p> Compared to all the previous pandemics in world history, there\u2019s a new powerful tool in humanity\u2019s hands \u2014 artificial intelligence.</p><p> As health experts work round the clock to stem the crisis, tech leaders have launched a database with copious amounts of scientific articles in an effort to help the scientific community around the globe in its research.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind division, for instance, is sharing all the findings and progress in studying COVID-19 that its algorithms are making. And the White House has called on artificial intelligence (AI) experts to help them connect the dots.</p><p> As the world does its part in fighting off the worst pandemic in our lifetime, technology, tech companies and the people behind them are the game changers.</p><p> Representatives of the broader tech industry were the first ones the White House ran to for help.</p><p> Will lawmakers and many policy experts revert back to their routine \u201cbreaking up big tech\u201d rhetoric after the crisis is over?</p><p> Only time will tell.</p><p> Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Young Voices contributor, Internet Law and Policy Fellow at the IP Foundry and an expert at the Federalist Society\u2019s Emerging Technology Working Group, part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDLNDF-4749831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896158A443F3F RDLNDF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-G5B1-JBCN-4227-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429766</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Multiple data privacy and election-related scandals at various tech companies and a new political strategy of being tough on \u201cBig Tech\u201d have led to the phenomenon known as \u201ctechlash.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, in 2018, the Financial Times used that term to summarize \u201cthe year in a word.\u201d And the hits just keep on coming: in 2019 and this year, we\u2019ve continued to see even more calls to regulate technology and tech companies \u2014 with antitrust suits, congressional hearings and bad bills galore.</p><p> But as the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic sinks in, that desperately needs to change.</p><p> One of the major tools keeping us afloat right now is, of course, technology. Not every job can be performed remotely, and many brave people are going to work every day to keep the economy and the country from collapsing. However, a significant number of businesses, and even entire industries, have been able to move online. Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and other helpful remote tools have made this transition possible, though, admittedly, it hasn\u2019t always been smooth.</p><p> Remote work isn\u2019t the only area of our lives being sustained by technology during this period. Many churches are hosting their services online, and most schools and universities have switched to online classes for the rest of March \u2014 some even until the end of the semester. Political nominees are holding virtual town halls. Even AA meetings and therapy sessions are going digital.</p><p> It should bring us hope to see how society is adapting in all these spheres, desperate to persevere in the face of great odds. Tech, too, is being utilized for philanthropic purposes. Groups on social media platforms are forming to provide help to those in need and coordinate volunteer efforts.</p><p> As Fred Rogers said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Technology has made it much easier to connect those helpers now.</p><p> Tech companies have also stepped up to the plate to try to help mitigate the crisis and its impact on the economy.</p><p> First and foremost, social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) as well as hardware and software providers (like Microsoft and Apple) are actively combating misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p> For instance, Google removed thousands of videos that spread false reports about the coronavirus, and Apple\u2019s App Store team issued new guidance for health apps developers. Facebook has also been aggressively removing false content and promoting official, trustworthy accounts. Many of the big and small companies are also working around the clock and adding critical updates to their interfaces in coordination with health authorities.</p><p> Furthermore,\u201cBig Tech,\u201d hated as it is, has been busy creating and protecting jobs amid the crisis, since the economy is relying much more heavily on e-commerce.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is hiring 100,000 more people and raising employees\u2019 pay, and Microsoft is continuing to pay its hourly workers (like shuttle drivers, cafeteria staff) their regular pay \u2014 even though there has been a reduced need for their services as many employees begin working from home.</p><p> Gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft have followed suit, offering two-week compensation to their drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with COVID-19. And Facebook announced a $100 million program that will give cash grants and ad credit to small businesses impacted by coronavirus. E-commerce powerhouses like Ebay, and again, Amazon, prohibited price gouging when some tried to use their platforms to sell necessities like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and toilet paper for outrageous prices.</p><p> Compared to all the previous pandemics in world history, there\u2019s a new powerful tool in humanity\u2019s hands \u2014 artificial intelligence.</p><p> As health experts work round the clock to stem the crisis, tech leaders have launched a database with copious amounts of scientific articles in an effort to help the scientific community around the globe in its research.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind division, for instance, is sharing all the findings and progress in studying COVID-19 that its algorithms are making. And the White House has called on artificial intelligence (AI) experts to help them connect the dots.</p><p> As the world does its part in fighting off the worst pandemic in our lifetime, technology, tech companies and the people behind them are the game changers.</p><p> Representatives of the broader tech industry were the first ones the White House ran to for help.</p><p> Will lawmakers and many policy experts revert back to their routine \u201cbreaking up big tech\u201d rhetoric after the crisis is over?</p><p> Only time will tell.</p><p> Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Young Voices contributor, Internet Law and Policy Fellow at the IP Foundry and an expert at the Federalist Society\u2019s Emerging Technology Working Group, part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WHITDY-4749918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289616D9A77F6F WHITDY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-YC91-JBCN-43JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279931</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Multiple data privacy and election-related scandals at various tech companies and a new political strategy of being tough on \u201cBig Tech\u201d have led to the phenomenon known as \u201ctechlash.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, in 2018, the Financial Times used that term to summarize \u201cthe year in a word.\u201d And the hits just keep on coming: in 2019 and this year, we\u2019ve continued to see even more calls to regulate technology and tech companies \u2014 with antitrust suits, congressional hearings and bad bills galore.</p><p> But as the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic sinks in, that desperately needs to change.</p><p> One of the major tools keeping us afloat right now is, of course, technology. Not every job can be performed remotely, and many brave people are going to work every day to keep the economy and the country from collapsing. However, a significant number of businesses, and even entire industries, have been able to move online. Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and other helpful remote tools have made this transition possible, though, admittedly, it hasn\u2019t always been smooth.</p><p> Remote work isn\u2019t the only area of our lives being sustained by technology during this period. Many churches are hosting their services online, and most schools and universities have switched to online classes for the rest of March \u2014 some even until the end of the semester. Political nominees are holding virtual town halls. Even AA meetings and therapy sessions are going digital.</p><p> It should bring us hope to see how society is adapting in all these spheres, desperate to persevere in the face of great odds. Tech, too, is being utilized for philanthropic purposes. Groups on social media platforms are forming to provide help to those in need and coordinate volunteer efforts.</p><p> As Fred Rogers said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Technology has made it much easier to connect those helpers now.</p><p> Tech companies have also stepped up to the plate to try to help mitigate the crisis and its impact on the economy.</p><p> First and foremost, social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) as well as hardware and software providers (like Microsoft and Apple) are actively combating misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p> For instance, Google removed thousands of videos that spread false reports about the coronavirus, and Apple\u2019s App Store team issued new guidance for health apps developers. Facebook has also been aggressively removing false content and promoting official, trustworthy accounts. Many of the big and small companies are also working around the clock and adding critical updates to their interfaces in coordination with health authorities.</p><p> Furthermore,\u201cBig Tech,\u201d hated as it is, has been busy creating and protecting jobs amid the crisis, since the economy is relying much more heavily on e-commerce.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is hiring 100,000 more people and raising employees\u2019 pay, and Microsoft is continuing to pay its hourly workers (like shuttle drivers, cafeteria staff) their regular pay \u2014 even though there has been a reduced need for their services as many employees begin working from home.</p><p> Gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft have followed suit, offering two-week compensation to their drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with COVID-19. And Facebook announced a $100 million program that will give cash grants and ad credit to small businesses impacted by coronavirus. E-commerce powerhouses like Ebay, and again, Amazon, prohibited price gouging when some tried to use their platforms to sell necessities like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and toilet paper for outrageous prices.</p><p> Compared to all the previous pandemics in world history, there\u2019s a new powerful tool in humanity\u2019s hands \u2014 artificial intelligence.</p><p> As health experts work round the clock to stem the crisis, tech leaders have launched a database with copious amounts of scientific articles in an effort to help the scientific community around the globe in its research.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind division, for instance, is sharing all the findings and progress in studying COVID-19 that its algorithms are making. And the White House has called on artificial intelligence (AI) experts to help them connect the dots.</p><p> As the world does its part in fighting off the worst pandemic in our lifetime, technology, tech companies and the people behind them are the game changers.</p><p> Representatives of the broader tech industry were the first ones the White House ran to for help.</p><p> Will lawmakers and many policy experts revert back to their routine \u201cbreaking up big tech\u201d rhetoric after the crisis is over?</p><p> Only time will tell.</p><p> Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Young Voices contributor, Internet Law and Policy Fellow at the IP Foundry and an expert at the Federalist Society\u2019s Emerging Technology Working Group, part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LAD-4749761</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABB72645A7AC LAD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-G5B1-JBCN-41VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157105</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Digital First Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily News of Los Angeles</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 29, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Multiple data privacy and election-related scandals at various tech companies and a new political strategy of being tough on \u201cBig Tech\u201d have led to the phenomenon known as \u201ctechlash.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, in 2018, the Financial Times used that term to summarize \u201cthe year in a word.\u201d And the hits just keep on coming: in 2019 and this year, we\u2019ve continued to see even more calls to regulate technology and tech companies \u2014 with antitrust suits, congressional hearings and bad bills galore.</p><p> But as the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic sinks in, that desperately needs to change.</p><p> One of the major tools keeping us afloat right now is, of course, technology. Not every job can be performed remotely, and many brave people are going to work every day to keep the economy and the country from collapsing. However, a significant number of businesses, and even entire industries, have been able to move online. Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and other helpful remote tools have made this transition possible, though, admittedly, it hasn\u2019t always been smooth.</p><p> Remote work isn\u2019t the only area of our lives being sustained by technology during this period. Many churches are hosting their services online, and most schools and universities have switched to online classes for the rest of March \u2014 some even until the end of the semester. Political nominees are holding virtual town halls. Even AA meetings and therapy sessions are going digital.</p><p> It should bring us hope to see how society is adapting in all these spheres, desperate to persevere in the face of great odds. Tech, too, is being utilized for philanthropic purposes. Groups on social media platforms are forming to provide help to those in need and coordinate volunteer efforts.</p><p> As Fred Rogers said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Technology has made it much easier to connect those helpers now.</p><p> Tech companies have also stepped up to the plate to try to help mitigate the crisis and its impact on the economy.</p><p> First and foremost, social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) as well as hardware and software providers (like Microsoft and Apple) are actively combating misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p> For instance, Google removed thousands of videos that spread false reports about the coronavirus, and Apple\u2019s App Store team issued new guidance for health apps developers. Facebook has also been aggressively removing false content and promoting official, trustworthy accounts. Many of the big and small companies are also working around the clock and adding critical updates to their interfaces in coordination with health authorities.</p><p> Furthermore,\u201cBig Tech,\u201d hated as it is, has been busy creating and protecting jobs amid the crisis, since the economy is relying much more heavily on e-commerce.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is hiring 100,000 more people and raising employees\u2019 pay, and Microsoft is continuing to pay its hourly workers (like shuttle drivers, cafeteria staff) their regular pay \u2014 even though there has been a reduced need for their services as many employees begin working from home.</p><p> Gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft have followed suit, offering two-week compensation to their drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with COVID-19. And Facebook announced a $100 million program that will give cash grants and ad credit to small businesses impacted by coronavirus. E-commerce powerhouses like Ebay, and again, Amazon, prohibited price gouging when some tried to use their platforms to sell necessities like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and toilet paper for outrageous prices.</p><p> Compared to all the previous pandemics in world history, there\u2019s a new powerful tool in humanity\u2019s hands \u2014 artificial intelligence.</p><p> As health experts work round the clock to stem the crisis, tech leaders have launched a database with copious amounts of scientific articles in an effort to help the scientific community around the globe in its research.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind division, for instance, is sharing all the findings and progress in studying COVID-19 that its algorithms are making. And the White House has called on artificial intelligence (AI) experts to help them connect the dots.</p><p> As the world does its part in fighting off the worst pandemic in our lifetime, technology, tech companies and the people behind them are the game changers.</p><p> Representatives of the broader tech industry were the first ones the White House ran to for help.</p><p> Will lawmakers and many policy experts revert back to their routine \u201cbreaking up big tech\u201d rhetoric after the crisis is over?</p><p> Only time will tell.</p><p> Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Young Voices contributor, Internet Law and Policy Fellow at the IP Foundry and an expert at the Federalist Society\u2019s Emerging Technology Working Group, part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SVGT-4749918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28961505494100 SVGT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-G5B1-JBCN-4246-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270095</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media News Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Multiple data privacy and election-related scandals at various tech companies and a new political strategy of being tough on \u201cBig Tech\u201d have led to the phenomenon known as \u201ctechlash.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, in 2018, the Financial Times used that term to summarize \u201cthe year in a word.\u201d And the hits just keep on coming: in 2019 and this year, we\u2019ve continued to see even more calls to regulate technology and tech companies \u2014 with antitrust suits, congressional hearings and bad bills galore.</p><p> But as the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic sinks in, that desperately needs to change.</p><p> One of the major tools keeping us afloat right now is, of course, technology. Not every job can be performed remotely, and many brave people are going to work every day to keep the economy and the country from collapsing. However, a significant number of businesses, and even entire industries, have been able to move online. Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and other helpful remote tools have made this transition possible, though, admittedly, it hasn\u2019t always been smooth.</p><p> Remote work isn\u2019t the only area of our lives being sustained by technology during this period. Many churches are hosting their services online, and most schools and universities have switched to online classes for the rest of March \u2014 some even until the end of the semester. Political nominees are holding virtual town halls. Even AA meetings and therapy sessions are going digital.</p><p> It should bring us hope to see how society is adapting in all these spheres, desperate to persevere in the face of great odds. Tech, too, is being utilized for philanthropic purposes. Groups on social media platforms are forming to provide help to those in need and coordinate volunteer efforts.</p><p> As Fred Rogers said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Technology has made it much easier to connect those helpers now.</p><p> Tech companies have also stepped up to the plate to try to help mitigate the crisis and its impact on the economy.</p><p> First and foremost, social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) as well as hardware and software providers (like Microsoft and Apple) are actively combating misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p> For instance, Google removed thousands of videos that spread false reports about the coronavirus, and Apple\u2019s App Store team issued new guidance for health apps developers. Facebook has also been aggressively removing false content and promoting official, trustworthy accounts. Many of the big and small companies are also working around the clock and adding critical updates to their interfaces in coordination with health authorities.</p><p> Furthermore,\u201cBig Tech,\u201d hated as it is, has been busy creating and protecting jobs amid the crisis, since the economy is relying much more heavily on e-commerce.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is hiring 100,000 more people and raising employees\u2019 pay, and Microsoft is continuing to pay its hourly workers (like shuttle drivers, cafeteria staff) their regular pay \u2014 even though there has been a reduced need for their services as many employees begin working from home.</p><p> Gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft have followed suit, offering two-week compensation to their drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with COVID-19. And Facebook announced a $100 million program that will give cash grants and ad credit to small businesses impacted by coronavirus. E-commerce powerhouses like Ebay, and again, Amazon, prohibited price gouging when some tried to use their platforms to sell necessities like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and toilet paper for outrageous prices.</p><p> Compared to all the previous pandemics in world history, there\u2019s a new powerful tool in humanity\u2019s hands \u2014 artificial intelligence.</p><p> As health experts work round the clock to stem the crisis, tech leaders have launched a database with copious amounts of scientific articles in an effort to help the scientific community around the globe in its research.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind division, for instance, is sharing all the findings and progress in studying COVID-19 that its algorithms are making. And the White House has called on artificial intelligence (AI) experts to help them connect the dots.</p><p> As the world does its part in fighting off the worst pandemic in our lifetime, technology, tech companies and the people behind them are the game changers.</p><p> Representatives of the broader tech industry were the first ones the White House ran to for help.</p><p> Will lawmakers and many policy experts revert back to their routine \u201cbreaking up big tech\u201d rhetoric after the crisis is over?</p><p> Only time will tell.</p><p> Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Young Voices contributor, Internet Law and Policy Fellow at the IP Foundry and an expert at the Federalist Society\u2019s Emerging Technology Working Group, part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TORDLY-4749586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897A487996360 TORDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-G5B1-JBCN-41R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Multiple data privacy and election-related scandals at various tech companies and a new political strategy of being tough on \u201cBig Tech\u201d have led to the phenomenon known as \u201ctechlash.\u201d</p><p>In fact, in 2018, the Financial Times used that term to summarize \u201cthe year in a word.\u201d And the hits just keep on coming: in 2019 and this year, we\u2019ve continued to see even more calls to regulate technology and tech companies \u2014 with antitrust suits, congressional hearings and bad bills galore.</p><p> But as the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic sinks in, that desperately needs to change.</p><p> One of the major tools keeping us afloat right now is, of course, technology. Not every job can be performed remotely, and many brave people are going to work every day to keep the economy and the country from collapsing. However, a significant number of businesses, and even entire industries, have been able to move online. Zoom, Slack, Google Docs and other helpful remote tools have made this transition possible, though, admittedly, it hasn\u2019t always been smooth.</p><p> Remote work isn\u2019t the only area of our lives being sustained by technology during this period. Many churches are hosting their services online, and most schools and universities have switched to online classes for the rest of March \u2014 some even until the end of the semester. Political nominees are holding virtual town halls. Even AA meetings and therapy sessions are going digital.</p><p> It should bring us hope to see how society is adapting in all these spheres, desperate to persevere in the face of great odds. Tech, too, is being utilized for philanthropic purposes. Groups on social media platforms are forming to provide help to those in need and coordinate volunteer efforts.</p><p> As Fred Rogers said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Technology has made it much easier to connect those helpers now.</p><p> Tech companies have also stepped up to the plate to try to help mitigate the crisis and its impact on the economy.</p><p> First and foremost, social media companies (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) as well as hardware and software providers (like Microsoft and Apple) are actively combating misinformation about COVID-19.</p><p> For instance, Google removed thousands of videos that spread false reports about the coronavirus, and Apple\u2019s App Store team issued new guidance for health apps developers. Facebook has also been aggressively removing false content and promoting official, trustworthy accounts. Many of the big and small companies are also working around the clock and adding critical updates to their interfaces in coordination with health authorities.</p><p> Furthermore,\u201cBig Tech,\u201d hated as it is, has been busy creating and protecting jobs amid the crisis, since the economy is relying much more heavily on e-commerce.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, is hiring 100,000 more people and raising employees\u2019 pay, and Microsoft is continuing to pay its hourly workers (like shuttle drivers, cafeteria staff) their regular pay \u2014 even though there has been a reduced need for their services as many employees begin working from home.</p><p> Gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft have followed suit, offering two-week compensation to their drivers who have been quarantined or diagnosed with COVID-19. And Facebook announced a $100 million program that will give cash grants and ad credit to small businesses impacted by coronavirus. E-commerce powerhouses like Ebay, and again, Amazon, prohibited price gouging when some tried to use their platforms to sell necessities like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and toilet paper for outrageous prices.</p><p> Compared to all the previous pandemics in world history, there\u2019s a new powerful tool in humanity\u2019s hands \u2014 artificial intelligence.</p><p> As health experts work round the clock to stem the crisis, tech leaders have launched a database with copious amounts of scientific articles in an effort to help the scientific community around the globe in its research.</p><p>Google\u2019s DeepMind division, for instance, is sharing all the findings and progress in studying COVID-19 that its algorithms are making. And the White House has called on artificial intelligence (AI) experts to help them connect the dots.</p><p> As the world does its part in fighting off the worst pandemic in our lifetime, technology, tech companies and the people behind them are the game changers.</p><p> Representatives of the broader tech industry were the first ones the White House ran to for help.</p><p> Will lawmakers and many policy experts revert back to their routine \u201cbreaking up big tech\u201d rhetoric after the crisis is over?</p><p> Only time will tell.</p><p> Ashkhen Kazaryan is a Young Voices contributor, Internet Law and Policy Fellow at the IP Foundry and an expert at the Federalist Society\u2019s Emerging Technology Working Group, part of the Regulatory Transparency Project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LBEACH-4749655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABB557E59769 LBEACH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJ2-G5B1-JBCN-41WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Long Beach Press-Telegram</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 29, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>AP Taxonomy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNBS</classCode><className>ONTOLOGIES &amp;

The rate will likely fall back in July, but the BBSW - which represents the short-term funding costs of the banks - appears to have moved firmly away from the levels achieved when liquidity was abundant.</p><p>More repo, or repurchasing, activity going on in the lead-up to June 30 means that cash is more expensive for market participants who have to reduce their exposures before the calendar year is ruled off. To do this they need physical cash or cash equivalents, largely for technical and regulatory reasons, but the impact of this has had a pronounced effect on BBSW at the March quarter-end too.</p><p>But this time, rates experts have noticed that Australian dollar financing has become sharply more expensive than its US equivalent. This is evident in the gap between three-month BBSW and LIBOR, the benchmark for US funding, over their respective overnight rates, which is at its widest in seven years.</p><p>This can also be observed currently in foreign exchange forwards, repo rates and in the cross-currency basis swap market, which is where investors can swap floating rates between different currencies.</p><p>\"There's nothing to suggest that it's sinister just yet, we expect these things to be high as we get to quarter-end as the historical pattern shows,\" said Tamar Hamlyn, portfolio manager at fixed income boutique Ardea. \"My feeling would be that it's a bit too early for a pronounced and sustained increase, these are wholesale financial markets. Most corporates don't refinance every day, but a lot of corporate borrowing will be tied to a bank bill swap rate plus a spread.</p><p>\"If that rate remains high it is going to mean higher financing costs for anybody that's got variable rate financing in Australia, banks have to borrow money at BBSW as well.\"</p><p>The move is not being attributed to the updated composition of BBSW, which changed in May.</p><p>\"There is a global dimension to this starting with the US,\" said Nomura rates strategist Andrew Ticehurst, who observes that multinationals outside the US are holding fewer US dollars. This is a consequence of President Donald Trump's move to incentivise US firms to repatriate money sitting idle offshore. The equivalent US bank bill rate moved higher and most reference rates moved in sympathy. It also meant, according to ANZ, that big tech companies would no longer be the marginal buyers of US Treasury bills.</p><p>That global dimension is missing in the run-up to June 30, Mr Ticehurst pointed out, where the move in Australia is not being replicated to the same extent in New Zealand, Britain or US. Some participants speculated that it was because Australian banks were inclined to raise more of their short-term financing in the domestic market instead of in the offshore market, but others believed this to be a strictly an anticipatory effect for now.</p><p>\"Australia has a large need for $A funding reflective of local funding needs and Australia's current account deficit,\" wrote Richard Grace, Commonwealth Bank's chief currency strategist, on Thursday. At the same time, Australia's US-dollar funding needs are minimal.</p><p>The volume of repo outstanding is at a record high, according to ANZ, including the usage of repo by non-resident investors, which is at 52 per cent of total outstanding repo as of March.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029683380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM2-RTX1-JBJ7-N0RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><timeReceived>06:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Google, in contrast, reported its first revenue decline in company history.<br/>The disparity was evident in the two companies' diverging stock performance Friday, with Google's stock slumping more than 3% at market close and Facebook's popping more than 8%.<br/>Analysts said factors like the amount of revenue coming from direct-response versus brand advertising, exposure to areas like travel, and Google's sheer size gave Facebook's ad business a leg up over Google during the second quarter.<br/>In notes to investors on Thursday and Friday, analysts explained why Facebook is enduring the pandemic better than Google. Here's what they had to say.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 31: Facebook<br/>Facebook equity rallied 7.4% after the company beat profit estimates by 41 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share. Revenue also beat estimates. The social media giant also said it expects growth in ad sales despite a boycott by some key advertisers and cutbacks induced by the pandemic.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 31: Facebook will add music videos after deals with labels<br/>Facebook plans to launch music videos starting in the U.S. on Saturday after reaching deals with big and independent music companies in a move that could grab advertising dollars from Google-owned YouTube.<br/>In a blog post, Facebook announced deals with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Merlin, BMG, Kobalt and other independent music groups to launch music videos on its platform.<br/>Users will be able to react to, comment on and share music videos on their news feed, on Groups and in Messenger. Artists with videos will include Blake Shelton, Diplo, Jonas Brothers and Nicki Minaj, the company said.<br/>\"Over time, the experience will become more personalized to your tastes based on artists you follow and videos you engage with,\" the post says.<br/>Facebook said users will be first to see an official music video for a new song from artist Lele Pons.<br/>Bloomberg reported in December that Facebook was pursuing the rights to music videos from major record labels in hopes to boost Facebook Watch. According to the report, Facebook's deals previously allowed it to use songs in the background of videos but it didn't previously have the rights to offer official music videos.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 30: Facebook says the ad boycott is having an impact, but you wouldn't know that looking at its forecast<br/>Facebook said in its second quarter 2020 earnings on Thursday it's been impacted by ad boycotts from major advertisers. But its third-quarter outlook suggests there won't be much of a ding to its ad revenue growth.<br/>Facebook said its year-over-year ad revenue growth rate in the first three weeks of July were in-line with its second-quarter year-over-year ad revenue growth rate of 10%, and that its ad revenue growth rate for the third quarter will be \"roughly similar to this July performance.\"<br/>Major advertisers announced various degrees of pauses to their social media advertising budgets in June, after a campaign called \"#StopHateForProfit\" called on advertisers to boycott Facebook for the month of July.<br/>Those organizations wanted to pressure Facebook into taking more stringent steps to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation on its platform.<br/>Facebook listed an \"impact from certain advertisers pausing spend on our platforms related to the current boycott\" as a factor contributing to its third-quarter outlook, and said macroeconomic uncertainty, a normalization in a recent surge in community engagement and potential regulation will also impact its third quarter ad revenue.<br/>Wedbush analysts in a research note this week said they expected \"minimal financial impact from brand boycotts.\" They wrote that given the duration of announced boycotts, it expects roughly $100 million of \"near term brand revenue is at risk, representing less than 1% of [year-over-year] growth in Q3.\"<br/>&amp;#8243;#StopHateForProfit\" organizers said in an emailed statement Thursday that the boycott encouraged Facebook to take a number of \"concessions,\" but that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"has not yet approached the type of meaningful action that we want to see.\"<br/>\"We called for a Facebook ad pause for the month of July as the mobilization for the Stop Hate for Profit movement.</p><p>July 30: Facebook says Apple's iOS 14 changes could hurt its ad targeting<br/>Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on Thursday that upcoming changes to Apple's iOS 14 operating system could hurt the social network's ability to target ads to users.<br/>With the update to its mobile devices, Apple will ask users if they want to let app developers track their activity across other apps and websites. Apple has not said when iOS 14 will launch, but it's expected to roll out this year.<br/>\"We're still trying to understand what these changes will look like and how they will impact us and the rest of the industry, but at the very least, it's going to make it harder for app developers and others to grow using ads on Facebook and elsewhere,\" Wehner said.<br/>Until now, advertisers could use a device ID number called the IDFA to better target ads and estimate their effectiveness. In iOS 14, each app that wants to use these identifiers will ask users to opt-in to tracking when the app is first launched.<br/>The change is expected to start impacting Facebook's advertising in the third quarter but it will have a more pronounced effect in the fourth quarter, Wehner said.<br/>The company forecast revenue growth for the third quarter of about 10%, beating analysts' expectations for growth of 7.9%.<br/>\"Our view is that Facebook and targeted ads are a lifeline for small businesses, especially in the time of Covid, and we are concerned that aggressive platform policies will cut at that lifeline at a time when it is so essential to small business growth and recovery,\" Wehner said.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 30: Zuckerberg says there's 'no end in sight' for Facebook employees working from home<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday said there is no timetable for when employees will return to the company's offices amid a continuing surge in Covid-19 cases in the U.S.<br/>Zuckerberg made his comments on a call with analysts about Facebook's second-quarter results, specifically criticizing the Trump Administration for its handling of the coronavirus.<br/>\"With Covid growing quickly in the U.S., there's currently no end in sight for when our teams here will be able to return to our offices,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It is incredibly disappointing because it seems like the U.S. could've avoided this current surge in cases if our government had handled this better.\"<br/>This is not the first time Zuckerberg criticized President Trump for his handling of Covid-19. Zuckerberg made similar criticisms on July 16 on a publicly streamed call with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert.<br/>In May, Zuckerberg said Facebook planned to allow employees to start going back into its offices on July 6.<br/>The company reported 11% revenue growth despite the coronavirus pandemic's effects on the economy and advertising spending, sending the company's shares up more than 6% after hours on Thursday.<br/>Facebook's expenses in the second quarter were up 24% from a year earlier, excluding the company's settlement with the Federal Trade Commission a year ago. That was a smaller increase than in the first quarter, primarily because of a decline in costs related to travel and events as a result of employees working from home, Facebook CFO David Wehner said on a call with analysts on Thursday.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 30: Facebook<br/>Shares of Facebook rallied above 6% after besting analyst estimates in the second quarter.

Sensors would capture data on park bench usage, air quality and more, aimed at making the neighborhood more livable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was handshakes and smiles all around when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and officials from Sidewalk Labs gathered here 18\u00a0months ago to announce the data-driven city of tomorrow. But internal discord and public criticism are threatening the project.</p><p>\"I don't think they look so happy now,\" said Paula Fletcher, a Toronto City Council member. \"This big idea isn't going exactly the way it was planned.\"</p><p>As in New York, where fierce opposition to Amazon led the online retail giant to cancel plans to build a second headquarters in Long Island City, a local movement here is growing to send Sidewalk Labs packing. The concerns: money, privacy and whether Toronto is handing too much power over civic life to a for-profit American technology giant.</p><p>The #BlockSidewalk campaign formed in February after the Toronto Star reported on leaked documents indicating that Sidewalk Labs was considering paying for transit and infrastructure on a larger portion of the waterfront. In return, it would seek a cut of the property taxes, development fees and the increased value of the land resulting from the development - an estimated $6\u00a0billion over 30 years.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, said the reason it had not shared the proposal was that it was still being debated. But it was a tough look for a company that has come under fire over a lack of transparency around its business model and over the question of who would own and govern the data and intellectual property at the heart of its proposal.</p><p>\"It's our job to remind everybody that no is an option and that consent is important,\" said Bianca Wylie, one of the leaders of #BlockSidewalk. \"The way this process has been set up was not a question of whether we should do stuff like this, but how.\"</p><p>Separately, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing the city, provincial and federal governments to shut down the project over privacy concerns. Michael Bryant, the head of the group, said Trudeau had been \"seduced by the honey pot of Google's sparkling brand and promises of political and economic glory.\"</p><p>In the original \"vision document\" for Quayside, Sidewalk Labs described adaptive traffic lights that would detect when pedestrians and cyclists were at a light to ensure that they had priority to cross. Sensors would detect when benches needed to be repaired, when waste bins needed to be emptied and when bicycle lanes should be transformed into pedestrian walkways, or vice versa.</p><p>The vision document also mentioned \"health sensors\" but did not elaborate. A digital identification system would enable residents and workers to access services.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs committed $50\u00a0million to conducting year-long public consultations and creating a master plan to be submitted to Waterfront Toronto, a corporation that represents the three levels of government in developing the area. The plan would require the approval of the corporation and several government bodies to advance.</p><p>The plan is expected by the end of June - more than six months behind schedule.</p><p>The company has acknowledged missteps.</p><p>Micah Lasher, the head of policy and communications for Sidewalk Labs, said providing more details about the business model for Quayside and plans for data governance earlier would have helped allay many concerns. But he also said the business model remains uncertain.</p><p>Lasher said the company has struggled to figure out when to unveil ideas to the public.</p><p>\"If you share them too early, they seem half-baked and you might move away from them later,\" he said. \"If you share them too late, you are subject to criticism for not being transparent.\"</p><p>Long before the #BlockSidewalk movement and the civil liberties lawsuit, controversies had already provoked public skepticism.</p><p>Some of the  disillusionment stemmed from the flurry of coverage about how tech firms, Google included, handle their customers' personal data.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs has downplayed links to its corporate sibling, saying it will not monetize the data it collects and proposing that it be governed by a data trust that would set the rules around its use.</p><p>Andrew Clement, a professor emeritus in the University of Toronto's faculty of information studies and member of a Waterfront Toronto advisory panel, said questions remain about the trust. Instead of answering them, he added, Sidewalk has been distracting people with new prototypes, such as raincoats for buildings.</p><p>Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs were both rocked by several high-profile resignations and dismissals last year. Ontario's former privacy commissioner resigned from a paid consulting role with Sidewalk because she said its plans for the data trust fell short of her standards.</p><p>Then, in December, Ontario's auditor general found that Waterfront Toronto gave Sidewalk Labs more information before a request for proposals than other companies that would be responding to the request.</p><p>According to the auditor general, Waterfront Toronto said it shared information with Sidewalk Labs as part of its regular \"market sounding process\" to gauge interest in the project, also shared it with some other groups and would have given it to any that asked. Waterfront Toronto said the information did not give potential bidders an unfair advantage.</p><p>The auditor general said that \"fair practice and equal treatment would suggest that all potential bidders receive the same information at the same time\" and called for greater government oversight.</p><p>Wylie, the #BlockSidewalk leader, said cities are relinquishing too much power to big tech companies as regulators are trying to rein them in.</p><p>But some worry that showing Alphabet the door would stain the tech-friendly image Trudeau has tried to cultivate for Canada.</p><p>\"We believe that tearing up this process midstream poses reputational risks, trade risks and legal risks,\" Brian Kelcey, vice president of public affairs for the Toronto Region Board of Trade, told a parliamentary committee last month.</p><p>Kristina Verner, Waterfront Toronto's vice president of innovation, sustainability and prosperity, said that \"the potential of this project is still very exciting.\" She said she does not see any harm in waiting to see Sidewalk's final plan.</p><p>\"It is definitely not a done deal,\" she said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:foreign@washpost.com\">foreign@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ad83ed206f6611e99f065fc2ee80027a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W24-1WW1-DXKP-J05S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1106\"/><timeReceived>4:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 5, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
