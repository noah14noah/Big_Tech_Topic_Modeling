The coronavirus threatens jobs, global economic activity, international relations, the health of our loved ones, and our own lives. To combat this pandemic, epidemiologists require data so they can better understand where and how the coronavirus may be spreading among populations. World leaders from the international level down to local ranks need to be able to track the spread of the virus in order to make informed decisions about how to manage resources, handle shelter-in-place restrictions, and reopen businesses. </p><p>The technologies politicians are testing, like phone-based contact tracing, thermal scanning, and facial recognition, are all euphemisms for surveillance, and tradeoffs being weighed now could extend well beyond this crisis. Before the pandemic, one of the most important \u2014 and popular \u2014 movements in ethics and social justice was the push against technology-powered surveillance, especially AI technologies like facial recognition. It's a rich topic centered around power[1] that pits everyday people against the worst parts of big tech, overreaching law enforcement, and potential governmental abuse. 'Surveillance capitalism' is as gross as its name implies, and speaking truth to that particular sort of power feels good. But now, with millions suddenly unemployed and some 80,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. alone, the issue is no longer corporate profits or policing efficacy versus privacy, security, and power. In a global pandemic, the tradeoff may very well be privacy, security, and power versus life itself.VB Transform 2020 Online[2] - July 15-17. Join leading AI executives: Register for the free livestream[3]. The spread of the coronavirus poses an immediate life-and-death threat. No one alive has experienced anything like it on such a scale, and everyone is scrambling to adjust. Against such a dire backdrop, theoretical concerns about data privacy or overreaching facial recognition-powered government surveillance are easily brushed aside. Is it really such a bad thing if our COVID-19-related medical records go into a massive database that helps frontline health care workers battle the disease? Or if that data helps epidemiologists track the virus and understand how and where it spreads? Or aids researchers in developing cures? Who cares if we have to share some of our smartphone data to find out whether we've come into contact with a COVID-19 patient? Is it really that onerous to deploy facial recognition surveillance if it prevents super-spreaders from blithely infecting hundreds or thousands of people? Those are legitimate questions, but on the whole it's a dangerously shallow perspective to take. A similar zeitgeist permeated the United States after 9/11. Out of fear \u2014 and a strong desire for solidarity \u2014 Congress quickly passed the Patriot Act with broad bipartisan support. But the country lacked the foresight to demand and implement guardrails, and the federal government has held onto broad surveillance powers[4] in the nearly two decades since. What we learned \u2014 or should have learned, at least \u2014 from 9/11 and the Patriot Act is that a proactive approach to threats should not exclude forward-looking protections. Anything less is panic. The dangers posed by a hasty and wholesale surrender of privacy and other freedoms are not theoretical. They're just perhaps not as immediate and clear as the threat posed by the coronavirus. Giving up your privacy amounts to giving up your power, and it's important to know who will hold onto all that data. In some cases, it's tech giants like Apple and Google, which are already not widely trusted, but it could also be AI surveillance tech companies like Palantir,[5]or Clearview[6] or Banjo[7], which have ties to far right extremists[8]. In other cases, your power flows directly into the government's hands. Sometimes, as in the case of a tech company the government contracts to perform a task like facial recognition-powered surveillance, you could be giving your data and power to both at the same time. Perhaps worse, some experts and ethicists believe systems built or deployed during the pandemic will not be dismantled. That means if you agree to feed mobile companies your smartphone data now, it's likely they'll keep taking it. If you agree to quarantine enforcement measures that include facial recognition systems deployed all over a city, those systems will likely become a standard part of law enforcement after the quarantines are over. And so on. This isn't to say that the pandemic doesn't require some tough tradeoffs \u2014 the difficult but crucially important part is understanding which concessions are acceptable and necessary and what legal and regulatory safeguards need to be put in place. For a start, we can look to some general best practices. The International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communication Surveillance[9], which has been signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, has for years insisted that any mass surveillance efforts must be necessary, adequate, and proportionate. Health officials, not law enforcement, need to drive the decision-making around data collection. Privacy considerations should be built into tools like contact tracing apps[10]. Any compromises made in the name of public health need to be balanced against the costs to privacy, and if a surveillance system is installed, it needs to be dismantled[11] when the emergent threat of the coronavirus subsides. Data collected during the pandemic must have legal protections, including stringent restrictions on who can access that data, for what purpose, and for how long. In this special issue, we explore the privacy and surveillance tradeoffs lawmakers are working through[12], outline methods of tracking the coronavirus[13], and examine France as a case study[14] in the challenges governments face at the intersection of politics, technology, and people's lives. This is a matter of life and death. But it's about life and death now and life and death for years to come.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about Digital Manipulation.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GUY RAZ:                 All right, let me ask you about Cayla. Tell me, what is Cayla? Tell me about Cayla.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FINN MYRSTAD:                 (Laughter) So Cayla, I would say, was an Internet-connected doll.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGER:                 (Singing) Cayla knows millions of things.             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 The children can talk to the doll.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1:                 How do you make a cake?             </p><p>COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE:                 Mix eggs, flower, milk, butter...             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 And the doll would use speech-recognition technology and answer the child's questions.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2:                 My Friend Cayla talks, listens to you, plays games with you and knows millions of things.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 And because Cayla talks to you and listens to you and knows millions of things, Finn Myrstad, who is the director of digital policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, wanted to see how easily Cayla could be hacked.             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 We decided to investigate or look at this doll more closely, and what we discovered was that it had very little security. So anyone within Bluetooth range or within a certain distance could basically connect to the doll through their phones and initiate the two-way conversation.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2:                 (As Cayla) Hi, my name is Cayla. What is yours?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Finn.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 On the TED stage, you do this. You bring out a colleague, who from, like, backstage is talking to you through Cayla and presumably could talk to a child in their bedroom.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2:                 (As Cayla) Is your mom close by?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 No, she's in the store.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2:                 (As Cayla) You want to come out and play with me?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 That's a great idea.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2:                 (As Cayla) Oh, great.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 It's totally weird.             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Yeah, yeah. And it's completely, of course, unacceptable. And what made this story worse was that there was a label on the packaging saying that this was an Internet-safe doll while it really had no safety or security precautions in it whatsoever.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 Now, did Cayla, like, also listen in on the things people were telling her and then using that information?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Well, we read the terms and conditions that no one reads, and in there, the company reserved the rights to use the voice recordings of the child and use it for targeted advertisement, for example.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2:                 Cayla knows millions of things.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1:                 How do you make a cake?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 But because we don't have any protections when it comes to data or when it comes to security, the market is flooded with insecure products and products which has a business model of selling our data. And that really decreases trust, and it leaves people completely apathetic to this.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 OK, so Cayla might sound like an extreme example of a tech company acting irresponsibly, but is it really? Is it an anomaly? Because when you unwrap Cayla and install the companion app, there is a user agreement.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 So we read also the terms and conditions that no one reads.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 The terms and conditions that no one reads. Finn Myrstad continues the story from the TED stage.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Like most of you, I have dozens of apps on my phone. If used properly, they can make our lives easier, more convenient and maybe even healthier. But have we been lulled into a false sense of security? It starts simply by ticking a box. Yes, we say, I've read the terms. But have you really read the terms? Are you sure they didn't look too long, and the last time you tried, they were impossible to understand, and you needed to use the service now? And now the power imbalance is established because we have agreed to our personal information being gathered and used on a scale we could never imagine.             </p><p>                This is why my colleagues and I decided to take a deeper look at this. We set out to read the terms of popular apps on the average phone. And to show the world how unrealistic it is to expect consumers to actually read the terms, we printed them - more than 900 pages - and sat down in our office and read them out loud ourselves.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3:                 Angry Birds, terms of service - the following terms of service and end-user license agreement...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Streaming the experiment live on our website, it took quite a long time. It took us 31 hours, 49 minutes and 11 seconds to read the terms on an average phone - that is longer than a movie marathon of the \"Harry Potter\" movies and \"The Godfather\" movies combined. And reading is one thing; understanding is another story - that would have taken us much, much longer.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 But this isn't just about, like, a creepy doll or, like, how incredibly frustrating and unrealistic it is to have to read hundreds of pages of user agreements. I mean, all of this data collected on us - I mean, companies can and do use it in some really, you know, sleazy ways, right?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Yeah. And what we're seeing increasingly is that this data can also be used to discriminate people. You won't see an ad because you're, for some reason, put in a high-risk category. We know that housing ads have not been shown to people of a certain ethnic minority, for example. So you can discriminate based on ethnicity. We know that job ads have not been shown to people living within a certain zip code or with a certain profile. We know that this data can be used to determine whether you're a risky consumer or not, so access to your - to credit can be a problem.             </p><p>                And you won't even know because it will just be a computer giving you a price or denying you access to a service, and you won't know why.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 Every single one of us - right? - we download apps, and we go to certain pages. And oftentimes, we give consent without thinking about it for a variety of reasons - 'cause we're out of time, we're in a hurry, whatever it might be. But then these technology companies - their response is, well, listen; we warned you. We gave you all of the information. You made a decision to opt in. But that's actually such an infuriatingly disingenuous response.             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Yeah, I would agree to that because, for example - let's use Facebook as an example. It's the world's most popular social network. And if you want to stay in touch with your friends, for most people, that's how you do it - either through Facebook or Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 Sure.             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 So we have to also keep in mind that most people have lots of other things to worry about. They have to go to work. They have to buy food that is safe and good, and they have to take their kids to football practice. So taking these very complicated decisions that could have detrimental effects in the long-term - in the short-term, we are not really equipped psychologically to take that into consideration.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 I can't help but think that a capitalist model makes this an impossible problem to solve because data is so valuable. It is increasingly important to these companies' bottom lines and to their market capitalization. What - why would they possibly give this up?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 No. And probably they won't, unless there is actually external pressure. And I think that's probably where, you know, we the citizens can make a difference, to tell our decision-makers, our politicians that we care about this, that we don't want this to be an individual choice. And I think this should be regulated the same way we regulated the environment, the water, big oil companies, tobacco and all of these things.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 I mean, Google and Facebook - this is their bread and butter. They control a huge percentage of the digital head market. How could they change their business model to, you know - to continue to make money if that's obviously their priority and their responsibility to their shareholders?             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Well, I think there is a discussion now whether you could, for example, serve contextual ads where you actually don't need to collect any data about the user, where, based on which website you're on, you will see ads that would be relevant to users of that website.             </p><p>                I would happily use Facebook. And if they asked me every - beginning of every month or beginning of every year, what things are you interested in? What would you like to see of ads? And it was my choice to say, I'm interested in sports. I'm interested in news. And you don't need to track me to - in order to know that you - I could actually willingly be telling them that.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 I mean, the companies argue, look; we're targeting people because it's better for their lives. It improves their lives. It's more efficient. It gives them opportunities to buy the things they need. We need this data to make - you know, to offer a better experience for consumers. They genuinely believe that what they're doing is for the greater good.             </p><p>FINN MYRSTAD:                 Yeah, I've also heard that, and I also see that when I meet with these companies. It's a lot of really good and smart people working at these big tech companies. But what I feel is that they are not at all - or the corporate culture - the companies' structures are not open for scrutiny. They are not open for transparency. And they say, trust us; we will have your best interests in mind.             </p><p>                And I think with all these privacy scandals, people are losing trust, and these companies are becoming increasingly more unpopular. But because they have such a strong grip on the markets - I would call them monopolies - it's really hard for consumers to vote with their feet because they have nowhere else to go.             </p><p>GUY RAZ:                 That's Finn Myrstad. He's director of digital policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council.

Each of the firms used its equity research analysts to provide presentations on key issues during the company's solicitation period in May 5.<br/> Each of the firms implicitly or explicitly offered favorable research coverage during the meetings or follow-up communications with Toys 'R' Us, according to FINRA. The company eventually abandoned[3] its planned IPO.<br/> The regulator added that Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Needham's supervisory procedures were inadequate in connection with the participation of the research analyst in the investment banking pitches.<br/> Susan Axelrod, executive vice president, regulatory operation at FINRA said the research analyst conflict of interest[4] rules clearly states that firms 'may not use research analysts or the promise of offering favorable research to win investment banking business.'<br/> Axelrod added that the settlement affirms FINRA's commitment to policing the boundaries between research and investment banking to ensure that research is not improperly influenced.'<br/> On the other hand, Brad Bennett, executive vice president and chief enforcement at FINRA emphasized that the firms overstep the prohibition against analysts' solicitation and the promise of favorable research. He said the action of the regulator maintains the integrity of the research function against any pressures that may exist to monetize the reputation and work product of the analysts.<br/> FINRA said the firms agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations, but consented to the entry of its finding.<br/> The post FINRA Imposes $43.5M Fine on Ten Firms over Toys 'R' UsIPO[5] appeared first on ValueWalk[6].<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2014/P602059\">http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2014/P602059</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/12/big-tech-ipos-another-bubble-infographic/\">http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/12/big-tech-ipos-another-bubble-infographic/</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/toys-r-us-withdraws-i-p-o/\">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/toys-r-us-withdraws-i-p-o/</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/11/finra-conflicts-of-interest/\">http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/11/finra-conflicts-of-interest/</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/12/finra-fine-toys-r-us-ipo/\">http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/12/finra-fine-toys-r-us-ipo/</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com\">http://www.valuewalk.com</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VAWA13119314183348206899351668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAWA-131193</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DTK-VT81-F03R-N0G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><timeReceived>9:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ValueWalk</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>December 11, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001TWF</classCode><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

Further information on<br/>the Company's portfolio can be found in our Investment Manager's Review.<br/><br/>During the period, the Company's shares have consistently traded close to net<br/>asset value, beginning the period at a 0.6% premium to the Company's ex-income<br/>net asset value per share and ending on a 0.4% premium.<br/><br/>Share Capital<br/><br/>As I reported at the year-end, due to the constant demand for your Company's<br/>shares, we took the following actions:<br/><br/>\u00b7Three new block listing authorities were obtained from the UK Listing<br/>Authority to enable shares to be issued as cost effectively as possible;<br/><br/>\u00b7a Prospectus was also published in order that the Company can continue to<br/>issue shares in accordance with the Prospectus Directive; and<br/><br/>\u00b7shareholder authority to issue further shares equal to 10% of the Company's<br/>issued share capital on a non-pre-emptive basis was renewed at the Company's<br/>Annual General Meeting held in January 2014.<br/><br/>As at 31 March 2014 the Company had 91,310,212 shares of 25p each in issue (31<br/>March 2013: 75,986,219). No shares had been held in treasury by the Company<br/>since 26 May 2010. During the six months under review 8,173,655 new shares were<br/>issued raising \u00a341.0 million. Since the end of the half-year, to the date of<br/>this report, a further 1,460,000 new shares have been issued raising \u00a37.4<br/>million. As at 30 April 2014, the Company had 92,770,212 shares in issue.<br/><br/>The Directors believe that the issuance of those new shares continues to yield<br/>the following principal benefits:<br/><br/>Improvement of liquidity in the market for the Company's shares;<br/><br/>Maintenance of the Company's ability to issue shares tactically, so as to<br/>manage the premium to net asset value per share at which the shares trade;<br/><br/>Increase in the size of the Company, thereby spreading operating costs over a<br/>larger capital base with a consequent reduction in the ongoing charges ratio;<br/>and<br/><br/>Chairman's Statement<br/><br/>Continued<br/><br/>Enhancement of the net asset value per share of existing shares through new<br/>share issuance at a premium to the cum income net asset value per share;<br/><br/>Dividend<br/><br/>The Board has declared a first interim dividend of 5.1p per share, compared to<br/>last year's first interim dividend of 4.8p per share, an increase of 6.3%. The<br/>dividend will be paid on Tuesday, 6 May 2014 to shareholders who were on the<br/>register on Friday, 4 April 2014. The associated ex dividend date was<br/>Wednesday, 2 April 2014.<br/><br/>Regulatory Matters<br/><br/>As stated in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts the Board, together with<br/>its advisors is currently working to achieve compliance with the Alternative<br/>Investment Fund Managers Directive (the `Directive') which is due to come into<br/>force on 22 July 2014. In accordance with the Directive it is intended that the<br/>Bank of New York Mellon will be appointed as the Company's Depository and the<br/>Company's Manager, Frostrow Capital LLP, will undertake the role of the<br/>Company's Alternative Investment Fund Manager.<br/><br/>Outlook<br/><br/>The FTSE All Share Index is barely changed in the year so far. Since our<br/>half-year end technology companies have been among the worst performing stocks,<br/>while the exposure of many companies in the portfolio to emerging markets has<br/>also eroded their profits due to the strength of sterling.<br/><br/>However, your Board continues to believe that our Investment Manager's strategy<br/>of investing for the long-term in durable cash generative franchises capable of<br/>sustained dividend growth will continue to deliver superior investment returns<br/>to shareholders.<br/><br/>Anthony Townsend<br/>Chairman<br/><br/>30 April 2014<br/><br/>Investment Manager's Review<br/><br/>\"Your Company has had a great run of absolute and relative performance over the<br/>last few years and this continued through the recent half-year...\"<br/><br/>Of course we are delighted by the return the strategy has delivered for<br/>shareholders (including me as an ongoing buyer of shares) and remain<br/>enthusiastic about its prospects - nonetheless we hope shareholders will keep<br/>their expectations in check.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best corrective for any excessive optimism about Finsbury's<br/>prospects - if such exists - is a review of the dividend growth being delivered<br/>by the portfolio constituents. Not surprisingly we pay a lot of attention to<br/>dividend announcements made by each company and look at the effects of these<br/>announcements at portfolio level too. To us the decision any board takes twice<br/>a year (in the UK at least) about what to do with its next dividend payment is<br/>full of valuable information for a long-term investor. This valuable<br/>information relates to a company's sustainable long term growth rate, or the<br/>sustainable growth rate its board believes the company can deliver. Profits and<br/>earnings are volatile from period to period, but boards are usually concerned<br/>that dividends be a lot less volatile. For this reason they tend to set<br/>dividend increases no higher than their expectation for long term growth in<br/>cash flow (because dividends have to be paid out of cash) - all other things<br/>being equal. This is an informative number.<br/><br/>Turning to our most recent experience, here are the bald statistics for your<br/>portfolio. Measuring the last dividend declared by each company and comparing<br/>it to the comparable payment 12 months previous - 12.5% of our holdings by<br/>value have left their dividends unchanged; another 12.5% have increased by up<br/>to 5%; 48% have increased by between 5% and 10% and the remainder, 27% by<br/>value, have increased dividends by 10% or more. At portfolio level, with a lot<br/>of errors and omissions excepted, it looks as though current weighted dividend<br/>growth is around 7.5% per annum.<br/><br/>There are three observations we make about that 7.5%. The first, bluntly, is<br/>that it is not likely that your Company's NAV and share price will rise at high<br/>teen rates or more year after year if the underlying rate of dividend growth -<br/>dividends being, after all, what end up in shareholders' hands - is half that.<br/>Here is the basis for my attempt at expectations management in the opening<br/>paragraph.<br/><br/>Next, though, I don't want shareholders to get downcast - because in truth we<br/>regard dividend growth of c.7.5% as a satisfactory outcome, if it really does<br/>represent a credible estimate of long-term growth. Think about it this way -<br/>the underlying dividend yield of your portfolio, before all expenses, is<br/>roughly 3% and growing at that 7.5%pa. So, the strategy offers a starting cash<br/>return that is nearly double the current rate of UK inflation (1.7% in February<br/>2014), growing at more than four times the rate of inflation. This is the sort<br/>of investment proposition - a growing return in excess of inflation - that<br/>makes you a great deal of money over time.<br/><br/>Finally and again accentuating the positive, closer analysis of the dividend<br/>policies of individual holdings gives us hope that aggregate dividend growth<br/>for the portfolio is more likely to tick up, rather than down, over the next<br/>few years. For instance, we are, candidly, somewhat taken aback that as much as<br/>25% of our portfolio is increasing its dividends by less than 5% in 2013/14.<br/>Growth in dividends, or the potential for it, is one of our key selection<br/>criteria and sub 5% is not what we are looking for. But we are prepared to cut<br/>some slack for offending companies. For instance, there are extenuating<br/>circumstances for the two major holdings where dividends are static in 2013/14.<br/>These are Fidessa and Heineken, combined over 12.0% of NAV. Fidessa has been<br/>operating against unusually straightened commercial conditions for its major<br/>customers - it sells software services to global investment banks - and, in<br/>addition, investing heavily in new products and its ordinary dividend is<br/>unchanged since 2011. However, like most successful software companies, Fidessa<br/>generates a great deal of cash which it has shared with its owners via a<br/>substantial special dividend, paid over each of the last four years. Meanwhile,<br/>Heineken and the London Stock Exchange, whose most recent dividend increase was<br/>\"only\" 4%, are both digesting recent substantial acquisitions made for cash and<br/>can be excused for stinginess with their dividends while they pay down the<br/>resultant debt.<br/><br/>Investment Manager's Review<br/><br/>Continued<br/><br/>Another dividend we watch especially closely at the moment is Pearson's. The<br/>most recent payment was up 7%, maintaining the company's record of 25 years of<br/>consecutive increases ahead of UK inflation. In this case we really do hope<br/>that Pearson's board is signalling a realistic expectation for its long term<br/>cash flows, because there is no doubt investors are sceptical. The shares have<br/>done poorly over the last six months, being the biggest detractor from the<br/>performance of your Company over that period and now stand on a historic<br/>dividend yield of 4.6%, some 35% higher than for the average for the FT<br/>All-share Index. We continue to add to the holding and do so, when it comes<br/>right down to it, because we are impressed by the relationships that Pearson<br/>has built and maintains with technology leaders such as Apple and Microsoft.<br/>Technology is changing the delivery of education; technology companies clearly<br/>sense a major profit opportunity from this change and, to date at least, big<br/>tech companies appear to value Pearson educational content and know-how highly<br/>and want to work with, rather than against, the company. There are not so many<br/>UK-quoted companies that can lay credible claim to being at the heart of a<br/>technology-driven productivity revolution, but Pearson is definitely one and is<br/>as a result very valuable, in our opinion.<br/><br/>In conclusion to this report and somewhat in the spirit of provocation I attach<br/>a piece written earlier in 2014 for a client with a very long term time<br/>horizon. A piece that outlines our strategic thinking about equity markets:<br/><br/>Think about the implications of the following recent advertising copy, for<br/>Cisco's smart routers and widgets:<br/><br/>\"Homes know when to turn up the heat. Pill bottles are ordering their own<br/>refills. Shopping carts are handling checkout. Crops are telling farmers when<br/>to harvest. Street lights will prevent crime. Clothing will detect fevers.<br/>Factories will react to markets in real time. Cities will adjust to changes in<br/>the weather.\"<br/><br/>We know from our own day-to-day experience that this is not pie-in-the-sky<br/>futurology. It's happening now. McKinsey calculates that the productivity gains<br/>from the \"Internet of Everything\" will boost global output by c$23 trillion<br/>(not billion!) by 2025. UBS predicts global GDP will accelerate by c0.6% pa -<br/>so a 20% increase on a 3% non-tech enhanced rate - and that inflation will be<br/>1% per annum lower than it would have been otherwise. A spokesman for British<br/>tech leader ARM, which designs these increasingly ubiquitous chips confirmed:<br/><br/>\"There's enormous scope for making many things more efficient. Low-cost sensors<br/>can be deployed in large numbers and there are many applications.\"<br/><br/>This stuff is of critical importance for those of us charged with allocating<br/>and preserving client capital. History teaches that what really drives wealth<br/>creation for humanity are the productivity gains that result from the<br/>widespread adoption of new technology - from the railways, the telegraph and<br/>through to the Internet. Everything else is pretty much noise - inflation,<br/>interest rates, government deficits or currency fluctuation. People have always<br/>worried about these \"macro\" factors, but I ask you to look back at long term<br/>charts of stock market performance, at least stock markets in nations that<br/>respect individual property rights, and acknowledge that you can't see those<br/>macro worries in the charts. They go up and they go up because human ingenuity<br/>discovers new ways to meet needs and wants and that ingenuity is rewarded with<br/>profit. The S&amp;P 500 is within 0.5% of its all-time high today - show me the<br/>malign impact of the US budget deficit, or the debauch of the Dollar. No, can't<br/>see them? But I can show you 500 of the most innovative, productive, rational<br/>companies on the planet. Natural selection makes S&amp;P 500 constituents pretty<br/>\"fit\".<br/><br/>I'm not pretending there aren't losers. It's fascinating to read that even US<br/>coffee shops are feeling the pinch of the digital revolution. Howard Schultz,<br/>CEO of Starbucks, had this to say about last Christmas:<br/><br/>Investment Manager's Review<br/><br/>Continued<br/><br/>\"I firmly believe that the month of December will go down as a turning point in<br/>the overall way in which people are shopping...people spent much more time on<br/>the Web...there were clearly less people out shopping.... There will be a real<br/>sea change for many, many retailers, who are going to have a hard time<br/>navigating through what I believe will not (just) be a December problem.\"<br/><br/>Or consider the \"lost\" $32.5billion of texting revenues for telephony companies<br/>in 2013. Instead of texting over the phone networks people are doing it for<br/>free via the Internet, using applications like WhatsApp. In Mexico WhatsApp has<br/>already captured 90% of all instant messaging. That's painful for the incumbent<br/>telephone companies, but great for people who need to communicate.<br/><br/>Throw this into the mix - the US drilled another 30,000 shale gas wells in<br/>2013, further accelerating the point at which the world's most innovative and<br/>dynamic economy becomes energy self-sufficient. Surely the price of energy is<br/>going to plummet in years to come, in response to this new, unlooked for supply<br/>of cheap gas? That's another huge wealth and productivity boost for<br/>corporations and people around the world.<br/><br/>Market strategists fret that equity valuations are \"high\", whatever that means.<br/>But they're often valuing industries and companies of the past, not the future.<br/>We say Equity valuations look high because - whether they know it consciously<br/>or not - investors are beginning to discount a massive increase in global<br/>profitability, derived from the factors I've scratched the surface of above.<br/><br/>For investors knowing how to participate is tough. Some of the biggest gains of<br/>the next 20 years will arise from companies and probably industries that don't<br/>even exist yet. But those that follow us - our children or future officers of<br/>the institutions we are responsible for today - will not thank us if we sit out<br/>on this next, probably unprecedented, wave of wealth creation.<br/><br/>Nick Train<br/>Director<br/><br/>Lindsell Train Limited<br/>Investment Manager<br/><br/>30 April 2014<br/><br/><br/>Investments<br/>as at 31 March 2014<br/><br/>Investment                     Sector                          Fair        % of<br/>                                                              Value Investments<br/>                                                              \u00a3'000<br/><br/>Unilever                       Food Producers                43,627         9.0<br/><br/>Diageo                         Beverages                     41,163         8.4<br/><br/>Heineken Holdings (A Shares)*  Beverages                     32,174         6.6<br/><br/>Pearson                        Media                         31,478         6.5<br/><br/>Reed Elsevier                  Media                         29,981         6.1<br/><br/>London Stock Exchange          Financial Services            29,053         6.0<br/><br/>Fidessa                        Software &amp; Computer           28,044         5.8<br/>                               Services<br/><br/>Schroders                      Financial Services            26,655         5.5<br/><br/>Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (A  Media                         26,580         5.4<br/>Shares)<br/><br/>A.G.

The principal<br/>risks faced by the Company fall into the following broad categories: market<br/>price risk; interest rate risk; portfolio performance; operational and<br/>regulatory risk; credit risk; liquidity risk; investment management key person<br/>risk; availability of bank finance; inability to maintain a progressive<br/>dividend policy. Information on each of these areas, with the exception of the<br/>availability of bank finance and the Board's ability to maintain a progressive<br/>dividend policy, is given in the Report of the Directors within the Annual<br/>Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2013. The risk associated<br/>with the availability of bank finance is that the provider or any other lender<br/>may no longer be prepared to lend to the Company. Copies of the monthly loan<br/>covenant compliance certificates, provided for the lender, are circulated to<br/>the Board and both the Board and the Investment Manager are kept fully informed<br/>of any likelihood of the withdrawal of the loan facility so that repayment can<br/>be effected in an orderly fashion if necessary. With regard to the Company's<br/>dividend policy, the Board regularly reviews the Company's portfolio and also<br/>income forecasts prepared by the Manager; regular reports on the Company's<br/>income position are also made by the Company's Investment Manager at each Board<br/>meeting. The Company also maintains a distributable revenue reserve which can<br/>be used to help make up any shortfall in income received by the Company.<br/><br/>In the view of the Board these principal risks and uncertainties are applicable<br/>to the remaining six months of the financial year as they were to the six<br/>months under review.<br/><br/>Related Party Transactions<br/><br/>During the first six months of the current financial year, no transactions with<br/>related parties have taken place which have materially affected the financial<br/>position or the performance of the Company.<br/><br/>Going Concern<br/><br/>The Directors, having made relevant enquiries, are satisfied that it is<br/>appropriate to prepare financial statements on the going concern basis as the<br/>net assets of the Company consist of liquid securities, all of which, with the<br/>exception of the partnership interest in Frostrow Capital LLP, are traded on<br/>recognised stock exchanges.<br/><br/>Directors' Responsibilities<br/><br/>The Board of Directors confirms that, to the best of its knowledge:<br/><br/>(i) the condensed set of financial statements contained within the Half Year<br/>Report has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards;<br/>and<br/><br/>(ii) the interim management report includes a true and fair review of the<br/>information required by 4.2.7R and 4.2.8R of the UK Listing Authority and<br/>Transparency Rules.<br/><br/>The Half Year Report has not been reviewed or audited by the Company's<br/>auditors.<br/><br/>The Half Year Report was approved by the Board on 30 April 2014 and the above<br/>responsibility statement was signed on its behalf by:<br/><br/>Anthony Townsend<br/>Chairman<br/><br/>Glossary of Terms<br/><br/>AIFM<br/><br/>The Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (the \"Directive\") is a<br/>European Union Directive that entered into force on 22 July 2013. The Directive<br/>regulates EU fund managers that manage alternative investment funds (this<br/>includes investment trusts). There is a one-year transition period within which<br/>alternative funds must comply with the provisions of the Directive.<br/><br/>Discount or Premium<br/><br/>A description of the difference between the share price and the net asset value<br/>per share. The size of the discount or premium is calculated by subtracting the<br/>share price from the net asset value per share and is usually expressed as a<br/>percentage (%) of the net asset value per share. If the share price is higher<br/>than the net asset value per share the result is a premium. If the share price<br/>is lower than the net asset value per share, the shares are trading at a<br/>discount.<br/><br/>FTSE Disclaimer<br/><br/>\"FTSE\u00a9\" is a trade mark of the London Stock Exchange Group companies and is<br/>used by FTSE International Limited under licence.

The NAV is also described<br/>as `shareholders' funds' per share. The NAV is often expressed in pence per<br/>share after being divided by the number of shares which have been issued. The<br/>NAV per share is unlikely to be the same as the share price which is the price<br/>at which the Company's shares can be bought or sold by an investor.

And how will the marketing mix rebalance in a world where Goldman could go head-to-head with Google</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple Pay and Google Pay own the digital wallet market. Amazon and Alibaba have already loaned billions of dollars. And Facebook wants you to use Messenger to pay your friends back for dinner. Make no mistake, Silicon Valley tech giants are climbing into the financial services playground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade following the recession we've seen fintech startups precipitate incremental change in the financial services space. Disruptors have reimagined components of the financial services puzzle and nudged Wall Street into the digital age, creating the competition necessary to force traditional financial companies to compete on multiple fronts: product innovation, user experience, transparency and value.</p><p>But ultimately, fintech startups and Wall Street giants played nice. Many financial services companies saw the writing on the wall and decided that if they couldn't move quickly enough to incubate those innovations in-house, they could join forces with newcomers through strategic partnerships. It turned out this was the beginning of a mutually beneficial friendship, resulting in a huge win for consumers.</p><p>In 2015, Jamie Dimon gave his ominous warning that \"Silicon Valley is coming.\" Wall Street was able to weather the storm in subsequent years, but they're not out of the woods.</p><p>With a deep user base, tech looms large For Wall Street, Big Tech poses a threat to financial services that is, well, bigger. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet-currently the second, third and fourth largest companies in the United States-have something that the small fintech start-ups lack: Scale. A lot of it.</p><p>If Fintech 1.0 was all about plucky startups working to elevate the standards that consumers expected from financial services companies, Fintech 2.0 is about Silicon Valley behemoths turbocharging that mindset to their expansive user base with the backing of billions of dollars of capital.</p><p>These companies bring to the table the best cloud, data and AI resources on the planet. No one knows better than these giants how to surround a customer with an experience so seamlessly connected that the ease of use is worth the sacrifice of privacy (something traditional financial firms have struggled to deliver).</p><p>This is, in part, because most tech players have maintained reputations as friendly giants. Their Net Promoter Scores soar high above big banks. People are willing to give a company like Google all their information if it makes it easy to toggle between their laptop, their phone and an IoT device. What if Google's deep data troves could give you a holistic view of your financial picture too?</p><p>What does this mean for Wall Street? The bar for best-in-class UX is about to be raised again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 could impact competition</emphasis></p><p>Regulatory headwinds could slow Big Tech's penetration into finance. Just last month, Congress made moves to stymie Facebook and friends from launching their take on a cryptocurrency, Libra, with the aptly named \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act.\" And, in the first Democratic debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the breakup of America's largest tech players. With an election around the corner, it remains to be seen whether the House and Senate will turn red, purple or blue. But the political parties in power certainly will influence the future role that Big Tech can play in the financial services ecosystem.</p><p>Regardless of how things evolve, in the early innings of Fintech 2.0, Big Tech has already changed the game.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future of financial marketing comms</emphasis></p><p>Let's face it: Wall Street and Silicon Valley come from very different marketing communications schools of thought. As they square off in the fight for share of wallet, there are marketing and communications lessons that Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn from one another.</p><p>Dear Big Tech, don't forget thought leadership: In the years following the Financial Crisis, finance became commoditized-in product and cost-and the best way to win customer trust was in a race to capture share-of-voice through thought leadership.</p><p>Big firms launched thought leadership programs-often composed of a combination of proprietary research, earned media, content, and social/digital activations- that dug into consumers' emotional relationships with money, explored the role gender dynamics plays in investing and provided the tips to help people navigate financial decisions. Part group therapy, part actionable financial insights, consumer finance marketing communications became more human. This financial expertise and thought leadership is what sets traditional financial players apart from tech giants.</p><p>As Big Tech matures in the financial services realm, it could stand to take a leaf out of Wall Street's book, by going to market above product, addressing consumers' real desire for financial tips, education and empathy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street, it's time to evolve your value prop</emphasis>: Wall Street also has a big lesson to learn from Silicon Valley.</p><p>If Big Tech knows how to do one thing, it's to cultivate a user experience that is simple, well-designed and engaging. As these tech players dive fully into the financial services competitor set, customer expectations for user interface, PFM, smart analytics and AI are about to climb yet again.</p><p>In order to continue to thrive, traditional financial players will need to prove that they can match their counterparts in cultivating a compelling user experience that centers around an excellent product. As tech players challenge traditional financial models, Wall Street will need to make sure they're focusing on price, product and innovation as much as their competition is. Wall Street has shown itself to be resilient and-by and large-willing to evolve to keep up with their customers' expectations. If they can continue to lead the way in financial thought leadership while delivering on UX, they stand in good stead for the future.</p><p>The financial services marketplace is entering a second wave of rapid evolution. But if Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn a little from each other, then, ultimately, the end user will come out on top.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, Julia Bloch Mellon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSRVS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSRVS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT0-8J21-DYRW-V2K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 J.R.

And how will the marketing mix rebalance in a world where Goldman could go head-to-head with Google</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple Pay and Google Pay own the digital wallet market. Amazon and Alibaba have already loaned billions of dollars. And Facebook wants you to use Messenger to pay your friends back for dinner. Make no mistake, Silicon Valley tech giants are climbing into the financial services playground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade following the recession we've seen fintech startups precipitate incremental change in the financial services space. Disruptors have reimagined components of the financial services puzzle and nudged Wall Street into the digital age, creating the competition necessary to force traditional financial companies to compete on multiple fronts: product innovation, user experience, transparency and value.</p><p>But ultimately, fintech startups and Wall Street giants played nice. Many financial services companies saw the writing on the wall and decided that if they couldn't move quickly enough to incubate those innovations in-house, they could join forces with newcomers through strategic partnerships. It turned out this was the beginning of a mutually beneficial friendship, resulting in a huge win for consumers.</p><p>In 2015, Jamie Dimon gave his ominous warning that \"Silicon Valley is coming.\" Wall Street was able to weather the storm in subsequent years, but they're not out of the woods.</p><p>With a deep user base, tech looms large For Wall Street, Big Tech poses a threat to financial services that is, well, bigger. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet-currently the second, third and fourth largest companies in the United States-have something that the small fintech start-ups lack: Scale. A lot of it.</p><p>If Fintech 1.0 was all about plucky startups working to elevate the standards that consumers expected from financial services companies, Fintech 2.0 is about Silicon Valley behemoths turbocharging that mindset to their expansive user base with the backing of billions of dollars of capital.</p><p>These companies bring to the table the best cloud, data and AI resources on the planet. No one knows better than these giants how to surround a customer with an experience so seamlessly connected that the ease of use is worth the sacrifice of privacy (something traditional financial firms have struggled to deliver).</p><p>This is, in part, because most tech players have maintained reputations as friendly giants. Their Net Promoter Scores soar high above big banks. People are willing to give a company like Google all their information if it makes it easy to toggle between their laptop, their phone and an IoT device. What if Google's deep data troves could give you a holistic view of your financial picture too?</p><p>What does this mean for Wall Street? The bar for best-in-class UX is about to be raised again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 could impact competition</emphasis></p><p>Regulatory headwinds could slow Big Tech's penetration into finance. Just last month, Congress made moves to stymie Facebook and friends from launching their take on a cryptocurrency, Libra, with the aptly named \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act.\" And, in the first Democratic debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the breakup of America's largest tech players. With an election around the corner, it remains to be seen whether the House and Senate will turn red, purple or blue. But the political parties in power certainly will influence the future role that Big Tech can play in the financial services ecosystem.</p><p>Regardless of how things evolve, in the early innings of Fintech 2.0, Big Tech has already changed the game.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future of financial marketing comms</emphasis></p><p>Let's face it: Wall Street and Silicon Valley come from very different marketing communications schools of thought. As they square off in the fight for share of wallet, there are marketing and communications lessons that Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn from one another.</p><p>Dear Big Tech, don't forget thought leadership: In the years following the Financial Crisis, finance became commoditized-in product and cost-and the best way to win customer trust was in a race to capture share-of-voice through thought leadership.</p><p>Big firms launched thought leadership programs-often composed of a combination of proprietary research, earned media, content, and social/digital activations- that dug into consumers' emotional relationships with money, explored the role gender dynamics plays in investing and provided the tips to help people navigate financial decisions. Part group therapy, part actionable financial insights, consumer finance marketing communications became more human. This financial expertise and thought leadership is what sets traditional financial players apart from tech giants.</p><p>As Big Tech matures in the financial services realm, it could stand to take a leaf out of Wall Street's book, by going to market above product, addressing consumers' real desire for financial tips, education and empathy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street, it's time to evolve your value prop</emphasis>: Wall Street also has a big lesson to learn from Silicon Valley.</p><p>If Big Tech knows how to do one thing, it's to cultivate a user experience that is simple, well-designed and engaging. As these tech players dive fully into the financial services competitor set, customer expectations for user interface, PFM, smart analytics and AI are about to climb yet again.</p><p>In order to continue to thrive, traditional financial players will need to prove that they can match their counterparts in cultivating a compelling user experience that centers around an excellent product. As tech players challenge traditional financial models, Wall Street will need to make sure they're focusing on price, product and innovation as much as their competition is. Wall Street has shown itself to be resilient and-by and large-willing to evolve to keep up with their customers' expectations. If they can continue to lead the way in financial thought leadership while delivering on UX, they stand in good stead for the future.</p><p>The financial services marketplace is entering a second wave of rapid evolution. But if Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn a little from each other, then, ultimately, the end user will come out on top.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, Julia Bloch Mellon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSRVS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRSRVS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-8T21-DYRW-V530-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 J.R.

It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to the first IMF Fintech Roundtable.  <br/>Over the next couple of days, we\u2019ll discuss many of the pivotal issues faced by policymakers and regulators: What are the risks and benefits of new financial technologies\u2014including crypto-assets? What new challenges and opportunities confront central banks and financial markets? Will technology fundamentally change risk management and supervision? In a fast-changing environment, can we be confident that the financial-stability impact of new technologies can be managed?  </p><p><br/>Emerging technologies are dramatically transforming the financial services landscape \u2014 creating opportunities as well as challenges for consumers, service providers and regulators. New technologies could support the introduction of new services; drive efficiency gains in the financial sector; foster financial inclusion and financial deepening; and deliver widespread economic and social benefits.  <br/>To maximize the full potential of new financial technologies, policymakers must strike a sensible balance \u2014 creating a supportive space for innovation while maintaining a robust regulatory framework. Adopting well-designed standards can promote both certainty for innovators and safety for consumers.  <br/>Here at the Fund, we encourage our member countries to explore new technologies \u2014 by enhancing \u201cfintech\u201d awareness at official institutions; by creating controlled environments where new technologies can be tested; and by promoting financial education. Many countries are indeed working with fintech companies in innovation hubs and regulatory sandboxes, and we look forward to hearing about the lessons they\u2019ve learned.  <br/>We must remain aware, however, of potential risks that new technologies might pose \u2014 especially when they operate outside the purview of financial regulation and supervision.  <br/>Financial stability could be affected \u2014 through disruptions to existing service providers, business models, and market structure. Activities might also migrate to unregulated sectors; pose money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks; and create additional operational risks related to IT, cybercrime, and outsourcing. New technologies and new forms of intermediation may erode legal certainty, and the balance between transparency and privacy. The rapidly increasing use of customers\u2019 personal data raises concerns about the ethical use of data; accountability and ownership; and cybersecurity.  <br/>Recognizing both benefits and risks, the IMF has been closely monitoring developments in this field. The widespread adoption of new technologies is not only changing business models and providing widespread opportunities, but it\u2019s also challenging the thinking of financial regulators and supervisors. As they explore new ideas, they must keep in mind that the key factor \u2014 in fintech, as in all areas of financial services \u2014 is building confidence and strengthening public trust.  <br/>The Risks and Rewards of Crypto-Assets  <br/>One area, in particular, deserves our intense focus: the potential risks, and regulatory implications, of crypto-assets.  <br/>The rapid growth of crypto-assets has raised questions about the effectiveness of the current regulatory perimeter\u2014and about the ability of the existing regulatory architecture to adapt to changing conditions. The market capitalization of crypto-assets reached more than $900 billion early this year \u2013 a five-fold increase over the last year. There are now about 1,600 types of crypto-assets being traded worldwide. In 2017, there were 880 Initial Coin Offerings, which raised about $6 billion\u2014a vast increase over the previous year, when there were only 43 ICOs, which raised just $95 million.  <br/>Moreover: The market capitalization of crypto-assets may still be just a small fraction of the broader financial sector \u2014 but their extreme volatility, rapid growth among retail investors, and several spectacular cases of hacks and failures have recently intensified regulatory concerns. Stronger measures for investor and consumer protection are essential\u2014as are stronger safeguards against potential financial instability.  <br/>About half of last year\u2019s ICOs have already failed. Many small-scale investors have suffered dramatic losses. Confidence in the realm of crypto-assets has been shaken.  <br/>Amid the blow to market confidence: The question of regulating crypto-assets and exchanges is an important concern. It is no surprise that country authorities and IMF country teams continue to ask the Fund for advice on appropriate regulatory measures.  <br/>As we consider regulation, it\u2019s worth reflecting on whether crypto-assets truly qualify as \u201ccurrencies.\u201d After all, they\u2019re not a good unit of account; they\u2019re not a widespread medium of exchange; and they\u2019re not a stable store of value. So they cannot be accurately classified as \u201ccurrencies.\u201d Perhaps they\u2019re better-defined as digitally created vehicles that use cryptography for security, and that are native tokens of distributed ledgers or blockchains. Crypto-assets or digital tokens seem more appropriate terms.  <br/>Uncoordinated regulations could lead to fragmentation  <br/>By their very nature, crypto assets were created outside the boundaries of traditional regulatory frameworks. While many crypto-assets may not meet the definition of financial instruments, some of them function in a way that is similar to them.  <br/>It would be misguided to imagine that crypto-assets are currently beyond the reach of regulation. Some aspects of crypto-assets are already within the existing regulatory perimeter. For example: many ICOs qualify as \u201cpublic offerings of securities\u201d by securities regulators, and therefore they are covered by public-offering regulations and private-placement exceptions.  <br/>Some jurisdictions are also using their enforcement powers to prosecute fraud or the avoidance of applicable regulation, while issuing warnings to the public about crypto-assets\u2019 potentially fraudulent implications. Some regulators are licensing exchanges, or are treating them as money transmitters. Other jurisdictions have decided to ban ICOs altogether. Many crypto-exchanges and intermediaries are subject to anti-money-laundering regulations\u2014and, of course, they need to meet the standards preventing criminal abuse and fraud  <br/>The regulatory approaches are varied and jurisdiction specific. However, the nature of fintech services allows for businesses to easily and quickly move locations to optimize and arbitrage the regulatory treatments and many are already actively doing so.  <br/>Appropriate regulation would support innovation  <br/>Under the current fragmented approach, many important risks remain unaddressed. Regulatory frameworks should be tailored to address those new risks. Yet both policymakers and innovators should not see regulations as stifling innovation, but rather, as shaping an environment that helps build trust.  <br/>One of the main risks in the crypto-asset industry, after all, is regulatory uncertainty, including the risks of a major clampdown by authorities. Providing clear guidelines that ease uncertainty would help establish a solid foundation for crypto-assets to grow in a more sustainable manner.  <br/>International principles can already address identified risks  <br/>As we\u2019ve seen in many areas of financial regulation since the global financial crisis, we all work together to continue reaping the collective benefits of a safe and secure global financial system. The rapid pace of innovation, and its borderless nature, calls for building international consensus\u2014thus helping eliminate gaps in regulation that might provoke a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d  <br/>An early formation of an international consensus would also help strengthen public confidence, and would provide a smoother landscape for innovators. Effective regulation is essential in maintaining public confidence \u2014 because the larger and the more complex a system is, the bigger the shock when regulation is introduced.  <br/>Because the realm of crypto-assets is developing so fast, regulators should be wary of categorizing them too strictly, because narrow definitions might become obsolete overnight.  <br/>Instead, drawing on existing international principles for financial regulation \u2014 such as those of governance, auditing, client asset segregation, minimum capital, outsourcing, cyber-security, and disclosure\u2014could be applicable to publicly offered crypto-assets and exchanges. Applying such principles will help authorities address the new risks more quickly and more consistently.  <br/>ICOs should face regulation  <br/>In addition, it\u2019s vital that crypto-assets be subject to certain regulation. If crypto-assets are offered to the general public, are expected to be tradable, and are invested with some expectation of financial return, then such assets should be subject to regulations like other types of asset. Threats to market integrity, such as manipulation and insider trading, surely make crypto-assets subject to enforcement action. In addition, ETFs, investment funds and derivatives of crypto-assets clearly warrant regulation.  <br/>Regulators should also consider their own risk appetite: Are current regulatory boundaries effective in preventing the abuse of retail investors? Are current enforcement approaches sufficient? Even if current enforcement approaches were enhanced, and perhaps coupled with targeted investor-education programs, they might be unable to ensure investor protection. That kind of flaw might provoke a loss of trust in the financial system more broadly.  <br/>Crypto-exchanges should be supervised actively  <br/>Crypto-exchanges today have risks that are not being properly addressed. Some authorities have already started to address anti-money-laundering and fraud risks but, clearly, more needs to be done. While crypto-exchanges provide market-making and some may provide margin-lending services, and liquidity support to clients, their risks are often overlooked. The higher volatility of the underlying assets implies significant market risks in the exchanges\u2019 inventories. It also means material counterparty default risk to the investors to whom the exchanges provide margin lending \u2014 because required margins may not be enough to cover the loss of their positions if the price change is greater than that modeled in the margin calculation.  <br/>The exchanges may also face liquidity risk, if the cash deposited from investors is not segregated and if it has been used for other purposes, such as inventory purchase of illiquid crypto-assets or provided for leveraged trading of other clients. Some exchanges, focusing only on crypto-assets, don\u2019t accept any fiat currencies \u2014 a factor that could make their liquidity management more difficult.  <br/>Certain risks, in fact, are intrinsic to crypto-exchanges\u2019 business model \u2013 operational risks and cyber risks, for example. The recent breach of the crypto-exchange Coincheck shows that cyber losses (about $500 million) were higher than its total registered capital. Due to those inherent risks, crypto-exchanges should be subject to intrusive supervision.  <br/>Enhanced monitoring should be prioritized  <br/>In our roundtable here this week, we can be frank about yet another considerable risk: the knowledge gap, or \u201cFintech awareness gap.\u201d This goes beyond the divide that exists between Fintech entrepreneurs and regulators. Many supervisors do not have a good understanding about how their own supervised entities are exposed to crypto-assets, or how the risks of those assets could affect the financial sector. Many are seeking to adapt to the new crypto environment, yet many regulators are not prepared to face the growing risks, given their legal mandates and limited resources. If supervision falters or fails, there is a great risk of reputational damage to regulators and the financial sector as a whole. That risk calls for prompt and coordinated action.  <br/>Financial regulators must address data gaps and monitor the risk of contagion from crypto-assets to the broader financial sector. Let\u2019s not take too much comfort from the fact that, today, the direct exposure of the financial sector to crypto-assets seems limited. There are growing risks of indirect exposures, such as investments in related technologies, lending to crypto-investors, and the offering of futures trading to their clients. Supervisors should continue monitoring exposures to crypto-assets in a direct and indirect manner and encourage them to limit their exposures more carefully, when needed. Material exposures require a prudential treatment.  <br/>Conclusion  <br/>Regulation does not offer the answer to every fintech dilemma \u2014 yet it is certainly needed when distortions, excessive arbitrage, market abuse, and the risk of contagion pose a danger to consumers, investors and the broader financial system. Regulatory boundaries may need to be revised, given the cross-sector and cross-border growth of the crypto-asset sector \u2014 and that fact means that building a global consensus and consistent application of regulation is essential.  <br/>Financial innovation is occurring at a time when public trust in the financial sector is low, and when financial intermediation is moving toward less-regulated sectors. Yet leaps in computing power, technology, big-data analytics, and big-tech business models are poised to transform the landscape of the financial sector. These new challenges call for a far-reaching regulatory response.  <br/>Crypto-assets exemplify why policymakers and international institutions must coordinate more closely than ever. Cooperation and coordination are needed to meet every aspect of the fintech challenge. Developing and acquiring deep expertise \u2014 bringing together technology, finance, law enforcement, prudential regulation and public policy\u2014is more vital than ever before.  <br/>Over the next couple of days, our discussions will clarify where we need to work together, and explore how we can strengthen our work together \u2014 and they\u2019ll help identify areas where the IMF can help facilitate a global dialogue.  <br/>To help capture the greatest benefit from continuing waves of innovation, we must help build trust in new technologies \u2014 by promoting an atmosphere that encourages creativity, without sacrificing consumer protection or systemic safety. If regulators devise frameworks that strengthen public trust, they can inspire entrepreneurship and unleash the full creative energies of technology innovators.  <br/>I\u2019m looking forward to imaginative and productive discussions with all of you, and I wish you every success here at this week\u2019s roundtable.  <br/>Thank you very much. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN737412920180412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3B-VS21-J9XT-P277-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2442\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

However, there is one outstanding issue that the authorities must consider to consolidate and strengthen the ecosystem of financial technology (fintech) platforms, and it is to avoid monopoly practices in this sector, which could be due to the emergence of big tech to financial services, said Rafael de la Parra, CEO of the Enso digital wallet.</p><p><br/>In interview, De la Parra commented that the Fintech Law is an important step for the consolidation of the ecosystem, and highlighted the regulatory challenges that this platform had to meet to request its authorization and operate under that legal framework.<br/>\"The outstanding issue of the regulations is that there are provisions that prevent potential monopolistic practices of some players in the future, and in particular there is always the fear of big tech. So, that's a topic where there's work to be done. However, the law is a big step,\" De la Parra said.<br/>On 25 September, the deadline for fintechoperating before the enactment of the regulations expired in March 2018 to request their authorization to operate under that legal framework expired.<br/>According to information from the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), a total of 85 companies entered their application for authorization, of which 60 applied to operate as institutions of electronic payment funds (or digital wallets) and 25 as financing collective, who are the two figures contemplating the law.<br/>In the category of institutions of electronic payment funds enters Enso, according to its CEO, because it is a digital wallet that is dedicated to transfers between people, without the need for complicated processes.<br/>\"People are liking what we offer, which are tools that, by allowing money transfers between people through a cell phone, make it easier to have clear accounts and long friendships, which facilitate the flow of money and that help replace the use of effective,\" said the Enso executive.<br/>Something that had never been done<br/>According to De la Parra, complying with the requirements required by law to apply for authorization to operate under the legal framework was not an easy task, because many things had to be done that in Mexico had never been done and that were established in the law.<br/>\"Part of the complexity was the amount of things they requested and coordinated within the organization all the areas, which were doing their day-to-day work and that, in addition, they had to be doing all the documentation (...) and at the same time working with external suppliers who supported us with several of these issues,\" de la Parra said.<br/>The Enso executive commented that the Fintech Act will allow users to use more digital platforms for the use of financial services, as it will give them certainty that these organizations are supervised by financial authorities.<br/>\"The Fintech Act helps, avoiding projects that don't work well and don't work properly, so that users can adopt these services more, with the confidence that things work the way they should,\" he added.<br/>De la Parra commented that after the legal deadline for fintechs to enter their application to operate under the law, the authorities will have to act with the platforms that perform the activities reserved in the regulations without being attached to the legal framework.<br/>\"You have to see the response of theauthorities with platforms that did not apply for their licence, to prevent these companies from continuing to operate in an irregular manner,\" said the Enso executive, who currently has nearly 14,000 users and who expects to receive his authorization to operate under the law, in the first months of 2020.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

While banks, credit unions and other traditional lenders remain the chief source of finance in most economies, with capital markets playing an important role in some cases, new intermediaries have recently emerged. In particular, digital lending models such as peer-to-peer and marketplace lending have grown in many economies in the past decade. These types of credit, facilitated by online platforms rather than traditional banks or lending companies, are referred to as 'fintech credit'. Moreover, in the past few years, many large companies whose primarily business is technology (big techs) have entered credit markets, providing 'big tech credit' either directly or in partnership with financial institutions.Contribution</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Information on the size and characteristics of fintech and big tech credit is scarce. In this paper, we assemble and update available data on fintech and big tech credit volumes for 79 countries around the world over 2013-19. The database is made available as a resource for researchers, policymakers and practitioners. We answer the questions: how large are fintech and big tech credit markets, both in absolute terms and relative to overall credit markets? What economic and institutional factors are driving their growth and adoption? How large and important could they become in the future?Findings</p><p>We find that in 2019, fintech and big tech credit (together 'total alternative credit') reached nearly USD 800 billion globally. Big tech credit has shown particularly rapid growth in Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia), and some countries in Africa and Latin America. By contrast, fintech credit volumes declined in 2018-19 due to market and regulatory developments in China. Outside China, fintech credit is still growing. We find that these alternative forms of credit are more developed in countries with higher GDP per capita (at a declining rate), where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where banking regulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is also more developed where there are fewer bank branches per capita. We find that these alternative forms of credit are more developed where the ease of doing business is greater, investor protection disclosure and the efficiency of the judicial system are more advanced, the bank credit-to-deposit ratio is lower, and where bond and equity markets are more developed. Overall, both fintech and big tech credit seems to complement other forms of credit, rather than substitute for them,\u00ad and may increase overall access to credit.Abstract</p><p>Fintech and big tech platforms have expanded their lending around the world. We estimate that the flow of these new forms of credit reached USD 223 billion and USD 572 billion in 2019, respectively. China, the United States and the United Kingdom are the largest markets for fintech credit. Big tech credit is growing fast in China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and some countries in Africa and Latin America. Cross-country panel regressions show that such lending is more developed in countries with higher GDP per capita (at a declining rate), where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where banking regulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is larger where there are fewer bank branches per capita. We also find that fintech and big tech credit are more developed where the ease of doing business is greater, and investor protection disclosure and the efficiency of the judicial system are more advanced, the bank creditto- deposit ratio is lower and where bond and equity markets are more developed. Overall, alternative credit seems to complement other forms of credit, rather than substitute for them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMFNNW-IFN6035991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMFNNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X2-M321-F0YC-N4P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438639</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact Financial News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56566\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Facebook is set today to release long-awaited details about its new cryptocurrency and in the process outline the coin's basic operations and function. It's a big moment. If successful, the new cryptocurrency could enable Facebook's 2.3 billion users to make purchases via WhatsApp, Facebook's website and likely elsewhere online. </p><p>There's a ton of suspense accompanying the rollout, but even with all the hoopla, I'm wagering that today's announcement won't resolve the considerable questions facing Facebook about how the coin should be regulated.</p><p>Congressional questions</p><p>Regulation has been a topic of conversation since May, when the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally to inquire about sensitive issues surrounding the coin, including:</p><p>   *</p><p>How the cryptocurrency based payment system would work, and whether the firm has reached out to financial regulators;</p><p>   *</p><p>Whether the company has information bearing on an individual's creditworthiness, mode of living, reputation to establish eligibility for housing, credit, insurance or employment;</p><p>   *</p><p>The privacy and consumer protections available to users;</p><p>   *</p><p>How the company plans to protect consumer financial information;</p><p>   *</p><p>Whether Facebook shares or sells consumer information with unaffiliated third parties.</p><p>Though privacy and consumer protection questions remain by far the most concerning, the questions involving financial regulation are not exactly easy. One heavily reported story in recent months has involved comments made by the SEC's \"Crypto Czar,\" Valerie Szczepanik, that stablecoins -- private cryptocurrencies not intended to fluctuate in value but to instead be used as instruments of payments -- could be deemed securities. Though it's unlikely in this case given what I've heard thus far, the issue is still probably murkier than one might think.</p><p>Just to underline the stakes, it's useful to remember that when any financial product -- stablecoin or otherwise -- is a security, an entire securities-based infrastructure for the stablecoins is necessary. Companies would have to register with securities authorities, and the coins themselves would only be able to be traded on a licensed securities exchange and handled by registered broker dealers.</p><p>Beyond Howey</p><p>Usually, when lawyers think about whether a cryptocurrency has to be registered with the SEC, they go through the analysis outlined in the famous 1946 Supreme Court case, SEC vs. Howey. There the court says a financial product is deemed to be an \"investment contract\" (and thus a security) where there is 1) an investment of money in 2) a common enterprise with 3) an expectation of profit where 4) investors depend on the efforts of others. Under this standard, purchasers are not expecting a profit insofar as the price is intended to remain stable. Indeed, in public remarks, Szczepanik laid out several categories of stablecoins suggesting that those pegged to fiat currencies are not securities.</p><p>However, the Facebook coin is reportedly based on a special basket of currencies, which arguably makes the coin valuable -- and it's up to the management to keep the balance of fiat currencies \"correct\" to ensure the coin has representative value. So I've heard from some very serious, very senior lawyers who believe that Howey likely kicks in. (Though I'm not so sure).</p><p>But -- and here's the ambiguity -- the Howey test isn't the only way a financial instrument might be deemed a security. Sometimes, an instrument might involve all the essential economic features of financial products already regulated under securities laws. Or other tests or standards might be applicable.</p><p>For example, all kinds of questions have been quietly raised in boardrooms about stablecoins -- like, could a stablecoin issuer be deemed a money market fund? -- but perhaps the most interesting is whether a stablecoin could be viewed as a debt instrument, and in particular, a demand note, since holders of stablecoins can usually exchange them at will for fiat currency and Treasurys.  </p><p>At first blush, this is absurd -- especially since most stablecoins don't pay interest. But the relevant test here may not be Howey. Instead, the yardstick could be the test provided in the Supreme Court case Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young -- decided in 1990 and which specifically tackles the issue of what kinds of \"notes\" are securities, but it is even less clear than Howey as to how it should be applied.  </p><p>And whether interest is paid is of only partial importance. Reves holds that notes are presumptively securities unless they bear a family resemblance to a certain subset of notes, tied generally to consumer finance, that courts have recognized are not securities. The court also provides factors to help to determine whether a financial product resembles the items in its list of non-security notes. Among the factors are:</p><p>   *</p><p>The seller's and buyers' motives;</p><p>   *</p><p>The plan of distribution (suggesting potential speculation by purchasers); </p><p>   *</p><p>The reasonable expectations of the investing public; and</p><p>   *</p><p>The availability of an alternative regulatory regime.</p><p>Unlike Howey, however, not all factors have to be present to meet the test. And many stablecoins will fall in the middle. In Facebook's case, for example, the company isn't trying to raise capital, but reports seem to suggest the plan of distribution could be enormous. Buyers shouldn't be motivated to profit from the coin, but might very well expect some kind of federal protection; however, the ultimate assets to which the coins are pegged may be held by trusts -- which are regulated under state law and have little likelihood of default -- likely meeting the alternative regulatory regime requirement. </p><p>Facts and circumstances at the SEC</p><p>Now let me be clear: what I've done is a very doctrinal exercise, not a common sense one. And courts may be hard pressed to actually conclude that the coin is a security. You'd think the SEC might be eager to provide clarity for not just Facebook, but future stablecoin issuers. Yet the agency has not always engaged the market in a way that addresses legal and doctrinal issues with nuance. Instead, some guidance appears to combine, and even mix and match criteria from different cases -- and across different categories of securities. In short, even though securities law emphasizes \"facts and circumstances,\" the agency at times pinpoints \"facts,\" without always elucidating the \"circumstances.\"</p><p>But in fairness to the agency, these kinds of questions underscore just how quickly things can get complicated in the world of cryptocurrencies, SEC guidance notwithstanding. And when a big tech firm like Facebook, warts and all, is looking to disrupt an industry that itself aims to be disruptive, questions are sure to arise -- and linger.  </p><p>Brummer is co-founder of Fintech Beat, CQ Roll Call's deep dive on how technology is transforming the banking and financial services sector.

The wealthier the neighborhood where you bought the toothbrush, the more it redounds to your credit. Savvy business, perhaps -- credit by association? But what if you shop in a neighborhood with poorer minority residents, and your credit score is lowered by the purchase?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to artificial intelligence and alternative data, where software programs potentially enable lower rates for underserved populations by taking into account factors -- like regular rent payments -- traditionally ignored by creditors, but may also find new ways to replicate the type of discrimination frowned upon -- and often prohibited -- when human beings are making the judgment.</p><p>This is as much a big tech story as a fintech one: many online companies develop or rely on computerized instructions -- algorithms -- to determine what ads to show customers, what prices to charge for certain products, and more. Fintech firms have a special stake in the issue because the algorithms are integral to decisions about consumer loans, the cost of credit, insurance and more.</p><p>The story goes to the heart of debates on wealth inequality, with studies now routinely identifying the yawning racial wealth gap.</p><p>Washington is starting to notice -- and trying to address the issue.</p><p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development took action in March against Facebook for violating fair housing laws. The company had come under scrutiny from ProPublica reporters who found that Facebook's \"ethnic affinities\" tool could be used to exclude black or Hispanic users from seeing specific ads.</p><p>Three Democrats, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Yvette D. Clarke of New York, introduced legislation (S 1108 and HR 2231) this month that would require tech firms with more than $50 million in revenue, or holding data on more than a million people, to probe and test for bias the algorithms they use.</p><p>Readers won't find it hard to extrapolate to other sectors the risks of discrimination from the Facebook case. Artificial intelligence can find data correlations a human being may not see, and may draw conclusions from data that human beings know are illegal or wrong. Lenders know they can't discriminate based on race, sex or religion, for example. But what about a computer that finds a reliable proxy to indicate race, sex or religion?</p><p>The proposed legislation met criticism from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank. \"To hold algorithms to a higher standard than human decisions implies that automated decisions are inherently less trustworthy or more dangerous than human ones, which is not the case,\" a spokesman claimed.</p><p>But I'm not sure that's an accurate reading since the bills appear to extend to algorithms regulatory expectations in other areas where human beings have been the integral actors. </p><p>Bias is already illegal in many sectors, and, if perpetrated by regulated entities like banks, can violate federal and state laws. Even nonbanks could, at least in theory, find themselves open to lawsuits for \"unfair\" practices insofar as bias is, well, just that.</p><p>With an expanding array of fintech applications poised to become more important than ever, the pressure to oversee algorithms is inevitable. But tackling bias won't be easy. Among the reasons is that algorithmic bias may not be intended by those who develop the programs. Yet the programs themselves can define target variables even if they are prohibited from using a protected trait. Computers can find proxies that reliably represent the trait. That ability means an endless cat-and-mouse game of identifying and enforcing bias law.</p><p>The House and Senate bills include provisions that may hint at what's to come as Washington, and others, try to prevent bias in artificial intelligence.</p><p>- Firms would have to assess their algorithms, and describe what they're doing. They wouldn't have to share the information, but they would have to figure out -- at least for themselves -- just what is the \"secret sauce\" behind their products. And presumably the Federal Trade Commission would be able to inspect it.</p><p>- Firms would consider not only the deployment of data, but also its storage, because the bills combine data protection with consumer protection.</p><p>- Firms would have to assess for inaccurate, unfair, biased or discriminatory decisions impacting consumers. The bills don't explicitly define bias, and could therefore entail more than just unfair acts against constitutionally protected groups of citizens.</p><p>Piece by piece, rules could start to nudge fintech and big tech firms alike into making more decisive, proactive changes to their business operations.</p><p>Chris Brummer is co-founder of Fintech Beat, CQ Roll Call's deep dive on how technology is transforming the banking and financial services sector.

The ride-hailing giant was listed on May 10 at $45 a share and it's been mostly falling since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But make no mistake, Uber's initial public offering -- along with those of Lyft, Zoom, Pinterest and Airbnb -- still made history. IPOs of startups with valuations of at least $1 billion, the so-called unicorns, are looking almost routine. The year may not exactly be replicating the wave of internet offerings in the 1990s, but the valuations -- Uber was worth more than $70 billion at the May 17 close -- are such that most cheerleaders of American capitalism could declare that initial public offerings are back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, not everyone's clapping. In fact, some are downright concerned, and not for Uber. A closer look shows not all tech companies have sprinted to IPO markets. Indeed, one subset of companies has, if anything, had an aversion to public offerings -- fintech firms.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Lawmakers have been trying to help companies raise equity in the capital markets for years. Congress passed legislation in 2012, the Jobs Act (PL 112-106), that was intended to make that easier, including by removing obstacles to raising equity capital privately, which allows startup companies to remain with founders and venture capitalist firms a bit longer before they list their shares on an exchange.</p><p>One theory about the missing fintech IPOs is that the 2012 law gave entrepreneurs more routes to raise capital, and in amounts that had previously been available only through IPOs. Moreover, firms are now permitted to have more shareholders before being required to go public.</p><p>It's an important insight since venture capital firms are clamoring for fintech investments and they have plenty of money to allocate. Equity funding backed by venture capitalists ballooned to $12 billion over 659 deals in 2018, according to CB Insights, a research company. Twenty-five companies, including fintech firms Stripe, Coinbase and Robinhood, raised $5 billion.</p><p>As a result, IPOs, the traditional path that led growing companies to more investors and more capital, are now optional for fintech founders.</p><p>There's another explanation, however, that may be more straightforward: Fintech firms tend to be younger than the big tech companies issuing shares publicly this year. Airbnb was founded in 2008; Uber and Pinterest in 2009. Fintechs were founded a bit later: Stripe, for example, was founded in 2010, Sofi in 2011, and Avant and Coinbase in 2012.</p><p>Uber has had three more years than Coinbase to prepare for going public. The implication is that the fintechs aren't ready, not that they've found another route to the capital. That view has support in broad market data. Jay Ritter, a University of Florida finance professor, has found that the median age of firms going public in 2018 was 12 years. That's older than used to be the case.</p><p>There's a third possible reason fintechs aren't going public: regulatory uncertainty. For many, the rules or the application of the rules governing their businesses are unclear. Big tech firms have regulatory changes as well -- just look at possible Federal Trade Commission fines of Facebook.</p><p>But the regulatory questions are existential ones for fintech. A cryptocurrency exchange still can't say definitively which cryptocurrencies are least likely to be deemed securities. The SEC hasn't said what methods it will consider suitable for custody of assets. Fintech lenders are still waiting for courts to determine how and whether loans purchased from banks will violate state usury laws. Bank services providers don't know whether they'll have to comply with bank-like, prudential regulations.</p><p>IPOs eat up managers' time and effort as they disclose financial results, operations and strategy. But regulatory uncertainty makes it impossible to provide investors with reliable information on growth. Try valuing such an IPO in a market that looks at growth potential rather than profits.</p><p>Would all those things chill investors' interest in an IPO? Hard to say. Venture capitalists are enthusiastic, plowing 120 percent more money into fintechs in 2018 than a year earlier. Give retail investors the same opportunity and they might make similar bets.</p><p>The irony of all this delay, however warranted, is that it could still pose a fourth, future problem for fintech IPOs: lack of enthusiasm from retail investors who suspect the value has been squeezed out of the equity by the time it reaches the listing. Only time will tell if their eventual performances on Wall Street will fare better than Uber's.</p><p>Chris Brummer is co-founder of Fintech Beat, CQ Roll Call's deep dive on how technology is transforming the banking and financial services sector.

With $250 billion of revenue at stake, wholesale payments and cash management is a battleground that banks need to defend.\"In the first half of 2018, revenues for PCM jumped 10%, and the firm forecasts annual growth of 5% over the next five years, propelled by growing volumes and rising interest rates that look more than able to offset margin compression.Rising competitionThere has already been a huge rise in investment into payments technology. According to a KPMG report, \"~The pulse of fintech', overall investment into fintech across venture capital, private equity and mergers and acquisitions deals in the first half of 2018 already exceeded the total investment in the whole of 2017.\"Globally, we are starting to see more mid-tier banks \"\" in addition to insurance and wealth management companies \"\" have recognized the need to embrace fintech and are making investments either directly or through participation in accelerators, incubators or innovation consortia,\" writes Anton Ruddenklau, global co-leader of fintech at KPMG International and co-author of the report.This includes fintech specialists such as TransferWise and Revolt, software providers like Xero and Sage, and large technology and platform businesses such as Apple and Alibaba.Marty Chavez, CFO at Goldman Sachs, told Oliver Wyman: \"[Transaction banking] \"\" that's an opportunity right there. The adjacencies to our core franchise are striking and obvious... And then also the adjacency to our foreign exchange business is obvious.\"Meanwhile, blockchain technology is increasingly being used to improve the efficiency of post-trade infrastructure in electronic FX trading, as well as to reduce back-office costs. This could eventually lead to the complete elimination of human involvement in post-trade workflow.Rise to the challengeTo compete in this new environment, banks and treasurers face a double challenge of trying to squeeze more value from existing operations, while also building new capabilities to rival the market disruptors.Marc Delbaere, head of corporates and trade at Swift, outlines three key elements that can ensure the<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Marc Delbaere, head of corporates and trade atSwift</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table> success of new projects in wholesale PCM.</p><p>\"Firstly, those banks that understand and address the pain points of corporates will fare well \"\" and those that are able to incorporate the feedback of users will inevitably fare best of all,\" he says. \"Secondly, banks that are able to implement their offerings on a global scale \"\" and get to critical mass fast \"\" will be at a major advantage.</p><p>\"Thirdly, success favours those that are able to start small and deliver value fast \"\" scaling up their offering as they go along.\"</p><p>This is the approach Swift took with developing its global payments innovation (gpi) for corporates (g4C) \"\" a new multi-bank payments tracking solution for corporates. This initiative was driven by corporate requirements and implemented in a standard way by the largest banks, with further enhancements expected down the line.Legacy systems</p><p>A key area where existing players need to make improvements is switching from legacy systems, which have long suffered from underinvestment and can be extremely costly to maintain.</p><p>According to Oliver Wyman, simple maintenance of \"flawed old systems\" can cost the largest players some $200 million to $300 million a year \"\" up to 15% of revenues. Meanwhile, clients who have chosen to build new digital banks from scratch have been able to do so for less than $200 million in under a year.</p><p>O'Kelly writes: \"Of course, wholesale payments is a different business. But the size of the prize is sufficiently large, and the cost of a targeted bet sufficiently small, that many challengers and more innovative incumbents are looking for ways to apply these techniques in the wholesale payments business.</p><p>\"Lessons from big tech tell us that where there are unmet needs, or high margins, new and nimble challengers will find a way to provide compelling solutions. Challengers are presented with a large market, ripe for disruption. Incumbents must rise to the challenge and find ways to deliver a generational change in wholesale payments.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1by2rd31qk9p8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXR-RM11-F0GS-H29T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000569J</classCode><className>OLIVER WYMAN GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002MJ2</classCode><className>KPMG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00069NT</classCode><className>KPMG INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

Throw in paltry interest rates killing the profitability of lending, plus the prospect of widespread loan defaults, and it's not surprising London's banking shares are cheaper than at any time since the 2008-09 financial crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By contrast, technology stocks have soared in 2020 and the future of finance is also where digital revolution meets the business of money. That doesn't just mean banks; insurance, payments, alternative lending, wealth management and even real estate are all touched by the proliferation of financial technology start-ups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fintech, therefore, is an incredibly broad church. Buying into innovation that's transforming how we earn, bank, invest and pay for goods and services sounds compelling, but the parts of that proposition each have their own pitfalls, and some are more easily investable than others.</p><p>Holding an S&amp;P 500 tracker fund gives sizeable exposure to the explosion in payments technology, albeit the shares are expensive. As well as highly valued Mastercard (US:MA) and Visa (US:V), owning Apple (US:AAPL), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Amazon (US:AMZN) includes a play on transactions.</p><p>Likewise, many Asia funds include Chinese tech giants Tencent (HK:0700) and Alibaba (HK:9988) and the same will surely be true of payments leader Ant Group - the world's largest fintech company - when it lists on mainland Chinese and Hong Kong exchanges in what looks set to be one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) ever seen.</p><p>Smaller companies, which are often pioneers and become takeover targets for the big players, are more elusive. The same is true of so-called neo banks, such as Monzo, Revolut, N26 and Starling, although these disruptors face uncertainties in the time of coronavirus.</p><p>Pandemic aside, governance issues are foremost when it comes to upstarts in whatever sphere of finance. That isn't to suggest impropriety, but there can be difficulty balancing tech wizards' focus on brilliant ideas and investors retaining visibility, including over timeframes and payback, although fintech's image has recently faced more serious issues than stereotypes of bearded hipster chief executives.</p><p>                      technology stocks have soared in 2020 and the future of finance is also where digital revolution meets the business of money Europe's fintech industry was rocked by the Wirecard scandal; when gross accounting irregularities at the German platform prompted regulators to freeze the assets of payment systems plugged into its infrastructure. This in turn affected thousands of small businesses using services such as Anna to manage their vital day-to-day cash flow.Financial misconduct is not just a 21st century phenomenon, though, and, arguably, fintech innovations will ultimately make deceit harder. What's undeniable is that this is one of the most exciting parts of the global economy. Research by CB Insights at the end of June 2020 counted 66 tech unicorns (defined as an unlisted business valued at over $1bn) backed by venture capital (VC), worth $248bn in aggregate.That excludes Ant Group, which is aiming for a world record IPO of $35bn, because its current ownership and funding structure doesn't fit CBI's definition of VC-backed. The omission only serves to underline the breadth of opportunities, although with many fast-growing businesses still not publicly listed, private investors in the UK must rely on a few specialist funds to get a piece of the action.Professional expertise can distinguish the sausage from the sizzleAs well as being able to buy a stake in companies at pre-IPO funding rounds, fund managers' expertise in weighing up the exciting stories and harsh fundamental realities is invaluable. Neo-banks are a perfect example. On the one hand lockdowns are driving use of mobile banking apps, which is good news for companies that excel in providing that experience; but on the other hand, forcing populations into hibernation left funding conditions largely contingent on central banks. Some models are inherently less resilient. Monzo, for example, relies heavily on interchange income from card transactions by its millennial customer base. Shutting down expensive coffee shops and grounding city-break travellers choked off that source of revenue.Furthermore, although deposits did increase by \u00a3930.7m in 2019-20, it is unclear what percentage of its 3.9m customers used Monzo as their primary account. If customers were just funnelling cash into Monzo to take advantage of features such as low foreign exchange commission when visiting abroad, then clearly lockdowns and travel bans will have hit the company hard.Focusing on robust core metrics is crucial and has informed Merian Chrysalis Investment Company's (MERI) holding of Starling Bank. As well as opening 1.5m accounts (including nearly 200,000 business accounts) since launch of the banking app in May 2017, the deposit base has swelled to more than \u00a33bn.Merian Chrysalis co-manager Richard Watts says: \"We are extremely pleased with the progress of Starling since we invested and more recently against a tough backdrop. Starling is building a sustainable bank with proven economics, evidenced by the fact that the business is set to reach profitability by the end of the financial year.\" Fund managers' expertise in weighing up the exciting stories and harsh fundamental realities is invaluable </p><p>Building a strong position in the small to medium enterprise (SME) market is a strength, but the effects of further restrictions to contain coronavirus this winter must be considered a threat, too. Starling bank has \u00a3900m of SME loans on its balance sheet, but has been accredited for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, which should help it support its customers and stay resilient.</p><p>By contrast, Monzo appeared much less assured when it released its annual numbers, with the report flagging a material risk to the business as a going concern. Investor doubts were already evident when its series G funding priced the company at a 40 per cent discount to its previous valuation.</p><p>A shake-up at board level has seen youthful founder Tom Blomfield step aside as chief executive for TS Anil, a banker with 25 years' experience, who had been heading Monzo's expansion into the US.</p><p>Changes are to be expected both in management and strategy as fintech businesses mature and strive to become profitable. German bank N26 has shifted its commercial focus, exiting the UK market and focusing on the US and Brazil.</p><p>There is also stiff competition in larger countries. Nubank, headquartered in Sao Paulo, has grown its user base by 25 per cent since the start of 2020 despite (or perhaps because of) Brazil suffering badly from coronavirus. Likewise, in America there are success stories such as Varo out of San Francisco. It has doubled users to 2m since late 2019 and has also seen a 350 per cent rise in deposits.</p><p>                     Banking on lower costs and a better customer experience                   </p><p>Funding and solvency remain the primary questions for any bank, neo or otherwise, but for those already on a path to sustainable growth there are considerable cost advantages both in providing services and winning customers.</p><p>June's Capgemini Global Banking Survey revealed distribution and channel costs for digital-only banks have much lower costs as a percentage of operating income and an average cost per customer acquisition of between $1 and $38, compared with $200 for incumbent banks.</p><p>Competition from nimble upstarts is yet another headwind for UK-listed banks, which struggle to move as fast to improve customer experience. Neo banks leverage partnerships with flexible open-platform technology and have built and managed their customer databases since rigid data protection rules came into force. This enables them to rapidly implement learnings to keep improving digital banking.</p><p>Hope for the incumbents could be at hand, however. More fintech businesses are now emerging not only to disrupt large banks and other corporates, but to help them adapt. For example, Yobota offers platform solutions that can help financial companies deal with legacy technology stacks. Furthermore, the open yet secure nature of technology, means incumbents could take advantage of several best-in-class vendors to solve problems.</p><p>Explaining the proposition, Yobota chief executive Ammar Akhtar says: \"In an age of API [application programming interfaces] interoperability, where everyone designs their product as a service, the complex integration problem many large banks and corporates face kind of goes away.\"</p><p>Potentially that means, with the right providers, big banks can rapidly improve their operations, including processing, account services, payments, credit decisions, identification checks and user experience in all important channels such as mobile. The challenge should not be underestimated, however, with the question of data (a heavily regulated area) to the fore.</p><p>The siloed nature of data capture over many years means traditional banks face a Herculean task in putting to use the vast pools of information they hold. Just over a quarter of incumbent banks were rated as data experts by the Capgemini report. Those that lag in this core competency face a serious barrier to matching the hyper-personalised experience offered by the neo banks.</p><p>When it comes to competitive advantage, the new banks with sustainable models and resilient balance sheets are in something of a sweet spot. Early-mover advantage has been had and it would be harder for further market entrants to get established.</p><p>Consolidation could be the order of the day in the current climate, although Chime bank (which is now America's highest-valued fintech) continues to innovate. Automated savings and especially a feature speeding up the clearing of salaries, could be game changing. Furthermore, Chime's zero fee mobile payments also cut time between transfers.</p><p>                     Payments the prize for Big Tech                    </p><p>Integrating the process of moving money with messaging apps is a cornerstone of tech companies' strategies for emerging markets. Users want to seamlessly make payments and chat simultaneously on their smartphones without toggling through tabs.</p><p>Western businesses lag China's WeChat (owned by Tencent), but are making huge investments. Facebook's (US:FB) main social media platform and WhatsApp, which it owns, are integrating payments - the decision to trial in India speaks volumes. Amazon, Google and Apple are also making strides.</p><p>Emphasis isn't just on emerging markets or remote transactions. British consumers who've ventured to the supermarket in person will have noted that Apple Pay and Google Pay both have bigger limits on tap payments than bank debit cards. </p><p>Does this signal banking is the next domino to fall to big tech? Tim Levene, managing director of investment trust Augmentum Fintech (AUGM), thinks not: \"They've been quite wary of the challenges of regulation, these are heavily regulated financial services businesses, which is not in line with the nimble attitude of Google or Amazon. [So they have] dipped their toe in cautiously.\"</p><p>Traditional lending isn't the game to get into in a low interest rate world, but big tech's move into payments does threaten to shut high-street banks out of growth areas in retail finance, making the old banks less attractive as long-term investments.</p><p>Some high-profile merger and acquisition activity demonstrate other big businesses understand fintech is key to protecting their turf. Scale and expertise provide payment giants with competitive advantage, but they aren't resting on their laurels. Earlier this year Visa bought Plaid, and Mastercard followed suit, snapping up Finicity; both were strategic moves for cutting-edge technology to optimise hugely valuable financial data.</p><p>Deal activity in payments businesses held steady in the second quarter of 2020, according to CB Insights. Lockdowns have accelerated the e-commerce megatrend and, regardless of economic uncertainty, if they had the cash, companies from a variety of industries weren't sitting on their hands when it came to embedding fintech solutions.</p><p>The rate of year-on-year growth for online retail spending increased fourfold between March and July and reducing payment friction is key to businesses not being left behind. Point-of-sale credit is also partly facilitating this acceleration, with speed, security and big data capabilities essential. Businesses such as Sweden's Klarna (a large holding for the Merian Chrysalis investment trust) are building significant traction in point of sale (POS) credit.</p><p>There are other niche ways to play the trend, too. Investors Chronicle's Simon Thompson uncovered Aim-traded ThinkSmart (TSL) which had a stake in payments platform ClearPay. The shares have tripled since Simon first published his Alpha report and one strand to the investment case was that ClearPay is potentially on Tencent's radar.</p><p>Fintech intertwined with emerging market growth                   </p><p>China's growing middle class and shift to a consumption-based economy is another megatrend that converges with technology. How Tencent competes with Ant Group for dominance in the enormous payments market in China and the rest of developing Asia will be fascinating. There are UK-listed investment trusts focused on exploiting such opportunities.</p><p>Austin Forey, manager of JP Morgan Emerging Markets (JMG), cites the youth population of China, which at 400m outnumbers the combined working population of Europe, as having a profound impact on the opportunity set of companies.</p><p>The shift towards social networks, e-commerce and software has been profitable for investors. Mr Forey says: \"These business models are enormously profitable without needing to invest vast sums of money, in turn generating higher returns to shareholders. We strongly believe that growth in this sector is likely to continue to accelerate over the years.\"</p><p>Digital growth in all emerging markets is already spectacular, and by 2022 upwards of 3bn internet users will live in these countries, but Mr Forey believes investors should take a bottom-up view of the businesses likely to achieve competitive advantage. He says: \"Investors should consider the growth potential of a specific company, rather than taking a view on a country.\"</p><p>Investment trusts such as JP Morgan Emerging Markets and Schroder Asian Total Return (ATR) have sizeable positions in Tencent and Alibaba (considered China's Amazon), making big names in Asia tech more easily investable. All eyes will be on Ant Group's listing, which is directly material for Alibaba thanks to its 33 per cent stake in the payment platform.</p><p>Fund managers will not be drawn on the Ant IPO, nor on broader issues of governance around Chinese companies. Certainly, it's a controversial topic at a sensitive moment; the Ant listing has revived unwelcome scrutiny of the way Alipay (Ant's old name) was spun out of Alibaba nine years ago.</p><p>                     Revolutionising old industries                   </p><p>Emerging market investments have always had a racy side to them, but that's part of the trade-off for exposure to exciting growth stories. In the West, some previously rather dull industries are being swept up in the fintech boom, although the questionmarks here are around valuation.</p><p>Smart insurer Lemonade (US:LMD) has had a bumpy time since its IPO at the start of July, although that's hardly surprising given its listing market capitalisation of $4bn valued it on a multiple of more than 50 times trailing 12-month sales.</p><p>The insurance business was the foundation for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, and GEICO has been one of his best all-time stock picks, but Lemonade's listing highlights just how difficult it is to repeat Mr Buffett's old strategy of buying quality at a low price.</p><p>In July, a tweet by Ian Sigalow, of New York venture capital firm Greycroft, noted that at Lemonade's valuation multiple, GEICO would be worth $800bn. That's almost twice the market cap of Berkshire Hathaway and, at that price, many investors would no doubt prefer to stick to Cherry Coke. The eye-watering price of companies once they list reinforces the wisdom of buying funds that invest pre-IPO.</p><p>The opportunity is huge, however. On the Tesla (US:TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings call in 2019, Elon Musk highlighted how learnings from smart cars can improve embedded insurance options, potentially another revenue stream for Tesla.</p><p>Investment platforms are also changing rapidly. These range from very recent upstarts that have taken the world by storm, to slightly older brands getting a fresh wind. In the former camp, Robinhood has been credited with democratising investment, especially for younger investors.</p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, Interactive Investor, which by the admission of Tim Levene whose Augmentum Fintech is a major investor, was \"a bit of a sleeping digital dinosaur\". Thanks to a new dynamic focus, this profitable business now manages \u00a336bn in assets and he sees it as offering UK investors a compelling digital alternative to market-leading platform Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.).</p><p>                     Being socially useful and sustainable                   </p><p>Bringing the opportunities of investing to a new generation and giving more people a stake in the success of capitalism ought to be applauded, but there are negative aspects to platforms like Robinhood. Grumblings that it hasn't adequately helped investors understand risk and reward are reasonable, as are concerns that some of the app features gamify investing and encourage overtrading.</p><p>As the fintech revolution touches more aspects of our daily lives, the risks must be assessed alongside the progress. Facilitating the flow of money around the financial system and the regular economy is of huge benefit, although regulators are rightly considering downsides.</p><p>Buy now, pay later technologies such as Klarna's point-of-sale credit facilities have attracted the eye of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is mindful of the debts being accrued, particularly by younger shoppers. Perhaps this should concern investors in POS companies, although these businesses are very different from lenders that have targeted low-income groups in the past.</p><p>For example, payday loan companies charge annualised percentage rate (APR) interest of over 1,000 per cent in some cases. Compare that with Klarna, which is interest-free and spreads payments over three instalments. The nebulous argument trotted out in support of payday loans was that they prevented low earners being marginalised in getting access to credit. That didn't really hold water for those products, but the logic arguably is applicable to 'buy now, pay later'.</p><p>Other fintech services like such as the pay cheque advance services integrated into Chime bank's offering in the US can be a boon to the underbanked. There are also fintech services such as Gusto, which makes it easier for companies' payrolls to give employees early access to earned wages.</p><p>Small and medium-sized businesses will also benefit from other cash-management technology. Another Augmentum holding, Previse, was in August awarded a grant by the Banking Competition Remedies' Capability and Innovation fund. Using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, Previse helps big companies identify payables they won't dispute to be cleared quickly and helps small businesses offer targeted incentives for early payment.</p><p>Shortening working capital cycles has clear benefits for businesses and society, especially with all the damage lockdowns have done to the economy. It also gives lenders the confidence to support businesses through the downturn and in less extreme times, which could boost standards of solvency and justify expanding the market for offering loans.</p><p>                     Providing a boost for economies fighting back                   </p><p>Fintech start-ups offer many benefits for the world economy, notably improving the flow of cash and potential liberalisation of capital markets. All of this is possible thanks to secure open platforms which enable the sharing of data between sources using their own application programming interfaces (APIs). </p><p>Services reliant in part on plugging into third-party technology, especially in sensitive areas like payments, does create the possibility of Wirecard-type failures. Although it should be remembered that this was one bad apple and wasn't big enough to cause a systemic risk. High-profile neo banks had no connection to Wirecard at the time the scandal broke and the failure to act on warning signs is mainly an indictment of the German regulator.</p><p>For investors it's yet another reminder of the importance of due diligence. The same is true of start-ups choosing suppliers and partners for critical infrastructure. This is probably where the naivety of founder-owners can be exposed, so other savvy backers of the companies is a good sign. Funds that take a seat on the board of fintechs also provide reassurance.</p><p>Such presence also helps bridge the culture gap between some (but by no means all) of the new wave of start-ups and investors who are more old-school. That said, you don't have to be a hipster to appreciate that owning a slice of companies shaping the future of finance is a tantalising prospect. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-66443886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YR-WTF1-JBNF-W44M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3578\"/><timeReceived>5:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Throw in paltry interest rates killing the profitability of lending, plus the prospect of widespread loan defaults, and it's not surprising London's banking shares are cheaper than at any time since the 2008-09 financial crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By contrast, technology stocks have soared in 2020 and the future of finance is also where digital revolution meets the business of money. That doesn't just mean banks - insurance, payments, alternative lending, wealth management and even real estate are all touched by the proliferation of financial technology start-ups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fintech, therefore, is an incredibly broad church. Buying into innovation that's transforming how we earn, bank, invest and pay for goods and services sounds compelling, but the parts of that proposition each have their own pitfalls, and some are more easily investable than others.</p><p>Holding an S&amp;P 500 tracker fund gives sizeable exposure to the explosion in payments technology, albeit the shares are expensive. As well as highly valued Mastercard (US:MA) and Visa (US:V), owning Apple (US:AAPL), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Amazon (US:AMZN) includes a play on transactions.</p><p>Likewise, many Asia funds include Chinese tech giants Tencent (HK:0700) and Alibaba (HK:9988), and the same will surely be true of payments leader Ant Group - the world's largest fintech company - when it lists on mainland Chinese and Hong Kong exchanges in what looks set to be one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) ever seen.</p><p>Smaller companies, which are often pioneers and become takeover targets for the big players, are more elusive. The same is true of so-called neo banks, such as Monzo, Revolut, N26 and Starling, although these disruptors face uncertainties in the time of coronavirus.</p><p>Pandemic aside, governance issues are foremost when it comes to upstarts in whatever sphere of finance. That isn't to suggest impropriety, but there can be difficulty balancing tech wizards' focus on brilliant ideas and investors retaining visibility, including over timeframes and payback, although fintech's image has recently faced more serious issues than stereotypes of bearded hipster chief executives.</p><p>Europe's fintech industry was rocked by the Wirecard scandal; when gross accounting irregularities at the German platform prompted regulators to freeze the assets of payment systems plugged into its infrastructure. This, in turn, affected thousands of small businesses using services such as Anna to manage their vital day-to-day cash flow.</p><p>Financial misconduct is not just a 21st century phenomenon, though, and, arguably, fintech innovations will ultimately make deceit harder. What's undeniable is that this is one of the most exciting parts of the global economy. Research by CB Insights at the end of June 2020 counted 66 tech unicorns (defined as an unlisted business valued at over $1bn) backed by venture capital (VC), worth $248bn in aggregate.</p><p>That excludes Ant Group, which is aiming for a world record IPO of $35bn, because its current ownership and funding structure doesn't fit CBI's definition of VC-backed. The omission only serves to underline the breadth of opportunities, although with many fast-growing businesses still not publicly listed, private investors in the UK must rely on a few specialist funds to get a piece of the action.</p><p>Professional expertise can distinguish the sausage from the sizzle As well as being able to buy a stake in companies at pre-IPO funding rounds, fund managers' expertise in weighing up the exciting stories and harsh fundamental realities is invaluable. Neo-banks are a perfect example. On the one hand, lockdowns are driving use of mobile banking apps, which is good news for companies that excel in providing that experience; but on the other hand, forcing populations into hibernation left funding conditions largely contingent on central banks.</p><p>Some models are inherently less resilient. Monzo, for example, relies heavily on interchange income from card transactions by its millennial customer base. Shutting down expensive coffee shops and grounding city-break travellers choked off that source of revenue.</p><p>Furthermore, although deposits did increase by \u00a3930.7m in 2019-20, it is unclear what percentage of its 3.9m customers used Monzo as their primary account. If customers were just funnelling cash into Monzo to take advantage of features such as low foreign exchange commission when visiting abroad, then clearly lockdowns and travel bans will have hit the company hard.</p><p>Focusing on robust core metrics is crucial and has informed Merian Chrysalis Investment Company's (MERI) holding of Starling Bank. As well as opening 1.5m accounts (including nearly 200,000 business accounts) since launch of the banking app in May 2017, the deposit base has swelled to more than \u00a33bn.</p><p>Merian Chrysalis co-manager Richard Watts says: \"We are extremely pleased with the progress of Starling since we invested and more recently against a tough backdrop. Starling is building a sustainable bank with proven economics, evidenced by the fact that the business is set to reach profitability by the end of the financial year.\"</p><p>Building a strong position in the small to medium enterprise (SME) market is a strength, but the effects of further restrictions to contain coronavirus this winter must be considered a threat, too. Starling bank has \u00a3900m of SME loans on its balance sheet, but has been accredited for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, which should help it support its customers and stay resilient.</p><p>By contrast, Monzo appeared much less assured when it released its annual numbers, with the report flagging a material risk to the business as a going concern. Investor doubts were already evident when its series G funding priced the company at a 40 per cent discount to its previous valuation.</p><p>A shake-up at board level has seen youthful founder Tom Blomfield step aside as chief executive for TS Anil, a banker with 25 years' experience, who had been heading Monzo's expansion into the US.</p><p>Changes are to be expected both in management and strategy as fintech businesses mature and strive to become profitable. German bank N26 has shifted its commercial focus, exiting the UK market and focusing on the US and Brazil.</p><p>There is also stiff competition in larger countries. Nubank, headquartered in Sao Paulo, has grown its user base by 25 per cent since the start of 2020 despite (or perhaps because of) Brazil suffering badly from coronavirus. Likewise, in America there are success stories such as Varo out of San Francisco. It has doubled users to 2m since late 2019 and has also seen a 350 per cent rise in deposits.</p><p>Banking on lower costs and a better customer experience Funding and solvency remain the primary questions for any bank, neo or otherwise, but for those already on a path to sustainable growth there are considerable cost advantages both in providing services and winning customers.</p><p>June's Capgemini Global Banking Survey revealed that distribution and channel costs for digital-only banks have much lower costs as a percentage of operating income and an average cost per customer acquisition of between $1 and $38, compared with $200 for incumbent banks.</p><p>Competition from nimble upstarts is yet another headwind for UK-listed banks, which struggle to move as fast to improve customer experience. Neo banks leverage partnerships with flexible open-platform technology and have built and managed their customer databases since rigid data protection rules came into force. This enables them to rapidly implement learnings to keep improving digital Banking .</p><p>Hope for the incumbents could be at hand, however. More fintech businesses are now emerging not only to disrupt large banks and other corporates, but to help them adapt. For example, Yobota offers platform solutions that can help financial companies deal with legacy technology stacks. Furthermore, the open yet secure nature of technology means incumbents could take advantage of several best-in-class vendors to solve problems.</p><p>Explaining the proposition, Yobota chief executive Ammar Akhtar says: \"In an age of API [application programming interfaces] interoperability, where everyone designs their product as a service, the complex integration problem many large banks and corporates face kind of goes away.\"</p><p>Potentially that means, with the right providers, big banks can rapidly improve their operations, including processing, account services, payments, credit decisions, identification checks and user experience in all-important channels such as mobile. The challenge should not be underestimated, however, with the question of data (a heavily regulated area) to the fore.</p><p>The siloed nature of data capture over many years means traditional banks face a Herculean task in putting to use the vast pools of information they hold. Just over a quarter of incumbent banks were rated as data experts by the Capgemini report. Those that lag in this core competency face a serious barrier to matching the hyper-personalised experience offered by the Neo banks.</p><p>When it comes to competitive advantage, the new banks with sustainable models and resilient balance sheets are in something of a sweet spot. Early-mover advantage has been had and it would be harder for further market entrants to get established.</p><p>Consolidation could be the order of the day in the current climate, although Chime bank (which is now America's highest-valued fintech) continues to innovate. Automated savings and especially a feature speeding up the clearing of salaries, could be game changing. Furthermore, Chime's zero fee mobile payments also cut time between transfers.</p><p>Payments the prize for big tech Integrating the process of moving money with messaging apps is a cornerstone of tech companies' strategies for emerging markets. Users want to seamlessly make payments and chat simultaneously on their smartphones without toggling through tabs.</p><p>Western businesses lag China's WeChat (owned by Tencent), but are making huge investments. Facebook's (US:FB) main social media platform and WhatsApp, which it owns, are integrating payments - the decision to trial in India speaks volumes. Amazon, Google and Apple are also making strides.</p><p>Emphasis isn't just on emerging markets or remote transactions. British consumers who've ventured to the supermarket in person will have noted that Apple Pay and Google Pay both have bigger limits on tap payments than bank debit cards.</p><p>Does this signal banking is the next domino to fall to big tech? Tim Levene, managing director of investment trust Augmentum Fintech (AUGM), thinks not: \"They've been quite wary of the challenges of regulation, these are heavily regulated financial services businesses, which is not in line with the nimble attitude of Google or Amazon. [So they have] dipped their toe in cautiously.\"</p><p>Traditional lending isn't the game to get into in a low interest rate world, but big tech's move into payments does threaten to shut high-street banks out of growth areas in retail finance, making the old banks less attractive as long-term investments.</p><p>Some high-profile merger and acquisition activity demonstrates other big businesses understand that fintech is key to protecting their turf. Scale and expertise provide payment giants with competitive advantage, but they aren't resting on their laurels. Earlier this year Visa bought Plaid, and Mastercard followed suit, snapping up Finicity; both were strategic moves for cutting-edge technology to optimise hugely valuable financial data.</p><p>Deal activity in payments businesses held steady in the second quarter of 2020, according to CB Insights. Lockdowns have accelerated the e-commerce megatrend and, regardless of economic uncertainty, if they had the cash, companies from a variety of industries weren't sitting on their hands when it came to embedding fintech solutions.</p><p>The rate of year-on-year growth for online retail spending increased fourfold between March and July and reducing payment friction is key to businesses not being left behind. Point-of-sale credit is also partly facilitating this acceleration, with speed, security and big data capabilities essential. Businesses such as Sweden's Klarna (a large holding for the Merian Chrysalis Investment trust) are building significant traction in point of sale (POS) credit.</p><p>There are other niche ways to play the trend, too. Investors Chronicle's Simon Thompson uncovered Aim-traded ThinkSmart (TSL), which had a stake in payments platform ClearPay. The shares have tripled since Simon first published his Alpha report and one strand to the investment case was that ClearPay is potentially on Tencent's radar.</p><p>Fintech intertwined with emerging market growth China's growing middle class and shift to a consumption-based economy is another megatrend that converges with technology. How Tencent competes with Ant Group for dominance in the enormous payments market in China and the rest of developing Asia will be fascinating. There are UK-listed investment trusts focused on exploiting such opportunities.</p><p>Austin Forey, manager of JP Morgan Emerging Markets (JMG), cites the youth population of China, which at 400m outnumbers the combined working population of Europe, as having a profound impact on the opportunity set of companies.</p><p>The shift towards social networks, e-commerce and software has been profitable for investors. Mr Forey says: \"These business models are enormously profitable without needing to invest vast sums of money, in turn generating higher returns to shareholders. We strongly believe that growth in this sector is likely to continue to accelerate over the years.\"</p><p>Digital growth in all emerging markets is already spectacular, and by 2022 upwards of 3bn internet users will live in these countries, but Mr Forey believes investors should take a bottom-up view of the businesses likely to achieve competitive advantage. He says: \"Investors should consider the growth potential of a specific company, rather than taking a view on a country.\"</p><p>Investment trusts such as JP Morgan Emerging Markets and Schroder Asian Total Return (ATR) have sizeable positions in Tencent and Alibaba (considered</p><p>China's Amazon), making big names in Asia tech more easily investable . All eyes will be on Ant Group's listing, which is directly material for Alibaba thanks to its 33 per cent stake in the payment platform .</p><p>Fund managers will not be drawn on the Ant IPO, nor on broader issues of governance around Chinese companies. Certainly, it's a controversial topic at a sensitive moment; the Ant listing has revived unwelcome scrutiny of the way Alipay (Ant's old name) was spun out of Alibaba nine years ago.</p><p>Revolutionising old industries Emerging market investments have always had a racy side to them, but that's part of the trade-offfor exposure to exciting growth stories. In the West, some previously rather dull industries are being swept up in the fintech boom, although the question marks here are around valuation.</p><p>Smart insurer Lemonade (US:LMD) has had a bumpy time since its IPO at the start of July, although that's hardly surprising given its listing market cap of $4bn valued it on a multiple of more than 50 times trailing 12-month sales.</p><p>The insurance business was the foundation for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, and GEICO has been one of his best all-time stock picks, but Lemonade's listing highlights just how difficult it is to repeat Mr Buffett's old strategy of buying quality at a low price.</p><p>In July, a tweet by Ian Sigalow, of New York venture capital firm Greycroft, noted that at Lemonade's valuation multiple, GEICO would be worth $800bn. That's almost twice the market cap of Berkshire Hathaway and, at that price, many investors would no doubt prefer to stick to Cherry Coke. The eye-watering price of companies once they list reinforces the wisdom of buying funds that invest pre-IPO .</p><p>The opportunity is huge, though. On the Tesla (US:TSLA) fourth-quarter earnings call in 2019, Elon Musk highlighted how learnings from smart cars can improve embedded insurance options, potentially another revenue stream for Tesla.</p><p>Investment platforms are also changing rapidly. These range from recent upstarts that have taken the world by storm, to slightly older brands getting a fresh wind. In the former camp, Robinhood has been credited with democratising investment, especially for younger investors .</p><p>on the other side of the spectrum, Interactive Investor, which by the admission of Tim Levene whose Augmentum Fintech is a major investor, was \"a bit of a sleeping digital dinosaur\". Thanks to a new dynamic focus, this profitable business now manages \u00a336bn in assets and he sees it as offering UK investors a compelling digital alternative to market-leading platform Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.).</p><p>Being socially useful and sustainable Bringing the opportunities of investing to a new generation and giving more people a stake in the success of capitalism ought to be applauded, but there are negative aspects to platforms such as Robinhood. Grumblings that it hasn't adequately helped investors understand risk and reward are reasonable, as are concerns that some of the app features gamify investing and encourage overtrading.</p><p>As the fintech revolution touches more aspects of our daily lives, the risks must be assessed alongside the progress. Facilitating the flow of money around the financial system and the regular economy is of huge benefit, although regulators are rightly considering downsides.</p><p>Buy now, pay later technologies such as Klarna's point-of-sale credit facilities have attracted the eye of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is mindful of the debts being accrued, particularly by younger shoppers. Perhaps this should concern investors in POS companies, although these businesses are very different from lenders that have targeted low-income groups in the past.</p><p>For example, payday loan companies charge annualised percentage rate (APR) interest of over 1,000 per cent in some cases. Compare that with Klarna, which is interest-free and spreads payments over three instalments. The nebulous argument trotted out in support of payday loans was that they prevented low earners being marginalised in getting access to credit. That didn't really hold water for those products, but the logic arguably is applicable to 'buy now, pay later'.</p><p>Other fintech services such as the pay cheque advance services integrated into Chime bank's offering in the US can be a boon to the underbanked. There are also fintech services such as Gusto, which makes it easier for companies'</p><p>payrolls to give employees early access to earned wages.</p><p>Small and medium-sized businesses will also benefit from other cash-management technology. Another Augmentum holding, Previse, was in August awarded a grant by the Banking Competition Remedies'</p><p>Capability and Innovation fund. Using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, Previse helps big companies identify payables they won't dispute to be cleared quickly and helps small businesses offer targeted incentives for early payment.</p><p>Shortening working capital cycles has clear benefits for businesses and society, especially with all the damage lockdowns have done to the economy. It also gives lenders the confidence to support businesses through the downturn and in less extreme times, which could boost standards of solvency and justify expanding the market for offering loans.</p><p>Providing a boost for economies fighting back Fintech start-ups offer many benefits for the world economy, notably improving the flow of cash and potential liberalisation of capital markets. All of this is possible thanks to secure open platforms that enable the sharing of data between sources using their own application programming interfaces (APIs).</p><p>services reliant in part on plugging into thirdparty technology, especially in sensitive areas such as payments, does create the possibility of Wirecardtype failures. Although it should be remembered that this was one bad apple and wasn't big enough to cause a systemic risk. High-profile. Neobanks had no connection to Wirecard at the time the scandal broke and the failure to act on warning signs is mainly an indictment of the German regulator.</p><p>For investors it's yet another reminder of the importance of due diligence. The same is true of start-ups choosing suppliers and partners for critical infrastructure. Thisis probably where the naivety of founder-owners can be exposed, so other savvy backers of the companies is a good sign. Funds that take a seat on the board of fintechs also provide reassurance.</p><p>Such presence also helps bridge the culture gap between some (but by no means all) of the new wave of start-ups and investors who are more old-school. That said, you don't have to be a hipster to appreciate that owning a slice of companies shaping the future of finance is atantalising prospect .</p><p>66 THE NUMBER OF TECH UNICORNS AT THE END OF JUNE 2020 (DEFINED AS AN UNLISTED BUSINESS VALUED AT OVER $1BN) 'Traditional lending isn't the game to get into in a low interest rate world, but big tech's move into payments does threaten to shut highstreet banks out of growth areas in retail finance' 'Buying into innovation that's transforming how we earn, bank, invest and pay for goods and services sounds compelling, but the parts of that proposition each have their own pitfalls'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fintech has integrated the process of moving money from within</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-163628890</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6103-3NP1-JCBW-N185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 2, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee will extend its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that the new currency, Libra, \"will have little standing or dependability.\" Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have expressed serious concerns recently that Libra could be used for illicit activity.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" Mnuchin told reporters at the White House on Monday. \"This is indeed a national security issue.\"</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee, which is holding tomorrow's hearing, called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators could review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for the hearing by the Senate Banking Committee that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard, to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from it, the company says.</p><p>Mnuchin's comments came a few days after Trump tweeted: \"I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, Trump said.</p><p>Powell, a powerful financial regulator who is independent of the Trump administration, told Congress last week that Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability. Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Facebook's challenges in Washington go beyond Libra. Later today, at a Judiciary subcommittee hearing, Facebook will be among four big tech companies - along with Google, Amazon and Apple - testifying about their impact on the innovation and entrepreneurship of smaller companies. It's the latest chapter in lawmakers' examination of the industry.</p><p>\"What happens in tech is that one big company grows to control a lot of stuff, and if it's allowed to stay there for too long, it slows down the sector,\" Timothy Wu, a professor of law, science and technology at Columbia Law School, has said. \"Companies like Google and Facebook have come to hold too much power. There's a growing sense that they have too much control over information, news, advertising, even who we are and what's going on.\"</p><p>Wu is among the expert witnesses scheduled to appear before the antitrust panel, which also will hear from executives from the four tech companies.</p><p>Earlier, it was Google that was on the receiving end of Trump tweet.</p><p>Over the weekend, billionaire investor Peter Thiel said the FBI and the CIA should open an investigation to determine if Google had been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence, according to Axios.</p><p>According to the Axios story, Theil said Google was \"engaged in the seemingly treasonous decision to work with the Chinese military and not with the US military.\"</p><p>Before 5 a.m. Eastern, Trump tweeted about Thiel, \"A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARCY GORDON, WASHINGTON,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AP</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AP19197050640618.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An outdoor Facebook sign at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MACDTM-113424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MACDTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKF-1YM1-JBKF-G0RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468345</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1031\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Macau Daily Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Macau Daily Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your needs to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Payment made. FinTech giants Global Payments and Total System Services tying up in a $21 billion deal. When one's just not quite enough, Alibaba reportedly looking at a second mega IPO, but this time, a little closer to home. And a faceoff with Canada, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, set to defy a Parliamentary call to testify on privacy. It's Tuesday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Back in action here at the New York Stock Exchange following the long weekend holiday. We are of course in the final week of May. Now if you sold in May, and went away then you certainly called the price action. The big question for investors I think now is do we continue to see the selling pressure hitting in June?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let me give you a look at the futures right now. The message is no. Actually, we're pretty fat. But we did lose ground last week. So some consolidation perhaps makes sense, particularly, of course, seeing pressure in the tech sector and those chip names. The Dow currently facing its worst losing streak since 2011, down for five weeks in a row now.</p><p>It's difficult to make a case here with stocks being oversold with so much uncertainty on trade remaining. We'll debate that later in the show. Maybe it's worth having a look at the message that the bond markets are selling us right now.</p><p>We closed out the week last week with 10-year bond yields in the United States at their lowest level since 2017. That was after some pretty weak U.S. manufacturing data, if you remember the survey data coming in weaker.</p><p>But now, take a look at what's going on as well, because we've got U.S. yields down in the session again today. It's going to be important, I think to see if that flight to safety, the flight to quality that we've seen in bond yields continues this week. Key economic data to watch, the second reading on GDP for the first quarter in the United States and inflation on Friday. A couple of key indicators.</p><p>For now, let me give you a look of what we're seeing in Europe. If you remember, we were talking about Italy yesterday in light of the Italian results in the E.U. referendum, the E.U. elections -- my apologies. What we're seeing right now is the Italian stocks down more than 1 percent. Bond yields also higher.</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini of the League Party had success in that election. He is now raising fears of another spending showdown in the E.U. He confirmed that Italy faces a 3 billion euro fine for overspending. Salvini has said that he is not concerned about breaking those deficit spending targets.</p><p>Former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said to me yesterday that investors need to watch the action rather than the rhetoric. Pragmatism will perhaps play out here in a deal making with the E.U. We shall see. For now, let's get to the drivers because we've got some other deal making going on, and this time in the FinTech space.</p><p>FinTech giant, Global Payments making a pretty large payment of its own acquiring Total System Services for more than $20 billion. Matt Egan joins us now and has been pouring over the details.</p><p>In an increasingly cashless society, we continue to see these big FinTech deals. Talk us through this one. What does this create? The type of these two?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: There's no doubt there's been a flurry of deal making in the payment space as a result of all of this innovation and disruption that the industry is facing.</p><p>So the latest deal was announced this morning, Global Payments is acquiring rival Total System Services for $21.5 billion. So it's an all-stock deal and it values Total System at about 20 percent premium to where the company was trading last week before. Some of the speculation about a possible deal started to leak out.</p><p>The deal will create a really big company in this payment space. It will service up to 3.5 million merchants in 100 countries, 1,300 financial institutions, and it's going to handle 50 billion transactions a year.</p><p>Now, the two companies are billing this as a merger of equals, and it's pretty close to that. But technically, what's going to happen is 52 percent of the new company will be led by Global Payments, the new company will keep the global payments name and it will be led by the Global Payments CEO, Jeff Sloan.</p><p>So it really is a takeover. Bigger picture. You know, I think that it's clear that there's a bit of an arms race going on in this space right now. As companies adapt to all of this innovation to competition from the likes of Square and PayPal and the fact that you know many people, including many millennials, really just don't have much cash on hand these days.</p><p>[09:05:13] EGAN: So in January, there was a big deal where FinTech company, Fiserv went out and acquired First Data for $22 billion, then we have Fidelity National Information Services, it went out and acquired World Pay and a takeover valued at $43 billion, including debt.</p><p>So clearly, all of this consolidation just shows that there's a lot of disruption and no one wants to be left behind.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and size matters to your point, if you're tackling some of those established names in this sector, the likes of Square, the likes of PayPal, then this consolidation makes sense.</p><p>You know, one of the other things I was looking at here, Matt, is the sheer quantity and the increase of venture capital money that's being pumped into this space, too. It's so hot right now, do we see more in this sector?</p><p>EGAN: That's right. We really have seen just an enormous amount of money from Silicon Valley come into this space, because I think that just companies realized there's a lot of potential here.</p><p>You know, everyone does so much of their shopping these days online, when they go to stores. They're not using cash. They're using their cards. And so what's happening is we're seeing some of these established players, they suddenly are dealing with all of this competition from the likes of Square, where they're using technology backed by all this venture capital money, and they are providing real competition to some of the establishment players here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, fascinating. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that. And later on today, I'll be speaking to the Global Payments CEO, Jeff Sloan, so you can catch that interview on \"The Express\" all the details, and more of what the company's plans are going to be.</p><p>All right, let's move on to our next driver. China's e-commerce giant, Alibaba planning a $20 billion Hong Kong listing. It gives domestic mainland investors access the company as the trade tensions continue, and that could be the key here.</p><p>Clare Sebastian is on this story for us. More funding, a diversification of funding. But interesting timing for me here, Clare and the choice to go to Hong Kong here, too.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, I think it's a practical decision in part. Alibaba share price, which had been really on quite a nice upward trajectory since its massive IPO in New York. It has been really buffeted by the trade war. It's down about 13 percent since its record high last year, so it may want to provide a cushion to that.</p><p>It may also want to fundraise in a market where people are familiar with its products. And of course, Hong Kong has also relaxed the rule that stopped Alibaba listing there in the first place that allows founders and other important individuals to hold preferential voting rights when it comes to shares.</p><p>But I think you're right. I think there may be politics at play here as well, especially given the current tensions between the U.S. and China. Don't forget Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder was recently outed last year as a member of the Chinese Communist Party. So this may be about the company trying to show a bit of loyalty, a bit of patriotism there by listing not necessarily on the mainland, but in Hong Kong.</p><p>But $20 billion, Julia, I just want to give you a bit of context on that. This is going to be, if it does do this, a huge IPO compared to some of the other IPOs we've seen in New York last year, it really does dwarf them even over $8.1 billion. So a massive undertaking here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a huge boon for Hong Kong as well, as you said to win such a large IPO and had the rules been different, perhaps, they would have reconsidered the Hong Kong initially rather than coming to the United States here, too.</p><p>But to your point, Jack Ma was one of the first CEOs that came out and was very bearish about the trade war and said this could be a multi-decade problem that we see here. Do we need to make a distinction between the likes of Shanghai, of Beijing because China is trying to develop its own hub in Shanghai to encourage tech companies to IPO there, because there is a difference between Hong Kong and domestic China for these companies, too.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely, I think for the moment, despite the fact that China is trying to launch its own, what's been called the Chinese NASDAQ, a new tech board at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it is not really ready yet to accommodate an IPO of this size.</p><p>You just saw its relative size compared to some of the biggest in the U.S. last year. Hong Kong has been attracting some big tech IPOs, the likes of Xiaomi, which raised about $4 billion last year. So it's much more of an option when it comes to liquidity for this kind of IPO.</p><p>But you're right, Jack Ma has been extremely vocal on the score of the trade war. He called it something that could last 20 years. Last year, he said it, it was stupid. He has admitted it. It's been hurting Alibaba business that relies on cross border flows of products.</p><p>So I think, you know, the question is, is he now by doing this, is the company you know -- is this a tacit admission that there might be a kind of a decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors going forward? That this is going to be a protracted battle?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's one to watch. I mean, China's largest semiconductor firm said it was withdrawing its U.S. listing just this week, so it's definitely a story to follow. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>[09:10:07] CHATTERLEY: All right, moving on to our next driver now. General Motors teaming up with Bechtel to build thousands of electrical vehicle charging stations here in the United States.</p><p>Peter Valdes-Dapena builders to Bina have this exclusive report. Peter, you and I have talked often about the challenge of electric vehicles and the fear of drivers that you run out of battery somewhere in the country and have no charging facilities. GM looking to tackle it here.</p><p>PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR AUTO WRITER: Yes, this is a big concern for them. General Motors is going to come out with 20 or more zero emission vehicles over the next few years by 2023. So they have a big interest in making sure that people feel comfortable buying these kinds of cars.</p><p>Now this network is not going to be restricted to GM vehicles, people will be able to charge most, maybe not Tesla, but most other electric vehicles at these stations. But it's certainly a smart move for them.</p><p>One thing though, is there we're looking for outside investors. GM and Bechtel are looking for outside investors to put money into building out this network, but they're both pretty confident that they can find that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's quite fascinating. So the two companies that coming together. They're going to do this, but they're not going to pay to do it. The argument to your point, I guess, Peter is that everyone needs this technology. They don't need it just located on highways, it needs to be far broader than that. So everyone that's producing electrical vehicles here has an incentive to invest.</p><p>DAPENA: Certainly, other companies, certainly other car companies might have an incentive to invest, power companies might have an incentive to invest. I'm just figuring because they're selling their product coming out the other end.</p><p>There are companies that make money running charger networks in America, and some of those companies might want to invest. And again, I'm just spinning off ideas here, but maybe even convenience store companies because people are going to need to buy Cokes, Pepsis and hotdogs and stuff while they're waiting to get their car charged. There could be some opportunities there.</p><p>But anyway, these companies are fairly competent, they'll be able to line up the investment to do this. And they're going to start by the end of this year putting these charges on the ground.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, I hope GM is listening. Fantastic sales job there. I think it's some brilliant ideas. Peter Valdes-Dapena, thank you so much for that.</p><p>And that full and exclusive report is on the CNN Business website. So go take a look. It's a fascinating story. Great job, Peter. Thank you.</p><p>All right, let's move on to annex driver. Can a state hold a company responsible for its opioid crisis? That's the question at the heart of a historical trial kicking off right now in Oklahoma. We were talking to you about this set yesterday.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson accused of acting as a drug kingpin. Johnson &amp; Johnson denying those charges, of course. Jean Casarez is joining us now from Norman, Oklahoma. What we've seen, of course, in this trial already is Teva Pharmaceutical, Purdue Pharma also settling here, Johnson &amp; Johnson now very much in the firing line and in the hot seat here. Why are they still going to trial?</p><p>JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, it's interesting. Johnson &amp; Johnson did give CNN a statement saying that they are prepared, they're ready for trial. Opening statements begin very shortly. But they also said that they are very open to a resolution before the trial or during the trial, because there is the uncertainty of what the outcome may be. And then also the cost of litigation.</p><p>So I think anything is possible. But Johnson &amp; Johnson is saying that these allegations are baseless, but the state of Oklahoma is saying that they have been and are in the midst of an opioid crisis, and that Johnson &amp; Johnson is responsible for that crisis because they procured the raw ingredients, the narcotics that they then sold to the companies that manufacture the opioid medications.</p><p>That Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries also marketed an extended-use opioid tablet along with a fentanyl patch. And they say that their branding and their publicity, their marketing was misleading, that it did not note the risks of opioids to medical professionals, to the public at large, but they touted unsubstantiated benefits of the medication.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson says that this is FDA monitored and they have complied constantly with the FDA. And remember, in 2016, Johnson &amp; Johnson got out of the opioid business. They sold off some of their subsidiaries, and they say that they now actually help in trying to alleviate and conquer the problem of opioid abuse.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and 1,900 other lawsuits around the country. So important, it seems to it to continue to fight this. Jean, thank you so much for that. Jean Casarez there in Norman, Oklahoma watching that story for us.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world. European leaders are in Brussels for meetings in the wake of Parliamentary elections this weekend on the agenda of filling the top jobs at key institutions including the European Central Bank.</p><p>They also need to decide who will run the bloc's executive for the next five years.</p><p>[09:15:10] CHATTERLEY: The current European Commission President, Jean- Claude Juncker's term expires this year.</p><p>Germany welcomes American companies with open arms. That was the message from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In her first in depth exclusive interview with an American network, Mrs. Merkel spoke to Christian Amanpour about a wide range of topics, including the U.S. President's threat to impose tariffs on E.U. cars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN ANCHOR: What's your reaction to German cause being considered a national security threat to the United States?</p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): Well, I take note of this, then of course, we build our case. I think it's right and good that we have a mandate from the European Union for trade talks with the American government.</p><p>Germany will hold these talks very seriously. And my argument, of course, is that German cars are not built only in Germany. That for example, with the BMW, their biggest plant is in South Carolina. This means Germany has much more direct investments taken out by German companies in America than the reverse, American companies investing here.</p><p>So I think we should look at these issues together. That namely American jobs at American places of training have to be secured as well. And then goods can be transported from there to the rest of the world.</p><p>Further, I think we should underline that also from the German side, we are open to all American companies, maybe many SMEs don't know that you can trade with us as well. So I invite all American businesses to take a closer look at German markets. We are open and welcoming everyone with open arms.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you can see the full interview with German Chancellor Angela Merkel coming up on \"Amanpour\" that is tonight at 6:00 p.m. in London, 1:00 p.m. here in New York, only on CNN.</p><p>In Japan, two people including a 12-year-old girl had been killed in a stabbing. The country's Prime Minister has called it heartbreaking. Sixteen all the children were injured when a man attacked a crowd near a park in the city of Kawasaki. Police say the attacker was detained, but died from a self-inflicted wound.</p><p>Another climber has died on Mount Everest, bringing this year's death toll to 11. The latest to be confirmed is an American lawyer who was an experienced climber. The alarming number of deaths has raised concerns that the mountain is overcrowded and that too many adventurers aren't properly prepared for the hardship of climbing up and down the world's highest peak.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, throwing the book at Mark Zuckerberg. Why Facebook's two biggest names will be challenged with contempt over in Canada.</p><p>And taking robotics up a step, Ford unveils, Digit, the delivery robot that can physically climb stairs. We'll have all the details. Stay with us on FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:21:08] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. A very cautious start this morning, remember, following the long weekend, a lot of dates to come later on in the week. Inflation, of course and the second reading of U.S. GDP, so we'll watch and wait for that.</p><p>Stocks are on track though for their first losing month for 2019. But losses have not been all that major in aggregate since the trade talks broke down. Just to give you some perspective, the Dow off 3.5 percent, the S&amp;P down four; the NASDAQ, the tech sector and those stocks are most sensitive of course to China, down some 6.5 percent.</p><p>Also keeping an eye on the auto sector again. The shares of Renault and Fiat-Chrysler adding to Monday's gains over in the European session. The companies are in merger talks and we're talking a $35 billion deal that will create the world's third largest car company.</p><p>All right, let's talk through what we're seeing right now and thinking, Phil Camporeale is an asset allocation strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, and he joins us now. Phil?</p><p>PHIL CAMPOREALE, ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: Good morning. Happy summer.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Happy summer. Can investors be happy this summer, though in light of border trade uncertainty here? There's hopes for a trade deal, and now kind of --</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Yes, it's been dashed a little bit. So they were really happy on May 3rd, because everything was priced to perfection. You had a really nice double shift in the Fed earlier this year. You had a march towards trade. And you had a really a market that was short.</p><p>So people were kind of coming back into the market. It wasn't -- the pain trade was really higher for the markets. If you take trade out. That doesn't mean everything goes back to flat. It just means you pull back by three to five percent. That's what we're seeing in May.</p><p>Here's a couple of big picture themes we're looking at. First off, we believe this is a really strong political issue for the Trump administration. The second that it starts to slip into an economic issue where the consumer pulls back, where GDP rates get close to zero. I don't think Trump going to have a strong of a hand as he does right now because he's got economics on his side.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's a great point to make. I mean, we've got consumer confidence right now 15-year highs according to the data, we also have a really strong in terms of magnitude, Q1 GDP reading. We can caution whether that was a net export effect and an inventory bill which perhaps could filter away, but you're kind of arguing that the data here emboldened the President to take the stance he did.</p><p>CAMPOREALE: That's right and that's exactly what happened the middle of last year when trade started to pick up. We had a four percent GDP rate in the second quarter, three percent the third quarter and trade became an issue. The big difference now though, Julia? Feds.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>CAMPOREALE: So in December -- in December, there was trade peace. Okay, and the equity market from December 1st to Christmas Eve, as we all know, sold off by 15 percent because of the Fed. So that's the big difference this year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you're arguing, actually, that for now, for investors, the Federal Reserve and their patience status is actually way more important than trade battles.</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Than trade, that's right. Because I think the Fed drives the American psyche, the 10-year Treasury a lot more than trade does.</p><p>Trade is headline and it is really sensational to talk about, we believe it's more of a political and economic one, and the really high bar for the Fed to do anything is in really encouraging financial condition environment, to take some risks, not only in equities, but also in high yielding securities as investors kind of wait and see what happens next. You want to get paid to wait.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you said you know, 3.5 percent, 4 percent. For the NASDAQ, we're talking some 6 percent, 6.5 percent, so within that, some of those individual names have been pretty heavily hammered like the chip stocks and those most sensitive to China.</p><p>You're saying the bad news is in the price and actually if we do manage to see some kind of peace agreed on the trade front then actually, that's a reason for investors to get back in --</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Sure. I think if that were to happen, Julia, and we're not counting on it. We're not holding our breath for it but if that were to happen, yes, the semiconductor and tech which has been ground zero in the past couple of weeks is going to see the sharpest snapback.</p><p>But that's not something that we're really counting on. What we're counting on here is accommodate the financial conditions, the ability to take risk in U.S. large cap and then go get paid to wait in things like high yield credit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What is the bond market telling me right now?</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Our bond market, if you look at it -- if you're a pessimist or an optimist, right? If you're an optimist, that's telling you the financial conditions are really easy.</p><p>[09:25:11] CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Mortgage rates are incredibly accommodative. The housing market has done really well this year versus last year when people were calling for 4 percent 10-year note, we're at 2.3 this morning.</p><p>The pessimist is going to say that it is really flat and the bond market is telling you something sinister, but it's not a recessionary predictor right now, because the consumer is just so healthy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so you made a call on emerging markets and you were underweight and you went neutral. What are you thinking right now in aggregate? Where should investors be putting money and how are you viewing emerging markets given all those factors and considerations?</p><p>CAMPOREALE: So we're not as overweight as we were earlier in the year, okay, when we had really accommodative financial conditions everywhere, however, we're not panicking, okay. There's no panic setting in an emerging market. We are not taking our exposure to zero.</p><p>We have an index waiting in our portfolio and the secret there is China also has stimulus, right? So total social financing. There's no requirement ratios. They have what it takes to keep their economy afloat. And we don't think a global recession is looming.</p><p>So in that environment, you keep an index waiting in EM. Don't panic in EM, but we're not as overweight as we were a little earlier --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you're a voice of calm.</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Trying to be, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A deal of uncertainty here.</p><p>CAMPOREALE: Yes, trying to be.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, very quickly here. Are investors nervous here or are they sort of listening and absorbing what you're saying?</p><p>CAMPOREALE: So investors are behaviorally nervous all the time. But the big difference between this year and last, they're not as long in the equity market as they were. Remember, last year, everybody was coming in super nice, coordinated global growth. That wasn't the theme this year. Coming in this year, everyone was all the way cash. So very, very different from positioning. So less nervous from that perspective.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: My first boss in financial markets used to say to me, whenever you get comfortable, panic. Something to remember, Phil. Great to have you on, as always, Phil Camporeale there.</p><p>We're counting down to the market open this morning. Plenty more to come on FIRST MOVE. Stay with us. You're with CNN.</p><p>[09:30:17] CHATTERLEY: I don't think I've ever heard a double ring of the opening bell here at the New York Stock Exchange. There's certainly some enthusiasm here this morning. What we are seeing though is a pretty flat open this morning on this holiday shortened trading week. It is a Tuesday of course. Seeing a bit of a bounce for tech stocks here, too.</p><p>Those, as we've been discussing on the show coming under most pressure in the last couple of weeks or so of trading. Key economic data to watch as well, U.S. inflation and that second read of U.S. GDP, also coming this week, so plenty to watch.</p><p>Also, we're keeping an eye of course on net trade headlines and the U.S. dollar trading against the Chinese yuan of course. The Chinese state media is quoting, the head of the People's Bank of China saying that he is confident that he can keep that exchange rates stable. But of course we're watching that cross, that currency pair pushing ever closer to at $7.00, a level critical seen as a line in the sand here in terms of the talks, most particularly the U.S. very sensitive to that level.</p><p>Also, China injecting fresh liquidity into the banking system. This after the government's first bank takeover in more than two decades on what they've cited as credit risk concerns. That's going to be something to watch and we'll talk about that over the next several sessions, too, I'm sure.</p><p>But for now, let me give you a look at some of the global movers that we are watching in the session today. As we've discussed already, Global Payments and Total System Services in focus. Global Payments buying their rival, Total System Services for $21.5 billion. The third big takeover in this industry, the FinTech industry this year.</p><p>The combined company worth roughly $40 billion. So they're describing this deal as a merger of equals. The deal expected to close by the end of 2019.</p><p>Also keeping an eye on Johnson &amp; Johnson. The U.S. state of Oklahoma accusing the drug maker of fueling the opioid epidemic. They're set to face trial in a multibillion dollar lawsuit. The state is alleging that Johnson and Johnson as well as other big pharmaceutical names downplayed the addictive risks of opioid drugs. Johnson &amp; Johnson deny any wrongdoing. As we've discussed already on the show, we will continue to watch that trial as it develops.</p><p>Fiat-Chrysler also being a focus today. Fiat-Chrysler to pursue the $35 billion merger with Renault, the combined company would be capable of producing nearly nine million vehicles a year. They are also aiming for more than $5 billion in annual savings. It would be the world's third largest in the global auto industry behind Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen, right now up some 8 percent.</p><p>All right, let's talk about Facebook now because the Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, of course, the COO risk being held in contempt of the Canadian Parliament, the site confirming that they plan to defy a subpoena to testify at a privacy hearing this week.</p><p>Paula Newton joins us now on this story. Paula, based in Canada, of course and the Canadian Parliament, but there's other nations represented there, some 450 million people in terms of population, actually bigger than the United States and yet they're not turning up.</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They are not turning up, and remember this all started in London when this committee had its first hearings, they heard, Julia, from another Facebook executive and look, the Chair of this Committee telling me, \"Look, it wasn't good enough.\" We all know how -- these are his words -- \"Facebook is micromanaged from the top.\" And that's why they want to hear from Mr. Zuckerberg and Miss Sandberg themselves. They are, CNN has learned going to be a no-show. They are sending Canadian representative. But that's just not good enough for this committee.</p><p>At issue here, as the Chair told me, Julia, it's not about dragging off these executives to Canada and putting them in handcuffs. But it is them blowing off yet one more government committee and they're saying, \"Look, how do you intend to make changes at the top with this platform to make sure that election interference doesn't happen again, and crucially, that data collection, what are the Privacy Practices in place that are going to protect consumers?\"</p><p>And Julia, I have to tell you, as I know, you keep an eye on morning out for investors to see what's going on here. Remember, this is material to investors. It has to do with the kind of legislation that we may see in several countries, and fines, of course, and what impact that will have on Facebook's business going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You raise a great point, Paula and it's about the U.K. It's about Canada. It's about other nations. And the idea that the more we see this perhaps and the more actually that Facebook executives don't turn up, the more likelihood the risk of seeing greater coordination and regulation because you get the sense that one country doing this alone is not good enough. But if everybody came together and said how do we tackle this as an issue going forward? Then perhaps Facebook has to be more targeted about their response here?</p><p>[09:35:17] NEWTON: Absolutely. And I think they feel Facebook that they're being quite deft in the sense that they're handling it from within and understanding what their response should be.</p><p>I have to say they have been proactive here in Canada, Julia. We have an election, the Federal election in the fall. They've already come up with a template, which could be used in other countries, perhaps to go forward and say, \"Look, we will proactively look at coordination between these actors on our social media platform. We will look for things that are inauthentic, we will report it.\"</p><p>But you know, we're back at square one, Julia. The Committee chair saying to me that from Mr. Zuckerberg himself, we have heard so many promises and we have not seen yet the action that we need. And that's at the very heart of this. And it's something that investors should look for as well, because that will mean it will shape the character of the legislation to come in the month that we're going to continue to cover these hearings and cover the different laws around the globe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If regulators don't act, nothing will change because users aren't changing their behavior and advertisers aren't changing their behavior. But I won't go down that rabbit hole, Paula, because I talked about this too much. Paula Newton, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let's move on to actually my favorite story of the day. MacKenzie Bezos donating half her nearly $37 billion fortune to charity after signing the Giving Pledge. It comes just month after finalizing a divorce, of course, from Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss.</p><p>Notably Jeff, not signing the pledge so far. Anna Stewart joins me now. Anna, I love this story. But I also love the justification that she gave for why she is doing this. Tell us more.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It's a statement, a lesson that's really going to resonate with so many people. As you said, she is freshly minted as a billionaire and I'll just read you a little extract of what she said. She said, \"We each come by the gifts we have to offer by an infinite series of influences and lucky breaks we can never fully understand. In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share.\"</p><p>And she certainly does, as you said, we value her around $37 billion. She's now newly become the 22nd richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. And of course, very recently, as well now as opposed - - as this pledge how it works.</p><p>There are about over 200 individuals and families who have signed up to this, they pledged to give away half or over half of their fortunes, sometime either during their life or after. It could be in their will. They can give to any causes they like. There's no set charity or anything, it can be to any cause as they see fit to. And it has gained many big names like Mark Zuckerberg, like Bill Gates, of course, not her ex-husband, Jeff Bezos, who is the world's richest man.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Dun-dun-dun. You've brought the gauntlet down. Jeff Bezos, the ball in your court, my friend.</p><p>STEWART: Yes, but you know, I will give him a break here. He does give to charities. For instance, he's got the One Day Fund which helps homeless people. He has already pledged $2 billion to that, but he hasn't signed this pledge. And I think that's what lots of people will be questioning today.</p><p>But it's interesting, Julia, lots of other people on this list and I like to see it as a nice little barometer of where the money is. Plenty of investors, I say this list of the new names that were added today, mostly founders of big investment firms. But we also -- interesting -- have two co-founders of Bitcoin exchanges or digital currency exchanges, and three co-founders of digital startups -- Twilio, Pinterest and WhatsApp. So there you go, kids, that's what you should be doing with your careers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Anna, my mother would call that a kick up the bottom and a pat on the head at the same time. Thank you for that. Anna Stewart there. Thank you for that. All right, coming up on FIRST MOVE, don't panic. Robots could be coming to your doorstep soon. Helper robots, thanks to Ford. We've got the details next.</p><p>[09:42:14] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" The \"Sports Illustrated\" brand has been sold by Meredith Corporation to Authentic Brands Group for $110 million. However, in an unusual arrangement, Meredith Corporation will continue to publish the iconic magazine and website. Meanwhile, Authentic Brands will handle things like marketing and business development.</p><p>Coming to a home near you soon, Ford is experimenting with a package carrying robot. The automakers say it is testing the walking robot to carry deliveries from its self-driving cars to customer's doorsteps. The robot called Digit can reportedly climb steps and walk on uneven terrain.</p><p>Dr. Ken Washington is the Chief Technology Officer at Ford and he join us now from the hump company's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Great to have you with us there, Ken. Fantastic.</p><p>CNN did a feature on this and I was pretty mesmerized. Talk to me about the work that you're doing on Digit and how it fits with your broader autonomous technology development.</p><p>KEN WASHINGTON, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, FORD: Well, it's great to be here. We are really enjoying the work that we're doing with Agility Robotics. This is a research project to help us understand how might we pair a robot with our self-driving car, so that we can complete the task that the customer has requested, which is to have their package delivered to their doorstep.</p><p>A vehicle can only get to the curb, our self-driving vehicle will finish the job by handing it off to the robot and the robot would carry the package to the door. There's a lot to do between now and the time when we realize that vision. That's why we're doing this research.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That was going to be my next question. How far away are we from actually seeing this kind of technology in use on a day to day basis?</p><p>WASHINGTON: Well, it's a little hard to guess, but we don't think it is very far. But there's still a lot of unanswered questions starting with how would the robot interact with the vehicle? That's why the first thing that we tackled in our research with Agility Robotics was to develop a deploy mechanism so the robot can store itself in the back of the vehicle.</p><p>And then when the self-driving vehicle arrives, they can deploy itself safely onto the street and then move to the next task, which is carrying the package. But there's still a lot to do. We're hoping to move this research forward so that by 2021, we might have a good chance of deploying it with that vehicle. But it's just too soon to say that that's going to be the timeline.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, that's quite fascinating for me when you're saying dates like 2021, you've made comments in the past that we have to be very careful when we're talking about autonomous vehicle technology.</p><p>There's a difference between technology that backs and supports a driver and operating a car and makes their life easier versus operating in an autonomous vehicle technology ecosystem where cars, vehicles, things are all talking to each other.</p><p>[09:45:13] CHATTERLEY: And I know you're doing work on that in places like Miami and Washington D.C., just explain the difference for me here, because I do think this is incredibly important for our viewers to understand.</p><p>WASHINGTON: That's right, the SAE International has defined five levels of autonomy. And we have made it very clear that levels one, two, and three involve a driver that is responsible for the driving task. That driver in levels, one, two, and three can be assisted by technology and we're deploying better and better and more capable assistance technology to the vehicles that our customers buy today and will buy tomorrow.</p><p>The next two levels, four and five are full autonomy. Self-driving cars, as we call them, our levels four, and maybe one day level five. Level four being in a controlled region when there is no driver. That car is its own driver. That's why we call it self-driving.</p><p>Digit and our self-driving cars are designed to work for the level four and level five self-driving vehicle, because there's no driver, there's no driver to hop out and come around and carry the package to the door. We're hoping that that can be done by a robot.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you're saying that that kind of technology could be on the road by 2021.</p><p>WASHINGTON: It's a possibility. We're not making a commitment at this time to say that, but that's why we're doing the research. You know, if you could wind the clock back five years, and the vehicle that we're going to deploy in 2021 was a research project at Ford. And now it's a production product.</p><p>So this is the same kind of thing. We do the research now so that later it can go into production when it's ready, but only when it's ready, which is why the research is so important to do to answer those questions that we need to answer because safety is job one here. You want to be able to deliver a package safely, efficiently, and you want it to be able to solve a real problem.</p><p>You don't want to just deploy robots and other technology for technology's sake, you want to be able to do it in a way that is actually helping someone meet a need that they have. And so we're testing out, will this meet a need? And will it be more efficient than some other mechanism for delivering packages?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And very quickly, technologies, just one side regulation and regulations being willing to accept this kind of technology on the streets, to your point about safety is the other. What kind of conversations are you having both at the state and at the Federal level about regulation and their comfort level with seeing this in the next two to three years?</p><p>WASHINGTON: Well, it is very early in the robotic delivery space. So the conversations with policymakers and regulators that haven't even begun yet. But you've made a really great point, which is, that has to be part of the research as well, just like the vehicle part.</p><p>The self-driving car that we're scheduled to deploy in 2021 in certain regions has a very active project to work with regulators and policymakers in partnership with our technical partners, so that we can know that when we deploy this vehicle in the cities that we deploy it that we're doing it in a way that meets regulation and that meets policy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's so exciting. You're going to come back and talk to us soon, please. Dr. Ken Washington, Chief Technology Officer at Ford. Thank you so much for joining us on FIRST MOVE.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break, but up next, from electric currents to ocean currents, how IBM's latest venture is making waves in the shipping industry. We will speak to IBM's head of blockchain to understand how they're putting that technology to great use. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:51:11] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Blockchain the word conjures up dark alleys, room and cryptocurrency miners, not the open seas of global commerce. But now it's time to update that image.</p><p>Blockchain is behind the IBM platform developed with the likes of Maersk that tracks 90 percent of global commerce. That's after two more shipping companies joined the venture just today.</p><p>Joining me now is Bridget van Kralingen. She is the charge of everything blockchain at IBM. And she is Senior Vice President of IBM Global Industries, Clients, Platforms and Blockchain. Wow, that's a title. But great to have you on the show. Explain what TradeLens is.</p><p>BRIDGET VAN KRALINGEN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, IBM GLOBAL INDUSTRIES, CLIENTS, PLATFORMS AND BLOCKCHAIN: So Julia, thanks for having me here today. I'm so excited that CMA and MSC have joined TradeLens and TradeLens is a platform for the entire shipping supply chain and what it allows them to happen is that any participant in the ecosystem, whether you are a shipper, a carrier or a freight forwarder, they can put the shipping records and data on the blockchain and share it immutably.</p><p>So we take a complex supply chain, and we have shared crusted data. The significance of this is quite huge. At the moment, the World Economic Forum reckons that 20 percent of the cost of shipping is in document exchange. And what we do is we completely reduce that by having it shared in one's doc.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Twenty percent of the cost is simply down to documentation, filling up paperwork, and you're basically stripping that back and saying it would effectively no longer be needed.</p><p>For me, one of the huge statistics that you brought out, 90 percent of the estimated $16 trillion in global goods that are moving around the world is done by shipping, 90 percent. So you're tackling an industry here, not only bringing down but also hugely vital to global trade here, too.</p><p>VAN KRALINGEN: Correct, correct. That's exactly right. Ninety percent of what you use every day is actually shipped. So the implication of being able to make it with more efficiency and more inclusive is huge for global trade.</p><p>The World Economic Forum thinks that around 15 percent more efficiency can arise by tackling the cost issues from paper documentation and manual work for that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: One of the things that we were tracking when the trade war between China and the United States began was how quickly ships could get to China and if they could do it before the tariffs hit. And it was something that we were watching very closely on the show.</p><p>This also allows you to track exactly where things are and when at a given point in time. So it also facilitates just understanding where ships are at any given moment, is that right?</p><p>VAN KRALINGEN: That's absolutely correct. It reduces wait times in ports, wait times for immigration clearances, because everybody's got the correct and right document and knows where it is at a point in time because of the complex number of participants.</p><p>And the beauty of this, it's an example of openness that it's good for the whole industry. It is an example of how blockchain is moving beyond the tourism phase to dealing with real complex networks.</p><p>So this kind of scaling that we're seeing in TradeLens for the shipping industry, we're seeing the same thing for food and food safety and food provenance and food trust. We're seeing the same complex systems that becomes simple and transparent.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So it's something that you can map to other industries and you're doing it with food as well as you mentioned.</p><p>VAN KRALINGEN: Yes, one of the reasons IBM invested so early on in creating the number one now enterprise blockchain network and technology is because we realized that complex supply chains, where there are multiple parties who need to trust each other and have permissions, secure an immutable way have loads of room for efficiency improvement.</p><p>So you can think about cross border finance, food trust where we have millions and millions of SKUs for food, sustainability, provenance and safety. Diamonds on a blockchain, conflict minerals and metals on the blockchain, all of which the supply chains are made more efficient, more trusted and more economically viable and better for the consumer. It also shows that the provenance of whatever you've got.</p><p>[09:55:20] CHATTERLEY: I mean, I know one of the things you looked at was food poisoning, you could track back to the fish that was originally causing the food poisoning and where it had been shipped to. I mean, that the technology here is so vital --</p><p>VAN KRALINGEN: Block chain with the food industry ecosystem, which involves firms like Walmart, Albertsons, Nestle, you name it and why they're so excited about it is food recall for something that is bad. Like romaine lettuce in New York City. Best in class today is Walmart and it takes them six days and 18 hours.</p><p>With blockchain, we've run multiple goods whether it's pork or mangos and we can recall them in two seconds. Think about the impact for that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Already. Never mind crypto, it is all about blockchain. You've sold me. Thank you.</p><p>VAN KRALINGEN: ... food poisoning ever yet. We're going to stop there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. Thanks for watching.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019052801cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W71-NRB1-DXH2-62NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 28, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002ERK</classCode><className>GLOBAL PAYMENTS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002H00</classCode><className>TOTAL SYSTEM SERVICES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

The report found that globally a record $US111.8 billion was invested in fintech firms in 2018, with Asian funding reaching a new high of $US22.7 billion across 372 deals.</p><p>KPMG said the $US600 million in Australian investments occurred across 28 deals in total, with the largest being the $US245 million sale of Avoka Technologies to Swiss tech company Temenos in December.</p><p>KPMG Australia head of banking and global co-lead for fintech Ian Pollari said that private equity and merger and acquisition activity had added to VC funding to drive local industry growth, and flagged the emergence of the open banking regime as a major catalyst for more.</p><p>Open banking gives access to customer data held by banks to external providers, such as technology companies, which can use it to create products and services.</p><p>\"These will be fintech companies and start-ups with services and capabilities that can enable banks to comply and/or help them to be operationally ready to meet their deadlines,\" Mr Pollari said. \"This can range from areas such as API management services, data sharing and ingestion capability, consent management, as well as identity and authentication services.\"</p><p>He predicted Australian banks and financial institutions will also look beyond domestic investments to markets such as the UK, as seen with ANZ's recent participation in a Series A funding round for Bud, a UK open banking platform.</p><p>The KPMG report found that Asian fintech deals represented a fifth of the total global funding, with China accounting for the majority with $US18.2 billion.</p><p>The Asian numbers were swelled by a huge $US14 billion series C investment in Chinese online payment platform Ant Financial last year, which was reported to be the biggest-ever single fundraising globally by a private company.</p><p>The global report predicted that 2019 would see more larger deals, influenced by the increasing participation in the fintech space from big tech players such as Google, Alibaba and Microsoft. It suggested this would come in the form of acquisitions and partnership arrangements.</p><p>It predicted a year of consolidation in more mature areas like payments and lending, as well as emerging areas like blockchain, as start-ups look to scale and fuel international growth.</p><p>Mr Pollari said the recently concluded Financial Services Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry would lead to increased investment and activity in areas such as regtech (regulatory technology) and suptech (supervisory technology.)</p><p>\"In particular, this will be in areas such as conduct risk, regulatory compliance, income and expense verification,\" he said. \"In addition, I expect banks and other participants in retail banking will be looking at investments and partnerships that give them access to digital mortgage capabilities.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc748akvrsjd411yptelh4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH6-9SJ1-F0J6-J217-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

(OTCQX: WEYL[1]) are benefiting. According to one recent report[2], \"Indonesia's fintech industry is in the midst of a period of significant growth. P2P lending recorded a triple-digit increase in 2018, while e-payment services have grown more than six-fold since 2012, prompting a surge of new foreign investment into a vibrant and increasingly diverse start-up community.\" </p><p>A recent article from FinTechNews[3] reported on the growth of the Fintech industry in Indonesia, with specific focus on one of the major players in the industry, the private company Gojek. \"Jakarta, Indonesia, is home to Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group. Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company, and also the first \"decacorn\" company[4] in Indonesia that's worth more than US$10 billion. Gojek operates Indonesia's fourth biggest e-wallet service Go-Pay, and from its headquarters in Jakarta, has expanded across the region to markets including Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.\" Weyland Tech, Inc. (OTCQX: WEYL[5]) is also aiming to seize a part of this giant opportunity. Weyland is a growing global provider of m-Commerce and fintech business enablement solutions with its CreateApp Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia, They recently reported[6] selected preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019. The company's subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), operates AtozPay and AtozGo. The AtozPay mobile payments platform serves the burgeoning m-Commerce and e-Payment markets in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. AtozGo is a fast-growing short-distance food delivery service in Jakarta, Indonesia. For the third quarter 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $9.0 million, which would represent an increase of 6.6% compared to the third quarter of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, the company expects record revenue of approximately $24.6 million, which would represent an increase of 42.6% versus the same year-ago period.

The technology empowers SMBs to increase sales, reach more customers, manage logistics, and promote their products and services in an easy, affordable and highly efficient way. Gojek was most recently in the news[7] as Gojek CEO and co-Founder, Nadiem Makarim announced on Monday that he had resigned to join Indonesia's new cabinet. The ride-hailing and payments company said two senior executives would jointly take over running operations of the $10 billion firm. \"We will make an announcement on what this news means for Gojek within the next few days,\" the Company said, referring to Makarim, who has been the face of the tech startup. The Indonesian company, valued at $10 billion, raised over $1 billion earlier this year from backers including Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ: GOOG[8]) (NASDAQ: GOOGL[9]) and Chinese tech giants Tencent and JD. Google, which has invested $500 million in Gojek, declined to comment on Makarim's departure, while Tencent and JD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Boku Inc (LSE: BOKU[10]), also recently announced[11] a partnership with GoPay, the digital payments platform of Gojek, the largest on-demand multi-service provider in Southeast Asia.

The funding gives Akulaku, which does most of its business in Indonesia but recently expanded into Vietnam and the Philippines, a $450 million valuation, according to Deal Street Asia[14]. Just a few days earlier, the outlet cited anonymous sources who said the startup was planning[15] to raise $100 million in a Series D funding round.

Banks and other institutions are looking to collaborate with emerging FinTech operators to future-proof their businesses, or risk becoming obsolete as tech-enabled rivals provide cheaper, faster services.</p><p>But Ms Lagarde said the growing participation of technology firms in the financial services industry poses risks and increases the need for tight regulation of the fast-growing FinTech sector.</p><p>\"This presents a unique systemic challenge to financial stability and efficiency, and one I hope we can touch on during the G20, and address in a cooperative and consistent fashion,\" she said.</p><p>In particular, China presents an example of the trade-off between benefits and challenges posed by financial technology. \"Over the last five years, technology growth in China has been extremely successful and allowed millions of new entrants to benefit from access to financial products and the creation of high-quality jobs,\" she said.</p><p>\"But it has also led to two firms controlling more than 90 per cent of the mobile payments market.\"</p><p>In an IMF blog post from March last year, Ms Lagarde said governments seeking to regulate FinTech face challenges. \"Their task isn't an easy one,\" she wrote. \"On the one hand, they must protect consumers and investors against fraud and combat tax evasion, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, ensuring that risks are thoroughly understood and managed. They must also protect the integrity and stability of the financial system.</p><p>\"On the other hand, they must beware of stifling innovation that responsibly and sustainably benefits the public.\"</p><p>Developing a forward-looking regulatory framework calls for creativity, flexibility and new expertise, she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATION-146324262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATION2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W99-75P1-F11P-X26H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Abu Dhabi Media Company Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The approvals come a day after Jelena McWilliams, Chairman of the FDIC, signaled the FDIC was considering two pending deposit insurance applications for ILCs[3]. Both companies still need to obtain the approval of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions to obtain an ILC charter.The approvals are significant for several reasons for fintechs and other non-bank companies. Most notably, they are the first of their kind since 2008, when the FDIC approved a single application for deposit insurance for an ILC. It also establishes a viable path forward for fintechs and other non-bank companies seeking a banking charter to allow them to offer their own proprietary products and services directly to customers and operate independently and more efficiently across the country. </p><p>ILCs also are attractive to fintechs and other non-bank companies because, for the time being, their parent companies do not become subject to the activities and investment restrictions of the Bank Holding Company Act and the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve on a consolidated basis. In other words, ILCs technically can be owned and controlled by commercial companies. Finally, the approvals closely follow in time the FDIC's February approval of Varo Bank's application for deposit insurance[4]. Ultimately, the approvals demonstrate that 'non-traditional' entities can satisfy the rigorous statutory and regulatory requirements to enter the industry and validate the viability of their respective business models.The conditions in the FDIC's approval orders are generally consistent with approval orders for traditional insured depository institutions. Expectedly, they require higher capital requirements, including a tier 1 leverage ratio of 20% in the case of Square and 12% in the case of Nelnet (Varo Bank is required to maintain a tier 1 leverage ratio of 10%). Likewise, both parent companies and controlling shareholders are required to enter into customary capital and liquidity maintenance agreements ('CALMA') and parent company agreements.FDIC Director Martin Gruenberg opposed Square's application on the grounds that it did not meet the statutory requirements under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, including source of financial strength. In that connection, he cited several concerns, including that Square has never been profitable since it formed in 2009, was reliant on a business model that is 'highly vulnerable to an economic downturn', and the viability of the proposed ILC would be entirely reliant on the parent company. In his separate statement[5], he also cited 'extraordinary conditions' included in Square's CALMA, including maintaining the 20% tier 1 leverage ratio at the proposed ILC and establishing a $50 million emergency fund in the event Square, Inc. failed to provide sufficient funds to the proposed ILC. He opined the conditions were 'reflective of the underlying weakness of the application.' He also described the conditions in the parent company agreement, several of which were described in the FDIC's March 17 proposed rule for ILCs and their parent companies[6]. Gruenberg voted to approve Nelnet's application, though he did issue a separate statement[7] discussing his opinions.The ILC charter has garnered significant opposition from community banks, community groups, trade associations, and others. This longstanding opposition stems from the fact that an ILC charter allows a commercial firm to own and control an FDIC-insured depository institution. Opponents argue this mixing of banking and commerce results in an uneven regulatory playing field, increases the risk of consumer harm, poses conflicts of interest and privacy concerns, and threatens the stability of the U.S. financial system, among other things. Opponents also have expressed concern that granting any fintech FDIC-insured ILC charter is a slippery slope toward allowing large U.S. 'Big Tech' giants such as Apple, Google, and Amazon to enter banking.The attention now shifts to pending deposit insurance applications for ILCs that are not predominantly financial in nature. In her statement accompanying the proposed rule[8], Chairman McWilliams noted that 'some industrial banks today are owned by nonfinancial commercial firms, and the FDIC has received applications from groups seeking to establish new banks owned by commercial parents. Questions about the mixing of banking and commerce, and the ability of banks to affiliate with nonfinancial firms, involve complicated policy trade-offs that are best addressed by Congress.'Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce company akin to Amazon, currently has an application pending. Its application promises to focus renewed attention on large tech firms, fintechs, and other non-bank companies seeking U.S. banking charters and the mixing of banking and commerce. Deposit insurance applications for commercially owned ILCs may be forced to wait to receive approval for federal deposit insurance until the FDIC adopts a final rule for ILCs and their parent companies. That process could take a long time.

This \u201cyoung destroyers\u201d misconception no...</p><p>The fintech-big bank relationship is often depicted as a David-versus-Goliath story. This is wrong, says Lloyds\u2019 Ravi Bhalla, the startups are not here to fell big banks, but to work with them. Mohamed Dabo reports.    This \u201cyoung destroyers\u201d misconception notably comes with two others, according to Bhalla, head of Group Design at Lloyds banking group: big banks are dinosaurs and fintechs are new kids on the block.    \u201cMany fintechs profess to have been operating in this space long before the term \u2018fintech\u2019 came around and became a globally used moniker.\u201d    He pointed to the advent of ATMs in the 1960s and the development of the industry-wide SWIFT payment infrastructure collaboration in the 1970s\u2014two examples, among countless others, showing fintechs are no spring chickens.    In any case, \u201cthe pace of change we\u2019re experiencing is simply frightening,\u201d he says.    It can be summed up neatly in a shift in architectural patterns, he says. From that of traditional monolithic-product-silos structures, with separate systems and data sets, to a target architecture state.    \u201cThe latter is free of technical debt, built on cloud infrastructure and APIs as its foundation.\u201d   Three notable fintech trends   Three major trends have captured Bhalla\u2019s attention:    The first is fintech\u2019s exploitation of open banking. \u201cFor example, through Revolut\u2019s partnership with TrueLayer, customers can see all their accounts and budget in on place.\u201d    The second trend is big tech\u2019s partnerships with established banks. \u201cAmazon and Goldman Sachs, through the use of Amazon\u2019s lending platform.\u201d    Another example is Lloyds banking group\u2019s recent partnership with Google, \u201cutilising Google\u2019s cloud platforms as a strategic tool to increase engineering capability, AI, and machine learning.\u201d    The thirdly is the rise of neobanks. \u201cThe top 2 neobanks in particular, Revolut and Monzo, have seen tremendous outgrowth recently,\u201d he says. \u201cWhilst at the same time, we\u2019ve seen the outgrowth of establish banks decline.\u201d    This last trend, he says, is largely fuelled by the tech-savvy behaviour of millennials.   The fintech investment level   In the UK alone, investment figures have doubled between 2017 and 2019, Bhalla notes. Global fintech investments have increased 30% over the last five years. Much of this has been driven by M&amp;A and PE activity.    \u201cRecently in the UK, Resolute was able to secure $500\u2019s worth of funding, which has made them the most valuable fintech in the UK, trebling their value.\u201d    However, there are still a number of challenges for fintechs. Many of them still have to turn a profit.    \u201cThe UK\u2019s regulatory environment is poorly supportive of innovation and development, via the FDA\u2019s sandbox,\u201d Bhalla says.    In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched its \u201cInnovate\u201d programme to support firms developing the innovative products and services of the future.    This resulted in the creation of sandbox, aimed at allowing businesses to test innovative propositions in the market, with real consumers.    \u201cOnly 4 out of 10 receive any further investment post the FCA\u2019s sandbox activity.\u201d   Partnership with fintechs   \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing appetite for established banks to acquire fintech firms,\u201d Bhalla says.    These ventures present both opportunities and challenges.   Opportunities   With is the underlying rationale for banks to partner with fintechs?    For starters, \u201cthe opportunity to challenge your own business model.\u201d    Fintechs also give banks the chance to enhance their customer experience. \u201cAdopting a user-centred design approach can help drive customer loyalty, richer user experience, and greater levels of trust.\u201d    The startups bring increased agility and adaptability. \u201cThis can accelerate the execution of minimum viable propositions which are much more effective in tailoring to changing customer\u2019s needs.\u201d    The ability to transform culture through innovation. \u201cIt also gives an opportunity to shift more towards a societal focus, given the increased regulatory importance placed on areas such as customer vulnerability and sustainability.\u201d    Fintechs, of course, represent investment opportunity. \u201cAn investment opportunity that brings with it cost reduction as well as faster, easier, and cheaper solutions.\u201d   Challenges   Great as partnering with, or acquiring, a fintech could potentially be for a bank, there needs to be some conditions for the collaboration to bear fruits.    \u201cBoth organisations should have a certain level of technical, cultural, and strategic fit to make the partnership work smoothly.\u201d    Bhalla has decerned certain characteristics that are common to successful fintech partnerships:    \u201cHaving a shared understanding of the problem statement. Shared vison, values, goals, and risk. As well as the appetite for all parties to share those features.\u201d    What is the true impact of technology on the business? \u201cA clear end-to-end framework with a clear understanding of the impact of technology, the architectural components and the integration levels required to across the organisation.\u201d    Success often calls for a plug-and-play business model. This a ready-made business model which is already set up and selling products or services. \u201cDeveloping a plug-and-play model to leverage multi-player capability to optimise and scale offerings.\u201d    There\u2019s little doubt that banks are now seeing financial technology companies as allies, not enemies.    In recent years, the financial industry has seen fast-growing adoption of financial technology. Banks and venture capital funds have made sizeable investments in fintech, reflecting their expectations for substantial change in the industry.    When David and Goliath work together, the customer is the ultimate winner.

Most of them said they wanted little to do with finance. But then 10 years ago, Silicon Valley had the aura of being full of bright, young individuals who wanted to improve the standard of living of the world. They considered themselves apart from, if not a cut above, the Wall Street that had just caused a crisis. But as the banking industry should have figured out, time but chiefly money, changes things. There are now 52 tech billionaires in California and 53 finance billionaires in New York.Hustle</p><p>Big tech and Wall Street look pretty evenly matched in a fight. A recent oped in the NY Times on Silicon Valley's work ethic makes one shudder. While banks introduce \"~protected weekends' and limit hours for junior bankers, tech firms are doing the opposite. They have their own version of \"~lunch is for wimps', and it is called the \"hustle\"; where 18-hour days are worn like badges and Lyft drivers who ferry passengers while in labour are heroes (or rather heroines).</p><p>\"Outgrind, outhustle, outwork everyone,\" is one of many similar slogans on the T-shirts of young tech billionaire-wannabes. If it were written on a tie, you could mistake yourself for being on Wall Street in the 1980s.</p><p>Faced with a younger, hungrier version of themselves, banks indeed have a reason to be nervous.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-3755649</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PR5-RJY1-F0GS-H1PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CYB9</classCode><className>LIVING STANDARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D4VJ</classCode><className>BIG DATA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A2VZ</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N524000CC</classCode><className>INSURANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DLCR</classCode><className>RIDE SHARING SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST00629349</classCode><className>CREDIT RATINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It also topped (50 per cent) in overall funding for fintech start-ups since 2015.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UAE's unique demographic, with a majority expatriate population made up of a diverse mix of nationalities, makes it a strategic jurisdiction for a number of international operations connecting people to services from their home countries. Local fintechs are also on the rise with a number of incubator programmes run by local regulators focusing on developing home-grown start-ups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The focus on fintech that we are seeing has mostly originated from non-traditional financial services companies rather than traditional financial institutions. Nonetheless, traditional financial institutions have been exploring and, in some cases adopting, new financial technologies.</p><p>As fintech lowers the barriers to entry and changes consumer habits and preferences, traditional financial institutions need to innovate to maintain market share. Fintech services have the potential to save a huge amount of operating costs \u2014 for example, by automating traditionally labour-intensive tasks such as KYC checks \u2014 and reduce compliance risk if used correctly.</p><p>Getting it right</p><p>There are a variety of stakeholders who have vested interests in the development of fintech. New entrants are clearly concerned about the legality of their business model and set up. Traditional financial institutions explore how they can use new technologies to offer new products, or offer existing products through new platforms and the associated conduct risk that that entails.</p><p>Regulators are also not immune to the challenges that Fintech raises and they seek to ensure that new technologies do not compromise the stability of the financial system, consumer rights and the ever-ongoing fight against financial crime.</p><p>We expect to see continued and more coordinated scrutiny of the moves by Big Tech into finance by regulators in the finance, data and competition spheres, with the potential for more enforcement action as regulators focus on the protection of consumers.</p><p>It's all about resilience</p><p>We also expect firms to intensify their focus on operational resilience to address commercial risks and meet mounting concerns among regulators. This is in the wake of larger and more frequent systems failures and hacks globally, and in the context of certain systemic risks being concentrated as firms increasingly outsource key functions.</p><p>Firms will look to collaborate where appropriate including on cybersecurity arrangements.</p><p>Reaching out</p><p>Policymakers will prioritise public-private engagement and industry outreach to find tech-driven solutions to cyber crime threats, including on threat assessment and action plans, information sharing, payments systems and authorised push payment fraud, digital identity services, the use of cryptoassets for money laundering, and the detection and reporting of suspicious transactions (including through the innovative use of cryptography and machine learning).</p><p>While some of the necessary tech already notionally exists, regulators and major firms will strive to agree on marketwide solutions that are more effective than siloed efforts.</p><p>One of the challenges in the expansion of fintech relates to the regulatory classification of the products and services. In many jurisdictions in the Middle East, temporary regulatory sandboxes have been created but more permanent licensing regimes remain nascent.</p><p>The UAE Government is committed to making the country a regional and world leader for fintech. We therefore expect the Government's strategy of moving early to implement regulations and making significant amounts of capital available to fintech start-ups to continue.</p><p>The UAE's Securities and Commodities Authority released the initial draft of its Regulation for Issuing and Offering Crypto Assets in October last for feedback from interested parties. This year, this regulation will be finalised and brought into law, making the UAE one of the first countries in the world to have a comprehensive legislative approach to crypto assets.</p><p>The UAE Central Bank has announced that it will be creating a fintech office.

This led a tripling of traffic on social media and at contact centres, where customers can get in touch via telephone, e-mail or SMS.</p><p>Corporate customers, especially those that need to make bulk cash deposits, have had more difficulty adapting, Moyo says.</p><p>Some of these have heavy documentation requirements for imports and exports.</p><p>The bank has made it easier for new retail clients to sign up via mobile phone. Bank cards cannot be mailed out for security reasons, so greater use of agents is being made in supermarkets and workplaces.</p><p>The bank may extend use of such partners so that basic banking operations can be carried out in a physical setting for those who need one, she explains.</p><p>Pleasant surprises and problems</p><p>Since taking over, Moyo has been pleasantly surprised by the depth of the bank's talent pool, the strength of compliance teams and the 'clean, strong' balance sheet.</p><p>'I haven't had to spend my time fixing things.'</p><p>A problem that the bank needed to fix resulted from the arrest of 28 of its tellers in April 2019 on charges of defrauding the bank and its customers by replacing US dollar deposits with local RTGS dollars. The fraud reportedly cost the bank $1,1 million. </p><p>As a result, system controls have been introduced to keep the currencies separate, Moyo says. There are now daily cash reconstructions for the separate currencies. Recruitment procedures for tellers have been tightened and psychometric tests are now used. </p><p>Fintech squeeze</p><p>There hasn't been a heavy impact from the pandemic on borrowers. The bank has little exposure to tourism and less than 2 percent of corporate and retail customers have needed a repayment holiday, Moyo says. She explains this by the bank's historically conservative lending policies.</p><p>The bank has been 'selective' rather than 'aggressive' in its lending, she says.</p><p>According to The Promise of Fintech, a report from the IMF in July, Zimbabwe is among countries where mobile payments have largely replaced cash transactions, and progress in financial inclusion is entirely driven by fintech. Mobile-money transactions in Zimbabwe in 2018 exceeded 75 percent of GDP, the IMF says.</p><p>The IMF notes that greater global use of digital financial services poses risks to financial stability if regulation does not keep pace. Potential cybersecurity risks will proliferate.</p><p>International agreements will be needed in areas like cybersecurity, data privacy, digital identification, cross-border digital currencies and the regulation of 'Big Tech' companies, the report says. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BHZIMB-BUSINESSWEEKLY1708202000012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BHZIMB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M5-7JB1-F00C-620P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436438</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Zimpapers LTD 1980 All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Weekly</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001925</classCode><className>BUSINESS OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLDV</classCode><className>IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

That will be the real thermometer of whether this law has been sufficiently stimulating for entrepreneurs and their projects or, on the contrary, too demanding, or with barriers to entry and operations too high or too hard,\" he says.<br/>He adds that the fintech law will lead to the consolidation and disappearance of \"some noise\", besides that great players, both from tech companies and from the world of non-Mexican capital, will help not only to provide this market with another dimension, but knowledge from other more developed markets, mainly in the United States, much more mature in both content.<br/>Improved<br/>Oriol Ros believes that the fintech law is surely improveable by the learning that is being had, and that today most of the companies presented are responding to the latest questions that the CNBV marks them before operating.<br/>He points out that it is a double-edged weapon for traditional banking, because if it is very hard, it will not leave much room for innovation, since it requires high doses of capitalization for these startups that do not have that muscle yet.<br/>\"But on the other hand, banking is very interested in having them go into surgery and collaborate with the best and most disruptive, to approach them and use that innovative arm to compete against big tech, in the medium term the main enemy of this industry,\" he emphasizes.<br/>The Latinia executive points out that Mexico is today the main market in terms of fintech initiatives and projects, together with Brazil.<br/>\"Historically Brazil was that market by far from the rest, but in the last two years Mexico has dramatically cut that distance to be fully on par with Brazil, like a horse race. Scale is everything, both Mexico and Brazil wear it as standard,\" he emphasizes.<br/>Based on this, he comments that Latinia has made certain investments in Mexican fintech, either directly or through its alliance with Startupbootcamp.<br/>To date, Latinia has made 45 investments directly as a partner of Startupbootcamp through its acceleration and scaling programs in fintech startups; direct investments in eight Mexican companies or with operations in the Aztec country.<br/>\"Latinia has taken a small stake through the acceleration and escalation programs of Startupbootcamp, of which we are investment partners, taking stakes in up to 45 companies, which are the ones that have passed through the program the last three years\", Exposed.<br/>Fintech in which Latinia has invested in Mexico<br/>\u2022 Dapp<br/>\u2022 Facturedo<br/>\u2022 Lending<br/>Flink<br/>\u2022 Your identity<br/>\u2022 UALET<br/>\u2022 Prometheus<br/>\u2022 Belvo<br/>[email protected]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10432819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1S-3S61-JBJN-M1GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"523\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

Around 19 percent of financial institutions in the U.S. are new entrants, such as challenger banks, non-bank payments institutions and big tech companies, according to the report. </p><p>Yet they have amassed only 3.5 percent of the total $1.04 trillion in banking and payment revenues so-far, Accenture found. In the UK, new entrants have made a larger dent, having captured 14 percent of the total \u20ac206 billion ($238.45 billion) in industry revenues, with the majority going to non-bank payments companies, according to the report. Accenture assessed more than 20,000 banking and payments institutions across seven markets around the world to determine the level of change that digital technologies have brought about in banking. Since the financial downturn, a growing number of companies across the world have sought to position themselves as cheaper and more user-friendly alternatives to banks by making better use of new technology. Banking and payments institutions have decreased by nearly 20 percent from 2005 to 2017. Still, one in six current institutions is what Accenture considers a new entrant, or companies that have entered the market since 2005. Their impact has varied by geography. Tougher regulations and greater dominance of large banks have made the U.S. a more difficult market for new entrants in areas excluding payments, Alan McIntyre, head of Accenture's global banking practice, said in an interview. 'You still have a very robust banking market in the US,' McIntyre said. More than half of new current accounts opened in the United States have been captured by three large banks, which have had more money to invest in digital than smaller regional players, he added. In the UK the situation has been different, thanks in part to a push from regulators aimed at fostering greater competition in the financial sector and diminishing the dominance of large banks. New entrants account for 63 percent of financial players in the UK, according to the report. The report also found new entrants are taking over one third of new revenue, pointing to their potential to pose a greater competitive threat going forward. In Europe, including the UK, 20 percent of banking and payments institutions are new entrants and have captured nearly 7 percent of total banking revenues, according to the report.

(OTCQX:WEYL) is eyeing many opportunities and has already outperformed its 2018 revenue numbers, company CEO, Brent Suen stated in a recent interview with Investorideas.com.<br/>Listen to the podcast<br/>https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3<br/>'For 2018 we had top line revenues of $22.6 million,' he said. 'This year, in the first nine months of operations \u2026 based on our preliminary announcement \u2026 we're already exceeding last year's entire full-year numbers in the first nine months of this year. That is due to distribution partners, or what we call white label partnerships, who are seeing considerably higher growth from the additional functionality that we added in over this past nine months.'<br/>Weyland, a developer and global provider of mobile business software applications, operates its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Suen indicated that a top priority of the company is an uplisting, which would enhance the company's profile and opportunities.<br/>Weyland typically enters markets with its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) application, which allows micro and small businesses to design apps themselves, and market and promote their goods and services to their end customers much more affordably than having a third party designer.<br/>'Our app, CreateApp\u2122, enables the business owner to do a number of things, but the four primary ones are: a) to market and promote their goods and services, b) to enable them to sell online through the phone, c) to pay for them through the phone, and then d) have them delivered through logistics delivery or courier if it's nearby.<br/>The company is taking a different approach to the Indonesian market, where roughly 70 percent of the population is unbanked, according to Suen, and therefore rely on alternatives such as e-wallets. Because of this, Weyland has entered the Indonesian market via its subsidiary, WeylandIndonesia Perkasa (WIP), and its ewallet Atozpay.<br/>'When you don't have bank accounts or credit cards \u2026 trying to sell things through the phone - e-commerce and m-commerce - is extraordinarily difficult to do in that type of environment,' he said. 'So what has ended up happening is that the prevalence of mobile payments or e-wallets, of which Atozpay is, has gained tremendous traction in Indonesia.'<br/>On the subject of Indonesia, with it being the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasting a growing confluence of big tech players and equity funds, Suen posits that it holds tremendous potential for investors.<br/>'What I've found in the past two years of being back [in the U.S.], when I talk to potential investors \u2026 about Indonesia, most of the response, very naturally is, 'that's an entire world away',' he said.<br/>'There are currently over 15 tech companies based in Indonesia that have what are called unicorn valuations,' he said. 'So, anything valued at a billion dollars or more would imply that it's a Unicorn valuation. Several are actually higher than ten billion and this is notable because every major global tech giant has investments in these 15.'<br/>'Not only are the big strategic tech companies making investments in these 15, we are also seeing the world's leading private equity funds investing as well,' he added. 'What you have is a landscape that's a who's who of global tech companies, a who's who of private equity funds and venture capital funds, and what we're going to see very soon is an impending wave of IPOs here in the US.'<br/>Suen said that the company's activities in Indonesia, coupled with its other developments, position it favorably for strategic investments or possibly acquisition.<br/>'It puts us on the path for potential strategic investment in or an acquisition of, our Indonesian subsidiary by one of these larger companies,' he said. 'What we believe will happen, is someone like Grab - which is currently a $16 billion valued company operating in Southeast Asia in its entirety - we believe that they will be a strategic investor in Weyland Indonesia Perkasa, or potentially acquire us.'<br/>The Investorideas.com podcasts are also available on iTunes, Spotify, Tunein, Stitcher, Spreaker.com, iHeartRadio and Google Play Music.<br/>Visit the Podcast page at Investorideas.com:<br/>https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/<br/>About Investorideas.com - News that Inspires Big Investing Ideas<br/>https://www.investorideas.com/About/<br/>Important Cautions Regarding Forward Looking Statements<br/>This release contains certain 'forward-looking statements' relating to the business of the Company.<br/>Disclaimer/Disclosure: Original content created by investorideas is protected by copyright laws other than syndication rights.

With Open Banking gaining pace, what does this mean for the security and the future development of payment systems for enterprises?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this concluding part of this series on the development of FinTech, we are asking what the future looks like? What trends are apparent and, how can businesses take advantage of this expanding sector?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The demand for more mobile, on-demand services from consumers is a clear trend and critical driver behind the development of FinTech as a whole. Indeed, Dilip Krishna, chief technology officer and a managing director with the Regulatory and Operational Risk practice at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/innovation/topics/FinTech.html\">Deloitte and Touche LLP</url> says: \"A large number of our clients are taking aggressive action to determine how they can use these technologies within their ecosystems. They're acting as venture capitalists and investing in their internal projects to see what specific problems these technologies can solve.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As financial services increasingly move away from traditional resources, FinTech will also become disruptive and, change how the B2B and B2C spaces approach payments in particular. Challenger banks which began with Metro Bank have been joined by a slew of others and additional service providers.</p><p>Speaking to Silicon UK, Todd McDonald, co-founder at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.r3.com/\">R3</url> said: \"The big trend we see is FinTech being embedded in more and more business processes. This goes hand in hand with the increased pace of digital transformation across all businesses. The advent of blockchain fits perfectly within these trends. As businesses digitally-enable their relationships, they need a way to stay in sync with more counterparties yet, do so in a way where those connections are private and secure. The right blockchain solution can solve for that, while also unlocking the potential to complete even complex transactions with little to no reconciliation or human intervention.\"</p><p>Coupling the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/projects/cio/the-promise-of-the-blockchain-324603\">blockchain</url> with FinTech services is a clear trend as together, these technologies continue to move financial services and transactions away from their traditional centralized base. The distributed ledger can also offer strong security which will be needed as payments, in particular, also move to new novel suppliers.</p><h>Trends to watch</h><p>FinTech has the potential to bring massive disruptive change to markets and processes that have changed little over decades. As Jacqueline Morcombe, area vice-president of international sales enablement at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncino.com/\">nCino</url>, explains, more automation also needs to be added to the mix of services and processes FinTech will bring to businesses:</p><p>\"Businesses and financial institutions will increasingly be looking for digital engagements and automated services wherever possible,\" she explained. \"We already see increased connectivity between businesses and financial institutions with a reduction in routine requests that can now be operationalized. For example, balance queries, statements and payments. The focus has been shifting towards value-add engagements that FinTech can facilitate for businesses, and portfolio and decision-making insights for financial institutions.\"</p><p>Adam Bialy, chief product officer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.openpayd.com/\">OpenPayd</url> also explained to Silicon UK: \"COVID-19 will inevitably force rapid acceleration of digital transformation across the financial services industry. Right now, the spotlight is on the banks' ability to adapt and survive without people visiting branches and without reliance upon manual processes. Those that didn't truly commit to a digital transformation strategy yesterday are set to pay the price today.</p><p>\"Before the pandemic, Open Banking was seen as the catalyst that would finally trigger real transformation among the traditional financial services sector. However, back in August 2019, research revealed that while 15% of traditional banks have built an API, not one is fully meeting PSD2 requirements. Open Banking has been less of a catalyst and more of a \"gentle nudge\", with consumer-facing applications being limited to account aggregation services.</p><p>Bialy concluded: \"While <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/ecommerce/open-banking-uk-227081\">Open Banking</url> has been less than success from a B2C perspective, there is an enormous opportunity in B2B around SME and corporate banking. By allowing third-party FinTechs access to business accounts, payment providers, lenders and equity managers, they will be able to better serve businesses desperate - especially under COVID-19 - to improve operational efficiencies, cut costs and better serve their customers.\"</p><h>The new normal</h><p>In a post-COVID-19 environment, banking and payment services platforms will continue to develop and evolve. Consumers and then businesses will increasingly demand change to reflect the new world everyone will then be working within.</p><p>Says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-81/Accenture-Payments-in-the-Digital-Age.pdf\">Accenture</url> in their report: \"Innovative payment methods introduced by non-banking players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon (GAFA) and Alibaba have further raised the bar by changing the way consumers \"experience\" payments. These players also have an inherent advantage-they're closer to the customer by way of the other services they offer. This has enabled them to keep an ear to the ground and develop the much-needed agility to stay on top of the game. Now, they are increasingly being seen as natural partners for FinTechs, quickly gaining a financial niche as well.\"</p><p>With Deloitte advising: \"Executives should be looking at FinTech trends and thinking in terms of experiments and pilot programs, giving incentives to customers to try out new offerings with the understanding that it's for a specified time or with limited features. Blockchain is a good example of how financial services organizations can create targeted applications and products to test out new approaches in a controlled environment.\"</p><p>Businesses looking past the current crisis to a time when trade returns to whatever the new normal looks like, will need to consider how the continuing development and expansion of FinTech will impact their enterprises.</p><p>FinTech is revolutionizing how financial services are delivered. And with more change on the near horizon thanks to advantages the distributed ledger will bring, paying close attention - and being ready to act - must be on every business's strategic roadmap.</p><h>Silicon in Focus</h><p>Alex Reddish, chief commercial officer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tribepayments.com/\">Tribe Payments</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the key trends across FinTech all businesses should pay attention to?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Right now, the most significant trend in FinTech is also the most prominent concern: COVID-19. With the current crisis, there are constraints around the amount of available capital. Investors are going to be cautious when looking at opportunities.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Challenger banks and FinTechs must prove their value in more than just customer acquisition. This will be challenging as FinTech companies have fewer funds to develop new products and more pressure to succeed. And many FinTechs that have used VC funds to drive customer acquisition can no longer do so.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This will lead FinTechs to focus inwardly on base economics to increase margins as volumes fall. By exploring ways to improve operational efficiencies, at a time of diminishing returns, FinTechs will be able to weather the storm, and critically come out of the crisis leaner, stronger and more resilient to headwinds.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And while funds will be limited for product development, there will be a lot to learn from customers who are using services in new and unexpected ways. Even more so than ever, FinTechs should pay attention to their customers to fuel the next wave of innovation.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How transformative will FinTech be across the financial services sector in particular?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FinTech is already transformative. For years, traditional financial services providers under invested in technology because they were unchallenged. Off the back of the 2008 financial crisis, the rise of FinTech has both created competition but also accelerated and supported digital transformation among incumbents. I'd argue that the sector is stronger and healthier as a result of the FinTech \"challenge\".</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FinTechs such as eToro and Kroo are transforming their respective markets. These companies have solved many issues consumers had with trading or retail banking.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More long term, FinTech was the catalyst for far-reaching industry changes like Open Banking, which was designed to drive competition and improve innovation, putting FinTechs on a level playing field with big players that have big pockets.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Starling Bank is a prime example of how this is transforming the sector. Starling has pioneered the idea of \"marketplaces\" where a range of best breed services from retail loyalty to pensions are available to customers to browse at their leisure. This innovation fuels competition and has made longstanding banks adapt to new ideas. For example, we've seen Natwest mirror Starling Bank in launching a companion card which vulnerable customers can give to trusted people to pay for their groceries and essential items.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moving forwards, as we transition from Open Banking to Open Finance, which addresses the broader universe of financial services - not just banking - FinTech will continue to be transformative. And my view is that sub-sectors like mortgages and pensions, which still rely heavily on paper-based processes, are set for the even greater disruption that we've seen to date.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How will CIOs and CTOs have to change to ensure their businesses and organizations make the most of FinTech in the future?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many CIOs and CTOs of financial institutions and companies, in general, will need to ?bite the bullet' when it comes to utilizing FinTech for their organizations. Older, archaic systems currently in place are not fit for purpose and are failing the businesses and customers they serve. This was a particularly acute problem last year, with The House of Commons Treasury Select Committee publishing a report slamming banks and cloud providers for their failures and calling for increased oversight and regulation.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial institutions need to re-think and re-orient their system architecture to allow them to partner with FinTechs to deliver new and exciting services more efficiently. But this isn't just about product innovation and new customer-facing products; it's also about the back and middle office. By deploying FinTech into the core, institutions under price pressure can improve operational efficiencies and improve the return on equity they so desperately crave.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How will compliance and regulation impact on the development of FinTech in general?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The FinTech industry largely exists because of regulations. The proactive stance from the UK government and its regulatory sandbox is one of the many reasons that it leads the world. PSD2 is the most important regulation for the FinTech industry to-date. It has been implemented to encourage data-sharing between banks and FinTechs - banks share the data, and FinTechs used it to craft new services.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unfortunately, right now, it isn't working quite as planned. The reason is that most bank APIs aren't up to spec and the costs of integrating with APIs for most third parties is too high, creating a barrier to entry especially for the start-ups the regulation was designed to help.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Open Banking has a sound rationale behind it; it is just a little broken. To fix it, there needs to be better cooperation between banks and FinTechs to reduce barriers to entry and to make sure banks are also able to make use of the innovations that appear as a result of it.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With new money laundering regulations and Open Finance around the corner, the impact on the FinTech sector moving forwards will largely depend on lawmakers. They need to strike a balance between security and innovation, between pragmatism and vision, and between the new players and the old.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is FinTech a disruptive technology or one that will evolve over time to make its full impact felt?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FinTech is a disruptive technology that is already driving change in the financial services industry.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just take digital wallet technology as an example. This is a significant innovation that allows any company from retailers to utility providers and even gaming companies to build an integrated digital wallet complete with account number and sort-code that give customers a way of storing and using their money. This would allow an energy company to provide a digital wallet and companion contactless card to a customer who can use their account balance to pay for goods and services.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">As a result, the energy company gets the customer data which they can use to craft new services, and the customer will get incentives from the company to keep their money within the system. This helps with customer engagement and allows the company to communicate with customers in a more informed and targeted way.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">While FinTech is changing the market, genuine disruption might be an overstatement. The fundamental market economics and systems remain the same. But with the rise of big tech, the evolution of Open Banking to Open Finance, and the growth of decentralized networks like Libra - all placed in the pressure cooker that is Covid-19, substantial disruption is just around the corner.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do you expect businesses to use FinTech services in the future?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To date FinTech services have been deployed at the front-end to provide a better user experience. In the future, I expect FinTech services to drive operational innovation and systemic, long term change in how businesses manage their finances.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One challenge in using FinTech services is fragmentation-the majority of FinTechs focus on solving a particular problem. Rather than going to a single provider to supply technology across the business, firms need to speak with a myriad different FinTechs and stitch together a holistic solution. This will give rise to companies that bring together best of breed FinTechs and provide a single point of integration to ease the procurement and implementation headache.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And finally, I expect businesses to use FinTech as the benchmark for innovation. $137.5 billion was pumped into FinTech in 2019, more than any other technology vertical. FinTech is leading the world when it comes to applications of AI, quantum computing and decentralized networks.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FinTech is setting the innovation barometer that all other businesses will measure their success against.</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://unsplash.com/@claybanks?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge\">Clay Banks</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLCNUK-342551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLCNUK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YV6-GPW1-F19T-R0GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462789</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2341\"/><timeReceived>11:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MEDIA365 All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>silicon.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64647\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>6 May 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

This year the greatest challenges are expected to be the need to keep up with technology advancements; perceived budgetary limitations, lack of investment and cost, and then data security.Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence has undertaken its fourth global survey to assess the impact of developments in regtech and fintech on the role, remit, and expectations of the compliance function in the financial services sector. The research represents compliance and risk practitioners around the world from almost 400 financial services firms.This section looks at the key challenges over the next 12 months identified by practitioners, such as the need for cyber resilience, and reflects on the areas firms that need to be addressed in order to realise the potential benefits offered by fintech, regtech and insurtech.INDUSTRY OPINION Technology-enabled solutions have driven a wave of start-ups pushing the bounds of innovation and using the new capabilities offered by concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Financial services firms themselves are also developing solutions in-house often in ring-fenced 'labs' where innovations are tested before beginning to be deployed.In this section a range of views from the industry have been collated to illustrate the multi-faceted approaches taken and varying attitude towards new forms of technology.\"As regulation and data outpace compliance, regtech brings welcome structure and precision for focusing and prioritising critical resources. </p><p>Regtech finds the 'needle in the haystack', providing insight how it got there so compliance can prevent it getting lost again.\"Stacey English, chief digital officer, Corlytics\"As outsourced compliance principals, we use our clients' technology. We always try to conform to the culture and systems that our clients use. For smaller firms in particular, I don't think adequate and affordable technologies exist to monitor risk. Although I believe that our clients do a good job monitoring their risk, the majority of it is incredibly time-consuming for their internal staff and for us as outsourced regulatory compliance principals. I find that the technology either isn't cost-effective for the smaller firms, or in many cases does not meet the demands of the client in a holistic way.\" Deirdre Patten, compliance principal and founder, Patten Training &amp;#38; Review, Texas, United States\"I worked for 10 years as a compliance officer, and although management would pay for sufficient technology to monitor money laundering and other types of financial crime risk, it was not as useful as it could have been, partly because we were understaffed. Also, we needed more training on how to use the technology better, particularly how to get the most from the tools and link them to those used by other departments.\"Former AML compliance officer for a large, global bank, NY office\"Technological advances have great promise for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of compliance functions at global financial institutions. Transactions can be reviewed and filtered by use of artificial intelligence and other technology methods that can assist in the fight against financial crimes, ensuring compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering laws, and OFAC sanctions requirements. Financial institutions should consider these advancements, paying particular attention to the reliability of the technologies and methods used, as with any vendor management program.\"Maria Vullo, former superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services and now CEO of Vullo Advisory Services, PLLC\"We use regtech for front-end KYC and customer due diligence screening, mainly. We should be using it for cybersecurity purposes more, but there is still a 'it might not happen to us' mentality here. Regtech has made compliance work easier and more effective, but it can be easy to depend too much on it - I think we're not being skeptical enough, sometimes. And it's used best when people know their roles well - who oversees the technology, who tests it, who updates it.\" Senior BSA/AML compliance officer at a large, global bank (NY office) \"Regtech is, like any tool, a great support mechanism for the compliance function. But like any tool, it is only as good as the system into which you input it. A system will not by itself solve issues, but it will do a couple of things: it will add welcome automation and objectivity to a process. Computational analysis helps us understand our own data and processes better and allows us to look critically at any process. It is not, however, a means to let the machine take over a function completely. Controls keep all systems in check by providing oversight, and model governance was meant to create the balance in the operational systems by providing quantifiable evidence that a system is working effectively. Also, the staff that are in charge of managing such systems must be equipped for success with adequate training, controls and permissions to manage the systems. Without the oversight and controls, there is not much to stop exploitation, abuse or even cyber influence. Making the program work with the systems is the key to success in balancing technology and operations.\" Debra Geister, CEO at Section 2 Financial Intelligence, Minnesota, United StatesThe last three years show a relatively steady view on fintech (including insurtech) innovation and digital disruption with 83% expressing either a mostly or extremely positive view. What is clear is that the neutrality of view on fintech from 2016 is no longer the case, with 56% of respondents reporting a neutral view of fintech in 2016 compared with 15% in 2019.As with the view on fintech, there has been a relatively steady and overall positive view of regtech innovation and digital disruption. A total of 77% (20% extremely positive, 57% mostly positive) expressed a positive view of regtech and, again, the neutrality reported in 2016 (57%) has reduced by almost two thirds to 20% in 2019. 'Innovation in financial services has the capacity to bring many benefits for consumers, the economy and society in general. It is essential to the effective functioning of a competitive economy. However, here is where a challenge lies for financial regulators. Innovation is good, but not all innovations are good, and not all good innovations are done well.'Ed Sibley, deputy governor at the Central Bank of Ireland, November 2019 CHALLENGES FOR FIRMS \"the increasing growth of big tech could have a more profound impact on the industrial organisation of financial services. The financial hierarchy could be reversed, with banks relegated from being in the centre of the financial system to a subordinated player to payment services provided by big tech companies.\"Pablo Hernndez de Cos, chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of the Bank of Spain, November 2019 Technological challenges for firms come in all shapes and sizes. There is the potential, marketplace changing, challenge posed by the rise of bigtech. There is also the evolving approach of regulators and the need to invest in specialist skill sets. Lastly, there is the emerging need to keep up with technological advances themselves.Source: Pablo Hernndez de Cos, chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of the Bank of Spain, November 2019. The challenges for firms have moved on. In the first three years of the report the biggest financial technology challenge facing firms was that of the need to upgrade legacy systems and processes. This year the top three challenges are expected to be the need to keep up with technology advancements; perceived budgetary limitations, lack of investment and cost, and then data security.The greatest financial technology challenges you expect your firm to face in the next 12 months areThe need to upgrade legacy systems and processes has not gone away even if it is now seen to be less of a challenge. More than half of firms (59%) reported they were either very or mostly confident that their IT infrastructure was or would be able to support fintech, regtech and insurtech solutions, up from 42% in the prior year. A third (33%) reported they were far from confident and that more investment was needed, though progress has been made.Firms choose to face the challenges of financial technology to reap the expected benefits which have themselves moved on. In the prior year, the greatest benefits expected to be seen from financial technology were greater efficiency and accuracy, improvements in compliance monitoring and reporting and better product delivery and customer experience. This year the top three benefits are seen as being strengthened operational efficiency, improved services for customers and greater businesses opportunities. The greatest benefits you expect your firm to see from financial technology in the next 12 months areCYBER RISK Cyber risk and the need to be cyber-resilient is a major challenge for financial services firms which are targets for hackers. They must be prepared and be able to respond to any kind of cyber incident. Good customer outcomes will be under threat if cyber resilience fails. One of the most prevalent forms of cyber attack is ransomware.There are different types of ransomware, all of which will seek to prevent a firm or an individual from using their IT systems and will ask for something (usually payment of a ransom) to be done before access will be restored. Even then, there is no guarantee that paying the fine or acceding to the ransomware attacker's demands will restore full access to all IT systems, data or files.Many firms have found that critical files often containing client data have been encrypted as part of an attack and large amounts of money are demanded for restoration. Encryption is in this instance used as a weapon and it can be practically impossible to reverse-engineer the encryption or \"crack\" the files without the original encryption key - which cyber attackers deliberately withhold.What was previously viewed often as an IT problem has become a significant issue for risk and compliance functions. The regulatory stance is typified by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which has said its goal is to \"help firms become more resilient to cyber attacks, while ensuring that consumers are protected and market integrity is upheld\". Regulators do not expect firms to be impervious but do expect cyber risk management to become a core competency.Good and better practice on defending against ransomware attacksRisk and compliance officers do not need to become technological experts overnight but must ensure cyber risks are effectively managed and reported on within their firm's corporate governance framework. For some compliance officers, cyber risk may be well outside their comfort zone but there is evidence that simple steps implemented rigorously can go a long way towards protecting a firm and its customers.Any basic cyber-security hygiene aimed at protecting businesses from ransomware attacks should make full use of the wide range of resources available on cyber resilience, IT security and protecting against malware attacks. The UK National Cyber Security Centre has produced some practical guidance on how organizations can protect themselves in cyberspace, which it updates regularly. Indeed, the NCSC's 10 steps to cyber security have now been adopted by most of the FTSE350. Source: 10 Steps to Cyber Security Infographic, National Cyber Security Centre, November 2018.Good advice on the general prevention of a ransomware attack is to seek to ensure company-confidential, sensitive client or other important files are securely and regularly backed up in a remote, un-connected back-up or storage facility. As with other aspects of compliance, the basics done consistently well will go a long way toward providing firms and their clients with a reasonable level of cyber resilience. A firm that has been a victim of a ransomware attack should use all possible means to regain access to IT systems and client files as swiftly and cleanly as possible. This may mean paying any ransom demanded as a matter of urgency. The follow-up action is then to learn all possible lessons to prevent a recurrence of the attack.Some specific good and better practice recommendations on preventing ransomware attacks include: Checking the firm has basic protection against malware and it is up to date - malware being an umbrella term to cover any code or content that could have a malicious, undesirable impact on systems. Ensuring all devices have the latest security \"patches\". Removing all unnecessary user accounts (such as guest and administrator accounts) and restricting user privileges to only what is required. Removing or disabling any unnecessary software to reduce the number of potential routes of entry available to ransomware attackers. Segmenting the network so that if an attack does take place the damage suffered is limited Ensuring the firm has an offline and offsite back-up of all critical systems (with the aim of protecting any back-up from also being encrypted as part of an attack) Training staff to recognize a ransomware attack if it does manage to get past any anti-malware protection in place.Some specific good and better practice recommendations for preparing to recover from a ransomware attack include: Ensuring the firm has an effective back-up policy and process in place and that it has been regularly tested as working. An essential element of any effectiveness testing is to consider how the firm can seek to ensure that any back-up will not also be maliciously encrypted in the event of a successful ransomware attack. Including cyber-attack scenarios in all business and disaster recovery plans and, again, testing regularly to ensure they work as planned. Once any ransomware has been removed, ensure a full security scan and penetration test of all systems and network is carried out. If attackers were able to get ransomware onto the firm's systems, they may have gained other access that has not yet been detected.Cyber security has become a significant regulatory risk and firms must ensure they manage and, whenever feasible, mitigate cyber risks, including ransomware. The compliance function must ensure that cyber risks are expressly included in the range of risks considered, and that the board is prepared to discuss the actions taken to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken to embed cyber resilience throughout the firm.CLOSING THOUGHTS \"The pace of change, together with the borderless nature of technology, requires an appropriate level of caution to be taken, through financial services firms taking risk-based approaches to strategic and business initiatives. Financial services firms need to make informed choices about where and how they are going to adapt and make sure that the associated risks are understood, considered, and measured as they make changes to their processes and business models.\"Ed Sibley, deputy governor at the Central Bank of Ireland, November 2019 The financial services industry has much to gain from the effective implementation of fintech, regtech and insurtech but practical reality is there are numerous challenges to overcome before the potential benefits can be realised. Investment continues to be needed in skill sets, systems upgrades and cyber resilience before firms can deliver technological innovation without endangering good customer outcomes. An added complication is the business need to innovate while looking over one shoulder at the threat posed by bigtech.There are also concerns for solution providers. The last year has seen many technology start-ups going bust and far fewer new start-ups getting off the ground - an apparent parallel, at least on the surface, to the bubble that was around dotcom. Solutions need to be practical, providers need to be careful not to over promise and under deliver and above all developments should be aimed at genuine problems and not be solutions looking for a problem.There are nevertheless potentially substantive benefits to be gained from implementing fintech, regtech and insurtech solutions. For risk and compliance functions much of the benefit may come from the ability to automate rote processes with increasing accuracy and speed. Indeed, when 900 respondents to the 10th annual cost of compliance survey report were asked to look into their crystal balls and predict the biggest change for compliance in the next 10 years, the largest response was automation.Technology and its failure or misuse is increasingly being linked to the personal liability and accountability of senior managers. Chief executives, board members and other senior individuals will be held accountable for failures in technology and should therefore ensure their skill set is up-to-date. Regulators and politicians alike have shown themselves to be increasingly intolerant of senior managers who fail to take the expected reasonable steps with regards to any lack of resilience in their firm's technology.This year's findings suggest firms may find it beneficial to consider: Is fintech (and regtech) properly considered as part of the firm's strategy? It is important for regtech especially not to be forgotten about in strategic terms: a systemic failure arising from a regtech solution has great capacity to cause problems for the firm - the UK FCA's actions on regulatory reporting, among other things, are an indicator of this. Not all firms seem to have fully tackled the governance challenge fintech implies: greater specialist skills may be needed at board level and in risk and compliance functions. Lack of in-house skills was given as a main reason for failing to develop fintech or regtech solutions. It is heartening that firms understand the need for those skills. As fintech/regtech becomes mainstream, however, firms may be pressed into developing such solutions. Is there a plan in place to plug the skills gap? Only 22% of firms reported that they need more resources to evaluate, understand and deploy fintech/regtech solutions. This suggests 88% of firms are unduly relaxed about the resources needed in the second line of defence to ensure fintech/regtech solutions are properly monitored. This may be a correct conclusion, but seems potentially bullish.To read the full report click here[1].

Its conclusion is relatively reassuring for groups such as Santander, BBVA, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Lloyds or Commerzbank: \"European banks face many challenges, but a frontal attack by firms like Amazon or Google is not among them,\" the note reads sent to investors by the Wall Street firm.<br/>According to the document, digital giants are going to have a more relevant role as suppliers or allies of banks, than as rivals. For example, Facebook, Google and Apple plan to collaborate with traditional entities on their respective means of payment.<br/>Amazon is already a key provider for many banks by storing their data in the cloud (through large centralized servers). But this should not calm industry executives. Bank of America sees an increased risk of business erosion by small new entrants (financial technology or fintech firms), which are supported by investment funds and attack market niches where banks are most profitable, such as transfers, currency exchange and cards.<br/>The risk<br/>\"Traditional banks will continue to see their businesses threatened by new entrants that are capable of providing modern technology. TransferWise is a good example of this. It has continued to increase its revenue, being solidly profitable, by offering low-cost currency transfer services for retail and SME customers. At the same time, the various digital banks (Monzo, N26, Starling, OakNorth, Klarna, Revolut and others) continue to grow their businesses, entering segments that were the headquarters. These companies agree to be regulated as financial services, have modern technology and do not address the data usage issues that some major technology companies have.\"<br/>This warning contradicts some comments from banking executives and managers, who talk about Facebook, Apple, Amazon, or Google as groups that may keep much of the financial pie in the future.<br/>Regulatory brake<br/>The Bank of America team admits that \"the argument that great tech makers can go after banks is powerful. They have powerful brands, a lot of liquidity, they don't have a legacy of outdated technology, and they have a lot of information and consumer data.\"<br/>But the analysis points to two reasons that can deter these groups from becoming banks.<br/>The first is the tough regulatory scrutiny they will have to face to provide financial services. \"The sector is heavily regulated. Although regulators have sympathy for innovation, they tend to be more motivated by financial stability and competition.\"<br/>For example, starting to capture deposits would force tech giants to park large amounts of capital. \"Becoming a bank would bring about a dramatic change in the balance sheets of technology companies,\" says the US entity.<br/>The second reason is that in Europe, unlike emerging markets in Asia and Africa, where Internet firms have become fully involved in the financial world, there are no large segments of the population without access to banks, nor is there a perceived lack of products or servi you. \"There are no millions of people in Europewithout access to financial services. In emerging markets, yes, which has allowed technology companies like Ant Financial and M-Pesa to build large (and socially useful) businesses. We think that the same strategy in Europe would fall into arid territory, because there is an enormity of different bank accounts.\"<br/>Where to invest<br/>In any case, Bank of America believes that traditional banks must make a strong investment to modernize their systems, a process that has execution risks as happened with TSB, Sabadell's British subsidiary. The refore, the firm's analysts advise investing in banks such as ING and Bank of Ireland, which already operate from new platforms. It also recommends London Stock Exchange (LSE), operator of the London Stock Exchange, which has been launched into market data management with the purchase of Refinitiv (owner of Reuters terminals).<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10067015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV6-VK91-JBJN-M4Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002CBQ</classCode><className>COMMERZBANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Al and James Norrin orrington report If 'fintech' refers to the use of technology in financial services, then there is nothing new about it. So what is? Implicitly, fintech stands for something else: the disruption of financial services business models through digital technology. And if there's one truism of the past two decades, it is that digital disruption - to paraphrase the world's digital disruptor par excellence - moves fast and breaks things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The financial services industry, a decade after it almost broke the global economy, appears ripe for disruption. It trades in information, rather than concrete goods. Hyper-regulated, diffuse and yet slow to react, today's banks, insurers and asset managers are the structural antithesis of the innovative tech start-up, working to streamline or rethink a niche area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's little surprise then that the competitive outlook for financial services is often framed as the inexorable rise of fintech, and the inevitable demise of the incumbents. When Mark Zuckerberg announces plans to replace the global payments system and shape financial regulation to Facebook's will, it's clear which side of the fintech duality is in the ascendency.</p><p>With hindsight, this may turn out to be an extreme case of hubris. And in any case, as with most investment matters, it pays to take a more nuanced view. So what might be wrong with this 'inevitability' take? First, a zero-sum view of the sector assumes all incumbents are standing still, unable to compete or collaborate. Second, at a certain point, fintech must swallow the inevitable by-product of becoming systemically important: regulation. There are growing signs that financial regulation can foster innovation and technological change that supports consumers. Functioning regulatory regimes appreciate the need to move fast, and support the post-crisis push towards a new openmarket policy. They are less keen on business models with an ambivalence towards breaking things.</p><p>Thrive, survive, or die? To analysts at Polar Capital, high regulatory barriers to entry are just one of several ways financial services companies can defend themselves from fintechs and technology groups. \"The claim that banking is facing its 'Kodak moment' ignores the response by the incumbents and the considerable advantages that come from cheaper funding, large customer bases\u2026 and control of the back end of finance,\" the investment firm wrote earlier this year.</p><p>Indeed, recent predictions of dour fortunes for the banking industry are yet to materialise. In 2014, consultancy Accenture estimated that fintech businesses would put 35 per cent of traditional banking revenues at risk by 2020. A quick survey of the UK's five largest banks - Lloyds (LLOY), HSBC (HSBA), Barclays (BARC), RBS (RBS) and Standard Chartered (STAN) - shows that revenues are this year forecast to surpass the 2014 combined total. And while it could be argued that Accenture's forecast was less a hard prediction than a vague pontification, one would nonetheless expect this apparently massive threat to show up in the top line.</p><p>This doesn't mean the pressures on fee income are non-existent. One example is the world of remittances, which has been upended by the UK-based Transferwise, which can process cross-border payments for around a tenth of the cost of traditional banks. The $3.5bn group, in which listed venture capital company Draper Esprit (GROW) is an investor, matches users' international transfers to pay out through local bank accounts, thereby avoiding currency conversion and the fees attached to the cross-border use of the unreliable SWIFT system.</p><p>Transferwise's payments model is a neat, if simple, example of a technology with the power to disrupt incumbent banks' revenues. It also feels symbolic of the idea that fintech innovation will steadily reveal the flaws in a bloated, inefficient and rent-seeking banking sector. Again, investors in incumbent stocks should consider the wider context. Polar Capital analyst George Barrow describes Transferwise as an instance of a \"front-end innovation\" built on traditional payments processes, rather than a paradigm shift.</p><p>Neo-banks: the brand challenge Arguably, the same could be said of the digitalonly 'neo-banks' such as Monzo, Revolut, N26 and Starling, which have proved an undeniable hit with customers. To a smartphone-savvy customer base, the ability to handle all their banking services in one place is a clear plus, if not an expectation.</p><p>Their products are certainly popular. Businessfocused Starling Bank expects to hit 1m customers by the end of the year. Berlin-headquartered N26 already has double that number. UK-based Monzo, which is expanding into the US, expects 250,000 people to apply for one of its bright orange debit cards in June alone.</p><p>In branding terms, this pack looks to be pulling ahead of the high-street incumbents. Monzo is a case in point. What started out as an app-backed prepaid debit card provider in 2015 had morphed into a licensed, deposit-taking bank by 2017. Customers have been drawn to cheap foreign exchange rates and an elegant money-managing app.</p><p>After successfully raising \u00a3113m in June, Monzo was valued at \u00a32bn. But from an investor perspective, there are an absence of what you'd call economic moats. Only a third of its customers use Monzo as their main bank account. Its savings offering is provided by third-parties such as Shawbrook, OakNorth and Investec, all of which offer better interest rates on their own websites. Monzo's customer-centred banking model partly relies on customer apathy.</p><p>With little revenues to speak of, and absolute costs rising, the bank will presumably require further funding rounds to maintain its growth rate. If it is upending the traditional banking model, it is yet to find a replacement for interest earned on loans. To the believers (and the many customers who now own shares in the bank) that might not be an issue. Call it a fintech, but Monzo's business outlook owes more to Mark Zuckerberg and JeffBezos than the high-street banks. Chief executive Tom Blomfield is on record as saying profitability is a secondary concern to the user experience.</p><p>That's all well and good, so long as capital markets stay open. What's more, we would argue that a digital-led banking model holds more weight (and is cheaper) than the branch-led proposition Metro Bank (MTRO) is betting on. But Metro has at least identified how it might reliably generate income, which helps to explain why it could count on investors for May's emergency \u00a3500m equity placing.</p><p>Until they can strike a balance between deposit growth and cash generation, the neobanks will only be able to claim a better user experience. That stance seems certain to invite a backlash from the incumbents.</p><p>Investor exposure Regardless of the dynamics, it's not clear retail investors can get much exposure to most hyped fintech companies, even if they wanted to. The trend among technology companies of all stripes is to stay private for longer, drenched by the firehose of cash sitting outside of public markets. This poses a \"real threat to retail investors\", says Tim Levene of Augmentum Fintech (AUGM), a venture capital fund focused exclusively on private fintech. \"[They] are missing out on a lot of the growth in top companies. Our pitch often to these investors is that we are one of the only routes in the public markets to get exposure.\"</p><p>Given fintech sometimes appears to want to reduce global finance to smartphone-based convenience - 'there's an app for that' - it's perhaps only appropriate that there's an exchange traded fund (ETF) for the sector, too. UK-based investors can trade Invesco's KBW NASDAQFintech UCITS (FTEK), which has managed to beat its benchmark since its inception in 2017. But if these are the industry's tech disruptors, then many appear to already be tightly woven into the architecture of US finance. Core holdings include major exchanges CBOE (US:CBOE) and CME Group (US:CME), payments giants Mastercard (US:MA) and PayPal (US:PYPL) and even ratings agencies Moody's (US:MCO) and S&amp;P (US:SPGI).</p><p>There is a logic to backing this type of blue-chip 'fintech'. They possess the firepower to acquire upstarts, and tend to be more technology-led than the financial services companies to which they are closely linked. What's more, the high-growth disruption model doesn't always make for a viable investment. UK-based peer-to-peer lending marketplace Funding Circle (FCH) seems to have little trouble growing its top line and loan origination, but is burning through cash and recently reported a rise in expected loan defaults. Its shares have more than halved since the group listed last September.</p><p>Another way for investors to get exposure to fintech, somewhat counter-intuitively, is through the incumbent banks themselves. To Marten Nelson, co-founder &amp; chief marketing officer of open banking platform provider Token.io, this is a risky move. \"Over the past couple of years I've been telling banks they must stop worrying about the competition from peer banks,\" he says. \"The real threat is from the large tech companies.\"</p><p>Yet it is clear that for all their clunky operations and outmoded IT systems, big banks are heavily investing in technology and innovation. According to Polar Capital, the banks outspend technology companies on fintech research and development (R&amp;D). As the chart shows, this has been a deliberate business strategy for some time; digitally-engaged clients, DBS Bank has suggested, also tend to be more profitable. And so long as banks' profits are constrained by low interest rates, regulation and economic malaise, the cost-to-income ratio will be one of the most closely followed performance metrics.</p><p>Alongside this approach has been a gradual acceptance of collaboration (as well as competition) with players in the fintech sector. \"Three to four years ago, they were regarded as slightly suspicious by the banks,\" says Mr Levene. \"Several billion pounds of R&amp;D spend later, they've realised they are struggling to do it themselves; there's less suspicion, and more proof points in the market.\"</p><p>It is this industry shift that means RBS can now proudly declare itself to be \"a partner of choice for fintech and big tech\". Of course, it's always smart to keep friends close, and enemies (or the largest competition) closer. But it is also a sign that leaders within major lenders are alive to the need to let technology lead customer engagement. \"It's our strategy to disrupt ourselves before we get disrupted by someone else,\" an insider at one 'Big Four' UK high-street bank told us.</p><p>From an investor perspective, picking the winners in this struggle can feel like a blind exercise of valuing intangibles such as intellectual property and branding. Both fintechs and banks will also claim the upper hand in the hunt for engineering and programming talent.</p><p>But within this hyper-competitive arena, investors shouldn't rule out the incumbents' ability to level the playing field, armed with a better appreciation for the regulatory environment.</p><p>Take RBS: with CurrencyPay and mettle, it is launching app-based answers to Transferwise and Starling Bank. In APtimise, it can boast the UK's only end-to-end accounts payable solution. It hopes that Esme, its small-business loans offering, will one day be fully automated. There are many reasons why banks are an unattractive place for investor capital, but shareholders holding the big names for income shouldn't fear a tech-based rout - at least not yet. AN Financial services won't be the same, but winners and losers aren't clear cut In the medium to long term, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technologies, facilitate an existential challenge because, to echo Mr Nelson, they bring the Big Tech companies into play as competitors. Silicon Valley giants won't shape the next-generation financial system entirely, especially after regulators and central banks have taken a bite out of their lofty ambitions, but expect them to have a prominent role.</p><p>In the meantime, the staggering pace of advance in AI (see box), blockchain and mobile connectivity is overhauling the way businesses and the financial system operates. Just as SWIFT is being exposed as archaic in currency transfers, long-established systems such as CREST and Euroclear (which handle clearing and settlement of securities) are prime for disruption. Mr Barrow agrees: \"Custody and settlement is clearly an area where blockchain would be really suitable. It has low error rates, is immutable, and drives down costs.\" Back-office efficiencies will lead to brokers, registrars and custodians making savings, although it's easy to be cynical about these being passed on to retail investors.</p><p>Looking beyond the banks, fintech has facilitated new entrants presenting themselves as better value alternatives in the marketplace for financial services. For example, in the retail broker/fund platform industry, along with investment product innovations (notably the explosion of cheap ETFs), user-friendly interfaces and portfolio management solutions have been the bedrock of so-called robo-advisers' offering.</p><p>Despite this, the chief worry for incumbent platforms isn't always losing customers to newcomers (many robo-advisers have struggled to attract clients). A bigger threat is the view regulators take of legacy business practices that account for a large slice of revenue, such as Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.) and AJ Bell (AJB) charging high administrative fees on managed open-ended funds.</p><p>The issue for shareholders is not that platforms will be usurped by tech start-ups; it's if the business of distributing funds and offering ready-made portfolios becomes less lucrative due to a root and branch shakeup of fees. Yet, while there are clear implications for the share prices of expensively valued platform companies, the flipside is that levies on robo-advisers' automated solutions might not escape scrutiny, calling the disruptors' economic viability into question.</p><p>New ways to raise finance, boost efficiencies and manage working capital Fintech companies that provide solutions to the wider economy have the best chance of being scalable. One of Augmentum Fintech's holdings, Previse, is making use of AI to help improve working capital cycles for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Analysing the enterprise resource planning (ERP) data of larger companies, the AI predicts which invoices are unlikely to get paid, so the rest can be cleared instantly. Given that SMEs generate around two-thirds of global growth and jobs (Source: World Economic Forum, 2015), systemic change that improves their cash flow is an economic game changer.</p><p>The 1 per cent fee suppliers pay for instant payments is shared between Previse, the end buyer and the funder of credit to the SME. Intuitively, the big question mark is against the incentive for large buyers who use extended payables periods to support their own cash flow. Previse argues that, in the long run, the cost of expensive loans taken out by suppliers to cover liquidity needs feeds into more expensive invoices. Plus, their share of commission paid by the supplier (who is still better offin real terms thanks to instant payment) gives buyers cash back on invoices.</p><p>By shortening working capital cycles, the AI technology de-risks lending for funders - opening a slice of the $2.4 trillion market of unserved finance demand. While it is impossible to predict the impact one small fintech company can have, hypothesising the aggregate effects of all similar businesses is fascinating. In a world where lending becomes less risky, the asset-to-equity and loan-to-deposit thresholds for banks to operate safely would theoretically be higher, reducing a barrier to expanding loan books (although low interest rates would remain an impediment to banks' profitability).</p><p>This one example of a business looking to solve a real problem highlights the effect AI could have for the global economy. Quantifying the uplift is difficult, but PricewaterhouseCoopers' 2019 report estimates AI technologies could contribute $15.7 trillion by 2030. The downside is the fear that AI will remove human jobs, although there are academics who withhold from making that judgment for now.</p><p>Gartner Research analyst and AI expert Moutusi Sau says displacement of jobs is a result of automation more generally and not specifically because of AI, which has the benefit of freeing stafffrom mundane jobs. Expanding on Ms Sau's point, there are very few companies who, for example, still employ people to manually process data, but AI could speed up the process of turning data into information, allowing the end user to focus on insights and putting them to work.</p><p>Harnessing AI to support human decision-makers in financial institutions is the sales pitch of Alpha-Sense, which is also part of Augmentum's portfolio. Its machine-learned algorithms help users conduct a semantic search that, unlike a regular search engine (which indexes billions of pages), pulls information into siloed proprietary databases. From this, they rank sources including transcripts of company results presentations, industry-specific news and policy announcements in order of likely importance. The AI even suggests the inflection points for companies, for example news that is going to have a material impact on meeting earnings forecasts.</p><p>Ironically, this sort of automated tool could help active fund managers fight back against passive investment products. Alpha-Sense chief executive Jack Kokko posits that the technology can help \"elevate analysts to a higher level of performance and empower active investors to have an edge in competing for alpha\".</p><p>Do all roads lead back to Big Tech? Partly by necessity, due to the need to manage the risks of liquidity and small companies failing, bigger companies make up proportionately more of Polar Capital Global Financials Trust (PCFT) and Polar Capital Technology Trust's (PCT) investments. There is also the compelling point that, for all the exciting start-up innovation, large companies that choose the right partners and leverage their scale and existing competitive advantages will do well out of fintech. Mr Barrow says that one of the important ways his team assesses banks is by looking at development budgets: \"[We] like banks that compete on R&amp;D spend; some are spending $3bn a year on R&amp;D firepower.\" The return on this capital invested is difficult to measure as banks' rising compliance costs offset efficiency savings elsewhere, but Mr Barrow highlights ways of estimating the efficacy of tech spending: \"One way is to look at how banks are increasing distribution and cutting physical costs.\"</p><p>On the payments side, Mr Barrow likes Mastercard and PayPal because they have \"good visibility on earnings and low capital intensity\". In such fastmoving industries, however, there is the potential for major players to disrupt one another and it's important to understand sources of competitive advantage. For example, the Adyen (ADYEN) payment company listed on Euronext has a single platform that enables greater transparency and higher approval rates, helping it roll out faster than competitors.</p><p>Big tech companies are an inexorable disruptive force for many other industries and, with the announcement of its intention to launch quasi-cryptocurrency Libra in 2020, Facebook (US:FB.) made clear it wants to be a major player in payments and digital money markets. The famous quote \"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!\" is attributed to Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812), who is often described as the founding father of international <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.finance.No\">www.finance.No</url> doubt conspiracy theorists had their tails tweaked by 21st century plutocrat Mark Zuckerberg's company making so bold a move.</p><p>The possibility of Facebook or any other tech giant such as Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) or Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG) cementing a central role in the world's future monetary system is frightening and intriguing. Companies that already hold vast swathes of data and have immense reach, to promote products and services they could get commission on, would be perfectly placed to take advantage of controlling payments and currency transactions. Such power would help spearhead profit growth and make shares good value even at the current lofty prices.</p><p>Significant barriers remain to this scenario playing out, however. Firstly, governments and central banks are hardly going to stand idle as corporates muscle in on money creation which, as Mayer Rothschild apparently said, is a major lever of power. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has spoken on the need for regulation to the highest standard and the US House of Representatives' financial services committee has requested a moratorium on Libra's development.</p><p>Secondly, there are problems with existing blockchain systems, which as Facebook's own blog states has hindered mainstream adoption. Blockchains work by networks of nodes being verified by known algorithms (see diagram on page 31) but there has been little uniformity as the technology has evolved. This is partly because users have wanted to maintain anonymity - in the most extreme cases for nefarious activities, such as criminal organisations using cryptocurrencies for money laundering.</p><p>Problems Facebook and its Libra partners will face can be summarised as a lack of standardisation, inter-operability, governance and potential integration costs. The company wants to work with the financial sector to resolve some of these issues, however, and the carrot it is dangling suggests big tech companies don't expect or want to make incumbent banks obsolete.</p><p>Speaking with tech website The Verge, Facebook's head of blockchain, David Marcus, said: \"You'll see banks on this between now and next year, because if we bring on another billion people, they'll need savings accounts, loans and things banks are very good at.\" It is also noteworthy that Visa and Mastercard are part of the Libra Association, which will fund the reserve backing the currency, so it's possible a successful new eco-system might help established financial companies grow earnings, as well as Facebook. It might eventually provide new sources of liquidity to the financial system.</p><p>There is still a long way to go, however, thanks to the problems mentioned. And, in the words of one independent analyst: \"There's a lot of bull being talked about application of blockchain.\" Rather like any nascent industry, blockchain has fostered the rise of snake-oil sales consultants, who our expert says \"will profit from being kept on to manage bad implementation and integrations\". This will be depressingly familiar to anyone who has been subjected to a big IT project at work.</p><p>From an investment perspective, with some intriguing opportunities out there - and tax benefits for venture capital trusts (VCTs) - trying to get some exposure to the smaller growth companies is worth a slice of capital. As far as the larger financial and technology companies are concerned there are some good investment trusts out there which, like all collective schemes, spread the risk of big calls on individual companies. JN Rise of the machines Foundations were laid for artificial intelligence (AI), when mathematician and Second World War code-breaking hero Alan Turing (1912-54) introduced his stored-program concept. Turing prophesied that computers would one day beat humans at chess and sure enough 40 years' evolution of artificial 'neural networks' (pioneered by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1950s) led to AI programme Deep Blue defeating chess master Gary Kasparov in 1997. Extrapolating trial and error learning into algorithms, overlaying information from other sources and re-hashing the learned algorithms - on a gargantuan scale - has seen AI continue to develop exponentially.</p><p>Another milestone was passed in April 2017, when Google's AlphaGo computer defeated the world champion (China's Ke Jie) of Korean strategy game Go. When sensitive human activities are the subject of AI interference there has been controversy. For example, the NHS was criticised for the access it gave Deep-Mind - the London start-up that created AlphaGo and was bought by Google - to 1.6m patient records as part of a project to optimise care.

Who doesn\u2019t want that? Here\u2019s a sample of the kind of consumer benefits the fintech revolution is likely to bring about to consumers in Malaysia and we should see some shoots of these innovations in 2017.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Note that some of these innovations are being developed by fintechs independently, or in collaboration with established financial institutions or by the institutions themselves. As one senior digital officer of a large bank explained to me recently, it is thanks to the fintech movement that banks are dedicating more resources to digital intiatives. Also to be noted is that banks fear the large tech companies (such as Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba and Google) more than they do the fintech start-ups.</p><p>This is probably why we will see more collaborations between banks and the big tech firms, beginning in the area of payments. In any case, here\u2019s why the consumer \u2013 both individuals and corporations \u2013 should be heralding fintech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cheaper remittances</emphasis></p><p>Charges for cross border transfers are on a downward spiral. In fact, a global race has began to provide cheaper, faster and safer cross border remittances.</p><p>Just recently, Malaysia\u2019s largest bank\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/business/marketwatch/stocks/?qcounter=MAYBANK\">Malayan Banking Bhd</url>\u00a0(Maybank) launched a digital remittance service in Malaysia with global player Western Union. The service will run through Maybank2u mobile banking app, enabling customers to transfer money to more than 500,000 Western Union agent locations in over 200 countries and territories. Even before Maybank\u2019s launch, there is local firm Merchantrade Asia, which provides a service called eRemit which offers something similar.</p><p>Then there are the fintechs, seeking to drive costs down even lower, by providing matching services to parties wanting to transfer funds. The idea is for both sides to enjoy better exchange rates than what banks and even money changers offer. Homegrown start-ups like MoneyMatch are creating their own platforms to match individual buyers and sellers of currencies. They are likely to ramp up their service to cater to the SME market which do a lot of cross border transfers in the normal course of business.</p><p>There are also global fintechs which target this space and which will be reaching our shores soon. UK-based TransferWise, which began in 2011 and today moves US$10bil a year through its platform, plans to launch in Singapore and Hong Kong after starting its Japan business in last September. Telcos are also inching into this space, considering they have a vast existing customer base to offer remittance and forex services</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robo advisory</emphasis></p><p>This is where software is meant to bring investment advice to the masses in a cheap and efficient manner. Sort of bringing the private banking suite to the masses. Will it work? Why not, if it means giving basic, cheap and easily accessible advice for those willing or interested in investing small amounts of money.</p><p>The platform provider though would have to gain the confidence of investors and prove they can deliver on decent financial advice and returns for investors. This space is going to get more traction as the Securities Commission (SC) is close to releasing the guidelines for parties interested in applying for a licence to operate robo advisory services in Malaysia. Among the more notable robo players in mature markets are Betterment (which hit an asset under management figure of US$5bil last July) Acorns (which offers an app targeted at young investors, allowing users to deposit small amounts in a brokerage account that automatically buys a diversified group of exchange-traded funds) and Nutmeg (that allows an investor to play around with an account without any real money).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Insurance</emphasis></p><p>Digital innovations are having a significant impact on the insurance sector, largely because of its very consumer focused offerings. In Malaysia, it is still in its nascent stage although a few start-ups have been making some inroads. Among the services that digital insurance platforms are seeking to offer are insurance comparison services for areas such as travel, car and health insurance products and platforms that seek to provide customers with the ability to buy insurance products directly, cutting out the middlemen and brokers. Some are seeking to be more collaborative.</p><p>Consider GetCover Sdn Bhd which will soon launch GetCover, a free mobile application that allows users to buy motor insurance directly from insurers. It is expected to be the first of its kind in the market.</p><p>GetCover\u2019s aim is to leverage on the efficiencies of digital distribution channels to benefit end-consumers.</p><p>The idea is to make it easier for consumers to research insurance products available in the market and for providers to streamline operations and save distribution costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peer-to-peer lending</emphasis></p><p>If you were an SME looking for debt funding to grow your business, you are in luck. Coming soon will be six technology-based platforms that have been licensed to match investors with SMEs looking to raise debt. All six will be quickly seeking to build their portfolio of borrowers and this can only be good news for SMEs, who now no longer have to rely on banks (that sometimes tend to avoid the smaller sized loan segment).</p><p>SMEs also now have a better option than turning to unlicensed money lenders or loan sharks. A few banks are believed to be backing some of the P2P players, which should boost the sustainability of these platforms. It is left to be seen if these platforms will attract sufficient number of investors, such as high net worth individuals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Watch the fintech sandbox</emphasis></p><p>As we know, the fintech space is a highly regulated one. Regulators will play a key role in the success or failure of fintech initiatives. In this regard, a close eye ought to be kept on the sandbox that Bank Negara Malaysia will be starting soon. Companies selected to participate have a high chance of getting legitamised to run their fintech offerings, although there\u2019s nothing to stop those not participating to later apply for a licence to operate. The idea of the fintech is to see how these fintech operations impact the market and from it clearer rules will emerge for regulators to impose on players.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Star (Malaysia)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Banks fear the large tech companies such as Alibaba more than they do the fintech start-ups.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-36582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S21-TF41-F17J-S11R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>January 5, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002GH5</classCode><className>MALAYAN BANKING BHD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009SYG</classCode><className>WESTERN UNION CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was perverse: our information was sitting inside the bank's systems but we couldn't get it out in away that made sense.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The experience helped him realise that, somewhere under the grunt work, a good business idea might be lurking. What was needed was some way of tapping into the customer account information locked away in the banks, leveraging the data in ways that could make everyday life a lot less complicated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As chief executive of Simpler, an online mortgage broker, Murphy has taken the first steps in this direction. Instead of the mountains of paperwork that are needed to support a typical loan application, first-time buyers can shortcircuit the process with Simpler's app, which interfaces with mortgage providers behind the scenes.</p><p>Life should get easier for businesses such as Murphy's from September, when the EU's second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) comes into force. It will usher in a new era of open banking, forcing banks to allow third parties - retailers, fintech start-ups and rival lenders - to access the accounts of any customers who authorise it. A public awareness campaign about PSD2, billed by some as the biggest upheaval to hit retail or business banking in the past 50 years, has kicked off in recent days.</p><p>\"It's your data but it's trapped in the bank,\" said Murphy. \"Open banking will get the data out of the bank so that it can be used for useful applications.\"</p><p>By breaking the banks' stranglehold on customer data, the hope is that their monopoly on financial services might be loosened, if not broken.</p><p>For an idea of what to expect, most people are looking to Britain, which implemented PSD2 in January 2018. This has necessitated a \u00a31bn ((EURO)1.1bn) investment by the country's banks and spawned almost 200 third-party busi-nesses eager to harvest data from bank customers for a wide range of services.</p><p>Credit Ladder, for example, lets tenants build a credit history based on their rental payments - data that was previously not available to lenders when making credit checks. Nestlings.io works like a mobile game that helps users make regular savings. Yet Britons have been predictably reluctant to throw their bank accounts open to third parties.</p><p>\"When you ask consumers to give away their data, their initial reaction is always no,\" said Garrett Cassidy, founder of Trezeo, an Irish company that has taken advantage of open banking in the UK. \"Their attitude changes, though, if you can demonstrate how sharing data can create value.\"</p><p>Trezeo has raised (EURO)750,000 from backers including Voxpro founders Dan and Linda Kiely. It uses open banking to access the accounts of those with irregular earnings, such as taxi drivers and gigeconomy workers, helping to smooth out their cashflow by holding back some income in busy weeks to help tide them over when work is less plentiful.</p><p>Initial expectations that the tech giants might use open banking as a weapon to break into financial services have so far proved unfounded. This may be because their ambitions are much greater than anything envisaged by PSD2. With Facebook planning its own currency, for example, it probably believes it has nothing to learn from conventional banks. Big tech may also be wary of PSD2 because the price for accessing banks' customer data is that third parties must agree to strict regulatory supervision.</p><p>Stripe, the payments unicorn founded by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, has obtained authorisation from the Central Bank of Ireland to provide PSD2-type services. There are no signs yet that other tech groups will follow.</p><p>\"The open banking products that are out there are mostly good solutions for small problems,\" said Murphy. \"Many of the companies behind them are probably not large enough to attract the funding that's needed to get regulated. You'd need a minimum of (EURO)100,000 to show the regulator you have the resources to stay solvent for the first 18 months.\"</p><p>Yet a number of Irish fintechs have surmounted the challenges of scale by concentrating on the UK. Swoop Funding, with (EURO)1.2m of backing from Enterprise Ireland and other investors, interrogates the bank accounts of UK small businesses to help them link up with about 1,000 providers of debt and equity capital.</p><p>\"We condense the funding market for small businesses, which are generally knowledge- and time-poor,\" said founder and chief executive Andrea Reynolds.</p><p>Circit, whose backers include former Ulster Bank chief executive Jim Brown, has a tool that allows external auditors to obtain real-time confirmations from their clients' bankers. Luna Connect is a Galway start-up that uses open banking to gather information on businesses and individuals that are looking for credit.</p><p>\"In some ways there's nothing new about what we do,\" said Cassidy, whose career before Trezeo included an eight-year stint at Bank of Ireland.</p><p>\"Without open banking, however, it would be too laborious and expensive to go through people's statements manually to gauge what a reasonable level of income should be for each individual. The process is so much more efficient when we have direct access to people's electronic data.\"</p><p>Irish banks are well placed to roll out open banking, says Cassidy, because AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have been through the process in the UK, including developing the application programming interfaces (APIs) that link customers' accounts with third-party providers. \"Using the same APIs as the UK lowers the barriers for UK third parties to come to Ireland,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think they'd be interested if Ireland used different APIs, because the market is too small.\"</p><p>Swoop is already working with Ulster Bank and other local lenders on introducing its business funding platform to Ireland. \"We're seeing a real shift in banks' mindsets,\" says Reynolds.</p><p>\"They've moved from viewing open banking as a compliance issue - something they have to do because of PSD2 - to being an opportunity. They're becoming more collaborative, realising that if they cannot meet their customers' needs, there is an opportunity in helping them find funding elsewhere by working with third parties such as Swoop.\"</p><p>Fears that banks might use this collaboration as a Trojan horse to steal the clever ideas of emerging companies are unfounded, according to Fergal Coburn, chief digital and innovation officer at AIB.</p><p>\"We're a bank,\" he said. \"Our business is not scalable to a level where we could absorb all the fintech ideas out there.\"</p><p>Coburn believes one of the main threat to banks from PSD2 will come from other banks. If customers agree to allow AIB to access their accounts at other banks, for example, it could have a much better view of their overall finances, allowing for speedier lending decisions.</p><p>AIB opened an open banking portal in November last year for fintechs gearing up to take advantage of open banking. Despite a lot of interest, only eight third parties are connected to the bank's API so far. They include Fire Financial Services, a payments company founded by the businessman Colm Lyon, who sold his Realex Payments for (EURO)115m in 2015.</p><p>\"We've made a big investment in this,\" says Coburn. \"Take-up has been disappointing but I expect open banking will be similar to our experience with contactless payment cards. They were a slow burn at first but usage has accelerated dramatically, to the point where half of card transactions are now contactless.\"</p><p>\"Banks have moved from viewing open banking as a compliance issue to an opportunity</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOSHOP: TONY BELL</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-150639487</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFT-9251-DYTY-C0TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 30, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DB2J</classCode><className>CREDIT CHECKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DL3M</classCode><className>MOBILE GAMES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

But as 2019 comes to an end without legislation, the industry isn't even expecting action in 2020. And for that, they're feeling relieved, not disappointed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook Inc.'s midyear announcement that it planned to launch a cryptocurrency, Libra, upended the industry's focus, tilting the legislative strategy from pressing hard for beneficial bills to staying clear of measures aimed at checking the social media giant's ambitions to transform commerce.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, with the possible exception of a data privacy bill and a smattering of smaller measures, congressional observers in the fintech world expect 2020 will maintain the statutory status quo.</p><p>\"Toward the end of the year, we started to see a couple different proposals circulated in the House that would go after Libra,\" said Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, an industry trade group.</p><p>But those proposals, like a bill (HR 5197) from Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia, D-Texas, that would have regulated managed stablecoins like Libra as securities, were narrowly tailored, Smith said, calling it a positive sign.</p><p>\"The fact that this is looking at a subset of crypto known as managed stable coins is pretty remarkable,\" she said, noting the bill could have targeted all cryptocurrencies. \"It's a very nuanced approach and answering a very targeted question.\"</p><p>That's a far cry from the spring, when the Blockchain Association hoped a bill (HR 2144) that would have prevented digital tokens from being labeled securities would make it at least to a House Financial Services Committee markup.</p><p>Smith said she expects to see more measures aimed at discouraging Silicon Valley from moving onto Wall Street's turf than those doing the opposite. She said the House Financial Services Committee could still mark up Garcia's bill next year along with similar proposals with names like the \"Keep Big Tech Out of Financial Services Act.\"</p><p>The fintech world \"dodged a bullet\" with that bill, said Jonah Crane, a former Treasury Department staffer and aide to Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who now advises fintech firms. \"I don't see high odds that those kind of bills will go anywhere, but they are the kind of bills that, if they start to get momentum, could be hard to stop because of the general antipathy toward Big Tech these days.\"  </p><p>But even if they made it to the House floor, there's little expectation they'd go anywhere in the Senate.</p><p>That's not because these bills are inherently partisan -- Republicans are about as skeptical as Democrats on a lot of fintech issues. It's because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has shown little interest in spending floor time on anything other than judicial nominations. </p><p>\"Betting on congressional inaction has sort of been a relatively safe bet for a while,\" Crane said. \"But there are a handful of small things that seem like they could happen.\"  </p><p>Crane pointed to lighter legislative lifts, like authorizing studies or establishing regulator task forces. Such uncontroversial measures, which allow members to say they've done something without having to go through the hassle of actually changing regulations or spending money, could find their way into must-pass legislation like an appropriations bill.   </p><p>A bill (HR 922) that would direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to study the potential for manipulation in digital commodities could find its way into the CFTC's reauthorization bill (HR 4895), Crane said. An amendment that would direct the CFTC to develop guidelines for trading digital commodities was already added at the Agriculture Committee's markup.  </p><p>The fear that tech firms like Facebook and Google will get into banking is largely motivated by the sector's spotty record with data privacy. Congress has grown more concerned that Silicon Valley is going too far by tracking users' every step online and then using that data to manipulate users' web habits, purchasing decisions and even political stances -- giving the companies unfettered access to saving and spending data.  </p><p>Data privacy measures</p><p>There have been at least 20 bills introduced this year on data privacy and cybersecurity, but one (S 2986) from Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation ranking member Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., has commanded the most attention since its introduction earlier this month.  </p><p>Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., released a draft of his own data privacy bill the same week Cantwell introduced her measure, and not much separates the two.  </p><p>\"There's actually an incredible amount of overlap,\" Crane said. \"They both agree on a pretty robust view of consumer data rights -- rights of transparency, rights of access, rights of data portability.\"  </p><p>They differ on allowing private rights of action, which Republicans generally loathe, and federal preemption, which Cantwell's bill lacks.  </p><p>Congress' interest in the issue stems from high profile data breaches, like one in 2013 of Yahoo's 3 billion user accounts and one in 2017 of Equifax that affected almost 150 million people.  </p><p>\"These things tend to gain a little bit of steam when there's a breach,\" said Ian Katz, an analyst at Alpha Capital Partners. \"The chances of legislation would pick up significantly if there were another significant breach.\"  </p><p>Another factor potentially driving legislative action is the implementation of California's data privacy law in 2020, coming in the wake of the European Union's enactment in 2018 of the General Data Protection Regulation.   </p><p>\"You're starting to really, truly see, at least in the states, a real patchwork emerging,\" said Jason Rosenstock, a lobbyist at Thorn Run Partners.  </p><p>Jodie Kelley, CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association, said she expects and hopes to see movement in 2020 on a uniform national standard for privacy to replace a series of state standards. She called Cantwell's bill \"directionally correct,\" but said it needs more work.   </p><p>\"It would really have to incorporate the ability of our companies to continue to use data to fight fraud,\" she said. \"They used data to fight fraud every day. There is a lot of innovation in that space.\"</p><p>Crane and Rosenstock disagreed about the impact the implementation of California's law would have on Congress' desire to pass a federal standard on data privacy.  </p><p>When California's law goes into effect in January, \"the world will not end,\" Crane said. \"That may sap some of the momentum from some of the federal efforts around privacy; it won't be viewed as such an emergency anymore.\"</p><p>Rosenstock disagreed. \"I think that it will only serve to continue to draw attention to the issue,\" he said.  </p><p>But don't expect many laws to pass in the short 2020 legislative year. An impeachment trial will likely eat up much of the Senate's January, and lawmaking in both chambers will grind to a halt when reelection campaigns pick up in the summer. </p><p>Source: CQ News<br/>Copyright 2019 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

You can easily use a company like Marqeta to offer credit cards, a provider like Plaid to connect customers to their banks, or any other number of platforms to easily collect payments or offer credit. Fintech startups are bypassing banks and shaping the future of banking.</p><p>Embedded finance isn't new. Retailers like Costco and Walmart have provided their own closed-loop credit cards for decades, and even old-school store credit looked a lot like the embedded finance we see today because it kept money out of banks.

Alipay is Amazon competitor Alibaba's ubiquitous mobile and online payment platform. Today, people across China use it to pay for everything from train fare to retail products, online or offline. The platform saw $15 trillion in transactions last year, and its parent company, Ant, is set to make an IPO of over $200 billion.</p><p>You could make the argument that compliance requirements and regulations in the U.S. will keep nonbanks out of the banking game for decades to come.

According to the new banking technology rules, one cannot use single OTP to sign more than one document. It was not earlier. This will change the business model and customer experience for all of us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEBI has released a consultative paper recently, which says that banks and financial institutions that are advisors cannot do selling. Those banks that are big mutual fund distributors and acting as advisors, now cannot do both. So, the technology and ecosystem must be designed in such a way as to be agile to handle such disruptions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now we have many NBFCs in the market and most NBFCs command a better premium than banks. This is because they are more customer focused and they are more flexible. Many of the new banks are using NBFCs as the last leg to expand their market. So, leveraging this, there is scope for exponential growth as compared to linear growth.</p><p>There are eCommerce players, healthcare companies and holiday companies, which were customers of banks. They can do underwriting based on the data they have. So, some of the current business of financial firms will come under threat. In the budget 2018 there are several measures that are offering benefits to the MSME sector.</p><p>Sameer Jaini, Digital Strategist, CEO - The Digital Fifth</p><p>Fintechs are not only impacting banks, they are also affecting big technology companies like Wipro, TCS, etc, which traditionally offer big solutions. Their deal sizes are in millions, compared to a few lakhs of the fintechs. Even consultancy business is changing. The large providers typically go with a T&amp;M model. Today, the sales guy cannot come as a coordinator, he must come with appropriate domain knowledge.</p><p>Banks themselves are changing direction. Earlier, they would do total outsourcing. Now they are hiring good technology guys to do inhouse development. Earlier, LMS was typically taken from a solutions provider. Now, many banks are building from scratch, as what is available is so generic that it does not give a long term competitive advantage. More and more things that are customer facing are getting insourced.</p><p>Prasanna Lohar, Head - Innovation, DCB Bank</p><p>The big tech companies have not thought of agility and new services around core applications. They are already late as fintechs are servicing things around the core. For example, Accenture is setting up a fintech lab. Collaboration will drive the success for fintechs.</p><p>Innovation Index of India is not growing in a big way. The parameters are how big organizations are innovating. So, India needs a structured way to adopt fintech, such as sandboxes. There are small countries like Singapore and Israel, which have gone a long way is making use of sandboxes. Microsoft has really changed its ways. It is working as if it is in a startup mode.</p><p>New banks have opportunity to bring in new technologies. Maybe, even core banking will come from a fintech. Banks are now recruiting ethical hackers, blockchain experts, UI/UX experts, etc, to bring in more innovation. Technologies like big data, IoT, AI, etc, are being adopted. When it comes to adopting fintech, we have done some hackathons. In India, we see lots of copycat solutions. We are suggesting the creation of a use case repository to empower fintechs, so that they do not need continuous explaining. This will enable vertical innovation as opposed to horizontal innovation.</p><p>Jagdish Narayanan, CTO, Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank</p><p>As a startup bank, we must see how to leverage the fintechs around us, as well as have the core backbone in shape. The backbone of CBS and regulatory and reporting solutions is hygiene and it should be left alone alone as far as possible. It must also be insisted that digital innovation should be done with API connections, making them lot more amenable to adopting newer technologies.</p><p>Kunal Patel, FinTech Speaker/Business Advisor and Mentor</p><p>Big companies and consultancies are today trying to play catch up. Banks are working with fintechs, but that was not the case earlier. They tend to invite some of their startups to their internal meetings as well. If someone in a big company tells you that they are working like a startup, that is not the case. The required cultural shift will happen slowly.</p><p>Big technology companies and startups must co-exist and be in sync. Many large IT companies today do not know what they are doing and how to remain relevant. These technology companies are still detached from their end users. Startups have a different mentality and are focused on the customers.</p><p>Akhil Handa, Head - Fintech &amp; New Business Initiatives, Bank of Baroda</p><p>We are fortunate to talk to both the big technology companies and the fintech startups. We have a problem in maintaining relationship with a big technology company. It relates to DNA on both sides. Banks need big technology companies to evolve. The large companies are making a roadmap for their future. Now who is drawing the maximum benefit is the fintechs, as they can go to both banks and big technology companies, in selling products or being acquired. A sale is largely made on putting together the requisite team. When we look at any proposition, we have 2 questions - is there any implicit call to a big company or can we do it internally? It is a great time to be a fintech. The strategy of large companies is to co-opt innovation and then take it to their clients. Many large technology companies today were fintechs 10 years ago.</p><p>Venkatesh Hariharan, Director - Fintech, iSPIRIT</p><p>When we talk about competition and collaboration with fintech ecosystems, I believe every industry is becoming a platform. Banking is, however, not in this frame because it is highly regulated. One of the big challenges is that banks are still looking at it as vendor management. If they look beyond, the scale will accelerate very fast. That is where commercial partnerships need to come up. Recently, the prime minister of the Philippines said his government wants to adopt Aadhaar. Many other countries are interested in leveraging solutions developed in India. With GST, millions of bills are coming online. That makes bill discounting a huge possibility. We see several digital lenders coming up.</p><p>Sudin Baraokar, Innovation Advisor, State Bank of India</p><p>The idea of building a bank chain alliance for blockchain was to move beyond our ecosystem. India must become not just the digital leader but also the technology leader. Only then we will have startups and fintechs thinking big. It is time for fintechs to think big and make use of the sandboxes. Instead of SBI buying the products and services, we can subscribe to and consume those services, and go ahead. Gartner predicts that by 2030, all banking services today will cease to exist.</p><p>Pankaj Pandey, CTO, IDBI Federal Life Insurance</p><p>Fintech companies must play a major role. We are still behind the west in fintech adoption. I see crucial role for the government and the regulator in this. The government is pushing for insurance penetration.</p><p>Neeraj Amin, Director - Key Account Relationship, Perfios</p><p>The biggest challenge is knowing what a customer needs. We are glad to enable customers to walk into a bank without a single piece of paper in their hand and apply for a loan. We can work in collaboration with banks to understand their pain areas and create a solution to leapfrog over where we are.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNKFRO-0038553658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNKFRO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXG-GN61-DXMP-K3R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Glocal Infomart Pvt Ltd, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Banking Frontiers</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Allerdings z\u00f6gern viele noch, weil in einzelnen Gebieten wie Finanzierung, Supply Chain Finance und Zahlungsverkehr v\u00f6llig unklar ist, welches Start-up sich nachhaltig durchsetzen kann. Hinzu kommt: Vielen Fintechs fehlt der Zugang zu Finanzabteilungen von Unternehmen. Viele Firmenkunden-Fintechs sind deshalb offener geworden f\u00fcr Kooperationen mit Banken - nicht zuletzt, weil es vielen von ihnen in den zur\u00fcckliegenden Jahren nicht gelang, den Markt allein zu erobern. Das ist ein zentrales Ergebnis der neuen FINANCE-Studie \"Liebe auf den dritten Blick - Wie Firmenkunden-Fintechs und Banken zusammenfinden\", die gemeinsam mit den Kooperationspartnern ING und CMS entstanden ist. </p><p>Insbesondere Fintechs, die vom Breakeven noch weit entfernt sind und deshalb starke Partner suchen, finden bei den Banken immer \u00f6fter Geh\u00f6r. Die Kreditinstitute stellen fest, dass sie von den jungen Finanzunternehmen viel lernen k\u00f6nnen - etwa wenn es darum geht, als Bank agiler zu arbeiten. Allerdings muss die Zusammenarbeit sauber ausgestaltet werden, denn auch f\u00fcr Fintechs werden die regulatorischen Rahmenbedingungen immer strenger. </p><p>Nicht zuletzt stellt sich die Frage, ob Fintechs und Banken nicht irgendwann werden kooperieren m\u00fcssen, wenn sie sich gegen eine Bedrohung von dritter Seite durchsetzen wollen, denn auch Big-Tech-Unternehmen wie Apple, Ariba, Amazon, PayPal und Google machen sich in Bankinggebieten wie dem Zahlungsverkehr - Stichwort Apple Pay - breit. </p><p>F\u00fcr die Studie hat FINANCE verschiedene Fintechs in Einzelinterviews intensiv befragt, welche Entwicklung sie in den zur\u00fcckliegenden Jahren durchlaufen haben und welche Zukunftspl\u00e4ne sie haben: An welchen Stellen hat sich ihr Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell ver\u00e4ndert? Und wie stehen sie heute zu den Banken und deren Angeboten?
