Among its ranks are some of the country's fastest-growing innovators, galloping ahead on Wall Street, while others are workhorses chalking up steady growth, often outside the limelight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, middle market companies find themselves squeezed between the vaunted Fortune 500 behemoths and the mom-and-pop small businesses of Main Street. That leads to distinct disadvantages. Don't go to Washington looking for a middle market counterpart to the Small Business Administration or the Fortune 500's powerful lobbyists on K Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The middle market universe, broadly defined as companies with annual revenue between $10 million and $1 billion, covers a broad spectrum of industries that include public and privately held companies as well as family-owned businesses, partnerships and sole proprietorships.&amp;#8239;</p><p>While the middle market accounts for only around 3% of U.S. companies, this slice of American business is responsible for one-third of private sector jobs and economic activity, according to the National Center for the Middle Market, located at Ohio State University.&amp;#8239;</p><p>\"Back of the envelope calculations by us show that from the Great Recession to the Great Pandemic, middle market companies accounted for 60% of net new jobs,\" said Thomas Stewart, executive director of the National Center for the Middle Market. \"The middle market is a huge, undercovered area.\"</p><p>The middle market is estimated to employ 30 million people nationwide with combined annual revenue of $10 trillion. Fueling all that growth means middle market companies operate at a robust pace when it comes to hiring, leasing and financing it all. Partially in response to barriers faced by middle market companies, the sector has fostered its own cottage industry of professionals and service providers catering to its financial, accounting and business needs</p><p>A key storyline for the middle market in the current crisis has been the acceleration of digital transformation. Long positioned as an eventual goal, the situation posed by the pandemic has underscored the necessity of a new embrace of technology.&amp;#8239;</p><p>The New Reality</p><p>The Bay Area's middle market ranges not only in size and sector but also in how some are thriving and others are diving amid the pandemic. One only needs to take a look at Wall Street for evidence of a clear-cut divide.&amp;#8239;</p><p>DocuSign has seen its shares soar about seven times higher since top-tier bankers Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase took the San Francisco electronic-signature company public in April 2018. DocuSign posted revenue of $701 million in 2019, and the company saw revenue jump to $297 million in the three-month period that ended April 30, 2020 - up almost 40% from the same period a year ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, lesser known Hayward-based Italian wholesale food distributor Armanino Foods of Distinction - with revenue last year of about $43 million - has seen its thinly traded shares fall more than one-third this year. Armanino Foods has trimmed its dividend as it copes with many of its restaurant customers being closed amid shelter-in-place orders. But the company is seeing a recent pickup in sales for its pasta and sauces.</p><p>\"We experienced a steady increase in sales and margins since the lowest point of the pandemic in early April, particularly in the domestic market. This upward trend continued through the end of the quarter,\" Tim Anderson, Armanino Foods' president and CEO, said in announcing second-quarter results. \"The economy, trends and consumer behaviors are still relatively unknown and will take several quarters to truly understand how this pandemic will affect our existing business model going forward.</p><p>\"That being said, we believe we are well positioned financially from a balance sheet perspective to weather the storm and strategically invest,\" Anderson said.</p><p>Both DocuSign and Armanino Foods are examples of how the pandemic-induced economic downturn has spurred middle market companies to set aside initial plans and projections in place before much of the economy shut down as they adapt to the new realities of business. And, they underscore how a divide in strategy can easily separate winners and losers in this market.&amp;#8239;</p><p>\"Covid-19's impact on the economy has been particularly disabling for the middle market, with smaller midsize companies bearing the brunt of the pressure,\" according to accounting firm RSM US LLC, citing a second-quarter survey for its RSM US Middle Market Business Index. \"Smaller middle market businesses sought lending relief at significantly higher rates than their larger counterparts and appeared less able to shift to remote work.\"</p><p>In the National Center for the Middle Market's breakdown of the most important factors for middle market companies to ignite growth, \"investing and innovating\" are listed as key to \"being able to withstand a downturn in your industry.\"&amp;#8239;</p><p>In the research center's parlance, these companies are \"innovators,\" which focus on developing new products and services and processes for delivering them.</p><p>Today's work-from-home environment, in which as much as possible is handled electronically, has fueled DocuSign's business that allows documents to be signed electronically.&amp;#8239;</p><p>Enabling the digital transformation of other companies has been a bright spot for the middle market. Companies like DocuSign and Slack have created the tools and products that are a key enabler of the new way business is conducted due to Covid-19.</p><p>\"DocuSign is in the business of helping customers digitally transform their agreement processes,\" said Kirsten Wolberg, DocuSign's chief technology and operations officer. \"Of our customers, about 60% have been focused on digitally transforming their front-office functions like sales, marketing and customer service. Another 40% of our customers are focused on transforming back-office functions like finance, IT, HR, legal and procurement.\"</p><p>Office closures and working from home amid Covid-19 spurred companies to rapidly embrace digital transformation, adopt new communication tools and shift more operations onto the cloud.</p><p>\"Within DocuSign, we already have the tools for remote collaboration, like Slack and Zoom, and our operations were designed with remote work in mind,\" Wolberg said. \"We also highly leverage our own solutions.\"</p><p>At Zendesk, the pandemic rapidly altered consumer demands and appetites for the San Francisco cloud-based customer service company's products.&amp;#8239;</p><p>\"Covid-19 caused a massive shift across all industries and customer expectations have changed dramatically within a matter of weeks,\" said Colleen Berube, chief information officer and senior vice president of operations at Zendesk.</p><p>The company reoriented its focus to services in greater demand, \"prioritizing the things that have the highest degree of customer impact, and rolling out the tools that are easiest to use and have the capability to deliver results fast,\" Berube said.&amp;#8239;</p><p>That focus on quick results amid the pandemic may explain why the digital transformation of business operations is moving full speed ahead despite economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19, according to a survey of middle market companies by the National Center for the Middle Market.</p><p>An Umpqua Bank survey released this month found more than 80% of middle market companies have already begun automating or plan to automate tasks previously performed by workers.&amp;#8239;</p><p>Deal or No Deal</p><p>Other growth channels for the middle market appear to currently be in a lull. On the M&amp;A front, there was a notable deal this month in which private equity firm Thoma Bravo cut an $11 billion cash-and-stock deal to sell Pleasanton fintech Ellie Mae, which provides a cloud-based loan origination platform for the mortgage industry.</p><p>Ellie Mae, which is No. 36 on the San Francisco Business Times Middle Market 50 List, was snapped up by Intercontinental Exchange, owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Intercontinental Exchange saw its shares change hands at a record price shortly after announcing the Ellie Mae acquisition.</p><p>Such a deal doesn't come as a surprise to Nick Steiner, partner in San Francisco accounting firm BPM. Still, he added that the deal isn't necessarily indicative of the market as a whole.&amp;#8239;</p><p>\"We have had a number of clients get acquired, especially in the technology space. All of the big tech companies, with their stock where they are and all their resources, have been very acquisitive,\" Steiner said. \"We're not seeing a lot of our middle market clients acquiring a lot of other companies. That's been pretty quiet all of 2020.\"</p><p>Today's M&amp;A financing environment is very favorable to the nation's top tech companies, with high stock prices providing a powerful currency for stock-swap deals. Historically low interest rates have&amp;#8239; also made financing all-cash deals easier.</p><p>Asked why middle market companies aren't out shopping, Steiner said the sector is largely taking a cautious approach.</p><p>\"No one knows what the next six months has in store,\" Steiner said. \"There are a lot of people out there waiting for the other shoe to drop.\"</p><p>But some observers are saying middle market companies are starting to move off the sidelines.</p><p>\"There are trillions of dollars in investment dry powder with corporates and private equities that are constantly searching for deals,\" said Kartik Sundar Raj, a partner with accounting firm RSMUS in San Francisco. \"The middle market has become a rich target.\"</p><p>Others Also See the Pickup in Activity.</p><p>\"M&amp;A activity in the middle market came to a full stop in March and April and now is starting to accelerate rapidly, which is tracking some of the larger company M&amp;A activity that picked up sharply in the last 30 days,\" said longtime San Francisco banker Jon Merriman, who is now chief business officer at B. Riley FBR in Los Angeles.&amp;#8239;</p><p>Merriman said the sector's lack of operational visibility led to the slowdown in deal flow, but executives are getting increasingly comfortable with future projections.</p><p>\"We saw several of our sell side companies take two to three months to calibrate their financials, fully stopping a prospective M&amp;A process, given their uncertainty. That period has normalized,\" Merriman said. \"Given the huge amount of liquidity in the market from the Fed, valuations of private companies are expanding, and obviously the public equity markets have hugely benefited from the massive liquidity.\"</p><p>That liquidity injection into the economy amounting to trillions of dollars also explains why bankruptcy filings are lower than many expected. BPM's Steiner anticipates more bankruptcies ahead by what he calls \"zombie companies.\"</p><p>\"They're sort of in limbo,\" Steiner said of these troubled companies. \"This is where we thought we'd see a bank foreclose or a landlord evict, but we're not seeing any of that. Everything is in a holding pattern. The banks and landlords don't really want to deal with the level of pain this would cause.\"</p><p>Internal Affairs&amp;#8239;</p><p>While some companies are walking zombies, others are clearly on a roll. In addition to DocuSign, San Francisco-based Slack Technologies also got a lift with more Americans working from home. A point not lost on Wall Street, where the company's shares are up about 65% since mid-March.</p><p>\"Succeeding in this new, remote-first world requires much more than just replicating at home the same processes we once carried out in a physical office - it depends on a fundamental reimagining of work and the employee experience,\" Robby Kwok, senior vice president of people at Slack, said of the opportunity he sees for the company.</p><p>\"It is not just about the tools and technology you work with. It's really about the culture and norms your employees work within, and how you create that culture and propagate those new norms in a work-from-home environment.\"</p><p>Bay Area middle market companies are not only facilitating the digital transformation of other businesses, they're quickly embracing digital in their own operations as Covid-19 forces change in how business is done.&amp;#8239;</p><p>One trend with long-lasting impact is the reliance on communication channels that customers already use in their everyday lives, such as Facebook Messenger, Twitter direct messaging, WhatsApp and Apple Business Chat, among others.</p><p>\"There has been a drive to digital during the crisis, and we can expect when it's over that customers will look to these channels more than ever for engagement as they provide easy and real-time solutions,\" said Zendesk's Berube.</p><p>Invitae, which is focused on bringing genetic information into mainstream medicine, said it turned to telehealth to deliver more of its services in recent months, alongside an AI-based chatbot.</p><p>The San Francisco-based company points to its creation of a chatbot for genetics, named Gia, that combined consumer-facing chatbot technology with a platform for health care providers, all in compliance with health care regulations.</p><p>\"There is one thing we know for sure: Now is the time to break free from outdated notions of how things should be done and to develop a new formula for success,\" Kwok said.&amp;#8239;</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BURR, PILGER AND MAYER LLP PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 BURR, PILGER AND MAYER LLP PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Burr, Pilger &amp; Mayer LLP (BPM) provides accounting and consulting services.

Add-on acquisitions, or transactions that occur when a company acquires another company that complements the acquiring company's business model, accounted for a record 72.5% of all U.S. private equity buyouts in the first quarter of 2020, up from 2019's record of 68.1%. The trend continued in Q2 as add-ons made up the highest percentage of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) on record, and median deal size ticked down for the first time in five years. But while the private equity industry is enjoying the benefits of add-ons, many operating companies may be missing out on potential opportunities.</p><p>Why? It's not necessarily because the potential strategic acquirers don't recognize the value of acquiring complementary businesses. It's often due to lack of internal resources needed to navigate many of the complexities involved in the strategic add-on process.</p><p>Add-ons typically occur when the acquired company could provide complementary products, services or technologies that can be easily integrated into the acquiring company's existing offerings. The target company might offer the same or similar products and/or services, but in a different geographic area. Or the target company might just do the same thing in the same market, but on a smaller scale and with different customers. These are just a few of many reasons a strategic add-on may make sense. In the current Covid-19 impacted environment, add-on deals may represent opportunistic buying opportunities, as potential target valuations may be down.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 21: Burr, Pilger and Mayer LLP: State Tax Issues Arise with COVID-19 Surcharges</p><p>Small business owners, especially restaurants and bars, are doing their best to keep cash coming in during 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic. One way some owners are trying to bring in more cash, and make up for the additional cleaning expenses, take-out containers and reduced capacity is by adding a \"COVID-19\" or \"Sanitation\" surcharge to their customers' receipts.</p><p>Their customers, who are also likely strapped for additional cash during the pandemic, are not taking these new charges lightly, and it is to be expected that neither will their state tax authorities.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 30: Burr, Pilger and Mayer LLP: Top 3 State &amp; Local Tax Issues Created by Remote Workers</p><p>New York City; Philadelphia; Portland; St. Louis; Washington, D.C - these are just a few of the dozens of major U.S. metropolitan areas situated on the borders of two or more states. Therefore, it should not be surprising to learn that nearly 4 percent of workers&amp;#8239; live and work in different states, according to U.S. census data.</p><p>As state and local tax experts know well, state borders may not segregate minor differences in laws or cultures. State and local income and sales tax laws that govern how, and at what rate, businesses and consumers are taxed can vary significantly from state to state, even those that border each other.</p><p>Accountants who work in state and local taxes, otherwise known as \"SALT,\" typically ensure their clients or businesses fulfill their respective obligations and are not overpaying taxes. Often, tax planning strategies are created to reduce their client's or business's tax burden to the absolute minimum. But when employees suddenly empty their offices and set up offices at home, as they have due to COVID-19 concerns, a wrench can be thrown into that tax planning.</p><p>Employee movement may impact tax planning because states tax companies when the company has a taxable nexus, or a minimum amount of business activity (created in most states by either a physical presence or by reaching the more nebulous \"economic presence\" standard) in that state. Newly remote employees who live in a different state than their employer's business operations may, in some cases, create a new state income tax nexus and new tax worries for the business.</p><p>For these new SALT issues happening in the middle of a tax year, businesses have two choices. They can evaluate everything at tax filing time - and potentially incur penalties as well as potentially overpay tax. Or they can take stock of their new remote employees and the new SALT laws they trigger&amp;#8239; now&amp;#8239; and plan ways to minimize their tax burden.</p><p>May 28: BPM's Edward Webb Talks Cash Flow Scenarios in AccountingWeb</p><p>Always the \"gold standard\" by which credit and investment decisions are made, cash flow analyses now also provide the means to monitor the health of your client's business and provide immediate input necessary for critical management decision-making.</p><p>A balanced picture of the future health of a business not only benefits clients, but ultimately all stakeholders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>May 28: Burr, Pilger and Mayer LLP: Webinar: Managing People and Financial Anxieties - Cash Flow for Small Businesses</p><p>While the impact of COVID-19 varies across industries and regions, business leaders must manage uncertainty as they plan for ways to preserve company value.

Since the QOZ legislation was initially passed in December 2017, the legislation following has been constantly evolving. Many of the modifications included in the Final Regulations are taxpayer friendly.</p><p>These final regulations are applicable for tax years beginning after March 13, 2020. However, taxpayers may apply the final regulations for earlier years, if applied in a consistent manner for all tax years. Since the final regulations are generally more favorable to taxpayers, it's believed most will choose to adopt them.</p><p>Section 1231 Gains</p><p>The cornerstone benefit of the QOZ legislation is a taxpayer can defer capital gain recognition by investing the gain proceeds in a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF). Then, if the taxpayer holds the QOF for at least 10 years, there is no taxation on the appreciation on ultimate disposition.</p><p>There have been questions surrounding how these rules applied to sales of trade or business assets (e.g., rental real estate). The sale of trade or business assets triggers Section 1231 gains. Section 1231 gains are treated as capital gains and are thus available for investment in QOFs. Initially, however, the prior proposed regulations provided the investor had to offset Section 1231 losses to determine how much of his/her gain could be invested in a QOF. In addition, the 180-day investment period started on December 31 or the end of the tax year. This created uncertainties and delays in investment.</p><p>The final regulations now clarify an investor does not have to offset Section 1231 losses against the Section 1231 gains to determine how much can be invested in a QOF.</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 20: Burr, Pilger and Mayer LLP: Zero-Touch Deployment: How HR and IT Can Work Together to Ensure Employee Management is Optimized</p><p>As organizations move to a more remote workforce, automating the on-boarding and off-boarding process to a zero-touch deployment is more important than ever.

Should you?</p><p>The CARES Act passed in March suspends, for 2020, the requirement that individuals take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their IRAs or other qualified plans. The requirement to take annual distributions applies to individuals1 who were 70 0.5 or older in 2019 or age 72 beginning January 1, 2020. Individuals, other than some spouses under the age requirement, who are beneficiaries of an IRA from a decedent may also be subject to the RMD provisions.</p><p>Under recent guidance provided by the IRS in Notice 2020-51, individuals who have taken an RMD in 2020 are allowed to put the money back into their IRA or other qualified plan2 if the funds are recontributed prior to August 31, 2020. Pre-existing rules allowed for most distributions to be rolled back into an IRA or other plan within 60 days of the distribution3. In addition, individuals were limited to one rollover distribution every 12 months. With respect to 2020 RMDs, under relief granted in Notice 2020-51, the rollover deadline for 2020 RMDs is extended to August 31, 2020 and any 2020 RMDs recontributed by the deadline are not counted as rollovers for purposes of the one rollover per 12-month period rule.</p><p>For those individuals who do not need the cash from their retirement, Notice 2020-51 allows them to return unwanted RMDs and thereby avoiding having to pay tax on the distributions.</p><p>Given the RMD flexibility available for 2020, what are some considerations that might impact the decision to recontribute an unneeded distribution?</p><p>If I am not taking a full distribution in 2020 requires taking a 2021 distribution in excess of the RMD, will the 2021 tax on the excess be greater than the 2020 tax?

Their revenues dropped 5% yoy in the first half of the year and loan loss provisions spiked, essentially wiping out profits. Nevertheless, the CET1 ratio increased to 14% and the leverage ratio dipped only slightly to 4.8%. Total assets surged, driven by a massive increase in liquidity reserves at central banks, a boom in corporate lending and substantial government bond purchases. By comparison, the major US banks have weathered the crisis somewhat better so far. They remained moderately profitable, despite setting aside more funds to cover future loan losses. Their revenues grew 2% yoy, a stronger headwind from the Fed's interest rate cuts notwithstanding. Capital ratios, however, appear less resilient than in Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD\">http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD</url></p><p>Industry: Capital Markets</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>September 10: Deutsche Bank wins 'World's Best Bank Transformation' in prestigious Euromoney awards</p><p>Deutsche Bank has won a prestigious Euromoney award for \"World's Best Bank Transformation\" for the progress it has made in the strategic transformation it launched last year to become stronger, more efficient and better positioned for the future.</p><p>\"It's clear that Deutsche Bank has resisted the distractions in market conditions that might have grabbed all its attention in the past,\" the editorial team of the leading industry publication wrote in announcing the award today. \"Its transformation is still a work in progress, but its achievements so far deserve recognition.\"</p><p>Deutsche Bank's \"compete to win\" strategy, announced in July last year, was to refocus on its core strengths, to do so within its own, existing capital resources, and to become sustainably profitable. It aimed to become more stable, innovative, trustworthy, excellent - and relevant, to its clients, to its investors, and to society as a whole.</p><p>\"Hard work pays off,\" said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer in a note to employees, thanking them for their \"passion and contribution\". \"Our transformation is gaining traction, not just in financial terms but also in tonality and recognition from all of the bank's stakeholders\", he said.</p><p>The bank set clear short-term and mid-term targets and accountabilities for financial and non-financial objectives through to 2022 and has achieved all of its major objectives since then.</p><p>It completed business exits, including cash equities trading and equity derivatives, agreed on the transfer of Global Prime Finance and has been reshaping businesses, including Rates. It has significantly reduced Risk Weighted Assets through the Capital Release Unit; is delivering significant cost reductions on target; and, despite the challenges of the coronavirus crisis, has maintained a strong capital ratio above the threshold.</p><p>Recent landmarks have included launching the International Private Bank; merging the German legal entities; reorganising DWS; integrating the Corporate Bank in Germany; and creating a holistic Chief Risk Office function.</p><p>\"Deutsche Bank is changing for the better,\" said Fabrizio Campelli, Management Board member and Chief Transformation Officer, who made the formal pitch for the award.</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals.

After the pandemic, we must focus on improving the health and wellbeing of the most vulnerable, and enhance the resilience of wherever they live, work or play. One example of this is promoting and incentivizing healthy lifestyles in order to cultivate a more resilient workforce. We have seen during the pandemic that people who already suffered from health problems have been hardest hit by COVID-19. So, improving the overall health of your workforce, for instance by providing free, healthful foods in the office or subsidizing gym memberships, will make your company better prepared to continue operating during a future pandemic.</p><p>Design Resilience can be enhanced by embracing new ways of designing and retrofitting buildings, facilities, and urban spaces in a post-pandemic world. No matter what type of business you run or work at, there's a good chance that the building space you use (whether office space, manufacturing facilities or R&amp;D labs) have had to undergo extensive changes to accommodate new safety and hygiene standards, aimed at curtailing the spread of the coronavirus. This has highlighted the fact that buildings that were designed to be easily adaptable can provide many advantages to a business. They contribute to making operations more resilient.</p><p>Planning Resilience thinking must be placed at the heart of business continuity planning. Collaboration must also be embraced, between communities, organizations, industry sectors and supply chains. Many companies out there had to shut down, not because their workforces had become infected with COVID-19 nor because the virus was widespread within the communities within which they operated. No, in fact, those companies had to discontinue operations because outbreaks in other parts of the world cut off their sources of critical supplies. As these, and all other companies, recovery from the pandemic, they should develop more comprehensive and inclusive stakeholder engagement plans that extend through multiple tiers of their supply chains. Companies should conduct a global supply chain analysis, which includes supplier evaluations and site assessments, in order to develop a proper assessment of the risks. This should also include a masterplan assessment of production sites, as well as a determination of the potential costs and benefits of both reshoring and adopting multi-siting approaches. This will generate a clearer understanding of vulnerabilities and point to steps companies can take to ensure constant access to critical supplies, no matter what happens.</p><p>Digital Digital tools and platforms are essential for gathering and analyzing data, which can inform smart decisions that can ensure business continuity and lead to competitive advantage. Perhaps more than anything, the pandemic has vividly demonstrated the utility of digital ways of working. Going forward, where possible, all organizations should accelerate the adoption of digital tools to manage facilities, assets, health and safety and supply chains. Additionally, the use of digital platforms helps generate data and insights that can be leveraged for competitive advantage.</p><p>Sustainability Resilience and sustainability go hand-in-hand. By implementing projects that improve sustainability performance, reducing resource consumption and protecting the environment, organizations enhance long-term resilience. For instance, an expedited, global transition to clean, renewable energy is a laudable sustainability goal, but COVID-19 has shown us that this would also make people, organizations, and society more resilient to pandemics. Air pollution from fossil fuels kills roughly seven million people each year and damages the airways of countless others. This creates so-called underlying conditions that exacerbate the negative consequences of contracting the coronavirus or other communicable diseases. So, reducing global air pollution by switching to more sustainable sources of energy will enhance resilience and also will help reduce our collective carbon footprint.</p><p>These are just a handful of examples of how a focus on these five means of enhancing resilience can help organizations do a better job of coping with pandemics or whatever else the future may hold. Arcadis experts have developed much more advice along these lines and it is available to you in a series of white papers we have produced as part of our Post-pandemic Resilience campaign. I hope you will take the time to explore these recommendations and learn about concrete steps you and your business can take to get better prepared for the future.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 EC HARRIS LLP PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2019</p><p>SECTION 5 OTHER NEWS: 2019</p><p>SECTION 6 EC HARRIS LLP TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 EC HARRIS LLP PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>PermID: 4297202436</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.echarris.com\">http://www.echarris.com</url></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>January 21: EC Harris LLP: Arcadis Acquires Over Morgen, a Dutch Consultancy</p><p>Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announces that it acquired Over Morgen, a fast-growing Dutch consultancy company with 80 employees focusing on solving various societal challenges by creating sustainable societies through an integrated approach that combines area development and energy transition.

And most Canadians expect mobile check-ins to perform a lot of the leg work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over 50 per cent of Canadian business travellers, in a recent survey of 200 Canadian business travellers by SAP Concur, say that mobile check-ins will be the most important mobile app features when travel resumes. For the same question, only 41 per cent of respondents globally felt the same way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When travel starts, 24 per cent Canadian business travellers say they're most likely to start their booking with online travel agencies, while 22 per cent say they will book directly with an airline or hotel website/app. Comparatively, only 18 per cent expect to first use their company's travel booking tool or go to their company's travel agency, and 17 per cent expect to use internet search engines.</p><p>Most of those surveyed said that they expect their company to experience negative outcomes due to travel restrictions around COVID-19, with 51 per cent noting it will result in a reduced number of deals or contracts signed that require in-person interactions and 44 per cent saying it would lead to declines in new business wins that require in-person meetings.</p><p>\"Our research shows that travel will continue to play an irreplaceable role in meeting critical business demands. However, travellers' health and safety, and a new era of trip preparation and policies, will be front and centre as travel resumes. Emerging expectations around personal and community health and safety will mean a new era of decisions, processes, and innovations across the travel industry,\" Victoria DeBoon, director of sales at SAP Concur Canada, told IT World Canada in an interview.</p><p>The majority of business travellers around the world have usually been most stressed before and after their trip. But, there has been a shift as a result of the pandemic. DeBoon says the trip itself is now the most stressful stage of travel. The situation is the same for most companies as they face more pressure than ever to ensure safety for their employees while embarking on business trips. As a result, nearly all Canadian business travellers (95 per cent) say they expect a \"new normal\" with changing norms and practices.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>hybris GmbH operates as a vendor of multi-channel communication and commerce software solutions.

Revenue: $1.06 billion, vs. $1.04 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>Revenue increased by about 20% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. Growth was down from 23% one quarter earlier.</p><p>Workday, whose software is used for financial management and human resources, said it now expects $3.73 billion to $3.74 billion in subscription revenue in fiscal 2021, up from a forecast in May of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Workday said it's seeing growth among companies that need help navigating Covid-19, keeping them engaged with employees who are working remotely. It's also partnered with IBM to help companies prepare their workplaces for a safe return as offices start to reopen.</p><p>In naming Fernandez as co-CEO, Workday is returning to a dual leadership structure it had at the time of its 2012 IPO, when Bhusri shared the role with co-founder Dave Duffield. Bhusri became sole CEO, when Duffield stepped down in 2014 and assumed the chairman role. Workday is going in the opposite direction of Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, which have recently switched from having two CEOs to having just one.</p><p>Fernandez joined Workday in 2014 from SAP, where he had been a senior vice president. In his new role he will run the company's sales, marketing and customer support.</p><p>Two likeminded CEOs are better than one, Bhusri said on a conference call with analysts.</p><p>\"I'm more of a product person and strategy person, and I personally would like to get back to working with our product teams and our venture teams and our strategy teams on where we go in the future,\" he said.</p><p>July 15: hybris GmbH: Wirecard Boasted of Hundreds of Partnerships.

Staffing firms currently participating in the marketplace include majors like Adecco; Experis, a ManpowerGroup brand; Guidant Global and its staffing affiliates S.com, Corestaff and SRG; KellyOCG; and Randstad US.</p><p>Spend Matters spoke with the SAP Fieldglass team, which said the solution was conceived months ago when it was understood that while demand for workers in some sectors had sharply declined, demand in other sectors - like healthcare, pharma and some manufacturing, retail and technology - was surging. Companies in these and other verticals were looking for workers, but finding them was very challenging. There was a fundamental disconnect between supply and demand. The External Talent Marketplace was created to help bridge this gap.</p><p>SAP Fieldglass said that, depending on the state of the coronavirus pandemic and the uptake by organizations and staffing firms, access to the Marketplace could be extended.</p><p>The External Talent Marketplace enables companies to search for available temporary workers from multiple staffing firms, create job postings from scratch or using templates, and automatically send job postings to staffing firms to speed up sourcing.</p><p>July 10: hybris GmbH: Clariba partners with SAP clients for intelligent enterprise</p><p>At its recent user conference, SAP made a case for its vision of the intelligent enterprise, but the concept still lacks clarity for many customers.</p><p>SAP defines the intelligent enterprise as a digital transformation, or the digitizing of existing processes and business models to enable the new processes and systems. The overhaul emphasizes analytics, data-driven decision-making and cloud-based technologies, and it enables companies to develop business models that monetize data in new ways.</p><p>For companies to undertake such a transformation, SAP will need help from its partners, said Marc Haberland, founder and managing director at Clariba, an SAP partner. Clariba has engaged in its own digital transformation and now develops applications and methods for SAP customers to do the same.</p><p>Clariba, based in Barcelona and Dubai, is a 20-year-old firm that started out as a consultancy for BusinessObjects, business intelligence platform technology that SAP acquired in 2007. In addition, Clariba is focused on SAP's vision of an intelligent enterprise and is developing data-driven intelligent enterprise applications, including one currently being used by the Italian National Football Federation.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 28: hybris GmbH: Covid Testing in the Workplace Is Tricky. Here's What Experts Recommend</p><p>As you and your employees return to the office, you may be considering whether to adopt Covid-19 testing or mandatory temperature checks and health surveys. Tread lightly--especially if you're planning to require Covid-19 testing. Businesses must comply with a raft of health regulations and protect employee privacy.</p><p>In April, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Department of Labor authorized the practice of collecting medical information such as taking temperatures. The government also approved conducting Covid-19 tests in the workplace, which employers typically couldn't do. \"I think there is a general need to know that the person walking into your facility does not have a fever currently,\" says Erin McLaughlin, labor and employment attorney at Pittsburgh-based law firm Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney. Testing in general, she says, and keeping track that employees who are coming into the workplace are healthy may give your business a layer of liability protection in case someone does get sick.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: U.S. big tech dominates stock market after monster rally, leaving investors on edge</p><p>U.S. technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off.

This is especially true of CFOs, who are managing tighter budgets and seeking new solutions that better control company spend and catch financial errors. These CFOs are on the hunt for tools that can adjust to the unique problems of home offices and hybrid working models and ongoing risk assessment.</p><p>But selecting a new solution is only half the battle. Orchestrating a tech overhaul - or even just adding a new tool to the mix - can be daunting and, without the right process, lead to low adoption levels across an organization. While typically a tech project, IT departments are more strapped than ever. According to a survey, global IT leaders' top concerns right now are network connectivity and security.</p><p>Thus, the job falls to finance. CFOs may find themselves asked to spearhead new technology adoptions, which can provide tremendous value for their company with the right approach. These tips can help put CFOs on the right track toward a successful implementation:</p><p>Find the right tool. When selecting a tool, prioritize technological advancements that provide more control and drive better compliance.</p><p>August 22: hybris GmbH: SAP's Dan Lahl Looks Back at SAP HANA's First Decade</p><p>Earlier this year marked the tenth anniversary of the release of SAP HANA, the software company's database management system. SAP HANA has been vital to the innovations of SAP software over the past decade, and instrumental to a lot of the software company's success.</p><p>ASUG recently sat down with Dan Lahl, global vice president of product marketing at SAP, to talk about the legacy of SAP HANA. The conversation also focused on what made the platform a success, and how it's still evolving.</p><p>Jim: SAP HANA just celebrated its tenth birthday. What were some of the highlights from SAP HANA's first decade? Dan Lahl, Global Vice President of Product Marketing, SAP</p><p>Dan: What SAP HANA has been able to accomplish is amazing. SAP HANA has the ability to establish in-memory column databases that provide the unique ability to do transactions and analytics in the same instance and at the same time. Historically, you would capture transactions in one database and then extract that information out of the database into a data warehouse. Then, you had to reorganize that information into a data warehousing storage format before analyzing it. For stock trading, dynamic telecommunications network management, or fast-moving stock items across thousands of retail point-of-sale devices-this is just not feasible to optimally run your business.</p><p>August 21: hybris GmbH: How the UK Post Office has delivered first class CX as COVID puts its stamp on operational needs</p><p>Post Office Ltd is a retail post office company in the UK that offers a wide range of products from postage stamps through broadband services to banking, delivered via a nationwide network of post office branches. It was founded in 1986 as a state-owned private company out of what used to be known as Post Office Counters.</p><p>In recent years the firm has struggled with losses and most recently was at the center of a major political row involving an abortive IT project, Horizon. And of course, this year, in common with every organization across every business sector, the COVID-19 crisis has brought fresh challenges. As James Scutt, Head of Customer Experience Strategy and Deployment, told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event:</p><p>I've worked for the Post Office for about 15 years now and during that time I've seen so many changes take place, but none as big as the changes we made during COVID-19, and certainly those changes weren't made as fast as well.</p><p>The importance of the Post Office as part of the UK landscape cannot be understated. In the UK, there are over 11,500 branches with an estimated 99.7% of the country's population living within 3 miles of one. Today, the firm offers more than 170 different products and services.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: 3 Actionable Insights with SAP global CMO Alicia Tillman</p><p>What does it take for a global B2B brand to succeed today? SAP's Alicia Tillman, who was named by Forbes as one of the most influential CMOs in the world, shares her actionable insights that will help marketers lead the way forward during this moment and beyond.</p><p>Multinational enterprise software company SAP was founded 48 years ago with a purpose of helping the world run better and to improve people's lives. As businesses struggle with the daily challenges of the ongoing pandemic, those objectives need to be met more than ever. Global chief marketer Alicia Tillman, who has grown SAP's brand value has grown to more than $18bn during her tenure, takes time out to talk to The Drum about how marketers must evolve to meet clients' needs. Here are the three top actions that Tillman recommends:</p><p>1. Maintain a daily, global perspective about your customers' needs.</p><p>\"Know what's going on outside of the walls of your company. Even though we are all experiencing a global pandemic, the effect of it is different by geography and region, and it evolves by the day. Understand the effect it has on the customer you serve. And then know what you have in your company that can best serve them - how it's valuable and how you position it effectively so they know you're there to help, how you can help and what they need to do to be able to embrace your help.\"</p><p>2.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: Heres What It Takes To Be a Supply Chain Leader in 2020</p><p>A recent study by SAP and Oxford Economics found that 12% of the top 1,000 supply chain performers proved to have more resilient supply chains. In this article, Richard Howells, vice president of solution management for SAP Digital Supply Chain, dives into these characteristics that led companies to become supply chain leaders.</p><p>At the start of 2020, when experts were talking about \"Vision 2020\", nobody predicted that we were entering a global pandemic that would bring the global economy to a virtual standstill within weeks. With the pandemic, came a highly variable demand for goods and services; an uncertain supply of critical Materials; constrained labor and resource capacity in manufacturing and logistics. All these factors, along with many others, resulted in reduced revenue, profits, and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Supply chains have been brought to the forefront and are now a regular discussion in presidential briefings, executive board rooms, and dining room tables. One thing is for sure - unexpected disruptions that adversely affect supply chains will continue to occur. The causes of disruptions will vary from pandemics or geopolitical or trade conflicts to natural disasters or the limited availability of natural resources.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: How Southwest Airlines helps employees to be the face of the brand, even behind a mask</p><p>Among the sectors most dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, the travel industry has been one of those hit most hard - and Southwest Airlines has been no exception. As Laurie Winters, Senior Director of Culture and Engagement at the airline told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event, this has led to a need to re-think how the firm operates:</p><p>With the unprecedentedly low load factors on our flights, coupled with the absolute unpredictability of the virus, we needed to adjust very quickly. Many of our customers needed us to fulfil our purpose to connect them to what's important in their lives. After all, people needed to return home to care for loved ones and travel to temporary medical assignments.</p><p>One manifestation of how the airline has responded is with its Southwest Promise, published in May to promote the measures taken to keep passengers safe, including personal protection and wellness, disinfection and cleaning regimes onboard planes and in airports and measures to support social distancing, such as limiting passenger numbers, changing boarding and deplaning routines and using mobile boarding passes on smartphones.</p><p>But there's another vital constituency, Winters reminded the Qualtrics audience, that of the Southwest Airlines employee base:</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: Tech IPOs brush aside election concerns as investors seek growth</p><p>In most presidential election years, conventional wisdom says the IPO window closes by mid-summer so that companies avoid the shadow of the November contest, a time when markets can be jittery.</p><p>That convention doesn't apply this year. The country is mired in the worst pandemic in a century and suffered its steepest-ever quarterly plunge in economic activity in the second quarter. Yet the equity markets are rallying, and tech stocks are trading at historical premiums.</p><p>In polls, Democratic candidate Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over President Donald Trump. Wall Street may like Trump, but it's OK with Biden, who was vice president during much of the bull market, which started shortly after Barack Obama took office in 2009.</p><p>For high-growth software companies eyeing the public market, that means talks with bankers are quickly ramping up.</p><p>\"We could find ourselves in a very strong second half here as we go into the elections,\" said Jackie Kelley, Americas IPO and strategic transactions leader at Ernst &amp; Young.</p><p>\"We're already seeing increased IPO activity over the last couple weeks. As long as markets stay stable, I think we have good runway to get a significant amount of this backlog out into the markets.\"</p><p>In particular, investors are thirsty for resilient business models that have shown elements of being Covid-proof.</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: HPE, SAP to deliver SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake</p><p>HPE and SAP on Thursday said they're partnering up to deliver the customer edition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake, HPE's h, its as-a-service platform.

HPE will supply, install and manage the infrastructure for the new offering -- including compute, storage and networking technologies that are certified and pre-configured for SAP software.</p><p>SAP, for its part, will deliver white-glove operations and application management services.</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: How Brakes bridged the B2B/ B2C gap to feed a nation</p><p>When COVID-19 forced the closure of schools, pubs, restaurants and hotels, Brakes knew it had to pivot its core business strategy.</p><p>Brakes is a B2B food delivery service and leading supplier to the food service sector in the UK.

For many companies, the scope for international reach has moved from a dream to a realistic and tangible reality-at least since they have had access to technology and logistics to aid this process. The business an organization secures is no longer limited by borders.</p><p>However, this seamless access has opened the door to some less pleasant realities of international trade. The more data businesses are generating, the more complex the analysis landscape becomes. How are finance teams expected to cope with these new volumes of information? Moving out of home territory and into unknown government trading law is an underlying issue firms often overlook. The fact is, in each government jurisdiction the tax transactions taking place and regulations around this are an ever-shifting minefield of compliance complexity.</p><p>Misunderstandings are costly in business, that much is true. For multinational businesses, there can be some serious missed opportunities where finance teams are not fully acquainted with the detail of tax law or are too time-poor to dedicate hours to unraveling complex value-added tax (VAT) regulation.</p><p>July 13: hybris GmbH: Australia Post road tests its transformation scope with staff first</p><p>Australia Post used SAP Qualtrics to source ideas and scope internal sentiment towards its current business transformation.</p><p>Executive general manager for transformation and enablement, John Cox, told SAP's HR Connect conference that AusPost is also using Qualtrics to manage employee fatigue after a challenging first half of the year.</p><p>Cox said AusPost is a \"big user\" of Qualtrics, which became part of SAP in early 2019.</p><p>\"It's really important to understand the state that our teams are in [and] how they're feeling,\" he said.</p><p>Cox was recently elevated from CIO to his current transformation role, and said AusPost used Qualtrics to scope the extent of its transformation efforts as well as to measure internal attitudes towards change.</p><p>\"I've recently just come into this role and one of the key things we did was understand how our people were feeling, how they felt about transforming the company, what their involvement would be, how much they were willing to change, and what they thought we should change,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's been a really valuable set of insights that are helping guide us where we want to go.\"</p><p>Outside of the transformation effort, Cox highlighted the pressure AusPost staff are under generally, handling huge increases in parcel volumes and service experience expectations of customers.</p><p>PermID: 4296929582</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2908201228493787000147580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PM-J2P1-JB4F-Y381-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

This is especially true of CFOs, who are managing tighter budgets and seeking new solutions that better control company spend and catch financial errors. These CFOs are on the hunt for tools that can adjust to the unique problems of home offices and hybrid working models and ongoing risk assessment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But selecting a new solution is only half the battle. Orchestrating a tech overhaul - or even just adding a new tool to the mix - can be daunting and, without the right process, lead to low adoption levels across an organization. While typically a tech project, IT departments are more strapped than ever. According to a survey, global IT leaders' top concerns right now are network connectivity and security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thus, the job falls to finance. CFOs may find themselves asked to spearhead new technology adoptions, which can provide tremendous value for their company with the right approach. These tips can help put CFOs on the right track toward a successful implementation:</p><p>Find the right tool. When selecting a tool, prioritize technological advancements that provide more control and drive better compliance. Cloud solutions integrate with financial systems and typically offer a mobile component, which simplifies the collection and organization of data across an organization. They also reduce financial errors by minimizing the need for paper receipts or signed documents, which require manual processing. Another consideration is solutions that are powered by machine learning and can automatically populate and categorize expense reports, providing visibility into discretionary spending as it happens and offering near real-time budget control. Better expense solutions can increase employee productivity and satisfaction, according to a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of SAP Concur. Build a team. Organize a v-team or a subgroup that will be responsible for driving the initiative forward. Involve representatives from multiple departments and from different levels to weigh in for their areas of expertise and better identify challenges to shape strategies and drive results. This can be challenging with employees working from home, so take advantage of the next virtual staff meeting to source volunteers. The most successful teams are comprised of individuals who are key end users and share the same goals.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>hybris GmbH operates as a vendor of multi-channel communication and commerce software solutions.

Revenue: $1.06 billion, vs. $1.04 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>Revenue increased by about 20% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. Growth was down from 23% one quarter earlier.</p><p>Workday, whose software is used for financial management and human resources, said it now expects $3.73 billion to $3.74 billion in subscription revenue in fiscal 2021, up from a forecast in May of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Workday said it's seeing growth among companies that need help navigating Covid-19, keeping them engaged with employees who are working remotely. It's also partnered with IBM to help companies prepare their workplaces for a safe return as offices start to reopen.</p><p>In naming Fernandez as co-CEO, Workday is returning to a dual leadership structure it had at the time of its 2012 IPO, when Bhusri shared the role with co-founder Dave Duffield. Bhusri became sole CEO, when Duffield stepped down in 2014 and assumed the chairman role. Workday is going in the opposite direction of Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, which have recently switched from having two CEOs to having just one.</p><p>Fernandez joined Workday in 2014 from SAP, where he had been a senior vice president. In his new role he will run the company's sales, marketing and customer support.</p><p>Two likeminded CEOs are better than one, Bhusri said on a conference call with analysts.</p><p>\"I'm more of a product person and strategy person, and I personally would like to get back to working with our product teams and our venture teams and our strategy teams on where we go in the future,\" he said.</p><p>July 15: hybris GmbH: Wirecard Boasted of Hundreds of Partnerships. Some Were Less Than Meets the Eye.</p><p>Before it unraveled in an accounting scandal, Wirecard AG built up an image as a fast-growing financial technology company. It spewed out news releases publicizing partnerships with blue-chip names such as SAP SE, Zurich Insurance Group and SoftBank Group Corp.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal found that some of those partnership announcements were misleading or were promoted without the agreement of the companies involved. The Journal reached out to more than 300 companies with which Wirecard said it had entered partnerships or collaborations.</p><p>.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: hybris GmbH: SAP Fieldglass launches free External Talent Marketplace in response to coronavirus, labor market changes</p><p>SAP Fieldglass, a leading global external workforce and services management solution, this week announced the launch of its External Talent Marketplace.</p><p>The offering, which is free to use in the U.S. for a limited time, is intended to address a supply-and-demand gap in today's arguably much more dynamic business environment that's affected by the coronavirus disruption and job losses, and it provides a win-win solution for U.S. hiring organizations and staffing firms. The free offer, which expires Dec. 31, 2020, is available online to organizations that do not use SAP Fieldglass' core solutions.</p><p>According to the announcement, SAP Fieldglass External Talent Marketplace provides a single, central place where businesses looking for temporary workers and staffing firms with vetted candidates can find each other to more quickly fill open jobs. Staffing firms currently participating in the marketplace include majors like Adecco; Experis, a ManpowerGroup brand; Guidant Global and its staffing affiliates S.com, Corestaff and SRG; KellyOCG; and Randstad US.</p><p>Spend Matters spoke with the SAP Fieldglass team, which said the solution was conceived months ago when it was understood that while demand for workers in some sectors had sharply declined, demand in other sectors - like healthcare, pharma and some manufacturing, retail and technology - was surging. Companies in these and other verticals were looking for workers, but finding them was very challenging. There was a fundamental disconnect between supply and demand. The External Talent Marketplace was created to help bridge this gap.</p><p>SAP Fieldglass said that, depending on the state of the coronavirus pandemic and the uptake by organizations and staffing firms, access to the Marketplace could be extended.</p><p>The External Talent Marketplace enables companies to search for available temporary workers from multiple staffing firms, create job postings from scratch or using templates, and automatically send job postings to staffing firms to speed up sourcing.</p><p>July 10: hybris GmbH: Clariba partners with SAP clients for intelligent enterprise</p><p>At its recent user conference, SAP made a case for its vision of the intelligent enterprise, but the concept still lacks clarity for many customers.</p><p>SAP defines the intelligent enterprise as a digital transformation, or the digitizing of existing processes and business models to enable the new processes and systems. The overhaul emphasizes analytics, data-driven decision-making and cloud-based technologies, and it enables companies to develop business models that monetize data in new ways.</p><p>For companies to undertake such a transformation, SAP will need help from its partners, said Marc Haberland, founder and managing director at Clariba, an SAP partner. Clariba has engaged in its own digital transformation and now develops applications and methods for SAP customers to do the same.</p><p>Clariba, based in Barcelona and Dubai, is a 20-year-old firm that started out as a consultancy for BusinessObjects, business intelligence platform technology that SAP acquired in 2007. In addition, Clariba is focused on SAP's vision of an intelligent enterprise and is developing data-driven intelligent enterprise applications, including one currently being used by the Italian National Football Federation.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 28: hybris GmbH: Covid Testing in the Workplace Is Tricky. Here's What Experts Recommend</p><p>As you and your employees return to the office, you may be considering whether to adopt Covid-19 testing or mandatory temperature checks and health surveys. Tread lightly--especially if you're planning to require Covid-19 testing. Businesses must comply with a raft of health regulations and protect employee privacy.</p><p>In April, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Department of Labor authorized the practice of collecting medical information such as taking temperatures. The government also approved conducting Covid-19 tests in the workplace, which employers typically couldn't do. \"I think there is a general need to know that the person walking into your facility does not have a fever currently,\" says Erin McLaughlin, labor and employment attorney at Pittsburgh-based law firm Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney. Testing in general, she says, and keeping track that employees who are coming into the workplace are healthy may give your business a layer of liability protection in case someone does get sick.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: Canadian business travellers view mobile check-ins as most important feature for future travel</p><p>More than half of Canadian business travellers say they have positive feelings about travelling again once COVID restrictions are lifted, provided there is effective tech in place to help them travel for business safely. And most Canadians expect mobile check-ins to perform a lot of the leg work.</p><p>Over 50 per cent of Canadian business travellers, in a recent survey of 200 Canadian business travellers by SAP Concur, say that mobile check-ins will be the most important mobile app features when travel resumes. For the same question, only 41 per cent of respondents globally felt the same way.</p><p>When travel starts, 24 per cent Canadian business travellers say they're most likely to start their booking with online travel agencies, while 22 per cent say they will book directly with an airline or hotel website/app. Comparatively, only 18 per cent expect to first use their company's travel booking tool or go to their company's travel agency, and 17 per cent expect to use internet search engines.</p><p>Most of those surveyed said that they expect their company to experience negative outcomes due to travel restrictions around COVID-19, with 51 per cent noting it will result in a reduced number of deals or contracts signed that require in-person interactions and 44 per cent saying it would lead to declines in new business wins that require in-person meetings.</p><p>\"Our research shows that travel will continue to play an irreplaceable role in meeting critical business demands.</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: U.S. big tech dominates stock market after monster rally, leaving investors on edge</p><p>U.S. technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off. FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</p><p>The combined value of the S&amp;P 500's five biggest companies - Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) - now stands at more than $7 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the index's market capitalization. That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.</p><p>The quintet's burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.</p><p>Yet the companies are drawing opposition. U.S. lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.</p><p>Some investors worry the companies powering this year's equity rally could become the market's Achilles' heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.</p><p>\"People see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.</p><p>August 22: hybris GmbH: SAP's Dan Lahl Looks Back at SAP HANA's First Decade</p><p>Earlier this year marked the tenth anniversary of the release of SAP HANA, the software company's database management system. SAP HANA has been vital to the innovations of SAP software over the past decade, and instrumental to a lot of the software company's success.</p><p>ASUG recently sat down with Dan Lahl, global vice president of product marketing at SAP, to talk about the legacy of SAP HANA. The conversation also focused on what made the platform a success, and how it's still evolving.</p><p>Jim: SAP HANA just celebrated its tenth birthday. What were some of the highlights from SAP HANA's first decade? Dan Lahl, Global Vice President of Product Marketing, SAP</p><p>Dan: What SAP HANA has been able to accomplish is amazing. SAP HANA has the ability to establish in-memory column databases that provide the unique ability to do transactions and analytics in the same instance and at the same time. Historically, you would capture transactions in one database and then extract that information out of the database into a data warehouse. Then, you had to reorganize that information into a data warehousing storage format before analyzing it. For stock trading, dynamic telecommunications network management, or fast-moving stock items across thousands of retail point-of-sale devices-this is just not feasible to optimally run your business.</p><p>August 21: hybris GmbH: How the UK Post Office has delivered first class CX as COVID puts its stamp on operational needs</p><p>Post Office Ltd is a retail post office company in the UK that offers a wide range of products from postage stamps through broadband services to banking, delivered via a nationwide network of post office branches. It was founded in 1986 as a state-owned private company out of what used to be known as Post Office Counters.</p><p>In recent years the firm has struggled with losses and most recently was at the center of a major political row involving an abortive IT project, Horizon. And of course, this year, in common with every organization across every business sector, the COVID-19 crisis has brought fresh challenges. As James Scutt, Head of Customer Experience Strategy and Deployment, told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event:</p><p>I've worked for the Post Office for about 15 years now and during that time I've seen so many changes take place, but none as big as the changes we made during COVID-19, and certainly those changes weren't made as fast as well.</p><p>The importance of the Post Office as part of the UK landscape cannot be understated. In the UK, there are over 11,500 branches with an estimated 99.7% of the country's population living within 3 miles of one. Today, the firm offers more than 170 different products and services.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: 3 Actionable Insights with SAP global CMO Alicia Tillman</p><p>What does it take for a global B2B brand to succeed today? SAP's Alicia Tillman, who was named by Forbes as one of the most influential CMOs in the world, shares her actionable insights that will help marketers lead the way forward during this moment and beyond.</p><p>Multinational enterprise software company SAP was founded 48 years ago with a purpose of helping the world run better and to improve people's lives. As businesses struggle with the daily challenges of the ongoing pandemic, those objectives need to be met more than ever. Global chief marketer Alicia Tillman, who has grown SAP's brand value has grown to more than $18bn during her tenure, takes time out to talk to The Drum about how marketers must evolve to meet clients' needs. Here are the three top actions that Tillman recommends:</p><p>1. Maintain a daily, global perspective about your customers' needs.</p><p>\"Know what's going on outside of the walls of your company. Even though we are all experiencing a global pandemic, the effect of it is different by geography and region, and it evolves by the day. Understand the effect it has on the customer you serve. And then know what you have in your company that can best serve them - how it's valuable and how you position it effectively so they know you're there to help, how you can help and what they need to do to be able to embrace your help.\"</p><p>2.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: Heres What It Takes To Be a Supply Chain Leader in 2020</p><p>A recent study by SAP and Oxford Economics found that 12% of the top 1,000 supply chain performers proved to have more resilient supply chains. In this article, Richard Howells, vice president of solution management for SAP Digital Supply Chain, dives into these characteristics that led companies to become supply chain leaders.</p><p>At the start of 2020, when experts were talking about \"Vision 2020\", nobody predicted that we were entering a global pandemic that would bring the global economy to a virtual standstill within weeks. With the pandemic, came a highly variable demand for goods and services; an uncertain supply of critical Materials; constrained labor and resource capacity in manufacturing and logistics. All these factors, along with many others, resulted in reduced revenue, profits, and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Supply chains have been brought to the forefront and are now a regular discussion in presidential briefings, executive board rooms, and dining room tables. One thing is for sure - unexpected disruptions that adversely affect supply chains will continue to occur. The causes of disruptions will vary from pandemics or geopolitical or trade conflicts to natural disasters or the limited availability of natural resources.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: How Southwest Airlines helps employees to be the face of the brand, even behind a mask</p><p>Among the sectors most dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, the travel industry has been one of those hit most hard - and Southwest Airlines has been no exception. As Laurie Winters, Senior Director of Culture and Engagement at the airline told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event, this has led to a need to re-think how the firm operates:</p><p>With the unprecedentedly low load factors on our flights, coupled with the absolute unpredictability of the virus, we needed to adjust very quickly.

Revenue: $1.06 billion, vs. $1.04 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>Revenue increased by about 20% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. Growth was down from 23% one quarter earlier.</p><p>Workday, whose software is used for financial management and human resources, said it now expects $3.73 billion to $3.74 billion in subscription revenue in fiscal 2021, up from a forecast in May of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Workday said it's seeing growth among companies that need help navigating Covid-19, keeping them engaged with employees who are working remotely. It's also partnered with IBM to help companies prepare their workplaces for a safe return as offices start to reopen.</p><p>In naming Fernandez as co-CEO, Workday is returning to a dual leadership structure it had at the time of its 2012 IPO, when Bhusri shared the role with co-founder Dave Duffield. Bhusri became sole CEO, when Duffield stepped down in 2014 and assumed the chairman role. Workday is going in the opposite direction of Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, which have recently switched from having two CEOs to having just one.</p><p>Fernandez joined Workday in 2014 from SAP, where he had been a senior vice president. In his new role he will run the company's sales, marketing and customer support.</p><p>Two likeminded CEOs are better than one, Bhusri said on a conference call with analysts.</p><p>\"I'm more of a product person and strategy person, and I personally would like to get back to working with our product teams and our venture teams and our strategy teams on where we go in the future,\" he said.</p><p>July 15: hybris GmbH: Wirecard Boasted of Hundreds of Partnerships.

The free offer, which expires Dec. 31, 2020, is available online to organizations that do not use SAP Fieldglass' core solutions.</p><p>According to the announcement, SAP Fieldglass External Talent Marketplace provides a single, central place where businesses looking for temporary workers and staffing firms with vetted candidates can find each other to more quickly fill open jobs. Staffing firms currently participating in the marketplace include majors like Adecco; Experis, a ManpowerGroup brand; Guidant Global and its staffing affiliates S.com, Corestaff and SRG; KellyOCG; and Randstad US.</p><p>Spend Matters spoke with the SAP Fieldglass team, which said the solution was conceived months ago when it was understood that while demand for workers in some sectors had sharply declined, demand in other sectors - like healthcare, pharma and some manufacturing, retail and technology - was surging. Companies in these and other verticals were looking for workers, but finding them was very challenging. There was a fundamental disconnect between supply and demand. The External Talent Marketplace was created to help bridge this gap.</p><p>SAP Fieldglass said that, depending on the state of the coronavirus pandemic and the uptake by organizations and staffing firms, access to the Marketplace could be extended.</p><p>The External Talent Marketplace enables companies to search for available temporary workers from multiple staffing firms, create job postings from scratch or using templates, and automatically send job postings to staffing firms to speed up sourcing.</p><p>July 10: hybris GmbH: Clariba partners with SAP clients for intelligent enterprise</p><p>At its recent user conference, SAP made a case for its vision of the intelligent enterprise, but the concept still lacks clarity for many customers.</p><p>SAP defines the intelligent enterprise as a digital transformation, or the digitizing of existing processes and business models to enable the new processes and systems. The overhaul emphasizes analytics, data-driven decision-making and cloud-based technologies, and it enables companies to develop business models that monetize data in new ways.</p><p>For companies to undertake such a transformation, SAP will need help from its partners, said Marc Haberland, founder and managing director at Clariba, an SAP partner.

Here's What Experts Recommend</p><p>As you and your employees return to the office, you may be considering whether to adopt Covid-19 testing or mandatory temperature checks and health surveys. Tread lightly--especially if you're planning to require Covid-19 testing. Businesses must comply with a raft of health regulations and protect employee privacy.</p><p>In April, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Department of Labor authorized the practice of collecting medical information such as taking temperatures. The government also approved conducting Covid-19 tests in the workplace, which employers typically couldn't do. \"I think there is a general need to know that the person walking into your facility does not have a fever currently,\" says Erin McLaughlin, labor and employment attorney at Pittsburgh-based law firm Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney.

And most Canadians expect mobile check-ins to perform a lot of the leg work.</p><p>Over 50 per cent of Canadian business travellers, in a recent survey of 200 Canadian business travellers by SAP Concur, say that mobile check-ins will be the most important mobile app features when travel resumes. For the same question, only 41 per cent of respondents globally felt the same way.</p><p>When travel starts, 24 per cent Canadian business travellers say they're most likely to start their booking with online travel agencies, while 22 per cent say they will book directly with an airline or hotel website/app. Comparatively, only 18 per cent expect to first use their company's travel booking tool or go to their company's travel agency, and 17 per cent expect to use internet search engines.</p><p>Most of those surveyed said that they expect their company to experience negative outcomes due to travel restrictions around COVID-19, with 51 per cent noting it will result in a reduced number of deals or contracts signed that require in-person interactions and 44 per cent saying it would lead to declines in new business wins that require in-person meetings.</p><p>\"Our research shows that travel will continue to play an irreplaceable role in meeting critical business demands.</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: Managing Digital Transformation Amid New Working Models</p><p>Many businesses continue to invest in digital transformation initiatives as they recognize deficiencies and address emerging needs in their IT infrastructure during this time. This is especially true of CFOs, who are managing tighter budgets and seeking new solutions that better control company spend and catch financial errors. These CFOs are on the hunt for tools that can adjust to the unique problems of home offices and hybrid working models and ongoing risk assessment.</p><p>But selecting a new solution is only half the battle. Orchestrating a tech overhaul - or even just adding a new tool to the mix - can be daunting and, without the right process, lead to low adoption levels across an organization. While typically a tech project, IT departments are more strapped than ever. According to a survey, global IT leaders' top concerns right now are network connectivity and security.</p><p>Thus, the job falls to finance. CFOs may find themselves asked to spearhead new technology adoptions, which can provide tremendous value for their company with the right approach.

SAP HANA has been vital to the innovations of SAP software over the past decade, and instrumental to a lot of the software company's success.</p><p>ASUG recently sat down with Dan Lahl, global vice president of product marketing at SAP, to talk about the legacy of SAP HANA. The conversation also focused on what made the platform a success, and how it's still evolving.</p><p>Jim: SAP HANA just celebrated its tenth birthday. What were some of the highlights from SAP HANA's first decade? Dan Lahl, Global Vice President of Product Marketing, SAP</p><p>Dan: What SAP HANA has been able to accomplish is amazing. SAP HANA has the ability to establish in-memory column databases that provide the unique ability to do transactions and analytics in the same instance and at the same time. Historically, you would capture transactions in one database and then extract that information out of the database into a data warehouse. Then, you had to reorganize that information into a data warehousing storage format before analyzing it. For stock trading, dynamic telecommunications network management, or fast-moving stock items across thousands of retail point-of-sale devices-this is just not feasible to optimally run your business.</p><p>August 21: hybris GmbH: How the UK Post Office has delivered first class CX as COVID puts its stamp on operational needs</p><p>Post Office Ltd is a retail post office company in the UK that offers a wide range of products from postage stamps through broadband services to banking, delivered via a nationwide network of post office branches. It was founded in 1986 as a state-owned private company out of what used to be known as Post Office Counters.</p><p>In recent years the firm has struggled with losses and most recently was at the center of a major political row involving an abortive IT project, Horizon. And of course, this year, in common with every organization across every business sector, the COVID-19 crisis has brought fresh challenges. As James Scutt, Head of Customer Experience Strategy and Deployment, told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event:</p><p>I've worked for the Post Office for about 15 years now and during that time I've seen so many changes take place, but none as big as the changes we made during COVID-19, and certainly those changes weren't made as fast as well.</p><p>The importance of the Post Office as part of the UK landscape cannot be understated. In the UK, there are over 11,500 branches with an estimated 99.7% of the country's population living within 3 miles of one.

SAP's Alicia Tillman, who was named by Forbes as one of the most influential CMOs in the world, shares her actionable insights that will help marketers lead the way forward during this moment and beyond.</p><p>Multinational enterprise software company SAP was founded 48 years ago with a purpose of helping the world run better and to improve people's lives. As businesses struggle with the daily challenges of the ongoing pandemic, those objectives need to be met more than ever. Global chief marketer Alicia Tillman, who has grown SAP's brand value has grown to more than $18bn during her tenure, takes time out to talk to The Drum about how marketers must evolve to meet clients' needs. Here are the three top actions that Tillman recommends:</p><p>1. Maintain a daily, global perspective about your customers' needs.</p><p>\"Know what's going on outside of the walls of your company. Even though we are all experiencing a global pandemic, the effect of it is different by geography and region, and it evolves by the day. Understand the effect it has on the customer you serve. And then know what you have in your company that can best serve them - how it's valuable and how you position it effectively so they know you're there to help, how you can help and what they need to do to be able to embrace your help.\"</p><p>2.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: Heres What It Takes To Be a Supply Chain Leader in 2020</p><p>A recent study by SAP and Oxford Economics found that 12% of the top 1,000 supply chain performers proved to have more resilient supply chains. In this article, Richard Howells, vice president of solution management for SAP Digital Supply Chain, dives into these characteristics that led companies to become supply chain leaders.</p><p>At the start of 2020, when experts were talking about \"Vision 2020\", nobody predicted that we were entering a global pandemic that would bring the global economy to a virtual standstill within weeks. With the pandemic, came a highly variable demand for goods and services; an uncertain supply of critical Materials; constrained labor and resource capacity in manufacturing and logistics. All these factors, along with many others, resulted in reduced revenue, profits, and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Supply chains have been brought to the forefront and are now a regular discussion in presidential briefings, executive board rooms, and dining room tables. One thing is for sure - unexpected disruptions that adversely affect supply chains will continue to occur. The causes of disruptions will vary from pandemics or geopolitical or trade conflicts to natural disasters or the limited availability of natural resources.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: How Southwest Airlines helps employees to be the face of the brand, even behind a mask</p><p>Among the sectors most dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, the travel industry has been one of those hit most hard - and Southwest Airlines has been no exception. As Laurie Winters, Senior Director of Culture and Engagement at the airline told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event, this has led to a need to re-think how the firm operates:</p><p>With the unprecedentedly low load factors on our flights, coupled with the absolute unpredictability of the virus, we needed to adjust very quickly. Many of our customers needed us to fulfil our purpose to connect them to what's important in their lives. After all, people needed to return home to care for loved ones and travel to temporary medical assignments.</p><p>One manifestation of how the airline has responded is with its Southwest Promise, published in May to promote the measures taken to keep passengers safe, including personal protection and wellness, disinfection and cleaning regimes onboard planes and in airports and measures to support social distancing, such as limiting passenger numbers, changing boarding and deplaning routines and using mobile boarding passes on smartphones.</p><p>But there's another vital constituency, Winters reminded the Qualtrics audience, that of the Southwest Airlines employee base:</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: Tech IPOs brush aside election concerns as investors seek growth</p><p>In most presidential election years, conventional wisdom says the IPO window closes by mid-summer so that companies avoid the shadow of the November contest, a time when markets can be jittery.</p><p>That convention doesn't apply this year.

Growth was down from 23% one quarter earlier.</p><p>Workday, whose software is used for financial management and human resources, said it now expects $3.73 billion to $3.74 billion in subscription revenue in fiscal 2021, up from a forecast in May of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Workday said it's seeing growth among companies that need help navigating Covid-19, keeping them engaged with employees who are working remotely. It's also partnered with IBM to help companies prepare their workplaces for a safe return as offices start to reopen.</p><p>In naming Fernandez as co-CEO, Workday is returning to a dual leadership structure it had at the time of its 2012 IPO, when Bhusri shared the role with co-founder Dave Duffield. Bhusri became sole CEO, when Duffield stepped down in 2014 and assumed the chairman role. Workday is going in the opposite direction of Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, which have recently switched from having two CEOs to having just one.</p><p>Fernandez joined Workday in 2014 from SAP, where he had been a senior vice president. In his new role he will run the company's sales, marketing and customer support.</p><p>Two likeminded CEOs are better than one, Bhusri said on a conference call with analysts.</p><p>\"I'm more of a product person and strategy person, and I personally would like to get back to working with our product teams and our venture teams and our strategy teams on where we go in the future,\" he said. \"And then it's super important that we you know maintain the great culture that we have and so, working with employees is critical too. So, you know, much like it was with with me and Dave.\"</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>hybris GmbH operates as a vendor of multi-channel communication and commerce software solutions.

The free offer, which expires Dec. 31, 2020, is available online to organizations that do not use SAP Fieldglass' core solutions.</p><p>According to the announcement, SAP Fieldglass External Talent Marketplace provides a single, central place where businesses looking for temporary workers and staffing firms with vetted candidates can find each other to more quickly fill open jobs. Staffing firms currently participating in the marketplace include majors like Adecco; Experis, a ManpowerGroup brand; Guidant Global and its staffing affiliates S.com, Corestaff and SRG; KellyOCG; and Randstad US.</p><p>Spend Matters spoke with the SAP Fieldglass team, which said the solution was conceived months ago when it was understood that while demand for workers in some sectors had sharply declined, demand in other sectors - like healthcare, pharma and some manufacturing, retail and technology - was surging. Companies in these and other verticals were looking for workers, but finding them was very challenging. There was a fundamental disconnect between supply and demand. The External Talent Marketplace was created to help bridge this gap.</p><p>SAP Fieldglass said that, depending on the state of the coronavirus pandemic and the uptake by organizations and staffing firms, access to the Marketplace could be extended.</p><p>The External Talent Marketplace enables companies to search for available temporary workers from multiple staffing firms, create job postings from scratch or using templates, and automatically send job postings to staffing firms to speed up sourcing.</p><p>July 10: hybris GmbH: Clariba partners with SAP clients for intelligent enterprise</p><p>At its recent user conference, SAP made a case for its vision of the intelligent enterprise, but the concept still lacks clarity for many customers.</p><p>SAP defines the intelligent enterprise as a digital transformation, or the digitizing of existing processes and business models to enable the new processes and systems. The overhaul emphasizes analytics, data-driven decision-making and cloud-based technologies, and it enables companies to develop business models that monetize data in new ways.</p><p>For companies to undertake such a transformation, SAP will need help from its partners, said Marc Haberland, founder and managing director at Clariba, an SAP partner. Clariba has engaged in its own digital transformation and now develops applications and methods for SAP customers to do the same.</p><p>Clariba, based in Barcelona and Dubai, is a 20-year-old firm that started out as a consultancy for BusinessObjects, business intelligence platform technology that SAP acquired in 2007. In addition, Clariba is focused on SAP's vision of an intelligent enterprise and is developing data-driven intelligent enterprise applications, including one currently being used by the Italian National Football Federation.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 28: hybris GmbH: Covid Testing in the Workplace Is Tricky. Here's What Experts Recommend</p><p>As you and your employees return to the office, you may be considering whether to adopt Covid-19 testing or mandatory temperature checks and health surveys. Tread lightly--especially if you're planning to require Covid-19 testing. Businesses must comply with a raft of health regulations and protect employee privacy.</p><p>In April, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Department of Labor authorized the practice of collecting medical information such as taking temperatures. The government also approved conducting Covid-19 tests in the workplace, which employers typically couldn't do. \"I think there is a general need to know that the person walking into your facility does not have a fever currently,\" says Erin McLaughlin, labor and employment attorney at Pittsburgh-based law firm Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney. Testing in general, she says, and keeping track that employees who are coming into the workplace are healthy may give your business a layer of liability protection in case someone does get sick.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: Canadian business travellers view mobile check-ins as most important feature for future travel</p><p>More than half of Canadian business travellers say they have positive feelings about travelling again once COVID restrictions are lifted, provided there is effective tech in place to help them travel for business safely. And most Canadians expect mobile check-ins to perform a lot of the leg work.</p><p>Over 50 per cent of Canadian business travellers, in a recent survey of 200 Canadian business travellers by SAP Concur, say that mobile check-ins will be the most important mobile app features when travel resumes. For the same question, only 41 per cent of respondents globally felt the same way.</p><p>When travel starts, 24 per cent Canadian business travellers say they're most likely to start their booking with online travel agencies, while 22 per cent say they will book directly with an airline or hotel website/app. Comparatively, only 18 per cent expect to first use their company's travel booking tool or go to their company's travel agency, and 17 per cent expect to use internet search engines.</p><p>Most of those surveyed said that they expect their company to experience negative outcomes due to travel restrictions around COVID-19, with 51 per cent noting it will result in a reduced number of deals or contracts signed that require in-person interactions and 44 per cent saying it would lead to declines in new business wins that require in-person meetings.</p><p>\"Our research shows that travel will continue to play an irreplaceable role in meeting critical business demands.</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: U.S. big tech dominates stock market after monster rally, leaving investors on edge</p><p>U.S. technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off.

That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.</p><p>The quintet's burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.</p><p>Yet the companies are drawing opposition. U.S. lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.</p><p>Some investors worry the companies powering this year's equity rally could become the market's Achilles' heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.</p><p>\"People see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: Managing Digital Transformation Amid New Working Models</p><p>Many businesses continue to invest in digital transformation initiatives as they recognize deficiencies and address emerging needs in their IT infrastructure during this time. This is especially true of CFOs, who are managing tighter budgets and seeking new solutions that better control company spend and catch financial errors. These CFOs are on the hunt for tools that can adjust to the unique problems of home offices and hybrid working models and ongoing risk assessment.</p><p>But selecting a new solution is only half the battle. Orchestrating a tech overhaul - or even just adding a new tool to the mix - can be daunting and, without the right process, lead to low adoption levels across an organization. While typically a tech project, IT departments are more strapped than ever. According to a survey, global IT leaders' top concerns right now are network connectivity and security.</p><p>Thus, the job falls to finance. CFOs may find themselves asked to spearhead new technology adoptions, which can provide tremendous value for their company with the right approach. These tips can help put CFOs on the right track toward a successful implementation:</p><p>Find the right tool. When selecting a tool, prioritize technological advancements that provide more control and drive better compliance.</p><p>August 22: hybris GmbH: SAP's Dan Lahl Looks Back at SAP HANA's First Decade</p><p>Earlier this year marked the tenth anniversary of the release of SAP HANA, the software company's database management system. SAP HANA has been vital to the innovations of SAP software over the past decade, and instrumental to a lot of the software company's success.</p><p>ASUG recently sat down with Dan Lahl, global vice president of product marketing at SAP, to talk about the legacy of SAP HANA. The conversation also focused on what made the platform a success, and how it's still evolving.</p><p>Jim: SAP HANA just celebrated its tenth birthday. What were some of the highlights from SAP HANA's first decade? Dan Lahl, Global Vice President of Product Marketing, SAP</p><p>Dan: What SAP HANA has been able to accomplish is amazing. SAP HANA has the ability to establish in-memory column databases that provide the unique ability to do transactions and analytics in the same instance and at the same time. Historically, you would capture transactions in one database and then extract that information out of the database into a data warehouse. Then, you had to reorganize that information into a data warehousing storage format before analyzing it. For stock trading, dynamic telecommunications network management, or fast-moving stock items across thousands of retail point-of-sale devices-this is just not feasible to optimally run your business.</p><p>August 21: hybris GmbH: How the UK Post Office has delivered first class CX as COVID puts its stamp on operational needs</p><p>Post Office Ltd is a retail post office company in the UK that offers a wide range of products from postage stamps through broadband services to banking, delivered via a nationwide network of post office branches. It was founded in 1986 as a state-owned private company out of what used to be known as Post Office Counters.</p><p>In recent years the firm has struggled with losses and most recently was at the center of a major political row involving an abortive IT project, Horizon. And of course, this year, in common with every organization across every business sector, the COVID-19 crisis has brought fresh challenges. As James Scutt, Head of Customer Experience Strategy and Deployment, told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event:</p><p>I've worked for the Post Office for about 15 years now and during that time I've seen so many changes take place, but none as big as the changes we made during COVID-19, and certainly those changes weren't made as fast as well.</p><p>The importance of the Post Office as part of the UK landscape cannot be understated. In the UK, there are over 11,500 branches with an estimated 99.7% of the country's population living within 3 miles of one. Today, the firm offers more than 170 different products and services.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: 3 Actionable Insights with SAP global CMO Alicia Tillman</p><p>What does it take for a global B2B brand to succeed today? SAP's Alicia Tillman, who was named by Forbes as one of the most influential CMOs in the world, shares her actionable insights that will help marketers lead the way forward during this moment and beyond.</p><p>Multinational enterprise software company SAP was founded 48 years ago with a purpose of helping the world run better and to improve people's lives. As businesses struggle with the daily challenges of the ongoing pandemic, those objectives need to be met more than ever. Global chief marketer Alicia Tillman, who has grown SAP's brand value has grown to more than $18bn during her tenure, takes time out to talk to The Drum about how marketers must evolve to meet clients' needs. Here are the three top actions that Tillman recommends:</p><p>1. Maintain a daily, global perspective about your customers' needs.</p><p>\"Know what's going on outside of the walls of your company. Even though we are all experiencing a global pandemic, the effect of it is different by geography and region, and it evolves by the day. Understand the effect it has on the customer you serve. And then know what you have in your company that can best serve them - how it's valuable and how you position it effectively so they know you're there to help, how you can help and what they need to do to be able to embrace your help.\"</p><p>2.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: Heres What It Takes To Be a Supply Chain Leader in 2020</p><p>A recent study by SAP and Oxford Economics found that 12% of the top 1,000 supply chain performers proved to have more resilient supply chains. In this article, Richard Howells, vice president of solution management for SAP Digital Supply Chain, dives into these characteristics that led companies to become supply chain leaders.</p><p>At the start of 2020, when experts were talking about \"Vision 2020\", nobody predicted that we were entering a global pandemic that would bring the global economy to a virtual standstill within weeks. With the pandemic, came a highly variable demand for goods and services; an uncertain supply of critical Materials; constrained labor and resource capacity in manufacturing and logistics. All these factors, along with many others, resulted in reduced revenue, profits, and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Supply chains have been brought to the forefront and are now a regular discussion in presidential briefings, executive board rooms, and dining room tables. One thing is for sure - unexpected disruptions that adversely affect supply chains will continue to occur. The causes of disruptions will vary from pandemics or geopolitical or trade conflicts to natural disasters or the limited availability of natural resources.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: How Southwest Airlines helps employees to be the face of the brand, even behind a mask</p><p>Among the sectors most dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, the travel industry has been one of those hit most hard - and Southwest Airlines has been no exception. As Laurie Winters, Senior Director of Culture and Engagement at the airline told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event, this has led to a need to re-think how the firm operates:</p><p>With the unprecedentedly low load factors on our flights, coupled with the absolute unpredictability of the virus, we needed to adjust very quickly. Many of our customers needed us to fulfil our purpose to connect them to what's important in their lives. After all, people needed to return home to care for loved ones and travel to temporary medical assignments.</p><p>One manifestation of how the airline has responded is with its Southwest Promise, published in May to promote the measures taken to keep passengers safe, including personal protection and wellness, disinfection and cleaning regimes onboard planes and in airports and measures to support social distancing, such as limiting passenger numbers, changing boarding and deplaning routines and using mobile boarding passes on smartphones.</p><p>But there's another vital constituency, Winters reminded the Qualtrics audience, that of the Southwest Airlines employee base:</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: Tech IPOs brush aside election concerns as investors seek growth</p><p>In most presidential election years, conventional wisdom says the IPO window closes by mid-summer so that companies avoid the shadow of the November contest, a time when markets can be jittery.</p><p>That convention doesn't apply this year. The country is mired in the worst pandemic in a century and suffered its steepest-ever quarterly plunge in economic activity in the second quarter. Yet the equity markets are rallying, and tech stocks are trading at historical premiums.</p><p>In polls, Democratic candidate Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over President Donald Trump. Wall Street may like Trump, but it's OK with Biden, who was vice president during much of the bull market, which started shortly after Barack Obama took office in 2009.</p><p>For high-growth software companies eyeing the public market, that means talks with bankers are quickly ramping up.</p><p>\"We could find ourselves in a very strong second half here as we go into the elections,\" said Jackie Kelley, Americas IPO and strategic transactions leader at Ernst &amp; Young.</p><p>\"We're already seeing increased IPO activity over the last couple weeks. As long as markets stay stable, I think we have good runway to get a significant amount of this backlog out into the markets.\"</p><p>In particular, investors are thirsty for resilient business models that have shown elements of being Covid-proof.</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: HPE, SAP to deliver SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake</p><p>HPE and SAP on Thursday said they're partnering up to deliver the customer edition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake, HPE's h, its as-a-service platform. That will make the new offering a fully-managed service, in the customer's data center or a colocation facility of their choice.</p><p>Customers will be able to keep their SAP software landscape and data on premise while getting an automated cloud experience and a flexible subscription-based as-a-service model.</p><p>\"The new deployment model SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud, customer edition is a direct response to customers who want the flexibility and service level of a managed private cloud, but need to keep their systems in their own data centers, such as public sector and regulated industry customers,\" Peter Pluim, SAP EVP and global head of Enterprise Cloud Services, said in a statement.</p><p>The partnership comes as SAP encourages customers to move to SAP S/4HANA. HPE will supply, install and manage the infrastructure for the new offering -- including compute, storage and networking technologies that are certified and pre-configured for SAP software.</p><p>SAP, for its part, will deliver white-glove operations and application management services.</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: How Brakes bridged the B2B/ B2C gap to feed a nation</p><p>When COVID-19 forced the closure of schools, pubs, restaurants and hotels, Brakes knew it had to pivot its core business strategy.</p><p>Brakes is a B2B food delivery service and leading supplier to the food service sector in the UK. Owned by Sysco, it has sister companies in Ireland, France and Sweden.</p><p>Its customer base is comprised of schools, contract caterers, hospitals, hotels, independent dining establishments, pubs and restaurant chains.</p><p>But when the Coronavirus became a reality, the company suddenly had a much larger mission - to feed a nation that was struggling.</p><p>Just three weeks into lockdown, the Food Foundation reported that 1.5 million Britons reported not eating for a full day because they either weren't able to afford it or didn't have access to food.

For many companies, the scope for international reach has moved from a dream to a realistic and tangible reality-at least since they have had access to technology and logistics to aid this process. The business an organization secures is no longer limited by borders.</p><p>However, this seamless access has opened the door to some less pleasant realities of international trade. The more data businesses are generating, the more complex the analysis landscape becomes. How are finance teams expected to cope with these new volumes of information? Moving out of home territory and into unknown government trading law is an underlying issue firms often overlook. The fact is, in each government jurisdiction the tax transactions taking place and regulations around this are an ever-shifting minefield of compliance complexity.</p><p>Misunderstandings are costly in business, that much is true.

The feature, which launched in May, has allowed select organizations and experts to share resources related to managing your mental health - including things like handling anxiety or grief amid the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. A handful of creators first gained access to the feature, and have since posted their wellness tips on their Instagram profiles in a separate tab, called \"Guides.\" Now, Instagram is developing tools that will allow creators to build out Guides for other types of tips and recommendations, too - like recommended places or even recommended products.</p><p>The larger goal with Guides is to give Instagram users a way to post longer-form content that's not just a photo or video. Currently, Guides can include photos, galleries and videos sourced from either the creator's own profile, which is more common, or from other creators. In addition, the Guides include commentary or tips alongside the media.</p><p>Instagram Guides</p><p>Instagram Guides today (Image Credits: Instagram)</p><p>The feature would allow creators to use Instagram as their platform for sharing tips and advice, instead of having that traffic redirected outside of Instagram - like to a blog or other website.</p><p>At launch, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the Guides feature was originally designed with the travel use case in mind, but the company pivoted Guides to focus on wellness because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Now it appears Instagram will be returning to its original idea of letting creators build Guides for places - and for other things, too.</p><p>The changes to Guides were first uncovered by Twitter user and self-described leaker, Alessandro Paluzzi.</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Heres the Surface Duo</p><p>I can't remember the last time I did a hands-on with a device prior to powering it on. The idea of basing posts entirely around glamour shots without really interfacing with the product feels like a relic of an early era of gadget blogging. But every so often a device comes along that warrants the approach.</p><p>There will be a far more in-depth review of the Surface Duo. I will write a lot of words on this website about the experience of using the software and living with the device as my go-to handset. For now, however, you and I both are going to have to settle for a handful of photos and a few choice words about the form factor.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Property tech startup Habi raises $10M to drive expansion in Latin America</p><p>When Brynne McNulty Rojas moved to Bogota, Columbia four years ago, she encountered a fragmented real estate industry that lacked a central database for consumers to find or compare homes. Rojas was struck by the magnitude of the problem; she was also inspired by the opportunity.</p><p>Rojas and business partner Sebastian Noguera homed in on some of the biggest issues in the city's real estate market, particularly for middle class buyers. They found a market where the average home took 14 months to sell; that figure drops to 10 months for middle class homes. It was a market that lacked price transparency and where sellers used analog tactics like posting a sign in the neighborhood in a futile attempt to attract buyers.</p><p>From these problems, Rojas and Noguera founded Habi, a property tech startup with a two-fold approach. The startup founders built a centralized database of residential real estate prices and trends - essentially a multiple listing service - and then used that information to create an automated pricing algorithm to buy and sell homes quickly and efficiently. The company buys, renovates and then sells homes, generating revenue off the margin. It also offers a tool that lets sellers estimate the value of their homes and a database that buyers can use to search for listings.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction.

In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices. The Apple Developer ecosystem, meanwhile, supports 23 million developers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Stockwell, the AI-vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega, is shutting down July 1</p><p>Stockwell AI entered the world with a bang but it is leaving with a whimper. Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline.

The feature, which launched in May, has allowed select organizations and experts to share resources related to managing your mental health - including things like handling anxiety or grief amid the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. A handful of creators first gained access to the feature, and have since posted their wellness tips on their Instagram profiles in a separate tab, called \"Guides.\" Now, Instagram is developing tools that will allow creators to build out Guides for other types of tips and recommendations, too - like recommended places or even recommended products.</p><p>The larger goal with Guides is to give Instagram users a way to post longer-form content that's not just a photo or video. Currently, Guides can include photos, galleries and videos sourced from either the creator's own profile, which is more common, or from other creators. In addition, the Guides include commentary or tips alongside the media.</p><p>Instagram Guides</p><p>Instagram Guides today (Image Credits: Instagram)</p><p>The feature would allow creators to use Instagram as their platform for sharing tips and advice, instead of having that traffic redirected outside of Instagram - like to a blog or other website.</p><p>At launch, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the Guides feature was originally designed with the travel use case in mind, but the company pivoted Guides to focus on wellness because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Now it appears Instagram will be returning to its original idea of letting creators build Guides for places - and for other things, too.</p><p>The changes to Guides were first uncovered by Twitter user and self-described leaker, Alessandro Paluzzi.</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Daily Crunch: Spotify is testing virtual events</p><p>Spotify explores virtual concerts, Twitter tests a \"quotes\" count and Google's Nest Hub becomes more hotel-friendly. This is your Daily Crunch for August 26, 2020.</p><p>The big story: Spotify is testing virtual events</p><p>We can't have real-world concerts at the moment, so the popular music streaming service is exploring virtual alternatives. The feature isn't live yet, but reverse-engineering scoopster Jane Manchun Wong tweeted out photos of an \"Upcoming Virtual Events\" section.</p><p>Spotify already highlights upcoming concerts from artists you like through various ticketing partners, and the screenshots show Songkick as the ticketing partner. Presumably, Spotify would be able to support virtual events with only minor changes to its bargaining agreement.</p><p>And how big can these events be? K-pop megastars BTS raised nearly $20 million for a single show - but it's probably safe to assume that most events will fall far short of that.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Heres the Surface Duo</p><p>I can't remember the last time I did a hands-on with a device prior to powering it on. The idea of basing posts entirely around glamour shots without really interfacing with the product feels like a relic of an early era of gadget blogging. But every so often a device comes along that warrants the approach.</p><p>There will be a far more in-depth review of the Surface Duo. I will write a lot of words on this website about the experience of using the software and living with the device as my go-to handset. For now, however, you and I both are going to have to settle for a handful of photos and a few choice words about the form factor.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Property tech startup Habi raises $10M to drive expansion in Latin America</p><p>When Brynne McNulty Rojas moved to Bogota, Columbia four years ago, she encountered a fragmented real estate industry that lacked a central database for consumers to find or compare homes. Rojas was struck by the magnitude of the problem; she was also inspired by the opportunity.</p><p>Rojas and business partner Sebastian Noguera homed in on some of the biggest issues in the city's real estate market, particularly for middle class buyers. They found a market where the average home took 14 months to sell; that figure drops to 10 months for middle class homes. It was a market that lacked price transparency and where sellers used analog tactics like posting a sign in the neighborhood in a futile attempt to attract buyers.</p><p>From these problems, Rojas and Noguera founded Habi, a property tech startup with a two-fold approach. The startup founders built a centralized database of residential real estate prices and trends - essentially a multiple listing service - and then used that information to create an automated pricing algorithm to buy and sell homes quickly and efficiently. The company buys, renovates and then sells homes, generating revenue off the margin. It also offers a tool that lets sellers estimate the value of their homes and a database that buyers can use to search for listings.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban. Proponents of the move note that the change in policy ought not be regarded as a softening on the government's stance toward the embattled hardware maker, but instead is an attempt to develop more streamlined standards for 5G, along with the company, which has been one of the primary forces in its development</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Apple says its App Store facilitated $519B in commerce in 2019</p><p>Amid increasing antitrust scrutiny by U.S. regulators, Apple announced an update on its App Store ecosystem. While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices. The Apple Developer ecosystem, meanwhile, supports 23 million developers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Stockwell, the AI-vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega, is shutting down July 1</p><p>Stockwell AI entered the world with a bang but it is leaving with a whimper. Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible. While this wasn't the way we wanted to end this journey, we are confident that our vision of bringing the store to where people live, work and play will live on through other amazing companies, products and services.\"</p><p>We originally reached out after we were tipped off by someone who had received an email about the closure.</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Rocket Labs next mission could launch just weeks after the last one</p><p>Rocket Lab is creeping closer to its goal of weekly launches with its 13th commercial mission, nicknamed \"Pics Or It Didn't Happen,\" which, if all goes well, will take off only three weeks after the last one.</p><p>\"Don't Stop Me Now\" got to orbit successfully over the weekend, on June 13, and the next one is scheduled for July 3 - weather and other factors permitting.</p><p>\"Rocket Lab has eliminated the small sat waiting room for orbit. We've focused heavily on shoring up our rapid launch capability in recent years and we're proud to be putting that into practice for the small sat community with launches just days apart,\" said the company's founder and CEO, Peter Beck, in a press release.</p><p>\"Pics\" will carry three different payloads from \"ride sharing\" customers:</p><p>Canon's CE-SAT-1B will provide orbital imagery and test the microsatellite platform for mass production Five of Planet's new SuperDove Earth observation satellites (Flock 4V) will join their hundreds of colleagues in orbit In-Space Missions's Faraday-1 cubesat will demonstrate viability of its platform for startups looking to get their software into orbit quickly</p><p>New Electron rockets are being built every 18 days, but that doesn't mean they can be launched that quickly, though there's definitely enough demand.</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: A new Silicon Valley venture report shocks - because of how little the pandemic has impacted dealmaking</p><p>The law firm Fenwick &amp; West has published some new data to highlight how Covid-19 has impacted the world of venture capital in Silicon Valley. The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers. We look forward to being able to continue to differentiate our product offerings and refine our point of view to further delight our current and future customers.\"</p><p>Related Articles One Kings Lane Loses CEO Doug Mack To Fanatics One Kings Lane Raises $112M At A $912M Valuation In A Quest To Dominate Home Goods Online Gilt's Unicorn Tale Comes To An End After Being Acquired For $250M</p><p>It is unclear how closely San Francisco-based One Kings Lane will be integrated into the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond brand.</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Uber in talks to close up to $2 billion in leveraged loans</p><p>Rumors from the Wall Street Journal that Uber was in the process of finalizing terms for a $1-2 Billion leveraged loan began spreading just after noon PST. This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that. The company has a notoriously high burn rate despite reports that company is profitable in the North America.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2708200931123789000184767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P6-3CW1-DXKH-N1B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club.

The feature, which launched in May, has allowed select organizations and experts to share resources related to managing your mental health - including things like handling anxiety or grief amid the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. A handful of creators first gained access to the feature, and have since posted their wellness tips on their Instagram profiles in a separate tab, called \"Guides.\" Now, Instagram is developing tools that will allow creators to build out Guides for other types of tips and recommendations, too - like recommended places or even recommended products.</p><p>The larger goal with Guides is to give Instagram users a way to post longer-form content that's not just a photo or video. Currently, Guides can include photos, galleries and videos sourced from either the creator's own profile, which is more common, or from other creators. In addition, the Guides include commentary or tips alongside the media.</p><p>Instagram Guides</p><p>Instagram Guides today (Image Credits: Instagram)</p><p>The feature would allow creators to use Instagram as their platform for sharing tips and advice, instead of having that traffic redirected outside of Instagram - like to a blog or other website.</p><p>At launch, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the Guides feature was originally designed with the travel use case in mind, but the company pivoted Guides to focus on wellness because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Now it appears Instagram will be returning to its original idea of letting creators build Guides for places - and for other things, too.</p><p>The changes to Guides were first uncovered by Twitter user and self-described leaker, Alessandro Paluzzi.</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Daily Crunch: Spotify is testing virtual events</p><p>Spotify explores virtual concerts, Twitter tests a \"quotes\" count and Google's Nest Hub becomes more hotel-friendly. This is your Daily Crunch for August 26, 2020.</p><p>The big story: Spotify is testing virtual events</p><p>We can't have real-world concerts at the moment, so the popular music streaming service is exploring virtual alternatives. The feature isn't live yet, but reverse-engineering scoopster Jane Manchun Wong tweeted out photos of an \"Upcoming Virtual Events\" section.</p><p>Spotify already highlights upcoming concerts from artists you like through various ticketing partners, and the screenshots show Songkick as the ticketing partner. Presumably, Spotify would be able to support virtual events with only minor changes to its bargaining agreement.</p><p>And how big can these events be? K-pop megastars BTS raised nearly $20 million for a single show - but it's probably safe to assume that most events will fall far short of that.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Property tech startup Habi raises $10M to drive expansion in Latin America</p><p>When Brynne McNulty Rojas moved to Bogota, Columbia four years ago, she encountered a fragmented real estate industry that lacked a central database for consumers to find or compare homes. Rojas was struck by the magnitude of the problem; she was also inspired by the opportunity.</p><p>Rojas and business partner Sebastian Noguera homed in on some of the biggest issues in the city's real estate market, particularly for middle class buyers. They found a market where the average home took 14 months to sell; that figure drops to 10 months for middle class homes. It was a market that lacked price transparency and where sellers used analog tactics like posting a sign in the neighborhood in a futile attempt to attract buyers.</p><p>From these problems, Rojas and Noguera founded Habi, a property tech startup with a two-fold approach. The startup founders built a centralized database of residential real estate prices and trends - essentially a multiple listing service - and then used that information to create an automated pricing algorithm to buy and sell homes quickly and efficiently. The company buys, renovates and then sells homes, generating revenue off the margin. It also offers a tool that lets sellers estimate the value of their homes and a database that buyers can use to search for listings.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices.

Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that.

The feature, which launched in May, has allowed select organizations and experts to share resources related to managing your mental health - including things like handling anxiety or grief amid the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. A handful of creators first gained access to the feature, and have since posted their wellness tips on their Instagram profiles in a separate tab, called \"Guides.\" Now, Instagram is developing tools that will allow creators to build out Guides for other types of tips and recommendations, too - like recommended places or even recommended products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The larger goal with Guides is to give Instagram users a way to post longer-form content that's not just a photo or video. Currently, Guides can include photos, galleries and videos sourced from either the creator's own profile, which is more common, or from other creators. In addition, the Guides include commentary or tips alongside the media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instagram Guides</p><p>Instagram Guides today (Image Credits: Instagram)</p><p>The feature would allow creators to use Instagram as their platform for sharing tips and advice, instead of having that traffic redirected outside of Instagram - like to a blog or other website.</p><p>At launch, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the Guides feature was originally designed with the travel use case in mind, but the company pivoted Guides to focus on wellness because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Now it appears Instagram will be returning to its original idea of letting creators build Guides for places - and for other things, too.</p><p>The changes to Guides were first uncovered by Twitter user and self-described leaker, Alessandro Paluzzi. He tells TechCrunch he found the new features by reverse engineering the Instagram app. But these changes haven't yet launched to the wider Instagram user base.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Equity Shot: Our favorite startups from YC Demo Day</p><p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast (now on Twitter!), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p><p>Yep, it's another Equity Shot. We're back. And then we're going to be back on Friday.

This time 'round Natasha and your humble servant were joined by Lucas Matney, a member of the TechCrunch reporting team and a first-timer on Equity. Where's he been all this time? Covering all sorts of things, including VR startups for the publication.

This is your Daily Crunch for August 26, 2020.</p><p>The big story: Spotify is testing virtual events</p><p>We can't have real-world concerts at the moment, so the popular music streaming service is exploring virtual alternatives. The feature isn't live yet, but reverse-engineering scoopster Jane Manchun Wong tweeted out photos of an \"Upcoming Virtual Events\" section.</p><p>Spotify already highlights upcoming concerts from artists you like through various ticketing partners, and the screenshots show Songkick as the ticketing partner. Presumably, Spotify would be able to support virtual events with only minor changes to its bargaining agreement.</p><p>And how big can these events be? K-pop megastars BTS raised nearly $20 million for a single show - but it's probably safe to assume that most events will fall far short of that.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Heres the Surface Duo</p><p>I can't remember the last time I did a hands-on with a device prior to powering it on. The idea of basing posts entirely around glamour shots without really interfacing with the product feels like a relic of an early era of gadget blogging. But every so often a device comes along that warrants the approach.</p><p>There will be a far more in-depth review of the Surface Duo. I will write a lot of words on this website about the experience of using the software and living with the device as my go-to handset. For now, however, you and I both are going to have to settle for a handful of photos and a few choice words about the form factor.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Property tech startup Habi raises $10M to drive expansion in Latin America</p><p>When Brynne McNulty Rojas moved to Bogota, Columbia four years ago, she encountered a fragmented real estate industry that lacked a central database for consumers to find or compare homes. Rojas was struck by the magnitude of the problem; she was also inspired by the opportunity.</p><p>Rojas and business partner Sebastian Noguera homed in on some of the biggest issues in the city's real estate market, particularly for middle class buyers. They found a market where the average home took 14 months to sell; that figure drops to 10 months for middle class homes. It was a market that lacked price transparency and where sellers used analog tactics like posting a sign in the neighborhood in a futile attempt to attract buyers.</p><p>From these problems, Rojas and Noguera founded Habi, a property tech startup with a two-fold approach. The startup founders built a centralized database of residential real estate prices and trends - essentially a multiple listing service - and then used that information to create an automated pricing algorithm to buy and sell homes quickly and efficiently. The company buys, renovates and then sells homes, generating revenue off the margin. It also offers a tool that lets sellers estimate the value of their homes and a database that buyers can use to search for listings.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>SpaceX has managed a first - catching both halves of the fairing used on one of its Falcon 9 rocket launches, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise. Our goal was both simple and bold: to reinvent the venture capital industry by bringing more transparency to what has become an ever more opaque financial environment for founders.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: The VCs who founders love the most</p><p>Over the past month, we have been asking founders to submit recommendations of VCs for The TechCrunch List, our newly-launched curated directory of investors who are ready to write first checks and lead venture rounds into startups. You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations. They have also been edited for clarity.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: US Commerce Dept. amends Huawei ban to allow for development of 5G standards</p><p>The United States Department of Commerce today issued a change to its sweeping Huawei ban.

While the company normally shares some App Store metrics during its WWDC keynote, it's today detailing the results of a new study that claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated half a trillion ($519 billion) in billings and sales globally in 2019. This is a new and broader figure than has been previously reported, as it includes all transactions the App Store facilitates, not just those on which Apple takes a commission.</p><p>The study, which was conducted by economists at the Analysis Group, is the first to attempt to comprehensively analyze the App Store ecosystem, which is now home to nearly 2 million apps. First launched in 2008, the App Store is visited by half a billion people every week across 175 countries. Collectively, users have download apps hundreds of billions of times to their devices. The Apple Developer ecosystem, meanwhile, supports 23 million developers.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Stockwell, the AI-vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega, is shutting down July 1</p><p>Stockwell AI entered the world with a bang but it is leaving with a whimper. Founded in 2017 by ex-Googlers, the AI vending machine startup formerly known as Bodega first raised blood pressures - people hated how it referenced and poorly 'disrupted' mom-and-pop shops in one fell swoop - and then raised a lot of money. But ultimately, it was no match for COVID-19 and the hit it has had on how we live.</p><p>TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Stockwell will be shutting down at the end of this month, after it was unable find a viable business for its in-building app-controlled \"smart\" vending machines stocked with convenience store items.</p><p>\"Regretfully, the current landscape has created a situation in which we can no longer continue our operations and will be winding down the company on July 1st,\" co-founder and CEO Paul McDonald wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \"We are deeply grateful to our talented team, incredible partners and investors, and our amazing shoppers that made this possible. While this wasn't the way we wanted to end this journey, we are confident that our vision of bringing the store to where people live, work and play will live on through other amazing companies, products and services.\"</p><p>We originally reached out after we were tipped off by someone who had received an email about the closure.</p><p>June 16: OfferAll lnc: Rocket Labs next mission could launch just weeks after the last one</p><p>Rocket Lab is creeping closer to its goal of weekly launches with its 13th commercial mission, nicknamed \"Pics Or It Didn't Happen,\" which, if all goes well, will take off only three weeks after the last one.</p><p>\"Don't Stop Me Now\" got to orbit successfully over the weekend, on June 13, and the next one is scheduled for July 3 - weather and other factors permitting.</p><p>\"Rocket Lab has eliminated the small sat waiting room for orbit.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers. We look forward to being able to continue to differentiate our product offerings and refine our point of view to further delight our current and future customers.\"</p><p>Related Articles One Kings Lane Loses CEO Doug Mack To Fanatics One Kings Lane Raises $112M At A $912M Valuation In A Quest To Dominate Home Goods Online Gilt's Unicorn Tale Comes To An End After Being Acquired For $250M</p><p>It is unclear how closely San Francisco-based One Kings Lane will be integrated into the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond brand.</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Uber in talks to close up to $2 billion in leveraged loans</p><p>Rumors from the Wall Street Journal that Uber was in the process of finalizing terms for a $1-2 Billion leveraged loan began spreading just after noon PST. This comes just two weeks after the company closed a $3.5 billion equity round from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. If the deal goes through, it would mean the company has added $5.5 Billion to it coffers in the amount of time it takes a typical startup to initiate discussion of a funding round.</p><p>One benefit of Uber raising money as debt rather than equity is that it can avoid additional dilution for its employees. The company has raised $12.51 billion in equity financing since 2009. The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that. The company has a notoriously high burn rate despite reports that company is profitable in the North America.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2708200930463789000184767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P6-3CW1-DXKH-N1B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5333\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

Rojas was struck by the magnitude of the problem; she was also inspired by the opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rojas and business partner Sebastian Noguera homed in on some of the biggest issues in the city's real estate market, particularly for middle class buyers. They found a market where the average home took 14 months to sell; that figure drops to 10 months for middle class homes. It was a market that lacked price transparency and where sellers used analog tactics like posting a sign in the neighborhood in a futile attempt to attract buyers.</p><p>From these problems, Rojas and Noguera founded Habi, a property tech startup with a two-fold approach. The startup founders built a centralized database of residential real estate prices and trends - essentially a multiple listing service - and then used that information to create an automated pricing algorithm to buy and sell homes quickly and efficiently. The company buys, renovates and then sells homes, generating revenue off the margin. It also offers a tool that lets sellers estimate the value of their homes and a database that buyers can use to search for listings. The foundation of its business is its automated pricing technology, which was built using data from its real estate, financial and government partners.</p><p>\"You can think of it as an MLS plus Opendoor model,\" Rojas said in a recent interview. (Opendoor is the U.S.-based property tech startup backed by SoftBank.)</p><p>The Bogota-based startup has now raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Inspired Capital, with participation from 8VC, Clocktower, Homebrew, Vine and Zigg. The round included angel investments from Flatiron Health and Looker. The company has raised $15.5 million to date.</p><p>Brynne and Sebastia&amp;#769;n_Habi</p><p>Habi co-founders Brynne McNulty Rojas and Sebastian Noguera. Rojas is CEO and Noguera is president of the Bogota-based real estate startup. Image Credits: Habi</p><p>Since launching in fall 2019, Habi has scaled rapidly - and has even picked up speed during the city's strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Transaction volume has increased threefold since March, Rojas noted.</p><p>Rojas said its data-driven approach works, allowing the company to sell a home three times faster than the market average.</p><p>The company currently covers all of Bogota. It plans to use this fresh injection of capital to expand to Medellin this month and eventually to other Latin American markets, according to Noguera, who previously ran the digital transformation at Banco de Bogota and co-founded Marqueo.</p><p>The founders also intend to eventually expand Habi's services to become a \"one-stop shop for everything related to the home,\" Rojas said. In the long term, this might mean connecting consumers with moving, storage, furnishings and other services.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 OFFERALL LNC.

In an open letter, Accountable Tech urges the five U.S.-based Facebook Oversight Board members to \"demand the Board be given real authority\" or quit their positions.</p><p>\"Each of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\" the letter's authors write. \"Now is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade -- that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\"</p><p>Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the 2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign's response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.</p><p>\"Facebook specializes in window dressing,\" Gill told TechCrunch. \"They have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform's problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\"</p><p>A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook's recent civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board's real power and also notes the oversight body's delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won't be up and running in time for the 2020 election.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Equity Shot: Our favorite startups from YC Demo Day</p><p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast (now on Twitter!), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p><p>Yep, it's another Equity Shot.

The feature, which launched in May, has allowed select organizations and experts to share resources related to managing your mental health - including things like handling anxiety or grief amid the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. A handful of creators first gained access to the feature, and have since posted their wellness tips on their Instagram profiles in a separate tab, called \"Guides.\" Now, Instagram is developing tools that will allow creators to build out Guides for other types of tips and recommendations, too - like recommended places or even recommended products.</p><p>The larger goal with Guides is to give Instagram users a way to post longer-form content that's not just a photo or video. Currently, Guides can include photos, galleries and videos sourced from either the creator's own profile, which is more common, or from other creators. In addition, the Guides include commentary or tips alongside the media.</p><p>Instagram Guides</p><p>Instagram Guides today (Image Credits: Instagram)</p><p>The feature would allow creators to use Instagram as their platform for sharing tips and advice, instead of having that traffic redirected outside of Instagram - like to a blog or other website.</p><p>At launch, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said the Guides feature was originally designed with the travel use case in mind, but the company pivoted Guides to focus on wellness because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Now it appears Instagram will be returning to its original idea of letting creators build Guides for places - and for other things, too.</p><p>The changes to Guides were first uncovered by Twitter user and self-described leaker, Alessandro Paluzzi.</p><p>August 27: OfferAll lnc: Daily Crunch: Spotify is testing virtual events</p><p>Spotify explores virtual concerts, Twitter tests a \"quotes\" count and Google's Nest Hub becomes more hotel-friendly.

Presumably, Spotify would be able to support virtual events with only minor changes to its bargaining agreement.</p><p>And how big can these events be?

The fairing is a two-piece protective cover that surrounds the cargo on the launch vehicle as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere on its way to space. SpaceX has been attempting to recover the fairing using two ships equipped with special nets designed to catch them as they fall, but this is the first time that the company has managed to actually catch both, rather than just one.</p><p>SpaceX attempts to reduce the cost of its launches by building In as much reusability as it can, which is why it has engineered a way to propulsively land its first stage rocket boosters back on Earth for refurbishment post launch. That part has been refined and is now fairly reliable, with SpaceX having landed a total of 57 of its spent first stages so far, including the one from today's launch.</p><p>The fairing recovery attempts have not been as successful so far. While the company has recovered fairing halves from the ocean, and even reused them it after retrieving them from the ocean, it has only caught single fairing halves previously using the ships at sea, with a first catch on the STP-2 mission last June, and another in January.</p><p>SpaceX estimates that it can save as much as $6 million per launch by recovering and reusing the fairing halves - another considerable savings on top of the reused boosters.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: SpaceX successfully catches both fairing halves for the first time on its latest launch</p><p>has completed another successful launch, this time on behalf of Lockheed Martin and its client South Korea. The payload is ANASIS-II, a dedicated military communications satellite (South Korea's first), which the nation will use to help safeguard its national security.</p><p>The Falcon 9 carrying the ANASIS-II lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:30 PM EDT (2:30 PM PDT) on Monday, using a first-stage booster that SpaceX flew less than two months ago - on the Demo-2 mission that carried NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station. This is a record in terms of the time required to recover a booster and turn it around for re-use - breaking the 63-day time of the booster used for Starlink's fourth production launch in February.</p><p>Today's booster only went 51 days between flights, beating the existing record by nearly two weeks. It's especially impressive when you consider that the first time this first stage was used, it was for what is easily SpaceX's most critical launch to date - the first carrying actual human beings on board. Just a few years ago, SpaceX typically configured its boosters in expendable mode for especially large and critical payloads, but it could conceivably even refurbish boosters for future crewed flights.</p><p>The launch for this mission included a re-entry attempt, which involved a controlled burn of the booster after it returned into the atmosphere for a landing on SpaceX's drone ship.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: After numerous rejections, Struck's dating app for the Co-Star crowd hits the App Store</p><p>Founded by former Apple engineers, a new app called Struck wants to be the Tinder for the Co-Star crowd. In other words, it's an astrology-based matchmaker. But it took close to 10 attempts over several months for the startup to get its app approved by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. In nearly every rejection, app reviewers flagged the app as \"spam\" either due to its use of astrology or, once, simply because it was designed for online dating.</p><p>Apple continually cited section 4.3 of its App Store Review Guidelines in the majority of Struck's rejections, with the exception of two that were unrelated to the app's purpose. (Once, it was rejected for use of a broken API. Another rejection was over text that needed correction. It had still called itself a \"beta.\")</p><p>The 4.3 guideline is something Apple wields to keep the App Store free from what it considers to be clutter and spam. In spirit, the guideline makes sense, as it gives Apple permission to make more subjective calls over low-quality apps.</p><p>Today, the guideline states that developers should \"avoid piling on to a category that is already saturated,\" and reminds developers that the App Store has \"enough fart, burp, flashlight, fortune telling, dating, and Kama Sutra apps, etc.</p><p>July 21: OfferAll lnc: Treasure8 adds Chris Cowart to its executive team as it renews pushing its tech to reduce food waste</p><p>Chris Cowart, the longtime IDEO product designer, Singularity University faculty member and consultant to a variety of venture firms and tech projects, is joining the food preservation technology developer Treasure8 as its new chief innovation and strategy officer, according to a post on LinkedIn.</p><p>\"In the last three years food has come to the fore as a theme,\" said Cowart in an interview with TechCrunch. Cowart, who previously spent the majority of his time consulting on healthcare companies, became interested in food through a year spent as an advisor to X, the Alphabet subsidiary that develops technologies and companies focused on sustainability, connectivity and new computing paradigms.</p><p>At X, Cowart was looking at projects that would use artificial intelligence to accelerate circular economy projects and it was there that he began to focus on food waste. The gravity of the situation around America's food waste and food insecurity in the country was driven home through Cowart's research, he said. \"We overproduce by double and we throw away 30% of our food,\" said Cowart. \"And in Santa Clara county one-in-six families are food insecure.\"</p><p>After completing his project at X, Cowart went to Treasure8 and was immediately pulled into strategy conversations, which led to him coming on board in June.</p><p>Unlike Apeel Sciences or Hazel Technologies, which have developed new preservative technologies to keep food fresh on store shelves (and raised several hundred million dollars), Treasure8's technology is a new spin on freeze-drying, which lets perishable foods hold their nutritional value while they're used as ingredients, supplements or powders.</p><p>Brands can reform it with rehydration, or put it into their products or reuse pieces of the vegetables and fruits in their products.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Tesla lands at least $14.7 million in tax breaks to locate Cybertruck factory in Texas</p><p>Lawmakers in Texas just gave Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk another incentive to locate its next factory there.</p><p>Commissioners in Travis County, home to Austin and the possible next Tesla factory, approved Tuesday property tax breaks worth at least $14.7 million - and potentially more - over 10 years. The incentives are on top of $46.6 million in property tax abatement that the Del Valle School District Board approved earlier this month.</p><p>News of the approval pushed Tesla shares 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.</p><p>The agreement, which the Austin Statesman first reported, is the latest carrot dangled in front of Tesla in hopes of landing the automaker's next factory, which is slated to assemble the all-electric Cybertruck and the Model Y for the East Coast market.</p><p>There are, of course, conditions to such an arrangement.</p><p>Under terms of the agreement with Travis County, Tesla must invest $1.1 billion in the new factory within the first five years. In exchange, Travis County will rebate 70% of the property taxes Tesla will pay. Once Tesla's investment in the factory eclipses that $1.1 billion mark, the property taxes rebates will increase to 75%. Any investments in the factory beyond $2 billion, will give Tesla 80% in property tax rebates.</p><p>Travis County has estimated that a $1.1 billion investment by Tesla would generated $8.8 million in new tax revenue over a 10-year period, a figure that takes into account the property tax rebates.</p><p>If Tesla fails to hit the investment goal or if its falls 75% short of its jobs requirement in any year, the company won't receive any property tax relief.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: After colleges sue, ICE backs down from student visa rule change</p><p>The Trump administration has backed down from plans to revoke visas of international students studying in the U.S. whose schools planned to provide their classes exclusively online in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The reversal comes as over a dozen universities and colleges threatened legal action against the administration's order. The multi-faceted effort also was led by attorneys general in 17 states, including D.C., led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harvard and MIT had a remote hearing to share a case against ICE's rule, which would have put the lives of millions of international students in jeopardy. Within minutes of the hearing, Homeland Security agreed to revoke its initial plans to only allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking in-person classes.</p><p>The new guidance, which is based on March 9 guidelines, will only benefit students who are currently enrolled. This leaves in flux new students or individuals set to come to the United States in the fall.</p><p>The rule, announced last Monday, was broadly met with fury from the academic community. Yale Law School's Dean, Heather Gerken, posted a statement in opposition to the rule.</p><p>July 15: OfferAll lnc: Adam Neumann is back in the shared economy business with an investment in GoTo Global</p><p>Adam Neumann, the controversial co-founder and former CEO of WeWork, has taken a 33% equity stake in GoTo Global, a shared mobility company that operates in Israel and Malta and aims to expand into Europe later this year.</p><p>Neumann's family office, 166 2nd Financial Services, invested $10 million into GoTo Global, as part of a $19 million Series B round. As part of his investment, Neumann will be able to appoint one board member on his behalf. Existing shareholder Shagrir Group Vehicle Services, a publicly traded Israeli company, also participated in the round.</p><p>GoTo Global (also referred to is GoTo Mobility) is mobility-as-a-service company that is aiming to cover the entire range of shared vehicles from cars and mopeds to bicycles and electric scooters. The company, which started in 2008 with a focus on car-sharing, previously raised $3 million in seed funding. It had also secured a $9 million loan from Shagrir, which has been converted into the equity investment.</p><p>This latest funding will be used to expand its shared services into Europe, beginning with Madrid.</p><p>Since forming 166 2nd Financial Services, Neumann has made about 15 investments in startups in Canada, Israel, UK and the United States, including EquityBee, Moon Active and Peach Street.</p><p>However, this is Neumann's first investment since he filed a lawsuit against Softbank Group for alleged breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty for pulling a $3 billion tender offer for WeWork shares.</p><p>July 14: OfferAll lnc: Announcing The TechCrunch List, a founder-friendly directory of first check and lead VCs</p><p>Nothing is more important for founders than finding their first check or the investor who will lead their round, and yet, finding the right VCs to invest in their startups is an arduous and agonizing prospect. By some counts, there are now tens of thousands of VCs scattered across all corners of the globe, investing in dozens of verticals across multiple stages of investing.</p><p>Who really invests in a particular space? Who really writes checks at the seed stage or the Series A? Who really is willing to lead a round before any other investors commit?</p><p>Here at TechCrunch, it's one of the most common questions founders ask us, and also one of the most challenging questions to answer. So we decided to launch a new initiative to help guide founders to some of the investment leaders who can help catalyze a fundraise.

You can head over to the list itself to see all 391 investors across 22 verticals.</p><p>Beyond the final compiled list though, there was an even more elite group of investors who a wide number of founders just raved about in their recommendations. So while The TechCrunch List is a free resource for all founders, over here on Extra Crunch, we wanted to place special attention on a short list of 11 investors that founders were particularly effusive in their praise.</p><p>Let's take a look.</p><p>Note: Recommendations were submitted \"on the record.\" However, out of an abundance of caution for the founders and their startups, we have elided certain specific details from these recommendations.

The biggest surprise? It's how little impact the global pandemic seems to have had on dealmaking this spring.</p><p>Consider first that valuations in April were actually higher than in March, and that despite massive layoffs in the tech sector, so-called up-rounds only declined modestly, from 72% in March to 70% in April.</p><p>In fact, though you'd think the massive disruptions prompted by virus would accelerate things wildly, it looks more like the steady continuation of a trend that began last year, when 83% of financings saw companies receive higher valuations.</p><p>Our guess is this shift really happened around the time of WeWork's pulled IPO last fall, which seemingly reminded investors that what goes up - and up - sometimes comes down fast, too. But it does beg the question: what about down rounds? Surely, there were a lot of these this spring (you might imagine), including startups in the travel industry or that count the travel industry as a customer. But again, Fenwick's data, at least, tells a different story. The number of deals that were marked down by investors accounted for just 12% of all deal volume in April; that's even lower than in March, when 16% of companies experienced down rounds.</p><p>It does make sense, considering that the data is specific to April alone, especially when accounting for the many startups that have been thrown a longer lifeline by their investors in the form of extensions to earlier rounds that were closed earlier this year or late last year.</p><p>SECTION 4 PRESS RELEASES: 2016</p><p>June 15: OfferAll lnc.: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquires One Kings Lane for undisclosed sum</p><p>Home furnishings site One Kings Lane has found a home of its own, with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The retailer announced a cash acquisition of the e-commerce startup, but the price was not disclosed.</p><p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a public company, so that means it needs to announce acquisition prices if the purchase is considered material. That could be up to about 15% of the company's $6.5 billion market cap.</p><p>But as Dan Primack pointed out on Twitter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had under $600 million in cash (closer to $500m) as of its last earnings. This suggests that the purchase price was substantially lower than One Kings Lane last valuation of its previous valuation above $912 million.</p><p>There was already talk that One Kings Lane could sell for as low as $150 million. Considering the company has raised at least $225 million, this is a very disappointing outcome for investors, which include Kleiner Perkins and Greylock.</p><p>The One Kings Lane acquisition draws similarities to Gilt, which was acquired by Saks Fifth Avenue owner, Hudson Bay, earlier this year. Both are e-commerce sites that gained traction with consumers when \"flash sale\" sites were more popular. But significant competition made it difficult to raise prices.</p><p>\"We are excited to be part of the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond family,\" said Dinesh Lathi, Chief Executive Officer of One Kings Lane, in a statement. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for our customers, as well as our employees and business partners, to benefit from additional support and resources and gain exposure to new customers.

The company has also previously brought in close to $2 Billion in debt financing from what is effectively a Wall Street credit line. This is the first time Uber is considering higher risk leveraged loans.</p><p>Leveraged loans typically have higher interest rates than traditional debt financing. It is also common for such loans to have variable rate interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, Uber is looking to secure a 4-4.5 percent yield.</p><p>Uber is betting heavily on international expansion and is going to need a lot of capital to accomplish that.

Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. </p><p>Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'. The EU views EV adoption as a key pillar of its decarbonisation aims (carbon neutrality by 2050), with transport currently accounting for an estimated 25.0% of total emissions. We view a significant expansion of EV charging infrastructure as a prerequisite to mass EV adoption in the bloc, in order to alleviate visceral 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. More automakers will then invest resources into EV production, with more diverse EV product line-ups produced at a greater scale translating into more affordable prices for consumers. These factors inform our forecast that EV sales will proliferate by 358.0% over the coming decade, increasing from a forecast of 525,000 units sold in 2020 to over 2.4mn in 2029 (see chart below).</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: Government Support To Drive Pakistan Power Sector Growth</p><p>Pakistan's power capacity will experience robust growth over the coming decade, at an annual average rate of over 5%, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

Our view is underpinned by ongoing efforts to support structural reforms in the sector, as well as the progress of projects despite the Covid-19 pandemic and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor controversies. We also expect to see a notable change in the Pakistan electricity generation mix over the coming decade, as the government shifts its focus away from expensive diesel power towards alternative generation sources. We maintain our view that Pakistan's power sector will experience robust growth over the coming decade, in line with a strong government commitment to prioritise the development of the sector to support economic growth. Pakistan has long faced power supply issues due to the ongoing disparity between electricity supply and demand due to a lack of generation capacity and insufficient investment. </p><p>Ongoing efforts to reduce barriers of entry for foreign investors in other sectors and boost industrial and manufacturing activities is also expected to lead in a surge in power demand over the coming years. Given the government's increasing focus on expanding domestic power capacity and boosting funding for the sector, there has been an increase in investor interest, particularly from Chinese companies as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has expanded the project pipeline notably. We forecast power capacity to grow by an annual average of 5.3% over the coming decade to reach over 72GW by 2029.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BUSINESS MONITOR INTERNATIONAL INC.

The sale of food, beverages and tobacco is the only consumer category to post a significant improvement from the May 2020 lows. This is a result of households prioritising their budgets towards necessities. Household goods and other discretionary spending has been severely impacted by demand-side risks, as consumers avoid crowded areas, including shopping malls. The economic realities of the pandemic have also fed through into retail sales figures, suggesting that the recovery will be slow over the rest of 2020. Total Retail Sales Are Improving As Restrictions Ease</p><p>Total retail sales in Indonesia contracted for its seventh consecutive month in July 2020, at -12.3% y-o-y. However, while still bleak, figures do point to a slow and broad recovery in retail sales, with July marking an improvement compared to June, when retail sales contracted by -17.1% y-o-y. May 2020 saw the worst contraction in retail sales, at -20.6% y-o-y. The recovery in retail sales is clearly following the reopening of the Indonesian economy and the relaxation of movement restrictions.</p><p>August 28: Business Monitor International Inc.: EU Decarbonisation Initiatives To Accelerate EV And Micromobility Adoption</p><p>The EU's 'European Green Deal' and its prospective 'Next Generation EU' recovery package will accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the bloc, albeit to varying degrees among member states. Investment into EV charging infrastructure from EU associated institutions, local authorities, publicly owned utilities and the private sector will drive growth in the European EV fleet by alleviating 'range anxiety' concerns among consumers. We note that disparities in EV fleet penetration among member states will remain, owing to endogenous factors including in the breadth and quality of charging infrastructure, national incentives and social sentiment. Decarbonisation efforts bode well for the adoption of integrated micromobility solutions, providing opportunities for automakers in that space. The EU will solidify its position as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the coming decade as it facilitates an uptick in investment into associated charging infrastructure. Representing the bloc's collective fiscal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the EUR750bn 'Next Generation EU' (NGEU) fund aligns spending initiatives with the EU's green infrastructure and broader decarbonisation push, epitomised by the 'European Green Deal'.</p><p>August 27: Business Monitor International Inc.: Sub-Saharan Africa Telecoms: Submarine Cable Developments</p><p>We anticipate higher Sub-Saharan African international bandwidth demand throughout our forecast period to 2029, driven by changing data consumption trends at consumer level and a digitising enterprise base.

Tread lightly--especially if you're planning to require Covid-19 testing. Businesses must comply with a raft of health regulations and protect employee privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In April, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Department of Labor authorized the practice of collecting medical information such as taking temperatures. The government also approved conducting Covid-19 tests in the workplace, which employers typically couldn't do. \"I think there is a general need to know that the person walking into your facility does not have a fever currently,\" says Erin McLaughlin, labor and employment attorney at Pittsburgh-based law firm Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney. Testing in general, she says, and keeping track that employees who are coming into the workplace are healthy may give your business a layer of liability protection in case someone does get sick.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 HYBRIS GMBH PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>hybris GmbH operates as a vendor of multi-channel communication and commerce software solutions.

Revenue: $1.06 billion, vs. $1.04 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>Revenue increased by about 20% from a year earlier in the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. Growth was down from 23% one quarter earlier.</p><p>Workday, whose software is used for financial management and human resources, said it now expects $3.73 billion to $3.74 billion in subscription revenue in fiscal 2021, up from a forecast in May of $3.67 billion to $3.69 billion.</p><p>Workday said it's seeing growth among companies that need help navigating Covid-19, keeping them engaged with employees who are working remotely. It's also partnered with IBM to help companies prepare their workplaces for a safe return as offices start to reopen.</p><p>In naming Fernandez as co-CEO, Workday is returning to a dual leadership structure it had at the time of its 2012 IPO, when Bhusri shared the role with co-founder Dave Duffield. Bhusri became sole CEO, when Duffield stepped down in 2014 and assumed the chairman role. Workday is going in the opposite direction of Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, which have recently switched from having two CEOs to having just one.</p><p>Fernandez joined Workday in 2014 from SAP, where he had been a senior vice president. In his new role he will run the company's sales, marketing and customer support.</p><p>Two likeminded CEOs are better than one, Bhusri said on a conference call with analysts.</p><p>\"I'm more of a product person and strategy person, and I personally would like to get back to working with our product teams and our venture teams and our strategy teams on where we go in the future,\" he said.</p><p>July 15: hybris GmbH: Wirecard Boasted of Hundreds of Partnerships. Some Were Less Than Meets the Eye.</p><p>Before it unraveled in an accounting scandal, Wirecard AG built up an image as a fast-growing financial technology company. It spewed out news releases publicizing partnerships with blue-chip names such as SAP SE, Zurich Insurance Group and SoftBank Group Corp.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal found that some of those partnership announcements were misleading or were promoted without the agreement of the companies involved. The Journal reached out to more than 300 companies with which Wirecard said it had entered partnerships or collaborations.</p><p>.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 15: hybris GmbH: SAP Fieldglass launches free External Talent Marketplace in response to coronavirus, labor market changes</p><p>SAP Fieldglass, a leading global external workforce and services management solution, this week announced the launch of its External Talent Marketplace.</p><p>The offering, which is free to use in the U.S. for a limited time, is intended to address a supply-and-demand gap in today's arguably much more dynamic business environment that's affected by the coronavirus disruption and job losses, and it provides a win-win solution for U.S. hiring organizations and staffing firms. The free offer, which expires Dec. 31, 2020, is available online to organizations that do not use SAP Fieldglass' core solutions.</p><p>According to the announcement, SAP Fieldglass External Talent Marketplace provides a single, central place where businesses looking for temporary workers and staffing firms with vetted candidates can find each other to more quickly fill open jobs. Staffing firms currently participating in the marketplace include majors like Adecco; Experis, a ManpowerGroup brand; Guidant Global and its staffing affiliates S.com, Corestaff and SRG; KellyOCG; and Randstad US.</p><p>Spend Matters spoke with the SAP Fieldglass team, which said the solution was conceived months ago when it was understood that while demand for workers in some sectors had sharply declined, demand in other sectors - like healthcare, pharma and some manufacturing, retail and technology - was surging. Companies in these and other verticals were looking for workers, but finding them was very challenging. There was a fundamental disconnect between supply and demand. The External Talent Marketplace was created to help bridge this gap.</p><p>SAP Fieldglass said that, depending on the state of the coronavirus pandemic and the uptake by organizations and staffing firms, access to the Marketplace could be extended.</p><p>The External Talent Marketplace enables companies to search for available temporary workers from multiple staffing firms, create job postings from scratch or using templates, and automatically send job postings to staffing firms to speed up sourcing.</p><p>July 10: hybris GmbH: Clariba partners with SAP clients for intelligent enterprise</p><p>At its recent user conference, SAP made a case for its vision of the intelligent enterprise, but the concept still lacks clarity for many customers.</p><p>SAP defines the intelligent enterprise as a digital transformation, or the digitizing of existing processes and business models to enable the new processes and systems. The overhaul emphasizes analytics, data-driven decision-making and cloud-based technologies, and it enables companies to develop business models that monetize data in new ways.</p><p>For companies to undertake such a transformation, SAP will need help from its partners, said Marc Haberland, founder and managing director at Clariba, an SAP partner. Clariba has engaged in its own digital transformation and now develops applications and methods for SAP customers to do the same.</p><p>Clariba, based in Barcelona and Dubai, is a 20-year-old firm that started out as a consultancy for BusinessObjects, business intelligence platform technology that SAP acquired in 2007. In addition, Clariba is focused on SAP's vision of an intelligent enterprise and is developing data-driven intelligent enterprise applications, including one currently being used by the Italian National Football Federation.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: Canadian business travellers view mobile check-ins as most important feature for future travel</p><p>More than half of Canadian business travellers say they have positive feelings about travelling again once COVID restrictions are lifted, provided there is effective tech in place to help them travel for business safely. And most Canadians expect mobile check-ins to perform a lot of the leg work.</p><p>Over 50 per cent of Canadian business travellers, in a recent survey of 200 Canadian business travellers by SAP Concur, say that mobile check-ins will be the most important mobile app features when travel resumes. For the same question, only 41 per cent of respondents globally felt the same way.</p><p>When travel starts, 24 per cent Canadian business travellers say they're most likely to start their booking with online travel agencies, while 22 per cent say they will book directly with an airline or hotel website/app. Comparatively, only 18 per cent expect to first use their company's travel booking tool or go to their company's travel agency, and 17 per cent expect to use internet search engines.</p><p>Most of those surveyed said that they expect their company to experience negative outcomes due to travel restrictions around COVID-19, with 51 per cent noting it will result in a reduced number of deals or contracts signed that require in-person interactions and 44 per cent saying it would lead to declines in new business wins that require in-person meetings.</p><p>\"Our research shows that travel will continue to play an irreplaceable role in meeting critical business demands.</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: U.S. big tech dominates stock market after monster rally, leaving investors on edge</p><p>U.S. technology giants are increasingly dominating the stock market in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, even as they draw accusations of unfair business practices, and some investors fear the pump is primed for a tech-fueled sell-off. FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen placed on a keyboard in this illustration taken March 25, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</p><p>The combined value of the S&amp;P 500's five biggest companies - Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) - now stands at more than $7 trillion, accounting for almost 25% of the index's market capitalization. That compares with less than 20% pre-pandemic.</p><p>The quintet's burgeoning share prices reflect a transition to an increasingly technology-driven economy that has been accelerated by the coronavirus outbreak, as doorways fill with Amazon packages, homebound families stream movies and friends commiserate on Facebook.</p><p>Yet the companies are drawing opposition. U.S. lawmakers are accusing them of stifling competition, a charge also leveled in recent days against Apple by Epic Games, creator of the popular game Fortnite.</p><p>Some investors worry the companies powering this year's equity rally could become the market's Achilles' heel if a legal assault, a shift to undervalued names or a move higher in bond yields dries up appetite for technology stocks.</p><p>\"People see these companies as winners and investors are willing to pay any price to own them,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.</p><p>August 27: hybris GmbH: Managing Digital Transformation Amid New Working Models</p><p>Many businesses continue to invest in digital transformation initiatives as they recognize deficiencies and address emerging needs in their IT infrastructure during this time. This is especially true of CFOs, who are managing tighter budgets and seeking new solutions that better control company spend and catch financial errors. These CFOs are on the hunt for tools that can adjust to the unique problems of home offices and hybrid working models and ongoing risk assessment.</p><p>But selecting a new solution is only half the battle. Orchestrating a tech overhaul - or even just adding a new tool to the mix - can be daunting and, without the right process, lead to low adoption levels across an organization. While typically a tech project, IT departments are more strapped than ever. According to a survey, global IT leaders' top concerns right now are network connectivity and security.</p><p>Thus, the job falls to finance. CFOs may find themselves asked to spearhead new technology adoptions, which can provide tremendous value for their company with the right approach. These tips can help put CFOs on the right track toward a successful implementation:</p><p>Find the right tool. When selecting a tool, prioritize technological advancements that provide more control and drive better compliance.</p><p>August 22: hybris GmbH: SAP's Dan Lahl Looks Back at SAP HANA's First Decade</p><p>Earlier this year marked the tenth anniversary of the release of SAP HANA, the software company's database management system. SAP HANA has been vital to the innovations of SAP software over the past decade, and instrumental to a lot of the software company's success.</p><p>ASUG recently sat down with Dan Lahl, global vice president of product marketing at SAP, to talk about the legacy of SAP HANA. The conversation also focused on what made the platform a success, and how it's still evolving.</p><p>Jim: SAP HANA just celebrated its tenth birthday. What were some of the highlights from SAP HANA's first decade? Dan Lahl, Global Vice President of Product Marketing, SAP</p><p>Dan: What SAP HANA has been able to accomplish is amazing. SAP HANA has the ability to establish in-memory column databases that provide the unique ability to do transactions and analytics in the same instance and at the same time. Historically, you would capture transactions in one database and then extract that information out of the database into a data warehouse. Then, you had to reorganize that information into a data warehousing storage format before analyzing it.

It was founded in 1986 as a state-owned private company out of what used to be known as Post Office Counters.</p><p>In recent years the firm has struggled with losses and most recently was at the center of a major political row involving an abortive IT project, Horizon. And of course, this year, in common with every organization across every business sector, the COVID-19 crisis has brought fresh challenges. As James Scutt, Head of Customer Experience Strategy and Deployment, told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event:</p><p>I've worked for the Post Office for about 15 years now and during that time I've seen so many changes take place, but none as big as the changes we made during COVID-19, and certainly those changes weren't made as fast as well.</p><p>The importance of the Post Office as part of the UK landscape cannot be understated. In the UK, there are over 11,500 branches with an estimated 99.7% of the country's population living within 3 miles of one. Today, the firm offers more than 170 different products and services.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: 3 Actionable Insights with SAP global CMO Alicia Tillman</p><p>What does it take for a global B2B brand to succeed today? SAP's Alicia Tillman, who was named by Forbes as one of the most influential CMOs in the world, shares her actionable insights that will help marketers lead the way forward during this moment and beyond.</p><p>Multinational enterprise software company SAP was founded 48 years ago with a purpose of helping the world run better and to improve people's lives. As businesses struggle with the daily challenges of the ongoing pandemic, those objectives need to be met more than ever. Global chief marketer Alicia Tillman, who has grown SAP's brand value has grown to more than $18bn during her tenure, takes time out to talk to The Drum about how marketers must evolve to meet clients' needs. Here are the three top actions that Tillman recommends:</p><p>1. Maintain a daily, global perspective about your customers' needs.</p><p>\"Know what's going on outside of the walls of your company. Even though we are all experiencing a global pandemic, the effect of it is different by geography and region, and it evolves by the day. Understand the effect it has on the customer you serve. And then know what you have in your company that can best serve them - how it's valuable and how you position it effectively so they know you're there to help, how you can help and what they need to do to be able to embrace your help.\"</p><p>2.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: Heres What It Takes To Be a Supply Chain Leader in 2020</p><p>A recent study by SAP and Oxford Economics found that 12% of the top 1,000 supply chain performers proved to have more resilient supply chains. In this article, Richard Howells, vice president of solution management for SAP Digital Supply Chain, dives into these characteristics that led companies to become supply chain leaders.</p><p>At the start of 2020, when experts were talking about \"Vision 2020\", nobody predicted that we were entering a global pandemic that would bring the global economy to a virtual standstill within weeks. With the pandemic, came a highly variable demand for goods and services; an uncertain supply of critical Materials; constrained labor and resource capacity in manufacturing and logistics. All these factors, along with many others, resulted in reduced revenue, profits, and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Supply chains have been brought to the forefront and are now a regular discussion in presidential briefings, executive board rooms, and dining room tables. One thing is for sure - unexpected disruptions that adversely affect supply chains will continue to occur. The causes of disruptions will vary from pandemics or geopolitical or trade conflicts to natural disasters or the limited availability of natural resources.</p><p>August 20: hybris GmbH: How Southwest Airlines helps employees to be the face of the brand, even behind a mask</p><p>Among the sectors most dramatically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, the travel industry has been one of those hit most hard - and Southwest Airlines has been no exception. As Laurie Winters, Senior Director of Culture and Engagement at the airline told the recent Qualtrics Work Different event, this has led to a need to re-think how the firm operates:</p><p>With the unprecedentedly low load factors on our flights, coupled with the absolute unpredictability of the virus, we needed to adjust very quickly. Many of our customers needed us to fulfil our purpose to connect them to what's important in their lives. After all, people needed to return home to care for loved ones and travel to temporary medical assignments.</p><p>One manifestation of how the airline has responded is with its Southwest Promise, published in May to promote the measures taken to keep passengers safe, including personal protection and wellness, disinfection and cleaning regimes onboard planes and in airports and measures to support social distancing, such as limiting passenger numbers, changing boarding and deplaning routines and using mobile boarding passes on smartphones.</p><p>But there's another vital constituency, Winters reminded the Qualtrics audience, that of the Southwest Airlines employee base:</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: Tech IPOs brush aside election concerns as investors seek growth</p><p>In most presidential election years, conventional wisdom says the IPO window closes by mid-summer so that companies avoid the shadow of the November contest, a time when markets can be jittery.</p><p>That convention doesn't apply this year. The country is mired in the worst pandemic in a century and suffered its steepest-ever quarterly plunge in economic activity in the second quarter. Yet the equity markets are rallying, and tech stocks are trading at historical premiums.</p><p>In polls, Democratic candidate Joe Biden holds a commanding lead over President Donald Trump. Wall Street may like Trump, but it's OK with Biden, who was vice president during much of the bull market, which started shortly after Barack Obama took office in 2009.</p><p>For high-growth software companies eyeing the public market, that means talks with bankers are quickly ramping up.</p><p>\"We could find ourselves in a very strong second half here as we go into the elections,\" said Jackie Kelley, Americas IPO and strategic transactions leader at Ernst &amp; Young.</p><p>\"We're already seeing increased IPO activity over the last couple weeks. As long as markets stay stable, I think we have good runway to get a significant amount of this backlog out into the markets.\"</p><p>In particular, investors are thirsty for resilient business models that have shown elements of being Covid-proof.</p><p>August 06: hybris GmbH: HPE, SAP to deliver SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake</p><p>HPE and SAP on Thursday said they're partnering up to deliver the customer edition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake, HPE's h, its as-a-service platform.

For many companies, the scope for international reach has moved from a dream to a realistic and tangible reality-at least since they have had access to technology and logistics to aid this process. The business an organization secures is no longer limited by borders.</p><p>However, this seamless access has opened the door to some less pleasant realities of international trade. The more data businesses are generating, the more complex the analysis landscape becomes. How are finance teams expected to cope with these new volumes of information? Moving out of home territory and into unknown government trading law is an underlying issue firms often overlook. The fact is, in each government jurisdiction the tax transactions taking place and regulations around this are an ever-shifting minefield of compliance complexity.</p><p>Misunderstandings are costly in business, that much is true. For multinational businesses, there can be some serious missed opportunities where finance teams are not fully acquainted with the detail of tax law or are too time-poor to dedicate hours to unraveling complex value-added tax (VAT) regulation.</p><p>July 13: hybris GmbH: Australia Post road tests its transformation scope with staff first</p><p>Australia Post used SAP Qualtrics to source ideas and scope internal sentiment towards its current business transformation.</p><p>Executive general manager for transformation and enablement, John Cox, told SAP's HR Connect conference that AusPost is also using Qualtrics to manage employee fatigue after a challenging first half of the year.</p><p>Cox said AusPost is a \"big user\" of Qualtrics, which became part of SAP in early 2019.</p><p>\"It's really important to understand the state that our teams are in [and] how they're feeling,\" he said.</p><p>Cox was recently elevated from CIO to his current transformation role, and said AusPost used Qualtrics to scope the extent of its transformation efforts as well as to measure internal attitudes towards change.</p><p>\"I've recently just come into this role and one of the key things we did was understand how our people were feeling, how they felt about transforming the company, what their involvement would be, how much they were willing to change, and what they thought we should change,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's been a really valuable set of insights that are helping guide us where we want to go.\"</p><p>Outside of the transformation effort, Cox highlighted the pressure AusPost staff are under generally, handling huge increases in parcel volumes and service experience expectations of customers.</p><p>PermID: 4296929582</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NBPCOM-2908201226283787000147580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PM-J2P1-JB4F-Y37W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5445\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

Double win in the 'Best ESG Solutions' category for service to Cargill and Payoneer, evidencing Deutsche Bank's market-leading expertise in this critical sector.</p><p>David Lynne, Deutsche Bank's Head of Fixed Income &amp; Currencies, APAC and Corporate Bank, APAC said: \"We are honoured to receive this recognition that reflects the depth and breadth of our solutions and the strength of our client partnerships across the region.</p><p>June 30: Deutsche Bank signs climate commitment</p><p>Today Deutsche Bank signed the climate commitment of the German financial sector. By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

The initiative will make the city-state of Singapore Deutsche Bank's fourth global FX centre, along with New York, London and Tokyo.</p><p>The Singapore e-FX hub will provide clients with the ability to execute FX transactions more closely aligned with geographic location, reducing latency, improving on local price transparency and liquidity.</p><p>Deutsche Bank Head of Fixed Income and Currencies APAC, Head of Corporate Bank APAC and Chief Country Officer, Singapore David Lynne said, \"Given the substantial increase in demand for Asia currency e-FX we have seen in the past five years, growing client sophistication in e-FX trading, and the MAS' focus on further developing the leading FX centre in the region, hubbing this activity in Singapore makes perfect sense.\"</p><p>The Deutsche Bank e-FX hub will be developed and staffed locally, and will be aligned to Deutsche Bank's focus across e-trading, fintech clients and digital FX payments.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore Executive Director, Financial Markets Development, Ms. Gillian Tan said: \"We are heartened by Deutsche Bank's commitment to build its fourth global FX electronic pricing and trading engine in Singapore, which will complement its APAC fixed income &amp; currencies and global transaction businesses operating here. This will allow Deutsche Bank to build on its strengths as a key global FX player and support its regional clients with enhanced price discovery and execution from Singapore, while leveraging Singapore's strengths as Asia's pre-eminent FX centre.\"</p><p>As global cross border payment processes rapidly move towards being completely digital, Deutsche Bank will further develop its Singapore infrastructure to be the payments hub for transactional FX business in APAC.</p><p>April 17: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Quantifying the fiscal costs from corona virus</p><p>The German government has responded quickly and decisively to the economic fallout from the corona pandemic. Altogether, Germany's anti-crisis measures - consisting of extra spending, guarantees and loan/participation programs - sum up to an astronomic value of around EUR 1.9 tr (well above 50% of GDP in 2019). This gives the government huge scope to fight the pandemic and economic crisis. In this note we try to quantify Germany's fiscal costs from the corona crisis.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>September 08: Deutsche Bank's education programmes go digital</p><p>Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the education system has been constantly changing. More than 90 percent of all students were not allowed to attend school, according to the UNESCO World Education Report 2020. And even now, many students still have to study online. These restrictions have impacted equal opportunities and high-quality education, especially for children from financially weaker and disadvantaged backgrounds. This year's International Literacy Day 2020 on September 8 therefore focuses on \"Literacy teaching and learning in the COVID-19 crisis and beyond\", especially on the role of educators and changing pedagogies.</p><p>\"The pandemic further increases inequalities in the education system. We embrace the current dynamics and have developed digital enhancements to our programmes that will reach students, even if studying at home\", says Lareena Hilton, Global Head of Brand &amp; Corporate Social Responsibility, Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Baut Eure Zukunft</p><p>Together with our partner organisations, we have adapted many of our Born to Be youth engagement programmes to meet the current restrictions. New online platforms now complement traditional classroom settings to reach everyone everywhere, like our Baut Eure Zukuft (Build your Future) project, which encourages students in grades 8 to 10 to work against social challenges like bullying, violence and racism.</p><p>September 08: New report from Deutsche Bank Research analyst Apjit Walia reveals America's racial gap in big tech</p><p>A new Deutsche Bank Research report, America's Racial Gap &amp; Big Tech's Closing Window, uncovers a host of stark statistics on the digital racial gap and possible long-term employment implications for minorities.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Global Head of Technology Investment Strategy Apjit Walia conducted the bottom-up societal study and concluded that if this \"digital racial gap is not addressed, in one generation alone, digitization could render the country's minorities into an unemployment abyss.\"</p><p>Walia found the data to be more glaring than expected, as indicated in some of the key findings:</p><p>Given the exponential growth of the digital economy, 76 percent of Blacks and 62 percent of Hispanics could get shut out from or be under-prepared for 86 percent of jobs in the US by 2045 Blacks and Hispanics are 10 years behind Whites in levels of broadband access and almost 4 times more Blacks have poorer tech connectivity than Whites While 83 percent of Whites own a personal computer, that rate drops to 60 percent for Blacks and 51 percent for Hispanics Just over 1 out of 20 Blacks feel privacy is a primary concern as it relates to tech Only 1 in 3 Americans now hold a positive view of Big Tech</p><p>Can Big Tech close the gap?</p><p>Big Tech can play a critical role in finding a solution.</p><p>September 03: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: We're here to help position Deutsche Bank as an expert on ESG</p><p>Trisha Taneja Trisha Taneja always wanted a career that contributed to building a more sustainable world. Her first stint in sustainability was in the non-profit sector, where she spent several years managing large programs in areas like global health and microfinance. When she decided to make the leap to the private sector because of her \"firm belief that private capital can make a significant difference in accelerating the shift to a sustainable economy\", she first completed a Finance degree before joining Sustainalytics, an ESG rating agency.</p><p>As global head of green and sustainable bonds, Taneja was responsible for growing the issuer side of the business, new product development and commercializing ESG products for issuers.</p><p>Then Deutsche Bank came calling</p><p>\"I'm quite entrepreneurial, and ESG is a fast-moving market, so the opportunity to grow the bank's Sustainable Finance business further really appealed to me. It's an exciting new venture,\" said Taneja, whose experience helping more than 200 issuers with their green and sustainable bonds directly translates to her new role at Deutsche Bank. As the Green, Social, Sustainable bonds (GSS) market is only about five or six years old, it can be a challenge to find someone with experience working with different types of issuers, whether that's corporates, banks or sovereigns, in different countries and regions.</p><p>\"Our mandate is two-fold: first, we want to act as ESG advisors to the bank's clients, helping position Deutsche Bank as an expert on ESG,\" she explained.</p><p>August 28: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: New CIO Special: The 'G' in ESG: Governance ' a question of balance</p><p>Coronavirus and its economic impact have put a renewed focus on corporate governance - the subject of the latest special report by Deutsche Bank's International Private Bank on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) themes.</p><p>The report argues that:</p><p>Governance is a source of corporate resilience. During the pandemic, good governance has allowed firms not only to maintain basic functions, such as cash flow and fulfilling contractual obligations, but has also helped them to keep their workforce and customers safe. The scope of governance will widen further in future. The socio-economic effects of this crisis, including the growing involvement of governments in many areas, will put new demands on corporate governance. Environmental aspects are also likely to stay prominent. Future governance changes will require a sense of balance. In a constantly changing environment, new approaches will need to evolve to address a range of concerns in a financially sustainable way that balances the needs of individuals, governments, corporates and investors.</p><p>The report provides an overview of governance components and studies their impact on firms' performance. It also includes a brief history of corporate governance and a guest contribution on governance in German family-owned firms.</p><p>August 26: Deutsche Bank acts as joint marketing coordinator for educating investors on the Federal Republic of Germany's inaugural Green Bond</p><p>Germany has just published its Green Bond Framework and is now marketing its inaugural Green German Federal Security Deutsche Bank is acting as joint marketing coordinator to ensure a smooth investor education process The inaugural Green German Federal Security is to be issued within the next few weeks</p><p>Over the last six months Germany has developed its first Green Bond Framework, joining several other countries such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands in the Green Bond market. With today's publication of the Framework, Germany, acting via the German Finance Agency, is now formally in the position to issue Green German Federal Securities, setting the scene for its ambition to establish them as the interest rate benchmark for the euro green finance market within a short period of time.</p><p>THE TWIN BOND CONCEPT - A UNIQUE ISSUANCE APPROACH</p><p>In practice, Germany plans to set up a green yield curve for the euro area, matching the maturities as on the conventional curve. Market participants with different investment horizons will have at their disposal a green, transparent investment opportunity with first-class credit quality. For that purpose, a unique issuance approach has been adopted: each new Green German Federal security will always be issued alongside an existing, conventional German Federal security, with exactly the same characteristics, i.e.</p><p>August 26: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Applications open for second Female FinTech Competition</p><p>Deutsche Bank has joined forces with Atos, Google Cloud and TechQuartier to launch the second Female FinTech Competition.</p><p>FinTechs with a female founder or female(s) in the top management groups are invited to enter the competition to pitch their business case.

What if Deutsche Bank had an app that could track clients' carbon footprints and help them save money by challenging their behaviour? And what if this app could also help those clients reinvest those extra savings in a more responsible way?</p><p>This idea became GreenR, a prototype developed as part of the Intrapreneur Initiative. GreenR will allow users to clearly see their personal environmental footprint. It will link directly to your Deutsche Bank accounts and translate your last six months of bank transactions- from where and what you eat, to how you move around - into how much C02 you produce.</p><p>Once a pattern emerges, GreenR will present a set of challenges designed to reduce your C02 footprint by, for example, helping you buy more local products, eat less meat or cycle more. For things you cannot change, like needing to fly, you can offset your carbon footprint by investing in environmental projects.</p><p>GreenR Logo \"Typically you have the option to donate to specific environmental projects to offset your C02 output. This is money you won't see again,\" said Saenz de Alba, a mathematician originally from Mexico. \"Our idea is to instead have a range of investments focused on environmental projects that, for example, help to reduce C02 or to reforest, so you're getting both an economic and an environmental return.</p><p>August 19: Deutsche Bank named Best Corporate Trust Bank in APAC and Best Domestic Custodian in four regional markets</p><p>The Asset Magazine has named Deutsche Bank \"Best Corporate Trust Bank\" in Asia Pacific and \"Best Domestic Custodian\" in four markets at their 2020 Sustainable Investing Institutional Investor, ETF and Asset Servicing Awards.

Close cooperation between the industry, governments and academia is necessary to meet these ambitions and open questions regarding the realisation and compatibility of the policy objectives need to be addressed along the way. During the pandemic, the role of the state in the EU economies has strengthened substantially. Hot political debates about normalising the market mechanism and reinstating state aid rules can be expected over the next years. Risks are that even post-COVID, there might be calls for continued exemptions to the European state aid and competition rules. This could lead to lasting distortions of the single market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INDEX</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2020</p><p>SECTION 4 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 DEUTSCHE BANK AG RESEARCH DIVISION PROFILE</p><p>1.1 SUMMARY</p><p>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD\">http://www.dbresearch.com/servlet/reweb2.ReWEB?rwsite=DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD</url></p><p>Industry: Capital Markets</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>September 10: Deutsche Bank wins 'World's Best Bank Transformation' in prestigious Euromoney awards</p><p>Deutsche Bank has won a prestigious Euromoney award for \"World's Best Bank Transformation\" for the progress it has made in the strategic transformation it launched last year to become stronger, more efficient and better positioned for the future.</p><p>\"It's clear that Deutsche Bank has resisted the distractions in market conditions that might have grabbed all its attention in the past,\" the editorial team of the leading industry publication wrote in announcing the award today. \"Its transformation is still a work in progress, but its achievements so far deserve recognition.\"</p><p>Deutsche Bank's \"compete to win\" strategy, announced in July last year, was to refocus on its core strengths, to do so within its own, existing capital resources, and to become sustainably profitable. It aimed to become more stable, innovative, trustworthy, excellent - and relevant, to its clients, to its investors, and to society as a whole.</p><p>\"Hard work pays off,\" said Christian Sewing, Chief Executive Officer in a note to employees, thanking them for their \"passion and contribution\". \"Our transformation is gaining traction, not just in financial terms but also in tonality and recognition from all of the bank's stakeholders\", he said.</p><p>The bank set clear short-term and mid-term targets and accountabilities for financial and non-financial objectives through to 2022 and has achieved all of its major objectives since then.</p><p>It completed business exits, including cash equities trading and equity derivatives, agreed on the transfer of Global Prime Finance and has been reshaping businesses, including Rates. It has significantly reduced Risk Weighted Assets through the Capital Release Unit; is delivering significant cost reductions on target; and, despite the challenges of the coronavirus crisis, has maintained a strong capital ratio above the threshold.</p><p>Recent landmarks have included launching the International Private Bank; merging the German legal entities; reorganising DWS; integrating the Corporate Bank in Germany; and creating a holistic Chief Risk Office function.</p><p>\"Deutsche Bank is changing for the better,\" said Fabrizio Campelli, Management Board member and Chief Transformation Officer, who made the formal pitch for the award.</p><p>August 18: Deutsche Bank appoints Vietnam Country Chief</p><p>Deutsche Bank today announced the appointment of respected Vietnamese banker, Huynh Buu Quang, as Acting Chief Country Officer (CCO) Vietnam, pending State Bank of Vietnam final approval.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Asia Pacific Chief Executive Officer Alexander von zur Muehlen, said: \"With Vietnam a key growth market for our bank in ASEAN, we are delighted to have an individual of Quang's calibre and experience leading the next phase in the expansion of the local franchise.\"</p><p>An experienced CEO, Quang has led significant transformation and growth strategies for both international and local banks. To be based in Ho Chi Minh City, he has held local and regional leadership roles in Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, across multiple banking functions spanning trade finance and credit risk management.</p><p>Head of ASEAN in Corporate Bank Burkhard Ziegenhorn said, \"With a career of more than 20 years in corporate banking working with multinationals, large and medium corporates and SME clients, we look forward to Quang's leadership in deepening our franchise in Vietnam.\"</p><p>In the region, Deutsche Bank AG has a long track record in providing corporate finance and advisory solutions to Vietnamese corporates, leading a number of notable capital markets transactions. The bank's expertise in loans and structured finance is also well known. Since 2017, Deutsche Bank has raised more than US1 billion in debt, loan and equity capital annually for Vietnamese corporates.</p><p>Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank announced it is investing in Vietnam to support higher trade flows from Europe, which are expected to increase following the recently ratified EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>With more clients settling trade payments in local currency, Deutsche Bank recently added the restricted Vietnamese Dong to its award-winning FX4Cash platform, which offers more than 130 currency pairs globally.</p><p>August 13: Deutsche Bank AG Research Division: Insolvency moratorium: The worst is yet to come</p><p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on growth in the second quarter was dramatic, no doubt about it. But economic data, as well as the daily and weekly real-time indicators that are now being watched meticulously, show that most countries began to reemerge from the slump back in May. In Germany, production was down by \"just\" 11.5% year over year in June, after a drop of nearly 25% in April. This yoy gap is likely to continue to shrink as the summer goes on. However, the overall economy is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels within the next 12 months, even if the current rise in infections does not lead to a \"second wave\" and the increase in infections that is feared for the winter does not overwhelm our healthcare system. In a survey conducted by the ifo Institute, German companies expected to see restrictions in public life continue until April 2021 on average. We believe it could be mid-2021 before a vaccine that would make it possible to lift these kinds of restrictions after a certain period becomes widely available. With activity across many industries paused in April, the temporary suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency that was introduced retroactively with effect from 1 March was an important step in mitigating adverse impacts. The moratorium applies explicitly only to cases in which the company in question has become insolvent or overindebted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the fact that corporate insolvencies were down by a whopping 9.9% year over year in May despite the tough economic situation already in place before the coronavirus crisis broke out seems to suggest that some businesses may be interpreting the economic impact of the pandemic very broadly. This is probably one of the factors behind the increasing warnings of a wave of bankruptcies to come starting in October.</p><p>July 29: Deutsche Bank reports pre-tax profit of 158 million euros in second quarter of 2020 with transformation fully on track</p><p>2nd-quarter profit despite restructuring and rise in credit loss provisions</p><p>Group pre-tax profit of 158 million euros, versus pre-tax loss of 946 million euros in 2nd quarter of 2019 Net profit of 61 million euros, versus net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the prior year quarter which included transformation-related effects Provision for credit losses of 761 million euros, consistent with management expectations; re-affirming full year guidance of 35-45 basis points of loans</p><p>Core Bank earnings momentum in the quarter</p><p>Pre-tax profit of 753 million euros, versus loss in prior year quarter Net profit of 489 million euros, post-tax return on tangible equity of 3.4%</p><p>Revenue growth year on year</p><p>Group net revenues up 1% to 6.3 billion euros despite exit of Equities Core Bank net revenues up 6% to 6.4 billion euros, up 8% to 6.3 billion euros ex-specific items Investment Bank net revenues up 46%, up 52% ex-specific items</p><p>Sustained progress on costs</p><p>Noninterest expenses down 23% year-on-year to 5.4 billion euros Adjusted costs ex-transformation charges1 down 10% to 4.8 billion euros excluding reimbursement-eligible Prime Finance expenses</p><p>Significant progress on transformation</p><p>Completed legal entity merger of Private Bank in Germany Created International Private Bank by combining Wealth Management and Private &amp; Commercial Business International Completed Integration of Corporate Bank in Germany Set 200 billion euro target for sustainable financing and investment Announced agreement to form partnership with Google Cloud</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 24: Deutsche Bank to invest in financing platform Traxpay</p><p>Deutsche Bank AG has announced its investment in the Frankfurt-based fintech Traxpay GmbH, with both parties signing the agreements in Frankfurt this Friday. By investing in Traxpay, Deutsche Bank is using the fintech's platform technology to expand its supply chain finance offering. Traxpay offers its corporate clients dynamic discounting and reverse factoring solutions to enable them to manage their cash flows flexibly. Traxpay strives for a leading role in Europe and having Deutsche Bank join as an investor is one step towards achieving this goal. Other banks are being encouraged to join as investors and cooperating partners to further expand the platform. Traxpay will maintain its existing cooperations with other banks.</p><p>Market for supply chain finance is growing \"The current crisis acts like a catalyst to the market. Numerous companies are reviewing their strategic relations with their suppliers and are identifying substantial potential in terms of financing,\" says Daniel Schmand, Global Head Trade Finance and Lending at Deutsche Bank. \"Recent developments we've seen as a result of COVID-19 show how important liquidity is for our clients. With Traxpay we have an experienced partner with a good track record. We can work with them to offer our clients further solutions in this area,\" Schmand says, adding: \"Our answer to the question 'fintech or bank' is: 'fintech AND bank'\".</p><p>Multibanking approach also applies to investor circle For Traxpay, having Deutsche Bank on board as an investor is a strategic step: \"With Deutsche Bank, we have gained a strategic investor with a leading role in supply chain financing across the globe,\" says Traxpay founder and CEO Markus Rupprecht. Traxpay also wants other banks to become shareholders. Many companies are looking for a reliable platform.</p><p>July 09: Deutsche Bank leads three green bond issues in one week</p><p>Deutsche Bank has helped three clients come to market with green bonds this week, despite a forty percent decrease in green issuance this year. The deals, a 600 million euro bond for Assicurazioni Generali, a 500 million euro bond for NEPI Rockcastle and a 500 million dollar bond for Kimco Realty, represent a success for the bank's debt capital markets (DCM) business across both Europe and the Americas.</p><p>Green bond issuance has been negatively impacted by the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new issues amounting to just under 70 billion US dollars in the first six months of this year compared with 125 billion US dollars in the same period last year. During the pandemic, issuers have been less likely to want to segregate funding to green assets so they can retain a pool of liquidity in case required for the crisis. However, the market has seen a remarkable increase in social and sustainability bonds, particularly from sovereigns looking to raise proceeds to finance policies around the pandemic.</p><p>Trisha Taneja, Head of Sustainable Finance in Deutsche Bank's Investment Bank business, said: \"The Covid pandemic is a tangible example of how non-financial factors can cause systemic risk to the global financial system. Corporates are increasingly starting to incorporate sustainability and ESG factors into their long-term plans to manage profitability and risk. Deutsche Bank strategists estimate that by 2030 almost 100 percent of investors' assets under management will be under responsible investment strategy.\"</p><p>The 600 million euro 11-year bond from Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali is the second green bond issued by the company, with Deutsche Bank also having led the first issue last year. The transaction aims to achieve a more balanced maturity profile and reduce interest costs in future years.</p><p>July 08: Deutsche Bank collaborates with BNY Mellon to Revolutionize Custody FX for Restricted EM Currencies</p><p>BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank have jointly developed a new API-enabled foreign-exchange (FX) solution that can dramatically improve confirmation times for restricted emerging-market currency trades.</p><p>The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimizing the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.</p><p>The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors' underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.</p><p>Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.</p><p>Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included--or more heavily weighted--in emerging-market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>\"We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients. With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency,\" said Jason Vitale, Global Head of FX at BNY Mellon</p><p>\"This is a milestone in solving a long-standing challenge in emerging markets, with broad application for the industry and our clients.</p><p>July 07: Deutsche Bank and Google to form strategic global, multi-year partnership to drive a fundamental transformation of banking</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) and Google Cloud have agreed to join forces and form a strategic partnership that aims to redefine how the bank develops and offers its financial services. The partnership is unique in that it will not only deliver cutting edge cloud services to Deutsche Bank, but also enable co-innovation between the two companies to create the next generation of technology-based financial products for clients. Both parties have signed a Letter of Intent and plan to sign a multi-year contract within the next few months.</p><p>The partnership will enable Deutsche Bank to accelerate its cloud transition and build on the engineering capabilities of both companies. Together with Google Cloud, Deutsche Bank will transform its IT architecture and thus generate considerable value for its clients. The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank's current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank's information assets</p><p>With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to world-class data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients' accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.</p><p>\"For more than 150 years, Deutsche Bank has been an industry pioneer, with a strong record of innovation in the financial services sector,\" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.</p><p>July 01: Five of the UK's most exciting young creative entrepreneurs win the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs</p><p>On July 1, five winners of the Deutsche Bank Awards for Creative Entrepreneurs (DBACE) fought off stiff competition to win a share of Pound50,000 for their socially driven ventures and 12-months of expert business guidance.</p><p>Despite the ongoing pandemic and significant blow to the creative industries, with research from Oxford Economics suggesting 1 in 5 sector jobs could be lost, the programme continues to recognise young creative entrepreneurs and celebrate those on a mission to tackle some of society's significant issues.</p><p>The programme is part of Deutsche Bank's global CSR social enterprise programme, Made for Good, and has been delivered in partnership with not-for-profit creative industries incubator MeWe360.</p><p>Moved from its usual Mayfair location, the winners were revealed in a celebratory event via YouTube Live by presenter Reuben Christian.

By doing so, we pledge to align our credit and investment portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Banks play a crucial role in the fight against climate change. Because it is up to us to provide the funds for the transformation of the global economy through financing and investment products. We accept this challenge,\" said Christian Sewing explaining the decision.</p><p>This initiative, launched by several banks, aims to contribute to climate protection and to support the sustainable, future-oriented development of the economy. This brings the German financial sector closer to the goal set by the German Federal Government at the beginning of 2019 of making Germany one of the leading locations for sustainable finance.</p><p>In future, the companies involved will disclose which emissions are associated with their credit and investment portfolios. In addition, they undertake to align their respective products and services as well as their commitments and initiatives in such a way that global warming is limited to well below 2 degrees - and if possible to no more than 1.5 degrees.</p><p>To this end, each signatory will develop and introduce mutually accepted methods of measuring climate impact by the end of 2022 and then regulate them in accordance with national and international climate targets. The participants intend to support each other in collecting the necessary emissions data. In addition, they want to jointly develop measurement methods and appropriate approaches to manage banking business in line with the goals. All signatories will report on their progress annually.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 25: Deutsche Bank announces changes to the Italian franchise and to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank S.p.A.</p><p>Deutsche Bank (XETRA: DBKGn.DB / NYSE: DB) After a 20-year career with Deutsche Bank, including 12 years of consecutive service as Chief Country Officer Italy and Chief Executive Officer at Deutsche Bank S.p.A., Flavio Valeri has decided to leave Deutsche Bank to pursue new challenges.</p><p>\"Flavio Valeri has been instrumental in developing the bank's Italian business and positioning it for growth in the years ahead,\" said Werner Steinmueller, Chairman of the Deutsche Bank S.p.A.

Big Tech luminaries such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have expressed support for the scheme. The idea is that some ultra-lean government body cuts everyone a check periodically. No one is left to live in poverty, because once you establish a reasonable poverty line, the UBI ensures no one lives below it. For the poorest among us, life won't be easy. </p><p>But everyone under a UBI can meet his or her basic needs. No matter one's income, each citizen will get, say, $1,200 a month. A UBI combines economic efficiency favored by the right with redistributive aspects favored by the left. In fact, bipartisanship is a big reason the idea has gotten legs:Those on the right should love a UBI because it would be designed to eliminate layers of welfare-state bureaucracy. A cluster of alphabet soup agencies would simply go away. Those on the left should love a UBI because it would ensure that no one living under its auspices would have to live below the poverty line. Those on the right should love a UBI because it allows people the freedom to spend the resources as they choose, rather than having it be directed by government. Those on the left should love a UBI because, despite the fact that it apparently benefits the wealthiest, way more people on the lower end of the income distribution would benefit. Those left, right, center and beyond think it has the potential to save humanity from the effects of mass displacement due to AI and automation.There is much to recommend the UBI. In some respects, it would be preferable to the status quo. Those enamored of the public ledger (blockchain) think a UBI is even more promising because such a technology has the potential to protect the system's integrity. But we have some deep concerns about a UBI \u2014 or at least the sort of UBI that is currently being floated among the cognitive elite. With the following, I offer some reasons to be wary.1. Human HouseCatsAs every economist will tell you, incentives matter. The basic idea is that if you subsidize some activity you'll get more of it, and if you tax some activity you'll get less of it. For the vast majority, a UBI will create legions of human house cats. So when you pay people to be relatively poorer, they are more likely to remain relatively poorer. Some UBI proponents are convinced that incentive effects will go away. People who are less stressed about meeting their basic needs will actually bemoreproductive, proponents argue, because they will have the financial freedom to experiment with different career options. And one might find anecdotal cases where that could be true. But for the vast majority, a UBI will create legions of human house cats. Living on a UBI might not be all that uncomfortable if you can afford a room, ramen noodles, and an Xbox to while away the hours. One need only look at the perverse effects of the U.S. welfare state which, in 1996, lead President Bill Clinton to sign awelfare reform bill[1]that was designed to unwind intergenerational cycles of poverty begun largely under President Lyndon Johnson'sGreat Society[2]. Many people are comfortable with the idea that there will be a massive superstratum of people who simply exist without knowing the dignity of work. A few imagine not work, but more \"generative behavior\" such as art, or that people will be gathered like ancient Greeks in the agora, dreaming up grand theories together. From the standpoint of productive, socially-beneficial output, such a condition is likely to generate considerable deadweight loss. Update: One reader requested more evidence for Point 1. We can start with evidence assembled by Michael P. Gibsonin this piece[3], as well as the effect ofunemployment insurance on unemployment duration[4]. (More on the moral hazard of unemployment insurancehere[5].)2. Levers of CentralizationAnother quite troubling feature of UBIs currently under consideration is that it would be administered by a large, powerful central government. Pass a UBI and suddenly you're conferring a massive lever of power to that very government. A UBI could very well evolve into a mechanism of central control. Let's suppose that there is a UBI of $10,000 per year, per person. That's an enormous new system of incentives, a Skinner Box of epic proportions. Let's also imagine the bill that creates the UBI leaves open the possibility for certain conditions being placed on citizens to receive their UBI check each month. According to statute, such conditions can be determined by the administering agency. You know, one of the Trump Administration's agencies! Maybe you think Donald Trump is wonderful. If so, then imagine the politician you hate most controlling the levers of incentive for every single American taxpayer. Is that something that sits comfortably with you? An awesome degree of power now lies in that hated politician's hands. Just think what they can get away with given the threat to withhold those funds. (Consider,for example,laws that require people to take drug tests to collect welfare checks[6]; or any number of paternalist schemes.) A UBI could very well evolve into a mechanism of central control that works in the service of ends that run counter to your values. But a UBI shouldn't have conditions placed on it, nor be used as a lever of control,say proponents, laboring under theUnicorn Fallacy[7].3. RomanticPoliticsRomantics about a UBI assure us that any such system will be immunized from politics. Like Social Security funds, it will be a special fund locked away from politicians and their influence. (Comedic pause.) It will work like an algorithm, redistributing funds like clockwork, without conditions, to everyone \u2014 that is, of course, if it can get passed. Politics is as much about the art of compromise as the science of corruption. I would ask the reader carefully to consider what sausage, first ground along the corridors of K Street, haseverbeen ideal. What angels staff the halls of Capitol Hill? In other words, why should we expect that whatever UBI has the political feasibility to pass would be pure in the way UBI proponents hope? It is not a stretch to say that no bill has ever gone through Congress and come out of the process elegant, simple, and ideal. A UBI is supposed to establish a poverty floor so that people simply get inured to poverty starting at a certain level. The belief is that in this ideal form, it won't create as many perverse incentives. Whether or not that hypothesis is true (it is most certainly not), the threat of suspending someone's UBI is a tremendous stick and carrot, thanks to the human propensity forloss aversion[8]. Politicians know this. And you better believe they'll use it to their advantage. Politics is as much about the art of compromise as the science of corruption. If there is no perceived political advantage to enacting a UBI, it will be a dead letter. Therefore, the only way to get a UBI of this type will be to accept just the sorts of compromise that will make it an instrument of power that is not always going to benefit the people (even if you think free money is beneficial on net).4. Affordability IssuesFew people take the time actually to sit down and ask whether or not a UBI is even affordable. A couple of people have done that work for us, though. Robert Greenstein of the progressive Center for Budget and Policy Priorities lays it out starkly:There are over 300 million Americans today. Suppose UBI provided everyone with $10,000 a year. That would cost more than $3 trillion a year \u2014 and $30 trillion to $40 trillion over ten years. This single-year figure amounts to more than three-fourths of the entire yearly federal budget \u2014 and double the entire budget outside Social Security, Medicare, defense, and interest payments. It's also equal to close to 100 percent of all tax revenue the federal government collects.Even if you cut the above UBI in half, it would still 'cost as much as the entire federal budget outside Social Security, Medicare, defense, and interest payments.' UBI proponents often respond by suggesting that a UBI simply be taxable, which makes it less than universal. Still, that sliding-scale approach means that the great bulk of Americans, having little to no tax liability, would fail to offset the cost. Put another way, the savings would only reduce the cost of a UBI 'to something like $2.5 trillion or $2.75 trillion (or $25 trillion to $27.5 trillion over ten years),' according to Greenstein. Much of the above concern overlaps with our concerns in 3,above, because it's romantic to think that any major program would go on the chopping block. Under what circumstances will the Pentagon give up its goodies or will people be willing to give up Social Security or Medicare? If we are not prepared to add to the looming tsunami of debt that awaits Americans due to the Big Three entitlements, then we have to figure out where to cut. And spending cuts are the political equivalent of flying pigs.5. Community's GlueMost think it's obvious that community is based on culture. Fewer are willing to admit that real, lasting community is based on need. The invisible filaments that bind us together as communities almost always originate in the desire for mutual aid. When mutual aid self-organizes, communities can become particularly robust.But: When aid is centralized and doled out from distant capitals, it can destroy the invisible filaments that bind people together. 'There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,' wrote the late urbanist Jane Jacobs, 'and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.' When aid is centralized and doled out from distant capitals, it can destroy the invisible filaments that bind people together. Like the centralized welfare state of the Twentieth Century, current conceptions of a UBI likewise threaten the structures of mutual aid and real community that arise among people with common interests and common needs.6. Universal HeterogeneityUnder the current conception of a UBI, everybody everywhere gets the same amount. But $10,000 in Manhattan is not the same as $10,000 in Mississippi. In other words, the economy, including the cost of basic living expenses, will create differential treatment for people due to considerations one might consider arbitrary under most ideas of equal justice. - Average rent inJackson, MS[9]= $854 - Average rent inSan Francisco, CA[10]= $4,351 - Average rent inChattanooga, TN[11]= $960 - Average rent inNew York, NY[12]= $3382 Notice that in Jackson and Chattanooga, a $10,000 UBI would cover someone's rent almost entirely, but in San Francisco or New York, it would not. This is usually why labor costs are higher in more expensive cities.Another related problem is that heavy regulation in certain industries versus light regulation in others creates inflation in certain sectors relative to others. Look at the trend lines in the graph, above. These relatively unregulated areas of the economy mean better, faster, cheaper things we might think of as non-essential, such as smartphones, apps, TVs,and toys. But if we were to add a UBI to those differences, we'd be likely to see a de facto incentive for people to spend more in those areas where they can get a better deal (which zips us back to Problem 1 above). This list is certainly not exhaustive, but it should give us pause in the face what seems to be a daily diet of UBI boosters' fare.Distributed Income Support CooperativesIt's not enough to criticize without offering an alternative. But in the interests of brevity, I want to offer the sketch of a larger idea to which we'll later return: Distributed Income Support Cooperates (DISCs). This clumsy name and acronym are designed to limn a system that could avoid some of the pitfalls of a UBI outlined above. DISCs would be preferable to UBIs because they are will satisfy the following criteria:Forms as an association, which can be joined and exited voluntarily; Is divorced from any territorial, legal jurisdiction, making any given system international; Competes with other DISCs to determine the best mix of properties, all within a wider competitive DISC fitness landscape; Is affordable; Is insulated from central authorities by choice, competition, and censorship resistance; Can be associated with communities 'on the ground;' Can include variable income support for variable contribution and cost of living; Can be built on distributed ledger technologies to ensure system integrity; Can be built in tandem with value-generating commercial systems, DAOs; Can include varying degrees of cross-subsidy or redistribution, as members will tolerate and the fiscal health of the systems dictate; Can be construed as a system of social insurance, or a system of universal income support for members; Aligns the incentives of all members; Provides aid where it's needed; Suspends aid where it's doing no good; Encourages productive behaviors and mutual support among members; Emphasizes mutual aid rather than mass dependency.These criteria are not meant to be exhaustive. They are rather a sketch designed to show we are thinking about the future of mutual aid in the era of decentralization.

Or les investisseurs ont besoin de ces monopoles: ils veulent que Google ou Facebook rach\u00e8tent les bo\u00eetes dans lesquelles ils ont investi, pour que \u00e7a leur rapporte de l'argent\", ajoute cet entrepreneur passionn\u00e9 de politique. </p><p>Warren et Sanders veulent imposer lourdement les riches, surtout les milliardaires comme les PDG Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) ou Jeff Bezos (Amazon), et assurer une couverture maladie \u00e0 tous les Am\u00e9ricains. </p><p>Mais Bernie Sanders, dont les partisans vantent \"l'authenticit\u00e9\", devance largement tous ses rivaux dans les sondages en Californie. </p><p>- R\u00e9volution - </p><p>\"Nous sommes dans l'une des r\u00e9gions les plus riches du pays, mais le co\u00fbt de la vie est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9, m\u00eame pour les +techies+\", estime Melinda Jackson, professeure de sciences politiques \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de San Jos\u00e9. \"Les id\u00e9es de r\u00e9volution ou de g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 sociale les attirent. Et l'attitude de Bernie est en phase avec la culture de la l'industrie: prendre des risques, voir grand, ne pas rentrer dans les cases...\" </p><p>Pour les mod\u00e9r\u00e9s, en revanche, le septuag\u00e9naire va trop loin. </p><p>\"Mes amis et moi, on voudrait juste un retour \u00e0 la normale plut\u00f4t que d'aller d'un extr\u00eame \u00e0 l'autre. Bernie, c'est l'autre extr\u00eame\" de Donald Trump, se d\u00e9sole Manu Koenig, un employ\u00e9 de start-up qui se pr\u00e9sente aux \u00e9lections locales. </p><p>Il soutient Pete Buttigieg, pass\u00e9 par les universit\u00e9s d'\u00e9lite, qui cultive une image d'homme traditionnel et pratiquant. Cet ancien maire ouvertement homosexuel met en avant sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 rallier les centristes. </p><p>Un argument qui vaut aussi pour Joe Biden, mais l'ancien vice-pr\u00e9sident, vainqueur en Caroline du Sud samedi, ne suscite pas l'enthousiasme au pays des hippies. </p><p>\"Biden c'est la normalit\u00e9 absolue, certes, mais il est trop vieux. Avec ma fianc\u00e9e on est hyper mal \u00e0 l'aise d\u00e8s qu'il ouvre la bouche. Il parle trop lentement. On veut la normalit\u00e9 2.0, voire 3.0\", argumente Manu Koenig. </p><p>Les noms du patron de Netflix, Reed Hastings, et de personnalit\u00e9s li\u00e9es notamment \u00e0 Google et Facebook circulent dans la presse am\u00e9ricaine parmi les soutiens de Buttigieg. </p><p>- Tout sauf Trump ? - </p><p>Quel que soit le candidat d\u00e9mocrate investi apr\u00e8s les primaires, toute la Silicon Valley devrait se rassembler derri\u00e8re lui. Toute? Non. </p><p>Larry Ellison, membre du conseil d'administration de Tesla, et co-fondateur du groupe informatique Oracle, a suscit\u00e9 la pol\u00e9mique en organisant mi-f\u00e9vrier, dans sa demeure californienne, une collecte de fonds en faveur du pr\u00e9sident Donald Trump, d'apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9tition d'employ\u00e9s d'Oracle en col\u00e8re contre leur patron. </p><p>La baie de San Francisco reste tr\u00e8s progressiste, favorable \u00e0 l'immigration, \u00e0 la protection de l'environnement. Mais la relation avec les d\u00e9mocrates s'est compliqu\u00e9e. </p><p>Depuis la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation des campagnes de d\u00e9sinformation men\u00e9es via les r\u00e9seaux sociaux - notamment lors du scrutin de 2016 - les d\u00e9mocrates critiquent sans rel\u00e2che les plateformes toutes puissantes. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren, notamment, a beaucoup \u00e9nerv\u00e9 Mark Zuckerberg en insistant sur son intention de \"casser la big tech\". </p><p>Mais la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9gulation du secteur a fait son chemin m\u00eame dans les esprits lib\u00e9raux des \"techies\", selon Melinda Jackson: \"Ils se disent qu'ils pourront n\u00e9gocier de meilleurs accords avec les d\u00e9mocrates\". </p><p>Et \"Donald Trump est trop impr\u00e9visible. Comme tous les milieux d'affaires, la tech aime la stabilit\u00e9\", ajoute-t-elle. \"Si le candidat r\u00e9publicain \u00e9tait Jeb Bush ou Marco Rubio, peut-\u00eatre qu'il r\u00e9colterait un peu plus de soutien\". </p><p>\"Tout sauf Trump\" reste donc l'argument le plus f\u00e9d\u00e9rateur, qu'on ait de l'argent ou pas. </p><p>En 2016, \"on s'est fait avoir. On a remport\u00e9 le vote populaire et pourtant on n'a pas gagn\u00e9\", remarque Lucas Garcia. L'\u00e9tudiant en informatique de 21 ans, dont la famille est d'origine mexicaine, s'inqui\u00e8te avant tout des enjeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \"Ai-je vraiment envie de voter pour Biden ou Sanders? Non. Mais c'est mieux que quelqu'un qui nous d\u00e9teste\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHLGFR-httpswwwchallengesfreconomieauroyaumecapitalistedelasiliconvalleylagaucheestreine701111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHLGFR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB3-FWP1-F085-800H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435725</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Editions Croque Futur tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Challenges.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41492\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>dimanche 1 mars 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Or les investisseurs ont besoin de ces monopoles: ils veulent que Google ou Facebook rach\u00e8tent les bo\u00eetes dans lesquelles ils ont investi, pour que \u00e7a leur rapporte de l'argent\", ajoute cet entrepreneur passionn\u00e9 de politique.</p><p>Warren et Sanders veulent imposer lourdement les riches, surtout les milliardaires comme les PDG Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) ou Jeff Bezos (Amazon), et assurer une couverture maladie \u00e0 tous les Am\u00e9ricains.</p><p>Mais Bernie Sanders, dont les partisans vantent \"l'authenticit\u00e9\", devance largement tous ses rivaux dans les sondages en Californie.</p><p>- R\u00e9volution -</p><p>\"Nous sommes dans l'une des r\u00e9gions les plus riches du pays, mais le co\u00fbt de la vie est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9, m\u00eame pour les +techies+\", estime Melinda Jackson, professeure de sciences politiques \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de San Jos\u00e9. \"Les id\u00e9es de r\u00e9volution ou de g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9 sociale les attirent.

Cet ancien maire ouvertement homosexuel met en avant sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 rallier les centristes.</p><p>Un argument qui vaut aussi pour Joe Biden, mais l'ancien vice-pr\u00e9sident, vainqueur en Caroline du Sud samedi, ne suscite pas l'enthousiasme au pays des hippies.</p><p>\"Biden c'est la normalit\u00e9 absolue, certes, mais il est trop vieux.

Comme tous les milieux d'affaires, la tech aime la stabilit\u00e9\", ajoute-t-elle. \"Si le candidat r\u00e9publicain \u00e9tait Jeb Bush ou Marco Rubio, peut-\u00eatre qu'il r\u00e9colterait un peu plus de soutien\".</p><p>\"Tout sauf Trump\" reste donc l'argument le plus f\u00e9d\u00e9rateur, qu'on ait de l'argent ou pas.</p><p>En 2016, \"on s'est fait avoir. On a remport\u00e9 le vote populaire et pourtant on n'a pas gagn\u00e9\", remarque Lucas Garcia. L'\u00e9tudiant en informatique de 21 ans, dont la famille est d'origine mexicaine, s'inqui\u00e8te avant tout des enjeux de soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \"Ai-je vraiment envie de voter pour Biden ou Sanders? Non.

Au South by Southwest (SXSW), qui chaque ann\u00e9e r\u00e9unit \u00e0 Austin, au Texas, des dizaines de milliers d'experts des nouvelles technologies, le changement d'atmosph\u00e8re est palpable. Il y a encore quelques ann\u00e9es, on y venait pour s'enthousiasmer des potentialit\u00e9s infinies de la technologie et pour voir \u00e9clore les applications innovantes de demain.

Mais beaucoup de cadres de la Silicon Valley refusent encore de penser que leurs technologies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es par un Etat \u00e9tranger\u00bb, a accus\u00e9 Molly McKew, ancienne experte aupr\u00e8s de l'ancien pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9orgien Mikhe\u00efl Saakachvili et experte en questions de propagande. M\u00eame diagnostic du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Clint Watts, chercheur pour le Foreign Policy Research Institute et ancien agent du FBI. \u00abJe ne comprends pas les gens de la Silicon Valley qui voient ce qu'il se passe depuis deux ans et qui se disent que cela va passer, qu'il faut attendre\u00bb, a-t-il accus\u00e9.</p><p> Les r\u00e9seaux sociaux pris au pi\u00e8ge des \u00abfake news\u00bb </p><p>La question de la diss\u00e9mination sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, comme Facebook, Twitter ou YouTube de fausses informations de natures diverses a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises.</p><p>La pr\u00e9sidente-directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, a justement profit\u00e9 du SXSW pour annoncer une mesure pour lutter contre un certain type de fausses informations, le conspirationnisme. Dans les prochains moins, aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de certaines vid\u00e9os promouvant des th\u00e9ories du complot appara\u00eetront des extraits de pages Wikip\u00e9dia correspondantes.</p><p>\u00abLes plates-formes ont beau essayer de lutter, cela va \u00eatre compliqu\u00e9, notamment pour Twitter et Facebook dont le business repose sur le fait que les gens partagent des contenus\u00bb, explique, un brin r\u00e9sign\u00e9, David Mikkelson, un des v\u00e9t\u00e9rans de la v\u00e9rification des faits sur Internet. Snopes, son site Internet de \u00abfact-checking\u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en\u20261994.</p><p>Invit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9agir sur le sujet lors d'une autre table ronde, Andy O'Connell, un des responsables des politiques publiques de Facebook, a estim\u00e9 que ce n'\u00e9tait pas un probl\u00e8me, que le r\u00e9seau social pouvait \u00abr\u00e9soudre seul\u00bb, tout en reconnaissant la \u00abresponsabilit\u00e9\u00bb de son entreprise de \u00abfaire partie de la solution, et non du probl\u00e8me\u00bb. Il a rappel\u00e9 les initiatives lanc\u00e9es par le r\u00e9seau social pour combattre ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de fausses informations, notamment la lutte contre \u00ables incitations \u00e9conomiques\u00bb. Facebook, assure M.O'Connell, tente de diminuer la port\u00e9e des contenus mensongers publi\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins mercantiles - pour attirer des visiteurs et donc vendre de la publicit\u00e9 -, notamment en d\u00e9tectant gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'intelligence artificielle les contenus uniquement destin\u00e9s \u00e0 ces fins.</p><p> Vers plus de responsabilit\u00e9? </p><p>Plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, il est de plus en plus courant, dans le milieu des nouvelles technologies, de voir se poser la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 des grandes plates-formes; une notion tr\u00e8s \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 ce milieu jusqu'\u00e0 une date r\u00e9cente.</p><p>\u00abNous cherchons \u00e0 int\u00e9grer [\u2026] une forme de responsabilit\u00e9 dans notre syst\u00e8me de recommandation\u00bb de vid\u00e9os, a par exemple expliqu\u00e9 Susan Wojcicki, la puissante PDG de YouTube. Pour la lanceuse d'alerte Chelsea Manning, il est temps que les d\u00e9veloppeurs se dotent d'un code \u00e9thique. \u00abNous autres d\u00e9veloppeurs, surtout ceux qui travaillent sur des syst\u00e8mes qui affectent un grand nombre de gens, devons \u00eatre conscients des cons\u00e9quences de ce que l'on construit\u00bb, a-t-elle lanc\u00e9 lors du festival.</p><p>\u00abQuand nous avons construit Twitter, nous ne pensions pas \u00e0 tout \u00e7a\u00bb, a expliqu\u00e9 lors d'une conf\u00e9rence Evan Williams, un des cofondateurs du r\u00e9seau social, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17114180/sxsw-social-media-ev-williams-steve-huffman-mark-warner-eddie-cue\">cit\u00e9 par le site sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 The Verge</url>:</p><p> \u00abNous avons mis en place l'architecture de base sans prendre en compte les comportements nocifs. Et maintenant nous y sommes confront\u00e9s.\u00bb </p><p>La pression vient aussi de l'ext\u00e9rieur. Ainsi, le maire de Londres, Sadiq Khan, au sujet du racisme en ligne, a estim\u00e9 qu'\u00abaucune entreprise ni industrie ne devrait jamais se consid\u00e9rer au-dessus des lois locales\u00bb:</p><p> \u00abAvec les comp\u00e9tences et les moyens que ces entreprises ont \u00e0 leur disposition, je pense qu'il est possible d'aller plus loin et plus vite.\u00bb </p><p>Pour r\u00e9soudre ces probl\u00e8mes, beaucoup veulent encore croire \u00e0 la collaboration entregouvernement et grandes entreprises d'Internet. Aux Etats-Unis du moins. \u00abNous allons avoir besoin de leur coop\u00e9ration parce que si on laisse \u00e7a \u00e0 Washington, on va probablement semer la pagaille\u00bb, a par exemple affirm\u00e9 Mark Warner. Car en filigrane de ces critiques croissantes, se trouve la possibilit\u00e9 - presque un gros mot dans ce secteur - de davantage de r\u00e9gulation de ces entreprises technologiques. Comme, avant elle, les \u00abBig Tobacco\u00bb et les \u00abBig Oil\u00bb.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LMONDF-5272143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LMONDF2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWG-39J1-F0K7-80N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">322025</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Le Monde Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48604\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>Vendredi 16 Mars 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAUSSE INFORMATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001340</classCode><className>PUBLICIT\u00c9 POLITIQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>R\u00c9SEAUTAGE SOCIAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000204</classCode><className>CERVEAU</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009TDQ</classCode><className>PARTIS POLITIQUES DES \u00c9TATS-UNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAGNE \u00c9LECTORALE ET \u00c9LECTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE ET ETHNICIT\u00c9</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISME &amp; X\u00c9NOPHOBIE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001340</classCode><className>PUBLICIT\u00c9 POLITIQUE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GX590</classCode><className>AUSTIN, TX, \u00c9TATS-UNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GS124</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, DC, \u00c9TATS-UNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GS159</classCode><className>TEXAS, \u00c9TATS-UNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>AM\u00c9RIQUE DU NORD</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>ASIE DU NORD</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data \u2013 where they've been, what they view, who their friends are \u2013 and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p> During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p> Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p> The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p> An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p> Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p> What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p> The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p> A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p> Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p> The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p> \"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p> The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p> The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sen.

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p>However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Matt O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p>However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Matt O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p>However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Matt O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p>However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic <person><nameText>Sen. Brian Schatz </nameText></person>of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it's strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement . The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said this summer that the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. \"We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Matt O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That's in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states are also considering more aggressive protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control over the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -and the powerful companies who mine that information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law could simply be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications all told senators that they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling over privacy back in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice-president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety over safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said both Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control over how broadband companies like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumers' data: how it's collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they've collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice-president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach.

The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act[2] would prevent social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, or Snapchat from using features that automatically generate an endless stream of content. The bill would also require social media companies to add an automatic time limit of 30 minutes per day for all users (though users could change it), and inform users of how much time they have spent on the platform every 30 minutes. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] US Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) has introduced a new bill intended intended to regulate the way that users interact with social media, the latest in a series of proposed legislation aimed at major tech companies.[4] The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act would fundamentally change the way that social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Snapchat engage with users, and call greater attention to how much time users are spending on each platform. </p><p>\"The business model for many internet companies, especially social media companies, is to capture as much of their users' attention as possible,\" reads the bill, in part.[5] \"To achieve this end, some of the internet companies design their platforms and services to exploit brain physiology and human psychology. By exploiting psychological and physiological vulnerabilities, these design choices interfere with the free choice of users.\" If enacted into law, the bill would require social media companies to limit the amount of automatically generated content shown to users, and prevent videos from automatically playing without user approval. Facebook and Twitter can surface a nearly endless stream of content to users as they scroll through their timeline or pursue trending topics. These platforms also allow videos to start playing automatically as soon as a user scrolls by.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1156196153463123969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Senator Hawley: \"Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction. Too much of the 'innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away.\"YouTube has also been criticized for its use of autoplay. After a user watches a video, the platform will continually surface other videos related to the user's original choice. However, reports have indicated that autoplay can also lead users to increasingly controversial or radical videos, as the algorithm selects new video to watch. Earlier this year The Verge reported[6] that watching certain videos featuring children would lead users to multiple videos featuring moments of children involving nudity or other compromising activities that could be deemed as sexual.

The bill calls for an automatic time limit of 30 minutes per day, though users would be able to adjust the amount of time for themselves. However, social media platforms would also be required to show a notification telling the user how much time they've spent on the platform that day, displayed at least once every half hour. The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act would also prevent social media companies from rewarding users for prolonged engagement with their platforms. For example, Snapchat promotes user Snapstreaks, which track how many days in a row a user has sent pictures to the same person. YouTube awards users with badges for being a paid subscriber to certain channels for six months or more, with badges becoming more rare as their time as a paid subscriber increases. Enforcement of the bill would fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The FTC would be required to provide a report on internet addiction and how social media affects psychology every three years. If approved, the bill would allow the commission to fine social media companies for non-compliance as well. Sen. Hawley has been vocal in his criticism of social media[8] and major technology companies since taking office at the start of the year. The Republican senator has repeatedly accused social media and video games of using addiction to fuel engagement.[9]The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act does not share any co-sponsors and hasn't reached the committee stage yet.NOW WATCH: I cleaned my entire apartment with 4 of Amazon's highest-rated cleaning robots, but I could've done a much better job myself[10]See Also: How to

Such is the magnitude of the job, Bradbury - as the head of the OECD's digital economy taskforce secretariat - was named in December by by the International Tax Review as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/australias-david-bradbury-no1-in-global-tax-20181209-h18wjl\">equal-most influential person in global tax</url>.</p><p>In an interview with The Australian Financial Review, Bradbury says from Paris that the potential global tax reforms could \"redefine who has taxing rights in a way that is even more profound\" than originally envisaged by world leaders when they set up the project. For the past six years the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project has had a big focus on how to collect more tax from digital firms such as America's so-called FAANG companies: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google.</p><p>In the data-rich modern economy, tech giants have sometimes tried to avoid having a physical presence (in tax jargon known as a permanent establishment) in jurisdictions in order to pay minimal tax in lucrative developed markets like Europe and Australia.</p><p>How to tax the provision of online advertising by Facebook and Google, Amazon's cloud services and advertising, and subscription and freemium streaming services by Netflix and Spotify is a vexed issue for tax authorities around the world. With American tech and other intellectual property-intensive darlings in the firing line, the Obama and Trump administrations have bitten back.</p><p>The US is concerned anti-American forces in Europe are attempting a revenue heist and regulatory attacks on Silicon Valley giants at the expense of Uncle Sam. There has been a stalemate on forging international consensus on taxing the digital economy after the US last year effectively vetoed proposals.</p><p>Surprise twist</p><p>Yet in a surprise twist, the global tax debate was recently turned on its head. Trump's top Treasury international tax official, former PwC and Baker McKenzie tax adviser Chip Harter, offered an olive branch to other countries. The US may be prepared to do a deal on global tax.</p><p>The Trump administration argues the vulnerabilities in the global tax base are not limited to highly digital firms but are more widespread for intangible assets owned by the likes of McDonald's, Starbucks and Nike. The American quid pro quo is that the original BEPS project be expanded beyond the digital economy to the rules on taxing IP and intangible assets more broadly.</p><p>Under the US proposal, a larger share of the profits would be taxed where a product is consumed - potentially delivering valuable revenue to big consumer markets like the US which has a population of 330 million people. The proposal grapples with a much more fundamental allocation of taxing rights between countries than BEPS originally envisaged.</p><p>\"It's potentially bigger than the BEPS project because it would redefine who has taxing rights,\" Bradbury says.</p><p>The 127 members of BEPS in January agreed to examine proposals involving two pillars that might form the basis of a long-term consensus. The first pillar focuses on the allocation of taxing rights between countries and the second pillar addresses other BEPS issues.</p><p>\"Under the first pillar, which focuses on the allocation of taxing rights among countries, several proposals have been made that would allocate more taxing rights to market-user jurisdictions in the case of highly digitalised firms,\" Bradbury says. \"These proposals would require a reconsideration of existing transfer pricing rules and contemplate solutions that go beyond the arm's length principle - which has been the key principle underpinning the transfer pricing rules.</p><p>\"The second pillar will consider granting new taxing rights that would strengthen the ability of jurisdictions to tax profits where other jurisdictions with taxing rights apply a low effective tax rate to those profits.\"</p><p>Opinions diverge widely between the big economies on how to proceed. The US wants to allocate some of the residual profit from intangibles to the consumer market, such as the US. The United Kingdom is keen to expand the taxing rights on big tech firms but wants to restrain the advancement into other industries that might hit its own multinationals.</p><p>The UK is also less interested in taxing where the \"consumer\" is, and is keener on taxing where the \"user\" is. For example, a \"user\" of a digital platform may upload photos, make social media posts or sign up friends to a service, without paying any money. Though they are technically not a \"consumer\", arguably these users add value to the digital company, even if no money changes hands.</p><p>To complicate matters, the Germans and French believe if the system is going to move beyond taxing digital firms, then a global minimum corporate tax should be imposed - a change the US corporate tax reforms in 2016 effectively imposed on US-headquartered multinationals.</p><p>Uphill task</p><p>Bradbury is in the thick of all this. To be sure, the OECD working on behalf of the Group of 20 world leaders faces an uphill task to finalise a compromise by a deadline of 2020.</p><p>With impatient <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/politics/australia-should-drop-unilateral-plans-amid-progress-on-google-and-facebook-tax-20190221-h1bk3l\">governments in Australia and the UK rolling out a range of unilateral tax laws</url> to hit multinational tax avoidance, tax experts are worried a failure to achieve a breakthrough could lead to an international tax war. Some others argue unilateral action by Australia may encourage countries to work out a global solution.</p><p>Bradbury, who as a Labor assistant treasurer did some of the early work on Australia's multinational tax-avoidance laws, is diplomatic. \"Australia has been closely engaged in this work and this will be increasingly important as we move into the next phase of deliberations,\" he says.</p><p>Many private-sector tax advisers believe the OECD's task is nigh on impossible, given the intractable political fight over how to carve up the global tax pie.</p><p>\"It is hard to see how the OECD will be able to achieve a consensus by 2020 and if they don't I think we will see more unilateral measures becoming permanent,\" says Clayton Utz tax partner Niv Tadmore. \"That would create ambiguity and incoherence in the international tax system.\"</p><p>Bradbury won't concede he has the impossible in front of him. In fact, the father of four teenage students recently signed a three-year contract extension at the OECD in Paris, which would take him to eight years in total in the job. He is deeply ensconced in Parisian life, musing that his bilingual children are much more fluent in French than he.</p><p>Politics still part of the job</p><p>It's a long way for the former western Sydney MP from the time he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/besieged-mp-ready-to-defend-the-nepean-20100707-100pz.html\">climbed aboard a patrol boat in Darwin</url> with then-prime minister Julia Gillard to showcase his border security credentials before the 2010 election. Despite recent rumours of a potential return to local politics, Bradbury shows little interest in resuming a Canberra political life. However, he admits politics is still part of the job at the OECD.</p><p>\"We are trying to achieve consensus with 127 jurisdictions at the table, all contributing on an equal footing,\" he says. \"Our work is not like a parliament where you need 50 per cent plus one. You need to understand the various interests and perspectives of countries in order to understand where they are coming from.</p><p>\"That requires an even greater understanding of the positions of the countries and national interests. It's a technical exercise but also a political one.\"</p><p>In comparison to a breakdown in multilateralism on trade and immigration, Bradbury at least thinks tax has the potential underpinnings for a deal.</p><p>\"At a time when there seems to be almost complete intractability on so many global issues, this seems to be one area where countries are constructively engaging with a strong desire to make progress,\" he says.</p><p>\"In my experience there is a pretty strong degree of political will among countries to try to address these issues. Where that leads us in the next couple of years remains to be seen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1030154198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHT-X1S1-JBJ7-N13P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1439\"/><timeReceived>10:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
